# ### Scale-free networks and attacks on networks
#            
# 1. Generate a free scale network with 10000 nodes and add 10 nodes in each step (use the barabasi_albert_graph (n, m) routine ).
# 2. Calculate the values of L, C and the grade distribution of the nodes. 
# 3. Generate a random network that has the same number of nodes and branches as the network that you have created, calculate your values.
# 
#         a) L 
#         b) C 
#         c) The degree distribution of the nodes
#         d) Compare the values obtained

# ### Comparing the results from the Scale-free and Random networks
# 
# ##### Clustering Ceofficient:
# 
#        1) Scale free network (C) = 0.01
#        2) Random network (C) = 0.0
# 
# The clustering ceofficient is slightly higher for the scale free graph compared to the Random network. In relation to the scale free network, the clustering coefficient also scales with network size following approximately a power law:
# 
#                 C ~ N^-0.75
# ##### Average path length:
# 
#        1) Scale free network (L) = 3.07
#        2) Random network (L) = 1.0
# 
# The average path length is larger for the Scale free netwrok compared to the Random netwrok. This is due to the random network being disconnected
# ##### Degree Distribution:
# 
# For the random netwrok, the distribution is very narrow, with the largest degree being 3. Comparing this to the scal free netwrok, the distribution is larger wider with the max degree being over 400.

# As the random_attack is removing nodes at random and the Gram_attack is an intelligent attack, we would expect for the Gram_attack to perform better on the graphs however, this is topology dependent. The computational cost of each attack is also different. As the random attack is fairly simplistic, the cost is O(n) compared to the more complex intelligent attack. For the intelligent attack, we must also calculate the degree of every node. This increases the cost to O(n^2).
# 
# The results are summarized below:
# 
# 
# ##### 1) Random Network:  
# 
#     a) Random_attack - The network performed well against this attack. From the graph above, the clustering coefficient changes at a consistant rate. This is demonstrated by the solid red line in the graph above
#     
#     b) Gran_attack - Again, the change in clustering ceofficient reduces at a consistant rate. 
#     
# ##### 2) Scale Free Network:
# 
#     a) Random_attack - The network performed well against this attack.  
#     
#     b) Gran_attack - Less resistant to the intelligent attack. From the graph above, you can see the the dotted blue line has a lower clustering coefficient for all the percentages compared to the random attack. 
# 
# 
# ##### 3) Small World Network:
# 
#     a) Random_attack - The network performed well against this attack.  
#     
#     b) Gran_attack - Again, the small world performed well against this attack 
# 
# ##### Best attack method against each graph:
# Random Network:<br>
# Gram_attack - As shown above, this performed better than the random_attack <br>
# Scale Free Network:<br>
# Gram_attack - As shown above, this network is less resistant to this type of attack<br>
# Small World Network:<br>
# Random Attack - Both attacks performed similar but the Random_attack costs less than the intelligent attack
