27896272	Long Noncoding RNA-LET Suppresses Tumor Growth and EMT in Lung Adenocarcinoma.	Recently, many studies showed that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are involved in tumor progression. It is reported that lncRNA-LET is downregulated and has antitumor effect on several types of cancer. This study focuses on the role of lncRNA-LET on lung adenocarcinoma (LAC) progression. RT-PCR results indicated that frequent downregulation of lncRNA-LET in LAC tissues was related to clinicopathologic factors. lncRNA-LET knockdown significantly promoted LAC cell proliferation, invasion, and migration while lncRNA-LET overexpression obviously inhibited LAC cell proliferation, invasion, and migration, indicating a tumor inhibition of lncRNA-LET in LAC progression. Besides, lncRNA-LET inhibited EMT and negatively regulated Wnt/beta-catenin pathway in part. Our study suggests that lncRNA-LET exhibits an important tumor-suppressive effect on LAC progression by inhibiting EMT and Wnt/beta-catenin pathway, which provides potential therapeutic targets for LAC.
27069301	Keeping eyes peeled: guppies exposed to chemical alarm cue are more responsive to ambiguous visual cues.	ABSTRACT: Information received from the visual and chemical senses is qualitatively different. For prey species in aquatic environments, visual cues are spatially and temporally reliable but risky as the prey and predator must often be in close proximity. Chemical cues, by contrast, can be distorted by currents or linger and thus provide less reliable spatial and temporal information, but can be detected from a safe distance. Chemical cues are therefore often the first detected and may provide a context in which prey respond to subsequent ambiguous cues ("context hypothesis"). Depending on this context, early chemical cues may also alert prey to attend to imminent cues in other sensory modalities ("alerting hypothesis"). In the context of predation risk, for example, it is intuitive that individuals become more responsive to subsequent ambiguous cues across sensory modalities. Consistent with the context hypothesis, guppies, Poecilia reticulata, exposed to conspecific alarm cue reduced activity, a classic fright response among fish, in response to a water disturbance more than those exposed to cues of unharmed conspecifics or a water control. Despite this reduction in activity, guppies exposed to alarm cue were more attentive to visual cues than those exposed to the other chemical cues, as predicted by the alerting hypothesis. These responses contrasted with those of guppies exposed to chemical cues of undisturbed, unharmed conspecifics, which were relatively unaffected by the disturbance. This is the first study indicating that unambiguous cues detected by one sensory modality affect animal responses to subsequent ambiguous multimodal cues. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: In moving water, chemical cues can be detected over longer distances than visual cues; they may therefore be detected first and alert animals to imminent visual cues. This effect is likely to be particularly important if these chemical cues are indicative of predation. I investigated how different chemical cues affect (1) guppy response to an ambiguous water disturbance and (2) their responsiveness to subsequent ambiguous visual cues. Guppies based their responses to ambiguous cues on the context implied by chemical cues: those exposed to chemical cues indicative of predation reduced activity, a classic fright response, but increased responsiveness to visual cues, relative to those exposed to control chemical cues. This is the first study to show that unambiguous cues detected by one sense affect animal responses to ambiguous cues detected by other senses.
27110121	Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting: exploring patients' subjective experience.	BACKGROUND: This study aimed to explore the subjective experience of nausea and vomiting during chemotherapy treatment among breast cancer patients and the impacts on their daily lives. METHODS: A qualitative descriptive study was conducted in breast cancer patients who received chemotherapy and had experienced nausea and/or vomiting. Semi-structured interviews were conducted and analyzed using content analysis based on Giorgi's method. RESULTS: Of 15 patients who participated, 13 were included in the final analysis (median age =46 years, interquartile range [IQR] =6.0; all were Malays). Vomiting was readily expressed as the "act of throwing up", but nausea was a symptom that was difficult to describe. Further exploration found great individual variation in patterns, intensity, and impact of these chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) symptoms. While not all patients expressed CINV as bothersome, most patients described the symptom as quite distressing. CINV was reported to affect many aspects of patients' lives particularly eating, physical, emotional, and social functioning, but the degree of impacts was unique to each patient. One of the important themes that emerged was the increase in worship practices and "faith in God" among Malay Muslim patients when dealing with these adverse effects. CONCLUSION: CINV continues to be a problem that adversely affects the daily lives of patients, hence requiring better understandings from the health care professionals on patients' needs and concerns when experiencing this symptom.
27229723	Difluorinated Curcumin: A Promising Curcumin Analogue with Improved Anti-Tumor Activity and Pharmacokinetic Profile.	BACKGROUND: Curcumin, a polyphenol from turmeric, is a dietary phytochemical with a diversity of health benefits including strong anti-tumor effects. Curcumin undergoes a rapid metabolism resulting in a low oral bioavailability. 3, 4-difluorobenzylidene curcumin or (CDF) is a novel fluorinated curcumin analogue which has been shown to be about 3 times more bioavailable than curcumin. This review aimed to summarize the findings of studies related to pharmacokinetic and pharmacological characteristics of CDF. METHODS: A systematic literature search was prformed in Scopus and Medline to identify all published articles dealing with CDF. RESULTS: Biodistribution assays have revealed that curcumin is mostly distributed to the heart and lung tissues while CDF is preferentially accumulated in pancreas where its tissue concentrations reach two folds higher than that of curcumin. Moreover, CDF has been reported to possess stronger cytotoxic effects compared with CMN in both monolayer and spheroid cultures of different tumor cell lines including chemo-resistant ones. CDF can promote tumor suppression through multiple mechanisms including inhibition of self-renewal capacity of cancer stem/stem-like cells, clonogenicity invasiveness and angiogenesis of tumor cells, while increasing the sensitivity of cells to chemotherapy. These effects are the results of the modulatory action of CDF on diverse targets, such as miRNAs (miR-21, miR-101, miR-210, miR34a and miR34c), PTEN, CD44, EGFR, EpCAM, EZH2, HIF-1alpha, and VEGF. CONCLUSION: This review presents an overview of the findings on metabolism and pharmacological activities of CDF, and also highlights potential opportunities to use this novel curcumin analogue in the treatment of cancer.
27110273	The Dynamics of Avian Influenza: Individual-Based Model with Intervention Strategies in Traditional Trade Networks in Phitsanulok Province, Thailand.	Avian influenza virus subtype H5N1 is endemic to Southeast Asia. In Thailand, avian influenza viruses continue to cause large poultry stock losses. The spread of the disease has a serious impact on poultry production especially among rural households with backyard chickens. The movements and activities of chicken traders result in the spread of the disease through traditional trade networks. In this study, we investigate the dynamics of avian influenza in the traditional trade network in Phitsanulok Province, Thailand. We also propose an individual-based model with intervention strategies to control the spread of the disease. We found that the dynamics of the disease mainly depend on the transmission probability and the virus inactivation period. This study also illustrates the appropriate virus disinfection period and the target for intervention strategies on traditional trade network. The results suggest that good hygiene and cleanliness among household traders and trader of trader areas and ensuring that any equipment used is clean can lead to a decrease in transmission and final epidemic size. These results may be useful to epidemiologists, researchers, and relevant authorities in understanding the spread of avian influenza through traditional trade networks.
26931452	Methylprednisolone blocks interleukin 1 beta induced calcitonin gene related peptide release in trigeminal ganglia cells.	BACKGROUND: Methylprednisolone (MPD) is a rapid acting highly effective cluster headache preventive and also suppresses the recurrence of migraine attacks. Previously, we could demonstrate that elevated CGRP plasma levels in a cluster headache bout are normalized after a course of high dose corticosteroids. Here we assess whether MPD suppresses interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta)- and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2)-induced CGRP release in a cell culture model of trigeminal ganglia cells, which could account for the preventive effect in migraine and cluster headache. Metoprolol(MTP), a migraine preventive with a slow onset of action, was used for comparison. METHODS: Primary cultures of rat trigeminal ganglia were stimulated for 24 h with 10 ng/ml IL-1beta or for 4 h with 10 muM PGE2 following the exposure to 10 or 100 muM MPD or 100 nM or 10 microM MTP for 45 min or 24 h. CGRP was determined by using a commercial enzyme immunoassay. RESULTS: MPD but not MTP blocked IL-1beta-induced CGRP release from cultured trigeminal cells. PGE2-stimulated CGRP release from trigeminal ganglia cell culture was not affected by pre-stimulation whether with MPD or MTP. CONCLUSION: MPD but not MTP suppresses cytokine (IL-1beta)-induced CGRP release from trigeminal ganglia cells. We propose that blockade of cytokine mediated trigeminal activation may represent a potential mechanism of action that mediates the preventive effect of MTP on cluster headache and recurrent migraine attacks.
27382772	[Role of NO signal in ABA-induced phenolic acids accumulation in Salvia miltiorrhiza hairy roots].	To investigate roles of nitric oxide (NO) signal in accumulations of phenolic acids in abscisic.acid (ABA)-induced Salvia miltiorrhiza hairy roots, S. miltiorrhiza hairy roots were treated with different concentrations of sodium nitroprusside (SNP)-an exogenous NO donor, for 6 days, and contents of phenolic acids in the hairy roots are determined. Then with treatment of ABA and NO scavenger (2-(4-carboxy-2-phenyl)-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline-1- oxyl-3-oxide, c-PTIO) or NO synthase inhibitor (NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester, L-NAME), contents of phenolic acids and expression levels of three key genes involved in phenolic acids biosynthesis were detected. Phenolic acids production in S. miltiorrhiza hairy roots was most significantly improved by 100 micromoL/L SNP. Contents of RA and salvianolic acid B increased by 3 and 4 folds. ABA significantly improved transcript levels of PAL (phenylalanine ammonia lyase), TAT (tyrosine aminotransferase) and RAS (rosmarinic acid synthase), and increased phenolic acids accumulations. However, with treatments of ABA+c-PTIO or ABA+L-NAME, accumulations of phenolic acids and expression levels of the three key genes were significantly inhibited. Both NO and ABA can increase accumulations of phenolic acids in S. miltiorrhiza hairy roots. NO signal probably mediates the ABA-induced phenolic acids production.
27054714	Stigma against Tuberculosis Patients in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.	BACKGROUND: Stigma attached to tuberculosis contributes to the limited effectiveness of current TB control approaches. However, there is a dearth of studies that explore the causes of stigma attached to tuberculosis and its effects on patients and tuberculosis control programs in Ethiopia. METHODS: An institution-based qualitative study was conducted at St. Peter Tuberculosis Specialized Hospital in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia from July to August, 2015. Ten in-depth interviews and 6 key-informant interviews were carried out among tuberculosis patients and healthcare workers, respectively.The Open Code computer software package was used to analyze the data thematically. RESULTS: The study revealed that fear of infection and inappropriate health education messages by media were the main causes of tuberculosis stigma. The patients experienced isolation within their family and community, separation, and financial crisis. The stigma attached to tuberculosis may contribute to delayed healthcare seeking, poor treatment adherence, and poor prognosis. CONCLUSION: Interventions that reduce the stigma attached to tuberculosis should target on areas, such as creating community awareness, patient counseling on problem-solving and emotional skills, preparing culturally sensitive and scientifically sound media messages, providing financial support for the patients, and enhancing the qualities of the healthcare workers, such as empathy, concern, respect for the patient and cultural sensitivity.
28116177	An Unusually Large Irritation Fibroma Associated with Gingiva of Lower Left Posterior Teeth Region.	Fibroma is a benign tumor of oral cavity, with usually the tongue, gingiva, and buccal mucosa being the most common sites. Females are twice more likely to develop fibroma than males. The intraoral fibroma typically is well demarcated; and its size can vary from millimeter to few centimeters. Intraorally the growth is attached to the mucosa by means of a peduncle. Fibroma is generally slow growing, painless, smooth surface lesion and the color is slightly paler than the adjacent healthy tissue. Treatment usually requires total excision and recurrence is rare. Here we present a case of 37-year-old female patient reported to the Department of Oral Medicine and Radiology with the chief complaint of a growth in the lower left posterior teeth region 3 months earlier.
26854377	Phthalimido-thiazoles as building blocks and their effects on the growth and morphology of Trypanosoma cruzi.	Chagas disease is a parasitic infection caused by protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi that affects approximately 6-7 million people worldwide. Benznidazole is the only drug approved for treatment during the acute and asymptomatic chronic phases; however, its efficacy during the symptomatic chronic phase is controversial. The present work reports the synthesis and anti-T. cruzi activities of a novel series of phthalimido-thiazoles. Some of these compounds showed potent inhibition of the trypomastigote form of the parasite at low cytotoxicity concentrations in spleen cells, and the resulting structure-activity relationships are discussed. We also showed that phthalimido-thiazoles induced ultrastructural alterations on morphology, flagellum shortening, chromatin condensation, mitochondria swelling, reservosomes alterations and endoplasmic reticulum dilation. Together, these data revealed, for the first time, a novel series of phthalimido-thiazoles-structure-based compounds with potential effects against T. cruzi and lead-like characteristics against Chagas disease.
26966357	Prevalence and pattern of torus palatinus and torus mandibularis among edentulous patients of Saudi Arabia.	BACKGROUND: The most remarkable exostoses of the human jaws are torus palatinus (TP) and torus mandibularis (TM). The aim of the present study was to actuate the prevalence of TP and TM in relation to age and sex among the edentulous patients of Saudi Arabia. METHODS: The present study included 847 edentulous subjects (458 men and 389 women) aged between 51 and 79 years. The subjects were examined for the existence of tori by clinical inspection and palpation. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS for Windows version. RESULTS: Among the 847 subjects, 149 (17.59%) had either TP or TM. Sixty six (7.79%) subjects had TP, whereas 83 (9.80%) had TM. The maximum percentage (36.36%) of tori was observed in the age-group of 60-69 years. The percentage of males with either tori was higher (19.0%) when compared to females (15.94%). According to shape, the occurrence of flat-shaped TP (57.58%) and bilateral solitary TM (39.76%) was more common. CONCLUSION: No significant difference in the presence of tori with respect to sex and age was observed. A comparatively increased prevalence of TP and TM was however observed, and this should be taken into consideration while planning for prosthodontic and periodontal therapy in these patients.
26914088	[Cerebrovascular disease in childhood. Case series].	Stroke in childhood is considered rare. It may be ischemic or hemorrhagic. Its presentation is often acute and it is a leading cause of mortality in pediatrics. The aim of our work is to present the general features of stroke of 18 patients under 15 years of age admitted to the Hospital El Cruce, between July 2009 and June 2014, and their clinical outcome a year later. We observed a predominance of male patients and the median age of 5 years. The main clinical features were hemiparesis, seizures, headache and vomiting and sensory impairment. The most frequent type was ischemic and the middle cerebral artery territory was the most commonly involved. Twelve patients had no sequelae. The signs and symptoms were guiding stroke, neuroimaging studies were essential for diagnosis and patients evolved favorably with low number of recurrence and death.
27051394	Diagnostic Accuracy and Impact on Management of Ultrasonography-Guided Fine-Needle Aspiration to Detect Axillary Metastasis in Breast Cancer Patients: A Prospective Study.	BACKGROUND: The axillary nodal status is essential to determine the stage of disease at diagnosis. Our aim was to prospectively assess the diagnostic accuracy of ultrasonography-guided fine-needle aspiration (US-FNA) for the detection of metastasis in axillary lymph nodes in patients with breast cancer (BC) and its impact on the therapeutic decision. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ultrasonography (US) was performed in 407 axillae of 396 patients who subsequently underwent surgery. US-FNA was conducted when lymph nodes were detected by US. Axillary dissection (AD) was performed when US-FNA was positive for metastasis. Patients with negative US-FNA and breast tumors of 30 mm in size were candidates for selective sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB). The anatomopathological results of AD or SLNB were used as reference tests. RESULTS: Lymph nodes were detected by US in 207 (50.8%) axillae. Of these, US-FNA was performed on 180 (86.9%). 94 axillae (52.2%) were positive for carcinoma and 79 women received AD. US-FNA had 77.5% sensitivity, 100% specificity, 100% positive predictive value, 69.3% negative predictive value, and 85.1% diagnostic accuracy. US-FNA avoided SLNB in 18.1% of patients who underwent AD. CONCLUSIONS: Axillary US-FNA is an accurate technique in the staging of patients with BC. It allows reducing the number of SLNB and, when positive, offers a fast and useful tool.
27031710	Beneficial Effect of Moderate Exercise in Kidney of Rat after Chronic Consumption of Cola Drinks.	AIM: The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of moderate intensity exercise on kidney in an animal model of high consumption of cola soft drinks. METHODS: Forty-eight Wistar Kyoto rats (age: 16 weeks; weight: 350-400 g) were assigned to the following groups: WR (water runners) drank water and submitted to aerobic exercise; CR (cola runners) drank cola and submitted to aerobic exercise; WS (water sedentary) and CS (cola sedentary), not exercised groups. The aerobic exercise was performed for 5 days per week throughout the study (24 weeks) and the exercise intensity was gradually increased during the first 8 weeks until it reached 20 meters / minute for 30 minutes. Body weight, lipid profile, glycemia, plasma creatinine levels, atherogenic index of plasma (AIP) and systolic blood pressure (SBP) were determined. After 6 months all rats were sacrificed. A kidney histopathological score was obtained using a semiquantitative scale. Glomerular size and glomerulosclerosis were estimated by point-counting. The oxidative stress and pro-inflammatory status were explored by immunohistochemistry. A one way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Tukey-Kramer post-hoc test or the Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunn's post-hoc test was used for statistics. A value of p < 0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: At 6 months, an increased consumption of cola soft drink was shown in CS and CR compared with water consumers (p<0.0001). Chronic cola consumption was associated with increased plasma triglycerides, AIP, heart rate, histopathological score, glomerulosclerosis, oxidative stress and pro-inflammatory status. On the other hand, moderate exercise prevented these findings. No difference was observed in the body weight, SBP, glycemia, cholesterol and plasma creatinine levels across experimental groups. CONCLUSIONS: This study warns about the consequences of chronic consumption of cola drinks on lipid metabolism, especially regarding renal health. Additionally, these findings emphasize the protective role of exercise training on renal damage.
27478501	Cell-free synthesis of functional phospholipase A1 from Serratia sp.	BACKGROUND: Phospholipase A1 is an enzyme that hydrolyzes phospholipids at the sn-1 position. It has potential applications across diverse fields including food, pharmaceutical, and biofuel industries. Although there has been increasing interest in the use of phospholipase A1 for degumming of plant oils during biodiesel production, production of recombinant phospholipase A1 has been hampered by low efficiency of gene expression and its toxicity to the host cell. RESULTS: While expression of phospholipase A1 in Escherichia coli resulted in extremely low productivity associated with inhibition of transformed cell growth, drastically higher production of functional phospholipase A1 was achieved in a cell-free protein synthesis system where enzyme expression is decoupled from cell physiology. Compared with expression in E. coli, cell-free synthesis resulted in an over 1000-fold higher titer of functional phospholipase A1. Cell-free produced phospholipase A1 was also used for successfully degumming crude plant oil. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate successful production of Serratia sp. phospholipase A1 in a cell-free protein synthesis system. Including the phospholipase A1 investigated in this study, many industrial enzymes can interfere with the regular physiology of cells, making cellular production of them problematic. With the experimental results presented herewith, we believe that cell-free protein synthesis will provide a viable option for rapid production of important industrial biocatalysts.
27957382	Study of the Antioxidant Property Variation of Cornelian Cherry Fruits during Storage Using HPTLC and Spectrophotometric Assays.	Cornus species fruits are well known as a rich source of antioxidant compounds responsible for their diverse health benefits. The present study aims to investigate the variation of the total antioxidant capacity of Cornelian cherry (Cornus mas L.) fruits during storage, using high-performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC) and two spectrophotometric assays based on different mechanisms: the 2,2-azinobis(3-ethylbenzothiazolyne-6-sulphonic acid) radical cation (ABTS+) assay and the ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assay. The fruit extract was stored at room temperature (22 degrees C) for 19 days. No major differences in the total antioxidant capacity were observed during this period, indicating that storage does not have any deleterious effect on the antioxidant properties of the investigated fruits extract. The antioxidant capacity varied between 12.91 and 12.83 micromol Trolox/g fruit as determined by the HPTLC method and from 36.13 to 33.93 micromol Trolox/g fruit as determined by the ABTS assay.
27128408	PDGFRbeta Is a Novel Marker of Stromal Activation in Oral Squamous Cell Carcinomas.	Carcinoma associated fibroblasts (CAFs) form the main constituents of tumor stroma and play an important role in tumor growth and invasion. The presence of CAFs is a strong predictor of poor prognosis of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Despite significant progress in determining the role of CAFs in tumor progression, the mechanisms contributing to their activation remain poorly characterized, in part due to fibroblast heterogeneity and the scarcity of reliable fibroblast surface markers. To search for such markers in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), we applied a novel approach that uses RNA-sequencing data derived from the cancer genome atlas (TCGA). Specifically, our strategy allowed for an unbiased identification of genes whose expression was closely associated with a set of bona fide stroma-specific transcripts, namely the interstitial collagens COL1A1, COL1A2, and COL3A1. Among the top hits were genes involved in cellular matrix remodeling and tumor invasion and migration, including platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta (PDGFRbeta), which was found to be the highest-ranking receptor protein genome-wide. Similar analyses performed on ten additional TCGA cancer datasets revealed that other tumor types shared CAF markers with OSCC, including PDGFRbeta, which was found to significantly correlate with the reference collagen expression in ten of the 11 cancer types tested. Subsequent immunostaining of OSCC specimens demonstrated that PDGFRbeta was abundantly expressed in stromal fibroblasts of all tested cases (12/12), while it was absent in tumor cells, with greater specificity than other known markers such as alpha smooth muscle actin or podoplanin (3/11). Overall, this study identified PDGFRbeta as a novel marker of stromal activation in OSCC, and further characterized a list of promising candidate CAF markers that may be relevant to other carcinomas. Our novel approach provides for a fast and accurate method to identify CAF markers without the need for large-scale immunostaining experiments.
26870360	Expression of metabotropic glutamate receptor 4 in osteosarcoma.	Metabotropic glutamate receptor 4 (mGluR4) has been associated with the pathogenesis of osteosarcoma. The aim of this study was to investigate mGluR4 expression and its clinical significance in osteosarcoma patients. mGluR4 expression was investigated using immunohistochemistry (IHC) in 58 osteosarcomas and 32 giant-cell tumors of bone. The correlations between mGluR4 expression and clinicopathological characteristics were analyzed with the Chi-squared test and survival curves were generated using the Kaplan-Meier method. The IHC results demonstrated that 20.69% (12/58) of the osteosarcomas and 43.75% (14/32) of the giant-cell tumors were mGluR4-positive. The statistical analysis revealed that mGluR4 expression was correlated with gender, age, Enneking stage and tumor volume in osteosarcomas (P<0.05). In the multivariate stepwise Cox regression analysis, Enneking stage was found to be statistically signi fi cantly associated with survival (P<0.05) and the survival analysis demonstrated that the survival probability was significantly higher in patients with higher mGluR4 expression compared with those with lower expression (P<0.05). Therefore, mGluR4 expression may be used to estimate the prognosis of osteosarcoma patients.
27386744	What can errors tell us about body representations?	In this review, we examine how tactile misperceptions provide evidence regarding body representations. First, we propose that tactile detection and localization are serial processes, in contrast to parallel processing hypotheses based on patients with numbsense. Second, we discuss how information in primary somatosensory maps projects to body size and shape representations to localize touch on the skin surface, and how responses after use-dependent plasticity reflect changes in this mapping. Third, we review situations in which our body representations are inconsistent with our actual body shape, specifically discussing phantom limb phenomena and anesthetization. We discuss problems with the traditional remapping hypothesis in amputees, factors that modulate perceived body size and shape, and how changes in perceived body form influence tactile localization. Finally, we review studies in which brain-damaged individuals perceive touch on the opposite side of the body, and demonstrate how interhemispheric mechanisms can give rise to these anomalous percepts.
27577391	A Strategy for Reusing the Data of Electronic Medical Record Systems for Clinical Research.	There is a great need to reuse data stored in electronic medical records (EMR) databases for clinical research. We previously reported the development of a system in which progress notes and case report forms (CRFs) were simultaneously recorded using a template in the EMR in order to exclude redundant data entry. To make the data collection process more efficient, we are developing a system in which the data originally stored in the EMR database can be populated within a frame in a template. We developed interface plugin modules that retrieve data from the databases of other EMR applications. A universal keyword written in a template master is converted to a local code using a data conversion table, then the objective data is retrieved from the corresponding database. The template element data, which are entered by a template, are stored in the template element database. To retrieve the data entered by other templates, the objective data is designated by the template element code with the template code, or by the concept code if it is written for the element. When the application systems in the EMR generate documents, they also generate a PDF file and a corresponding document profile XML, which includes important data, and send them to the document archive server and the data sharing saver, respectively. In the data sharing server, the data are represented by an item with an item code with a document class code and its value. By linking a concept code to an item identifier, an objective data can be retrieved by designating a concept code. We employed a flexible strategy in which a unique identifier for a hospital is initially attached to all of the data that the hospital generates. The identifier is secondarily linked with concept codes. The data that are not linked with a concept code can also be retrieved using the unique identifier of the hospital. This strategy makes it possible to reuse any of a hospital's data.
27143575	A Cross-Sectional Examination of the Association Between Dyspnea and Distress as Experienced by Palliative Home Care Clients and Their Informal Caregivers.	This study examined the association between dyspnea and distress as experienced by both palliative home care clients and their informal caregivers as a unit of care. Cross-sectional analysis was conducted using the interRAI Palliative Care Assessment database. Responses from 6,655 individual palliative home care clients across six regional jurisdictions in Ontario, Canada were included. This study found that clients experiencing dyspnea were more likely to show overall signs of distress; report one or more signs of self-reported distress; and be at risk for depression when compared to clients who do not experience dyspnea. Caregivers of clients experiencing dyspnea were more likely to exhibit distress than caregivers of clients not reporting dyspnea. When indicators of caregiver distress and client distress were combined, 53% of the caregiver-client units exhibited distress. Social work practitioners should include a focus on distress within the care unit as a priority when care planning to meet the needs of persons nearing the end of life. Members of the care team should consider available treatment and management options tailored to meet both the client and their informal caregiver's needs.
27856544	Group Random Call Can Positively Affect Student In-Class Clicker Discussions.	Understanding how instructional techniques and classroom norms influence in-class student interactions has the potential to positively impact student learning. Many previous studies have shown that students benefit from discussing their ideas with one another in class. In this study of introductory biology students, we explored how using an in-class accountability system might affect the nature of clicker-question discussions. Clicker-question discussions in which student groups were asked to report their ideas voluntarily (volunteer call) were compared with discussions in which student groups were randomly selected to report their ideas (random call). We hypothesized that the higher-accountability condition (random call) would impress upon students the importance of their discussions and thus positively influence how they interacted. Our results suggest that a higher proportion of discussions in the random call condition contained exchanges of reasoning, some forms of questioning, and both on- and off-topic comments compared with discussion in the volunteer call condition. Although group random call does not impact student performance on clicker questions, the positive impact of this instructional approach on exchanges of reasoning and other features suggests it may encourage some types of student interactions that support learning.
27446967	Tumor-Derived CXCL1 Promotes Lung Cancer Growth via Recruitment of Tumor-Associated Neutrophils.	Neutrophils have a traditional role in inflammatory process and act as the first line of defense against infections. Although their contribution to tumorigenesis and progression is still controversial, accumulating evidence recently has demonstrated that tumor-associated neutrophils (TANs) play a key role in multiple aspects of cancer biology. Here, we detected that chemokine CXCL1 was dramatically elevated in serum from 3LL tumor-bearing mice. In vitro, 3LL cells constitutively expressed and secreted higher level of CXCL1. Furthermore, knocking down CXCL1 expression in 3LL cells significantly hindered tumor growth by inhibiting recruitment of neutrophils from peripheral blood into tumor tissues. Additionally, tumor-infiltrated neutrophils expressed higher levels of MPO and Fas/FasL, which may be involved in TAN-mediated inhibition of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells. These results demonstrate that tumor-derived CXCL1 contributes to TANs infiltration in lung cancer which promotes tumor growth.
27766998	CHANGING HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT PARADIGMS?	OBJECTIVES: Health technology assessment (HTA) has to innovate to best support changing health system environments and to help provide access to valuable innovation under fiscal constraint. METHODS: Issues associated with changing HTA paradigms were identified through scoping and explored through deliberation at a meeting of industry and HTA leaders. RESULTS: Five broad areas of change (engagement, scientific dialogue, research prioritization, adaptive approaches, and real world data) were identified. The meeting focused on two themes derived from these: re-thinking scientific dialogue and multi-stakeholder engagement, and re-thinking value, affordability, and access. Earlier and ongoing engagement to steer the innovation process and help achieve appropriate use across the technology lifecycle was perceived as important but would be resource intensive and would require priority setting. Patients need to be involved throughout, and particularly at the early stages. Further discussion is needed on the type of body best suited to convening the dialogue required. There was agreement that HTA must continue to assess value, but views differed on the role that HTA should play in assessing affordability and on appropriate responses to challenges around affordability. Enhanced horizon scanning could play an important role in preparing for significant future investments. CONCLUSIONS: Early and ongoing multi-stakeholder engagement and revisiting approaches to valuing innovation are required. Questions remain as to the most appropriate role for HTA bodies. Changing HTA paradigms extend HTA's traditional remit of being responsive to decision-makers demands to being more proactive and considering whole system value.
27362752	Novel Methods for Surface EMG Analysis and Exploration Based on Multi-Modal Gaussian Mixture Models.	This paper introduces a new method for data analysis of animal muscle activation during locomotion. It is based on fitting Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) to surface EMG data (sEMG). This approach enables researchers/users to isolate parts of the overall muscle activation within locomotion EMG data. Furthermore, it provides new opportunities for analysis and exploration of sEMG data by using the resulting Gaussian modes as atomic building blocks for a hierarchical clustering. In our experiments, composite peak models representing the general activation pattern per sensor location (one sensor on the long back muscle, three sensors on the gluteus muscle on each body side) were identified per individual for all 14 horses during walk and trot in the present study. Hereby we show the applicability of the method to identify composite peak models, which describe activation of different muscles throughout cycles of locomotion.
27594808	Judges' views on evidence of genetic contributions to mental disorders in court.	This preliminary analysis assesses how judges view the use of behavioral genetics evidence on genetic influences to mental disorders in court. Twenty-one semi-structured interviews, analyzed using constant comparative analysis, were conducted with California trial court judges. Most judges reported the beneficial effects of this evidence being presented in court, particularly as a mitigating factor for sentencing. Yet some judges viewed it as an aggravating factor and expressed concerns about genetic privacy. Judges described initial reactions to being potentially presented with evidence on genetic influences to mental disorders as apprehension, curiosity, and sympathy. Judges also reported putting significant trust in experts on these issues. Findings suggest some judges are skeptical of this evidence, but largely open to its presentation. Sympathetic reactions may result in mitigating attitudes of some judges. As judges significantly trust experts, some judges could also be overly trusting of genetic evidence and expert opinion on these issues.
27296259	[Risk factors for pulmonary hypertension at the predialysis stage of chronic kidney disease].	AIM: To investigate the incidence and risk factors of pulmonary hypertension (PH) in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). SUBJECTS AND METHODS: 86 patients (53% men, 47% women; mean age, 45+/-13 years) with nondiabetic CKD were examined. According to the magnitude of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) decrease, all the patients were divided into 3 groups: 1) 33 patients with a GFR of 89--45 ml/min; 2) 33 with a GFR of 44--15 ml/min; 3) 20 with a GFR of <15 ml/min who were treated with hemodialysis. A control group consisted of 20 individuals with preserved kidney function (a GFR of >90 ml/min). Physical examination and transthoracic echocardiography were performed in all the patients. The serum concentrations of N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNT) and cystatin C were determined. RESULTS: PH was detected in 21 (24.4%) of the 86 patients with CKD. As CKD progressed, its prevalence in Groups 1, 2, and 3 increased, amounting to 18.2, 24.2, and 35%, respectively. The most predictably significant risk factors for PH were hypertension (rho=0.35; small er, Cyrillic=0.001) and kidney dysfunction (creatinine (rho=0.23; small er, Cyrillic=0.02). Elevated pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP) correlated with right ventricular (RV) dimension index (rho=0.45; small er, Cyrillic<0.0001), right atrial volume index (rho=0.3; small er, Cyrillic=0.02), left atrial volume index (rho=0.3; small er, Cyrillic=0.009), and left ventricular mass index (rho=0.35; small er, Cyrillic=0.03). In all the patients with CKD in the presence of PH, the NT-proBNP level was significantly higher than in its absence: 37.43 (5.83; 59.84) and 8.54 (5.1; 20.43) fmol/ml, respectively (small er, Cyrillic=0.01). Positive correlations were found between the level of cystatin C and the presence of PH (rho=0.32; small er, Cyrillic=0.003). Analysis of the ROC curve (AUC=0.718; small er, Cyrillic=0.03) in the predialysis-stage CKD groups (n=66) revealed that the cystatin C level of > 1045 ng/ml with a sensitivity of 71% and a specificity of 60% suggested that PH was present. Multivariate analysis showed that the factors correlating with the presence of PH were NT-proBNP (beta=0.34; small er, Cyrillic=0.008) and RV dimension index (beta=0.3; small er, Cyrillic=0.002). CONCLUSION: EchoCG reveals PH in almost 25% of the patients with CKD, which occurs at its predialysis stage. Elevated PASP is associated with myocardial structural changes. Traditional risk factors (hypertension) and diminished kidney function affect the development of PH.
27814369	Non-Communicable Disease Risk Factors among Employees and Their Families of a Saudi University: An Epidemiological Study.	OBJECTIVES: To assess the prevalence of noncommunicable disease (NCD) risk factors among Saudi university employees and their families; to estimate the cardiovascular risk (CVR) amongst the study population in the following 10years. METHODS: The NCD risk factors prevalence was estimated using a cross-sectional approach for a sample of employees and their families aged >/= 18 years old, in a Saudi university (Riyadh in Kingdom of Saudi Arabia; KSA). WHO STEPwise standardized tools were used to estimate NCD risk factors and the Framingham Coronary Heart Risk Score calculator was used to calculate the CVR. RESULTS: Five thousand and two hundred subjects were invited, of whom 4,500 participated in the study, providing a response rate of 87%. The mean age of participants was 39.3+/-13.4 years. The majority of participants reported low fruit/vegetables consumption (88%), and physically inactive (77%). More than two thirds of the cohort was found to be either overweight or obese (72%), where 36% were obese, and 59% had abdominal obesity. Of the total cohort, 22-37% were found to suffer from dyslipidaemia, 22% either diabetes or hypertension, with rather low reported current tobacco use (12%). One quarter of participants was estimated to have >10% risk to develop cardiovascular disease within the following 10-years. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of NCD risk factors was found to be substantially high among the university employees and their families in this study.
26836079	Tunable dual-wavelength ytterbium-doped fiber laser using a strain technique on microfiber Mach-Zehnder interferometer.	In this paper, stable dual-wavelength generation using a strain technique for a ytterbium-doped fiber laser is successfully demonstrated. A microfiber-based Mach-Zehnder interferometer is inserted into the laser ring cavity and stretched using the xyz translation stage. Four sets of dual-wavelength output lasing are obtained when the strain is applied onto a microfiber. The dual-wavelength output possesses spacing between 7.12 and 11.59 nm, with displacement from 2 to 190 mum from the central wavelength. The obtained side-mode suppression ratio is approximately 48 dBm, while the maximum power fluctuation and wavelength shift are less than 0.6 dB and 0.01 nm, respectively. The results demonstrate that this setup generates a stable dual-wavelength laser in the 1 mum region.
27895463	Lentivirus-mediated knockdown of NLK inhibits small-cell lung cancer growth and metastasis.	Nemo-like kinase (NLK), an evolutionarily conserved serine/threonine kinase, has been recognized as a critical regulator of various cancers. In this study, we investigated the role of NLK in human small-cell lung cancer (SCLC), which is the most aggressive form of lung cancer. NLK expression was evaluated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction in 20 paired fresh SCLC tissue samples and found to be noticeably elevated in tumor tissues. Lentivirus-mediated RNAi efficiently suppressed NLK expression in NCI-H446 cells, resulting in a significant reduction in cell viability and proliferation in vitro. Moreover, knockdown of NLK led to cell cycle arrest at the S-phase via suppression of Cyclin A, CDK2, and CDC25A, which could contribute to cell growth inhibition. Furthermore, knockdown of NLK decreased the migration of NCI-H446 cells and downregulated matrix metalloproteinase 9. Treatment with NLK short hairpin RNA significantly reduced SCLC tumor growth in vivo. In conclusion, this study suggests that NLK plays an important role in the growth and metastasis of SCLC and may serve as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of SCLC.
27127789	27.12 MHz Radiofrequency Ablation for Benign Cutaneous Lesions.	As surgical and/or ablative modalities, radiofrequency (RF) has been known to produce good clinical outcomes in dermatology. Recently, 27.12 MHz RF has been introduced and has several advantages over conventional 4 or 6 MHz in terms of the precise ablation and lesser pain perception. We aimed to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of 27.12 MHz RF for the treatment of benign cutaneous lesions. Twenty female patient subjects were enrolled. Digital photography and a USB microscope camera were used to monitor the clinical results before one session of treatment with 27.12 MHz RF and after 1 and 3 weeks. Treated lesions included telangiectasias, cherry and spider angiomas, skin tags, seborrheic keratoses, lentigo, milium, dilated pore, acne, piercing hole, and one case of neurofibroma. For vascular lesions, clinical results were excellent for 33.3%, good for 44.4%, moderate for 11.1%, and poor for 11.1%. For nonvascular lesions (epidermal lesions and other benign cutaneous lesions), clinical results were excellent for 48.3%, good for 45.2%, moderate for 3.2%, and poor for 3.2%. No serious adverse events were observed. Mild adverse events reported were slight erythema, scale, and crust. The 27.12 MHz RF treatment of benign vascular and nonvascular lesions appears safe and effective after 3 weeks of follow-up.
28066458	Nonsense Mutation Inside Anthocyanidin Synthase Gene Controls Pigmentation in Yellow Raspberry (Rubus idaeus L.).	Yellow raspberry fruits have reduced anthocyanin contents and offer unique possibility to study the genetics of pigment biosynthesis in this important soft fruit. Anthocyanidin synthase (Ans) catalyzes the conversion of leucoanthocyanidin to anthocyanidin, a key committed step in biosynthesis of anthocyanins. Molecular analysis of the Ans gene enabled to identify an inactive ans allele in a yellow fruit raspberry ("Anne"). A 5 bp insertion in the coding region was identified and designated as ans+5. The insertion creates a premature stop codon resulting in a truncated protein of 264 amino acids, compared to 414 amino acids wild-type ANS protein. This mutation leads to loss of function of the encoded protein that might also result in transcriptional downregulation of Ans gene as a secondary effect, i.e., nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. Further, this mutation results in loss of visible and detectable anthocyanin pigments. Functional characterization of raspberry Ans/ans alleles via complementation experiments in the Arabidopsis thaliana ldox mutant supports the inactivity of encoded protein through ans+5 and explains the proposed block in the anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway in raspberry. Taken together, our data shows that the mutation inside Ans gene in raspberry is responsible for yellow fruit phenotypes.
28018348	PD-L1 Is Not Constitutively Expressed on Tasmanian Devil Facial Tumor Cells but Is Strongly Upregulated in Response to IFN-gamma and Can Be Expressed in the Tumor Microenvironment.	The devil facial tumor disease (DFTD) is caused by clonal transmissible cancers that have led to a catastrophic decline in the wild Tasmanian devil (Sarcophilus harrisii) population. The first transmissible tumor, now termed devil facial tumor 1 (DFT1), was first discovered in 1996 and has been continually transmitted to new hosts for at least 20 years. In 2015, a second transmissible cancer [devil facial tumor 2 (DFT2)] was discovered in wild devils, and the DFT2 is genetically distinct and independent from the DFT1. Despite the estimated 136,559 base pair substitutions and 14,647 insertions/deletions in the DFT1 genome as compared to two normal devil reference genomes, the allograft tumors are not rejected by the host immune system. Additionally, genome sequencing of two sub-strains of DFT1 detected greater than 15,000 single-base substitutions that were found in only one of the DFT1 sub-strains, demonstrating the transmissible tumors are evolving and that generation of neoantigens is likely ongoing. Recent evidence in human clinical trials suggests that blocking PD-1:PD-L1 interactions promotes antitumor immune responses and is most effective in cancers with a high number of mutations. We hypothesized that DFTD cells could exploit the PD-1:PD-L1 inhibitory pathway to evade antitumor immune responses. We developed recombinant proteins and monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to provide the first demonstration that PD-1 binds to both PD-L1 and PD-L2 in a non-placental mammal and show that PD-L1 is upregulated in DFTD cells in response to IFN-gamma. Immunohistochemistry showed that PD-L1 is rarely expressed in primary tumor masses, but low numbers of PD-L1+ non-tumor cells were detected in the microenvironment of several metastatic tumors. Importantly, in vitro testing suggests that PD-1 binding to PD-L1 and PD-L2 can be blocked by mAbs, which could be critical to understanding how the DFT allografts evade the immune system.
27018557	Predicting Sport Experience During Training: The Role of Change-Oriented Feedback in Athletes' Motivation, Self-Confidence and Needs Satisfaction Fluctuations.	Change-oriented feedback (COF) quality is predictive of between-athletes differences in their sport experience (Carpentier & Mageau, 2013). This study extends these findings by investigating how training-to-training variations in COF quality influence athletes' training experience (within-athlete differences) while controlling for the impact of promotion-oriented feedback (POF). In total, 49 athletes completed a diary after 15 consecutive training sessions to assess COF and POF received during training, as well as situational outcomes. Multivariate multilevel analyses showed that, when controlling for covariates, COF quality during a specific training session is positively linked to athletes' autonomous motivation, self-confidence and satisfaction of their psychological needs for autonomy and relatedness during the same session. In contrast, COF quantity is negatively linked to athletes' need for competence. POF quality is a significant positive predictor of athletes' self-confidence and needs for autonomy and competence. Contributions to the feedback and SDT literature, and for coaches' training, are discussed.

27682867	Natural Products as a Source for Antileishmanial and Antitrypanosomal Agents.	Natural products are compounds extracted from plants, marine organisms, fungi or bacteria. Many researches for new drugs are based on these natural molecules, mainly by beneficial effects on health, health, efficacy, and therapeutic safety. Leishmaniosis, Chagas disease and African sleeping sickness are neglected diseases caused by the Leishmania and Trypanosoma ssp. parasites. These infections mainly affect population of developing countries; they have different symptoms, and may often lead to death. The therapeutic drugs available to treat these diseases are either obsolete, toxic, or have questionable efficacy, possibly through encountering resistance. Discovery of new, safe, effective, and affordable molecules is urgently needed. Natural organisms, as marine metabolites, alkaloids, flavonoids, steroids, terpene and coumarins provide innumerable molecules with the potential to treat these diseases. This study examines studies of natural bioactive compounds as antileishmanial and antitrypanosomal agents.
27764821	Sesquicentennial Tribute to Emil Redlich (1866-1930), The 'Embodied Conscience of Neurology'.	Professor Emil Redlich (1866-1930) of the University of Vienna was born 150 years ago. Raised in a humble environment, he became an eminent researcher and neurology scholar, and succeeded in laying some of the key foundations of neuroanatomy and neuropathology. His name is linked to medical eponyms that define the dorsal root entry zone into the spinal cord, epidemic disseminated encephalomyelitis, narcolepsy, senile plaques and dementia. As its first director, he managed to organize the Maria-Theresien-Schlossel into a first-class neuropsychiatric hospital. The one attribute that his colleagues constantly recognized was his inexorable scientific demeanor, always insisting on a critical checking of the facts before formulating any hypothesis.
26880152	Enablers and barriers for implementing high-quality hypertension care in a rural primary care setting in Nigeria: perspectives of primary care staff and health insurance managers.	BACKGROUND: Hypertension is a highly prevalent risk factor for cardiovascular diseases in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) that can be modified through timely and long-term treatment in primary care. OBJECTIVE: We explored perspectives of primary care staff and health insurance managers on enablers and barriers for implementing high-quality hypertension care, in the context of a community-based health insurance programme in rural Nigeria. DESIGN: Qualitative study using semi-structured individual interviews with primary care staff (n = 11) and health insurance managers (n=4). Data were analysed using standard qualitative techniques. RESULTS: Both stakeholder groups perceived health insurance as an important facilitator for implementing high-quality hypertension care because it covered costs of care for patients and provided essential resources and incentives to clinics: guidelines, staff training, medications, and diagnostic equipment. Perceived inhibitors included the following: high staff workload; administrative challenges at facilities; discordance between healthcare provider and insurer on how health insurance and provider payment methods work; and insufficient fit between some guideline recommendations and tools for patient education and characteristics/needs of the local patient population. Perceived strategies to address inhibitors included the following: task-shifting; adequate provider payment benchmarking; good provider-insurer relationships; automated administration systems; and tailoring guidelines/patient education. CONCLUSIONS: By providing insights into perspectives of primary care providers and health insurance managers, this study offers information on potential strategies for implementing high-quality hypertension care for insured patients in SSA.
27231112	Functional Components from Nature-Derived Drugs for the Treatment of Rheumatoid Arthritis.	Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic systemic disorder characterized by persistent synovitis and systemic inflammation. Currently, the widely used drugs for the treatment of RA are disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, biological agents and glucocorticoids. But their clinical use has been limited because of their adverse effects with a high frequency and high cost of treatment. It is essential to find novel candidate agents. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has been used for RA treatment for a long period of time. In recent years, significant amounts of studies have shown that some TCMs and their active ingredients have obvious therapeutic effects on RA. In this review, the compounds in TCMs that have an effect in clinic or animal experiments of RA are critically reviewed and summarized. Moreover, the relationship between chemical structures of the compound and their activities is analyzed. The relevant researches are described from the aspects of source, methods, result, and related mechanism analysis. The existing studies show that most effective compounds in TCM for RA treatment belong to alkaloids, flavonoids, terpenoids, phenols and quinines. It is hoped that the data summarized in this review will be beneficial to the screening of new nature-derived antirheumatic drugs.
27536798	The experience of adults who choose watchful waiting or active surveillance as an approach to medical treatment: a qualitative systematic review.	BACKGROUND: "Watchful waiting" or "active surveillance" is an alternative approach in the medical management of certain diseases. Most often considered appropriate as an approach to treatment for low-risk prostate cancer, it is also found in the literature in breast cancer surveillance, urinary lithiasis, lymphocytic leukemia, depression and small renal tumors. OBJECTIVES: This systematic review sought to:Identify and synthesize the best available international evidence on the experience of adults who choose watchful waiting or active surveillance as an approach to medical treatment. To this end the questions addressed in this review were:1. How do patients who have chosen watchful waiting or active surveillance describe the process of coming to the decision?2. What were the factors that influenced their decision to choose?3. How do patients who have chosen watchful waiting or active surveillance describe the experience? INCLUSION CRITERIA: Male or female patients, 18 years or older, who experience the phenomenon of choosing or not choosing watchful waiting or active surveillance as a treatment approach.The phenomena of interest were accounts of the experiences of adult patients who choose watchful waiting or active surveillance as an approach to medical treatment.This review considered studies that focused on qualitative data including, but not limited to, designs such as phenomenology, grounded theory, ethnography, action research and critical theory. Mixed method studies with narrative description and patient voice were also considered. Grey literature such as research reports and dissertations were also included. SEARCH STRATEGY: The search strategy aimed to find both published and unpublished studies through electronic databases, reference lists, and the World Wide Web. Extensive searches were undertaken of relevant databases to include CINAHL, PubMed, SCOPUS and PsycINFO. A three-step search strategy was used in each component of the review. Studies were limited to English language papers. The search considered papers from the year 2000 to January 2015. METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY: Qualitative papers selected for retrieval were assessed by two independent reviewers for methodological validity prior to inclusion in the review using the standardized critical appraisal instruments from the Joanna Briggs Institute Qualitative Assessment and Review Instrument (JBI-QARI). Any disagreements that arose between the reviewers were resolved through discussion, or with a third reviewer. DATA EXTRACTION: Qualitative data were extracted from papers included in the review using the standardized data extraction tool from. The data extracted included specific details about the phenomena of interest that described the experiences pertinent to the review questions DATA SYNTHESIS: The data were synthesized using the Joanna Briggs Institute approach to meta-synthesis by meta-aggregation using the JBI-QARI software and methods. RESULTS: A total of 16 studies, critically appraised by two independent reviewers and deemed to be of high quality, were included in the final review. One study was excluded after appraisal. One hundred and fifty-five findings from the 16 studies were extracted into 10 categories and then into three synthesized findings. The synthesized findings explicated: CONCLUSIONS: The synthesized findings of the review conclude that the process of making the decision to choose watchful waiting is complex. Through the process patients and their significant others experience an array of emotions that often lead to uncertainty and anxiety. Once the decision is made patients must cope with the knowledge that they have a troubling diagnosis and make the necessary adjustments. An empathic, reassuring relationship with a healthcare practitioner eases the burden of this process.Healthcare providers need to recognize that not all patients are "at peace" with the decision of choosing watchful waiting. Uncertainty and fear may intensify during this time as well as feelings of stress and anxiety. Patients and their significant others often attempt to adapt in the best way they know how but the effectiveness of their coping strategies needs to be assessed. In addition, healthcare providers need to also be aware that with the increased anxiety and stress associated with watchful waiting, patients' understanding of healthcare information and the ability to ask questions may be diminished. Both providers and patients benefit from open discussions related to the many aspects of uncertainty and fear related to making and living with the decision. Employing a shared decision making model with regard to the management of the array of issues that comes from both making the decision and living with it is recommended. It appears that patients are very sensitive to recognizing when the care they are receiving lacks empathy. Communication that is open, empathic, and non-judgmental is essential. A willingness to discuss sensitive issues such as sexual function needs to be conveyed. Lastly, providers and their staff need to remain attentive to the importance of articulating aspects of the situation that are hopeful and optimistic as many patients, during their visits, take their cues regarding their health status from non-verbal and verbal interactions.Future studies should investigate.
27617305	The mitogenome of the bed bug Cimex lectularius (Hemiptera: Cimicidae).	We report the extraction of a bed bug mitogenome from high-throughput sequencing projects originally focused on the nuclear genome of Cimex lectularius. The assembled mitogenome has a similar AT nucleotide composition bias found in other insects. Phylogenetic analysis of all protein-coding genes indicates that C. lectularius is clearly a member of a paraphyletic Cimicomorpha clade within the Order Hemiptera.
27658511	An Overview on the Role of alpha -Synuclein in Experimental Models of Parkinson's Disease from Pathogenesis to Therapeutics.	Parkinson's disease (PD) is a devastating and progressive movement disorder characterized by symptoms of muscles rigidity, tremor, postural instability and slow physical movements. Biochemically, PD is characterized by lack of dopamine production and its action due to loss of dopaminergic neurons and neuropathologically by the presence of intracytoplasmic inclusions known as Lewy bodies, which mainly consist of presynaptic neuronal protein, alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn). It is believed that alteration in alpha-syn homeostasis leads to increased accumulation and aggregation of alpha-syn in Lewy body. Based on the important role of alpha-syn from pathogenesis to therapeutics, the recent researches are mainly focused on deciphering the critical role of alpha-syn at advanced level. Being a major protein in Lewy body that has a key role in pathogenesis of PD, several model systems including immortalized cell lines (SH-SY5Y), primary neuronal cultures, yeast (saccharomyces cerevisiae), drosophila (fruit flies), nematodes (Caenorhabditis elegans) and rodents are being employed to understand the PD pathogenesis and treatment. In order to study the etiopathogensis and develop novel therapeutic target for alpha -syn aggregation, majority of investigators rely on toxin (rotenone, 1-Methyl-4-Phenyl-1,2,3,6-Tetrahydropyridine, 6-hydroxydopamine, paraquat)-induced animal models of PD as a tool for basic research. Whereas, cell and tissue based models are mostly utilized to elucidate the mechanistic and molecular pathways underlying the alpha -syn induced toxicity and therapeutic approaches in PD. Gene modified mouse models based on alpha-syn expression are fascinating for modeling familial PD and toxin induced models provide a suitable approach for sporadic PD. The purpose of this review is to provide a summary and a critical review of the involvement of alpha-syn in various in vitro and in vivo models of PD based on use of neurotoxins as well as genetic modifications.
28119628	Detection of Impaired Sympathetic Cerebrovascular Control Using Functional Biomarkers Based on Principal Dynamic Mode Analysis.	This study sought to determine whether models of cerebrovascular function based on Laguerre-Volterra kernels that account for nonlinear cerebral blood flow (CBF) dynamics can detect the effects of functional cerebral sympathetic blockade. We retrospectively analyzed continuous beat-to-beat blood pressure, middle cerebral blood velocity, and partial-pressure of end-tidal CO2 (PETCO2) recordings from eighteen healthy individuals who were treated with either an oral dose of the alpha1-adrenergic receptor blocker Prazosin or a placebo treatment. The global principal dynamic modes (PDMs) were analyzed using Laguerre-Volterra kernels to examine the nonlinear system dynamics. Our principal findings were: (1) very low frequency (<0.03 Hz) linear components of first-order kernels for BP and PETCO2 are mutually coupled to CBF dynamics with the ability to separate individuals between control and blockade conditions, and (2) the gains of the nonlinear functions associated with low-pass and approximately 0.03 Hz global PDMs for the BP are sensitive to sympathetic blockade. Collectively these results suggest that very low frequency global PDMs for BP may have potential utility as functional biomarkers of sympathetic neurovascular dysfunction which can occur in conditions like autonomic failure, stroke and traumatic brain injury.
27555761	Alteration of spontaneous brain activity in COPD patients.	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Airflow limitation in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) results in a decrease in oxygen transport to the brain. The aim of the present study was to explore the alteration of spontaneous brain activity induced by hypoxia in patients with COPD. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-five stable patients with COPD and 25 matching healthy volunteers were investigated. Amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) of blood oxygenation level-dependent signal at resting state in the brain was analyzed using functional magnetic resonance imaging. RESULTS: Whole-brain analysis using functional magnetic resonance imaging revealed significant decreases in ALFF in the bilateral posterior cingulate gyri and right lingual gyrus and an increase in ALFF in the left postcentral gyrus of patients with COPD. After controlling for SaO2, patients with COPD only showed an increase in ALFF in the left postcentral gyrus. Region of interest analysis showed a decrease in ALFF in the left precentral gyrus and an increase in ALFF in the left caudate nucleus of patients with COPD. In all subjects, ALFF in the bilateral posterior cingulate gyri and right lingual gyrus showed positive correlations with visual reproduction. CONCLUSION: We demonstrated abnormal spontaneous brain activity of patients with COPD, which may have a pathophysiologic meaning.
27558322	Surgical Ligation for Patent Ductus Arteriosus in Extremely Premature Infants: Strategy to Reduce their Risk of Neurodevelopmental Impairment.	Surgical ligation for patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) in extremely low birth weight infants (ELBWIs) has been shown a possible association with neurodevelopmental impairment (NDI) because of its invasiveness. However, we have undergone surgical ligation for ELBWIs immediately after cyclooxygenase inhibitor failed to close a hemodynamically significant PDA (hsPDA) to maintain proper systemic circulation. We aimed to determine the effect of surgical ligation for hsPDA on NDI in ELBWIs. In enrolled 71 ELBWIs, the clinical parameters, including the developmental quotient (DQ), were collected and compared among three groups that were divided by closure mode: spontaneous closure (n = 11), cyclooxygenase inhibitor therapy (n = 37) and surgical ligation (n = 23). No significant differences in DQ at the age of 36 months among the three groups were found: Median (interquartile range): 92.0 (31.0), 89.0 (22.0) and 92.0 (24.5), respectively. In a comparison between groups of DQ < 70 (n = 15) and DQ >/= 70 (n = 56), a significant difference was found in the parameters related to prematurity (p < 0.05 for each): gestational age [23.9 (1.70) vs. 25.4 (2.50) weeks], birth weight [595 (183) vs. 714 (192) g], Apgar score < 5 (1 min) (67% vs. 36%), and laser photocoagulation for retinopathy of prematurity (73% vs. 43%), but there was no significant association with hsPDA. Therefore, we propose that surgical ligation for hsPDA in ELBWIs should be immediately carried out for preventing future neurodevelopmental deterioration if the cyclooxygenase inhibitor failed to close hsPDA.
27621805	Reduction of psycho-spiritual distress of an elderly with advanced congestive heart failure by life review interview in a palliative care day center.	OBJECTIVES: Major depression is common in patients hospitalized with congestive heart failure and is independently associated with increased re-hospitalization and mortality. METHODS: Hereby, we report the treatment for an elderly congestive heart failure patient with frequent emergency department visits having major depression and hopelessness. RESULTS: Treatment outcomes measured showed that depressed scores of psychosocial needs were reduced with life review interview therapy in a palliative care day center. CONCLUSION: We hypothesize that multidisciplinary team's approach to treatment was important for this case.
27847657	Rare Case of an Epithelial Cyst in an Intrapancreatic Accessory Spleen Treated by Robot-Assisted Spleen Preserving Distal Pancreatectomy.	Epithelial cyst in an intrapancreatic accessory spleen (ECIPAS) is exceedingly rare with only 57 cases reported since the first publication in 1980. Comprehensive clinical and diagnostic features remain to be clarified. We present a case of ECIPAS in a 21-year-old Philippine woman who was admitted with right upper quadrant abdominal pain. A cystic lesion in the pancreatic tail was discovered and evaluated by computed tomography and magnetic resonance images. Based on clinical and radiological features a solid pseudopapillary neoplasm was suspected. The patient underwent robot-assisted spleen preserving distal pancreatectomy. Pathological evaluation revealed a 26 mm intrapancreatic accessory spleen with a 16 mm cyst, lined by multilayered epithelium in the tail of the pancreas. The postoperative course was uneventful. Differentiating ECIPAS from (pre)malignant cystic pancreatic neoplasms based on clinical and radiological features remains difficult. When typical radiological signs can be combined with scintigraphy using Technetium-99m labelled colloid or Technetium-99m labelled erythrocytes, which can identify the solid component of the lesion as splenic tissue, it should be possible to make the right diagnosis noninvasively. When pancreatectomy is inevitable due to symptoms or patient preference, minimally invasive laparoscopic or robot-assisted spleen preserving distal pancreatectomy should be considered.
26998355	Cholesterol Lowering Effect of Plant Stanol Ester Yoghurt Drinks with Added Camelina Oil.	The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of yoghurt minidrinks containing two doses of plant stanol ester either with or without added camelina oil on the serum cholesterol levels in moderately hypercholesterolemic subjects. In this randomised, double-blind, parallel group study, 143 subjects consumed a 65 mL minidrink together with a meal daily for four weeks. The minidrink contained 1.6 or 2.0 grams of plant stanols with or without 2 grams of alpha-linolenic acid-rich camelina oil. The placebo minidrink did not contain plant stanols or camelina oil. All plant stanol treated groups showed statistically significant total, LDL, and non-HDL cholesterol lowering relative to baseline and relative to placebo. Compared to placebo, LDL cholesterol was lowered by 9.4% (p < 0.01) and 8.1% (p < 0.01) with 1.6 g and 2 g plant stanols, respectively. With addition of Camelina oil, 1.6 g plant stanols resulted in 11.0% (p < 0.01) and 2 g plant stanols in 8.4% (p < 0.01) reduction in LDL cholesterol compared to placebo. In conclusion, yoghurt minidrinks with plant stanol ester reduced serum LDL cholesterol significantly and addition of a small amount of camelina oil did not significantly enhance the cholesterol lowering effect. This trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02628990.
27842260	Isolated hydatid cyst of the diaphragm, a case report.	INTRODUCTION: Hydatid disease mainly affect lung and liver. We report a very rare case of hydatid cyst of the diaphragm. PATIENT INFORMATION: A 25-year-old female presented with vague right hypochondrial pain for 2 months. Clinical Findings showed mild tenderness at right hypochondrial region, Ultrasound showed segment 7 hepatic cystic lesion of about 5x6x7 centimeters, relatively thick wall, with eccentrically coarse calcification. Computed tomography showed cystic lesion affecting segment 7 of the liver with rims of calcification, appearance is consistent with hydatid cyst of the liver. At laparascopy the liver was found to be normal with a bulging from the lateral border of the diaphragm. Postero-lateral mini-thoracotomy was performed and cyst was found to be inside. Resection was done with direct repair of the diaphragm. The histopathogical examination confirmed hydatid cyst of the diaphragm. CONCLUSION: Isolated hydatid cyst of the diaphragm is a very rare entity. Pre-operative diagnosis is mandatory to prevent unnecessary excessive incisions.
26855939	Rotational alignment of the tibial component in total knee arthroplasty.	Many surgical techniques, correlated to different anatomical landmarks, have been proposed to allow a satisfactory rotational alignment of the tibial component in primary total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Unfortunately, an accurate landmark has not yet been established although many computer models using CT reconstructions and standard radiologic studies have been performed. In this review article, the authors propose a new anatomical rotational reference for a correct positioning of the tibial component during primary TKA; the authors compared the results of their studies with the current literature on rotational alignment references and previously proposed surgical techniques. The authors also analyzed the correlation between classic and newer tibial baseplate designs and different tibial rotational landmarks.
27701150	Nanoparticle Technologies in the Spinal Cord.	Nanoparticles are increasingly being studied within experimental models of spinal cord injury (SCI). They are used to image cells and tissue, move cells to specific regions of the spinal cord, and deliver therapeutic agents locally. The focus of this article is to provide a brief overview of the different types of nanoparticles being studied for spinal cord applications and present data showing the capability of nanoparticles to deliver the chondroitinase ABC (chABC) enzyme locally following acute SCI in rats. Nanoparticles releasing chABC helped promote axonal regeneration following injury, and the nanoparticles also protected the enzyme from rapid degradation. In summary, nanoparticles are viable materials for diagnostic or therapeutic applications within experimental models of SCI and have potential for future clinical use.
26930204	An Automated Treatment Plan Quality Control Tool for Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy Using a Voxel-Weighting Factor-Based Re-Optimization Algorithm.	Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) currently plays an important role in radiotherapy, but its treatment plan quality can vary significantly among institutions and planners. Treatment plan quality control (QC) is a necessary component for individual clinics to ensure that patients receive treatments with high therapeutic gain ratios. The voxel-weighting factor-based plan re-optimization mechanism has been proved able to explore a larger Pareto surface (solution domain) and therefore increase the possibility of finding an optimal treatment plan. In this study, we incorporated additional modules into an in-house developed voxel weighting factor-based re-optimization algorithm, which was enhanced as a highly automated and accurate IMRT plan QC tool (TPS-QC tool). After importing an under-assessment plan, the TPS-QC tool was able to generate a QC report within 2 minutes. This QC report contains the plan quality determination as well as information supporting the determination. Finally, the IMRT plan quality can be controlled by approving quality-passed plans and replacing quality-failed plans using the TPS-QC tool. The feasibility and accuracy of the proposed TPS-QC tool were evaluated using 25 clinically approved cervical cancer patient IMRT plans and 5 manually created poor-quality IMRT plans. The results showed high consistency between the QC report quality determinations and the actual plan quality. In the 25 clinically approved cases that the TPS-QC tool identified as passed, a greater difference could be observed for dosimetric endpoints for organs at risk (OAR) than for planning target volume (PTV), implying that better dose sparing could be achieved in OAR than in PTV. In addition, the dose-volume histogram (DVH) curves of the TPS-QC tool re-optimized plans satisfied the dosimetric criteria more frequently than did the under-assessment plans. In addition, the criteria for unsatisfied dosimetric endpoints in the 5 poor-quality plans could typically be satisfied when the TPS-QC tool generated re-optimized plans without sacrificing other dosimetric endpoints. In addition to its feasibility and accuracy, the proposed TPS-QC tool is also user-friendly and easy to operate, both of which are necessary characteristics for clinical use.
27660466	Osimertinib making a breakthrough in lung cancer targeted therapy.	Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are the evidence-based first-line treatment for advanced non-small-cell lung cancer that harbors sensitizing EGFR mutations (EGFRm(+)) such as exon 19 deletions and L858R substitutions in exon 21. However, acquired resistance to EGFR TKIs is mostly driven by a second-site EGFR T790M mutation, which negates their inhibitory activity. Osimertinib (AZD9291, Tagrisso), an oral, third-generation EGFR TKI, has been designed to target the EGFR T790M mutation, while sparing wild-type EGFR. In this up-to-date review, focus is not only on the structure, mechanisms, and pharmacokinetics of osimertinib but also on summarizing clinical trials and making recommendations of osimertinib for patients with non-small-cell lung cancer.
27073590	SIRT1: A Novel Target for the Treatment of Muscular Dystrophies.	Muscular dystrophies are inherited myogenic disorders accompanied by progressive skeletal muscle weakness and degeneration. Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is the most common and severe form of muscular dystrophy and is caused by mutations in the gene that encodes the cytoskeletal protein dystrophin. The treatment for DMD is limited to glucocorticoids, which are associated with multiple side effects. Thus, the identification of novel therapeutic targets is urgently needed. SIRT1 is an NAD(+)-dependent histone/protein deacetylase that plays roles in diverse cellular processes, including stress resistance and cell survival. Studies have shown that SIRT1 activation provides beneficial effects in the dystrophin-deficient mdx mouse, a model of DMD. SIRT1 activation leads to the attenuation of oxidative stress and inflammation, a shift from the fast to slow myofiber phenotype, and the suppression of tissue fibrosis. Although further research is needed to clarify the molecular mechanisms underlying the protective role of SIRT1 in mdx mice, we propose SIRT1 as a novel therapeutic target for patients with muscular dystrophies.
27621744	An ATL78-Like RING-H2 Finger Protein Confers Abiotic Stress Tolerance through Interacting with RAV2 and CSN5B in Tomato.	RING finger proteins play an important role in plant adaptation to abiotic stresses. In the present study, a wild tomato (Solanum habrochaites) cold-induced RING-H2 finger gene, ShATL78L, was isolated, which has been identified as an abiotic stress responsive gene in tomato. The results showed that ShATL78L was constitutively expressed in various tissues such as root, leaf, petiole, stem, flower, and fruit. Cold stress up-regulated ShATL78L in the cold-tolerant S. habrochaites compared to the susceptible cultivated tomato (S. lycopersicum). Furthermore, ShATL78L expression was also regulated under different stresses such as drought, salt, heat, wound, osmotic stress, and exogenous hormones. Functional characterization showed that cultivated tomato overexpressing ShATL78L had improved tolerance to cold, drought and oxidative stresses compared to the wild-type and the knockdown lines. To understand the underlying molecular mechanism of ShATL78L regulating abiotic stress responses, we performed yeast one-hybrid and two-hybrid assays and found that RAV2 could bind to the promoter of ShATL78L and activates/alters its transcription, and CSN5B could interact with ShATL78L to regulate abiotic stress responses. Taken together, these results show that ShATL78L plays an important role in regulating plant adaptation to abiotic stresses through bound by RAV2 and interacting with CSN5B. Highlight: RAV2 binds to the promoter of ShATL78L to activates/alters its transcription to adapt the environmental conditions; furthermore, ShATL78L interacts with CSN5B to regulate the stress tolerance.
26870193	Early tumor cavitation with regorafenib in metastatic colorectal cancer: A case report.	Tumoral cavity formation is a characteristic phenomenon reported in anti-angiogenic therapy in lung lesions. A 57-year-old male with multiple pulmonary metastases from colorectal cancer treated with an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor, regorafenib, exhibited a characteristic cavity formation after the first two cycles. The decrease in the size of tumors was calculated as 38%, and there were associated decreases in the serum concentrations of the tumor markers carcinoembryonic antigen and CA19-9. After eight cycles of treatment, the cavity gradually disappeared through filling-in. This unique morphological response is not only reported in lung cancer but also in liver metastasis in colorectal cancer. However, the association between morphological changes including cavity formation and clinical benefit remains controversial. Pulmonary hemorrhage and pneumothorax are well-known consequences of cavitation, as reported with the other anti-angiogenic inhibitors. Early tumor cavitation in lung metastasis may demonstrate the predictive potential of regorafenib in colorectal cancer, although it is necessary to be mindful of toxicity.
27224056	Spectrum and Frequency of the GJB2 Gene Pathogenic Variants in a Large Cohort of Patients with Hearing Impairment Living in a Subarctic Region of Russia (the Sakha Republic).	Pathogenic variants in the GJB2 gene, encoding connexin 26, are known to be a major cause of hearing impairment (HI). More than 300 allelic variants have been identified in the GJB2 gene. Spectrum and allelic frequencies of the GJB2 gene vary significantly among different ethnic groups worldwide. Until now, the spectrum and frequency of the pathogenic variants in exon 1, exon 2 and the flanking intronic regions of the GJB2 gene have not been described thoroughly in the Sakha Republic (Yakutia), which is located in a subarctic region in Russia. The complete sequencing of the non-coding and coding regions of the GJB2 gene was performed in 393 patients with HI (Yakuts-296, Russians-51, mixed and other ethnicities-46) and in 187 normal hearing individuals of Yakut (n = 107) and Russian (n = 80) populations. In the total sample (n = 580), we revealed 12 allelic variants of the GJB2 gene, 8 of which were recessive pathogenic variants. Ten genotypes with biallelic recessive pathogenic variants in the GJB2 gene (in a homozygous or a compound heterozygous state) were found in 192 out of 393 patients (48.85%). We found that the most frequent GJB2 pathogenic variant in the Yakut patients was c.-23+1G>A (51.82%) and that the second most frequent was c.109G>A (2.37%), followed by c.35delG (1.64%). Pathogenic variants small es, Cyrillic.35delG (22.34%), c.-23+1G>A (5.31%), and c.313_326del14 (2.12%) were found to be the most frequent among the Russian patients. The carrier frequencies of the c.-23+1G>A and small es, Cyrillic.109G>A pathogenic variants in the Yakut control group were 10.20% and 2.80%, respectively. The carrier frequencies of small es, Cyrillic.35delG and c.101T>C were identical (2.5%) in the Russian control group. We found that the contribution of the GJB2 gene pathogenic variants in HI in the population of the Sakha Republic (48.85%) was the highest among all of the previously studied regions of Asia. We suggest that extensive accumulation of the c.-23+1G>A pathogenic variant in the indigenous Yakut population (92.20% of all mutant chromosomes in patients) and an extremely high (10.20%) carrier frequency in the control group may indicate a possible selective advantage for the c.-23+1G>A carriers living in subarctic climate.
27721650	Approaching Long Genomic Regions and Large Recombination Rates with msParSm as an Alternative to MaCS.	The msParSm application is an evolution of msPar, the parallel version of the coalescent simulation program ms, which removes the limitation for simulating long stretches of DNA sequences with large recombination rates, without compromising the accuracy of the standard coalescence. This work introduces msParSm, describes its significant performance improvements over msPar and its shared memory parallelization details, and shows how it can get better, if not similar, execution times than MaCS. Two case studies with different mutation rates were analyzed, one approximating the human average and the other approximating the Drosophila melanogaster average.

27147951	Premutation in the Fragile X Mental Retardation 1 (FMR1) Gene Affects Maternal Zn-milk and Perinatal Brain Bioenergetics and Scaffolding.	Fragile X premutation alleles have 55-200 CGG repeats in the 5' UTR of the FMR1 gene. Altered zinc (Zn) homeostasis has been reported in fibroblasts from >60 years old premutation carriers, in which Zn supplementation significantly restored Zn-dependent mitochondrial protein import/processing and function. Given that mitochondria play a critical role in synaptic transmission, brain function, and cognition, we tested FMRP protein expression, brain bioenergetics, and expression of the Zn-dependent synaptic scaffolding protein SH3 and multiple ankyrin repeat domains 3 (Shank3) in a knock-in (KI) premutation mouse model with 180 CGG repeats. Mitochondrial outcomes correlated with FMRP protein expression (but not FMR1 gene expression) in KI mice and human fibroblasts from carriers of the pre- and full-mutation. Significant deficits in brain bioenergetics, Zn levels, and Shank3 protein expression were observed in the Zn-rich regions KI hippocampus and cerebellum at PND21, with some of these effects lasting into adulthood (PND210). A strong genotype x age interaction was observed for most of the outcomes tested in hippocampus and cerebellum, whereas in cortex, age played a major role. Given that the most significant effects were observed at the end of the lactation period, we hypothesized that KI milk might have a role at compounding the deleterious effects on the FMR1 genetic background. A higher gene expression of ZnT4 and ZnT6, Zn transporters abundant in brain and lactating mammary glands, was observed in the latter tissue of KI dams. A cross-fostering experiment allowed improving cortex bioenergetics in KI pups nursing on WT milk. Conversely, WT pups nursing on KI milk showed deficits in hippocampus and cerebellum bioenergetics. A highly significant milk type x genotype interaction was observed for all three-brain regions, being cortex the most influenced. Finally, lower milk-Zn levels were recorded in milk from lactating women carrying the premutation as well as other Zn-related outcomes (Zn-dependent alkaline phosphatase activity and lactose biosynthesis-whose limiting step is the Zn-dependent beta-1,4-galactosyltransferase). In premutation carriers, altered Zn homeostasis, brain bioenergetics and Shank3 levels could be compounded by Zn-deficient milk, increasing the risk of developing emotional and neurological/cognitive problems and/or FXTAS later in life.
27790288	Ectopic expression of AtDGAT1, encoding diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase exclusively committed to TAG biosynthesis, enhances oil accumulation in seeds and leaves of Jatropha.	BACKGROUND: Jatropha curcas is an important biofuel crop due to the presence of high amount of oil in its seeds suitable for biodiesel production. Triacylglycerols (TAGs) are the most abundant form of storage oil in plants. Diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase (DGAT1) enzyme is responsible for the last and only committed step in seed TAG biosynthesis. Direct upregulation of TAG biosynthesis in seeds and vegetative tissues through overexpression of the DGAT1 could enhance the energy density of the biomass, making significant impact on biofuel production. RESULTS: The enzyme diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase is the rate-limiting enzyme responsible for the TAG biosynthesis in seeds. We generated transgenic Jatropha ectopically expressing an Arabidopsis DGAT1 gene through Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. The resulting AtDGAT1 transgenic plants showed a dramatic increase in lipid content by 1.5- to 2 fold in leaves and 20-30 % in seeds, and an overall increase in TAG and DAG, and lower free fatty acid (FFA) levels compared to the wild-type plants. The increase in oil content in transgenic plants is accompanied with increase in average plant height, seeds per tree, average 100-seed weight, and seed length and breadth. The enhanced TAG accumulation in transgenic plants had no penalty on the growth rates, growth patterns, leaf number, and leaf size of plants. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we produced transgenic Jatropha ectopically expressing AtDGAT1. We successfully increased the oil content by 20-30 % in seeds and 1.5- to 2.0-fold in leaves of Jatropha through genetic engineering. Transgenic plants had reduced FFA content compared with control plants. Our strategy of increasing energy density by enhancing oil accumulation in both seeds and leaves in Jatropha would make it economically more sustainable for biofuel production.
26869977	The Adapting Mind in the Genomic Era.	Genomics and molecular biology has added substantial methods and knowledge to nearly all fields of biology and medicine. In this review we try to demonstrate how genomics and molecular biology is also on the way to have a profound impact on behavioral anthropology, evolutionary psychology, evolutionary sociology, and bio-sociology. We propose that particularly studies on "selection and adaptation" will be influenced profoundly by genomics, for instance via identification of the partially genetic basis of human behavior by "candidate gene studies" and by "genome wide association studies." In addition, epigenetics will lead to a deeper study of the interaction of the genetic basis of a behavior and its environmental regulation. We argue that the "genomic revolution" is much more than merely a new methodological approach, but will change our concepts of human behavior and its development in the evolution of homo.
27964776	"Since both of us are using antiretrovirals, we have been supportive to each other": facilitators and barriers of pre-exposure prophylaxis use in heterosexual HIV serodiscordant couples in Kisumu, Kenya.	INTRODUCTION: Since 2015, the World Health Organization recommends pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for all persons at substantial risk for HIV, including HIV-uninfected partners in serodiscordant relationships in resource-limited settings. As PrEP moves from clinical trials to real-world use, understanding facilitators of and barriers to PrEP initiation and adherence is critical to successful PrEP implementation and rollout. METHODS: We conducted 44 in-depth individual or couple interviews with 63 participants (30 without HIV and 33 with HIV) enrolled in the Partners Demonstration Project in Kisumu, Kenya, between August and September 2014. The semi-structured interviews discussed the following: 1) perceived advantages and disadvantages of antiretroviral therapy (ART)/PrEP; 2) reasons for accepting or declining ART/PrEP and 3) influence of prevention of transmission to partner or infant on ART/PrEP use. Transcripts from the interviews were iteratively analyzed using inductive content analysis. RESULTS: Our study identified three key factors that may facilitate initiation of PrEP in this population. First, participants using PrEP felt reduced stress and increased trust in their HIV serodiscordant relationships. Second, greater community-wide knowledge of PrEP was thought to likely increase PrEP acceptance. Third, greater education and counselling by providers on PrEP use was also considered to likely increase the adoption of PrEP. We also identified three key barriers to initiation of and adherence to PrEP. First, most participants who declined PrEP expressed doubts about the relative additional effectiveness of PrEP in combination with other prevention tools. Second, perceived stigma related to PrEP use was an important barrier to PrEP initiation. Third, many struggled with overcoming perceived side effects or logistical challenges of taking daily PrEP, particularly when they themselves were not ill. CONCLUSIONS: Leveraging the facilitators and overcoming barriers to PrEP uptake may enhance the successful rollout of PrEP among HIV serodiscordant couples in Kenya and other areas in sub-Saharan Africa, thereby reducing sexual transmission of HIV. Further research focused on how best to provide counselling on combination HIV prevention tools in the context of PrEP use is a crucial next step to delivering PrEP.
27722193	Assessing risk for preclinical beta-amyloid pathology with APOE, cognitive, and demographic information.	INTRODUCTION: Clinical trials in Alzheimer's disease are aimed at early stages of disease, including preclinical Alzheimer's disease. The high cost and time required to screen large numbers of participants for Abeta pathology impede the development of novel drugs. This study's objective was to evaluate the extent to which inexpensive and easily obtainable information can reduce the number of screen failures by increasing the proportion of Abeta+ participants identified for screening. METHODS: We used random forest models to evaluate the positive predictive value of demographics, APOE, and longitudinal cognitive rates in the prediction of amyloid pathology, measured by florbetapir PET or cerebrospinal fluid. RESULTS: Predicting Abeta positivity with demographic, APOE, and cognitive information yielded a positive predictive value estimate of 0.65 (95% CI, 0.50-0.96), nearly a 60% increase over the reference Abeta+ prevalence in the cohort of 0.41. CONCLUSIONS: By incorporating this procedure, clinical trial screening costs of 7500 USD per participant may be reduced by nearly 7 million USD total.
28066296	Designing System Reforms: Using a Systems Approach to Translate Incident Analyses into Prevention Strategies.	Advocates of systems thinking approaches argue that accident prevention strategies should focus on reforming the system rather than on fixing the "broken components." However, little guidance exists on how organizations can translate incident data into prevention strategies that address the systemic causes of accidents. This article describes and evaluates a series of systems thinking prevention strategies that were designed in response to the analysis of multiple incidents. The study was undertaken in the led outdoor activity (LOA) sector in Australia, which delivers supervised or instructed outdoor activities such as canyoning, sea kayaking, rock climbing and camping. The design process involved workshops with practitioners, and focussed on incident data analyzed using Rasmussen's AcciMap technique. A series of reflection points based on the systemic causes of accidents was used to guide the design process, and the AcciMap technique was used to represent the prevention strategies and the relationships between them, leading to the creation of PreventiMaps. An evaluation of the PreventiMaps revealed that all of them incorporated the core principles of the systems thinking approach and many proposed prevention strategies for improving vertical integration across the LOA system. However, the majority failed to address the migration of work practices and the erosion of risk controls. Overall, the findings suggest that the design process was partially successful in helping practitioners to translate incident data into prevention strategies that addressed the systemic causes of accidents; refinement of the design process is required to focus practitioners more on designing monitoring and feedback mechanisms to support decisions at the higher levels of the system.
27336589	Dung Beetles along a Tropical Altitudinal Gradient: Environmental Filtering on Taxonomic and Functional Diversity.	Mountains provide an interesting context in which to study the many facets of biodiversity in response to macroclimate, since environmental conditions change rapidly due to elevation. Although the decrease in biodiversity with increasing elevation is generally accepted, our understanding of the variation of functional diversity along altitudinal gradients is still poorly known. The partitioning of diversity into spatial components can help to understand the processes that influence the distribution of species, and these studies are urgently needed in face of the increasing threats to mountain environments throughout the world. We describe the distribution of dung beetle diversity along an altitudinal gradient on a tropical mountain in southeastern Brazil, including the spatial partitioning of taxonomic and functional diversities. The altitudinal gradient ranged from 800 up to 1400 m a.s.l. and we collected dung beetles at every 100 m of altitude. We used the Rao Index to calculate gamma, alpha and beta diversity for taxonomic and functional diversity of dung beetles. Climatic, soil and vegetation variables were used to explain variation in community attributes along the altitudinal gradient. Dung beetle richness declined with altitude and was related to climatic and vegetation variables, but functional diversity did not follow the same pattern. Over 50% of gamma taxonomic diversity was caused by among altitudes diversity (beta), while almost 100% of functional diversity was due to the alpha component. Contrasting beta taxonomic with beta functional diversity, we suggest that there is ecological redundancy among communities and that the environment is filtering species in terms of the Grinnellian niche, rather than the Eltonian niche. beta taxonomic diversity is caused mainly by the turnover component, reinforcing the hypothesis of environmental filtering. Global warming may have strong effects on mountain communities due to upslope range shifts and extinctions, and these events will lead to an even larger than previously expected loss of diversity as dung beetles gamma taxonomic diversity is caused mainly by the beta component.
27307990	The CXCR4 antagonist plerixafor enhances the effect of rituximab in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma cell lines.	BACKGROUND: Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is an aggressive disease with variable clinical outcome, accounting for at least 25-30 % of adult non-Hodgkin lymphomas. Approximately one third of DLBCL patients are not cured by the currently used treatment regimen, R-CHOP. Hence, new treatment strategies are needed. Antagonizing the CXCR4 receptor might be promising since the CXCR4-CXCL12 axis is implicated in several aspects of tumor pathogenesis as well as in protection from chemotherapeutic response. In Burkitt lymphoma, the CXCR4 antagonist plerixafor has already been shown to enhance the therapeutic effect of rituximab, the immunotherapeutic agent of R-CHOP; but this is yet to be confirmed for DLBCL. We, therefore, investigated the effect of plerixafor on DLBCL cellular response to rituximab. METHODS: In this in vitro study, human DLBCL cell lines were treated with rituximab and/or plerixafor, concomitantly or in sequence. The trypan blue exclusion method and MTS-based assays were used to evaluate cellular proliferation, whereas flow cytometry was used for assessment of apoptosis status and CXCR4 surface expression level. Linear mixed effects models were used to assess statistical significance. RESULTS: We observed that simultaneous addition of plerixafor and rituximab resulted in a significant decrease in DLBCL cellular proliferation, compared to monotherapeutic response. The effect was dose-dependent, and concomitant administration was observed to be superior to sequential drug administration. Accordingly, the fraction of apoptotic/dead cells significantly increased following addition of plerixafor to rituximab treatment. Furthermore, exposure of DLBCL cells to plerixafor resulted in a significant decrease in CXCR4 fluorescence intensity. CONCLUSIONS: Based on our results, implying that the anti-proliferative/pro-apoptotic effect of rituximab on DLBCL cells can be synergistically enhanced by the CXCR4 antagonist plerixafor, addition of plerixafor to the R-CHOP regimen can be suggested to improve treatment outcome for DLBCL patients.
27825152	A Porcine Urinary Bladder Matrix Does Not Recapitulate the Spatiotemporal Macrophage Response of Muscle Regeneration after Volumetric Muscle Loss Injury.	Volumetric muscle loss (VML) results in irrecoverable loss of muscle tissue making its repair challenging. VML repair with acellular extracellular matrix (ECM) scaffolds devoid of exogenous cells has shown improved muscle function, but limited de novo muscle fiber regeneration. On the other hand, studies using minced autologous and free autologous muscle grafts have reported appreciable muscle regeneration. This raises the fundamental question whether an acellular ECM scaffold can orchestrate the spatiotemporal cellular events necessary for appreciable muscle fiber regeneration. This study compares the macrophage and angiogenic responses including the remodeling outcomes of a commercially available porcine urinary bladder matrix, MatriStem, and autologous muscle grafts. The early heightened and protracted M1 response of the scaffold indicates that the scaffold does not recapitulate the spatiotemporal macrophage response of the autograft tissue. Additionally, the scaffold only supports limited de novo muscle fiber formation and regressing vessel density. Furthermore, scaffold remodeling is accompanied by increased presence of transforming growth factor and alpha-smooth muscle actin, which is consistent with remodeling of the scaffold into a fibrotic scar-like tissue. The limited muscle formation and scaffold-mediated fibrosis noted in this study corroborates the findings of recent studies that investigated acellular ECM scaffolds (devoid of myogenic cells) for VML repair. Taken together, acellular ECM scaffolds when used for VML repair will likely remodel into a fibrotic scar-like tissue and support limited de novo muscle fiber regeneration primarily in the proximity of the injured musculature.

26849553	Transcriptome Analysis of an Anthracnose-Resistant Tea Plant Cultivar Reveals Genes Associated with Resistance to Colletotrichum camelliae.	Tea plant breeding is a topic of great economic importance. However, disease remains a major cause of yield and quality losses. In this study, an anthracnose-resistant cultivar, ZC108, was developed. An infection assay revealed different responses to Colletotrichum sp. infection between ZC108 and its parent cultivar LJ43. ZC108 had greater resistance than LJ43 to Colletotrichum camelliae. Additionally, ZC108 exhibited earlier sprouting in the spring, as well as different leaf shape and plant architecture. Microarray data revealed that the genes that are differentially expressed between LJ43 and ZC108 mapped to secondary metabolism-related pathways, including phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, phenylalanine metabolism, and flavonoid biosynthesis pathways. In addition, genes involved in plant hormone biosynthesis and signaling as well as plant-pathogen interaction pathways were also changed. Quantitative real-time PCR was used to examine the expression of 27 selected genes in infected and uninfected tea plant leaves. Genes encoding a MADS-box transcription factor, NBS-LRR disease-resistance protein, and phenylpropanoid metabolism pathway components (CAD, CCR, POD, beta-glucosidase, ALDH and PAL) were among those differentially expressed in ZC108.
26851477	Anthropometric characteristics of female smallholder farmers of Uganda--Toward design of labor-saving tools.	Sub-Saharan African women on small-acreage farms carry a disproportionately higher labor burden, which is one of the main reasons they are unable to produce for both home and the market and realize higher incomes. Labor-saving interventions such as hand-tools are needed to save time and/or increase productivity in, for example, land preparation for crop and animal agriculture, post-harvest processing, and meeting daily energy and water needs. Development of such tools requires comprehensive and content-specific anthropometric data or body dimensions and existing databases based on Western women may be less relevant. We conducted measurements on 89 women to provide preliminary results toward answering two questions. First, how well existing databases are applicable in the design of hand-tools for sub-Saharan African women. Second, how universal body dimension predictive models are among ethnic groups. Our results show that, body dimensions between Bantu and Nilotic ethnolinguistic groups are different and both are different from American women. These results strongly support the need for establishing anthropometric databases for sub-Saharan African women, toward hand-tool design.
27480968	The Role of Tai Chi in Mental Health Management-Lessons Learned from Clinical Trials.	BACKGROUND: Many people seek alternative treatments to reduce stress and to manage anxiety. To counsel people appropriately, physicians need to understand current evidence and recognize both the value and defects in the facts. OBJECTIVE: To review the effect of Tai Chi interventions on improvement of mental health and to learn lessons from current evidence through various clinical studies. METHODS: A literature search was performed to identify research studies that assessed Tai Chi's mental health benefits. Selected studies were classified according to research design, outcome measures, and results. They were qualitatively assessed based on Tai Chi's significant influence on mental health in the areas of mood, stress, and anxiety level. RESULTS: After screening in citations that mentioned Tai Chi as an intervention, we found 21 clinical studies, all of which included at least one outcome measure of mental health or a testing system that included a mental health component. Our results show low evidence of recommending Tai Chi intervention to all patients who seek improvement in mental health despite that many positive effects of Tai Chi practice on mood and anxiety were found in different clinical trials. CONCLUSION: Considering the fact that Tai Chi is a gentle exercise, well suited for people with various physical capabilities, especially the elderly, health care providers may consider recommending it to people with mental health issues and seek alternative treatment besides routine medical care. Nonetheless, clinicians should be aware of the limitations due to incomplete understanding of Tai Chi as an intervention. Better evidence and stronger clinical trial designs are needed to further investigate Tai Chi's role in improving mental health.
26871278	Development of a liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry assay for the quantification of PM01183 (lurbinectedin), a novel antineoplastic agent, in mouse, rat, dog, Cynomolgus monkey and mini-pig plasma.	Lurbinectedin (PM01183) is a new synthetic tetrahydroisoquinoline alkaloid that binds to selected sequences in the minor groove of DNA, inducing PM01183-DNA adducts that stall replication, DNA repair and transcription and gives rise to double-strand breaks and finally, caspase-dependent apoptotic cell death. PM01183 has demonstrated clinical antitumor activity in platinum resistant/refractory ovarian cancer patients. A rapid and sensitive liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry assay was developed and validated to quantify PM01183 in plasma from nonclinical species. The bioanalysis consisted of a supported liquid extraction, followed by a gradient phase chromatography and, detection by positive ion electrospray tandem mass spectrometry. The calibration range for PM01183 was established using PM01183 standards from 0.1 to 100 ng/mL in blank plasma. The multiple reaction monitoring, based on the transition m/z 767.3-->273.0, was specific for PM01183, and that based on the transition m/z 771.4-->277.0 was specific for the internal standard (deuterated PM01183). No endogenous material interfered with the analysis of PM01183 and the internal standard from blank plasma. The limit of detection (LOD) of the assay was calculated as 0.025 ng/mL. The correlation coefficients for the calibration curves ranged from 0.9937 to 0.9987. The mean inter-day accuracies for all calibration standards ranged from 92 to 108% (</=8% bias), and the mean inter-day precision for calibration standards was always less than 12%. The mean intra and inter-day assay accuracy for all quality control replicates remained between 91 and 109%. The mean intra and inter-day assay precision was less than 10% for all QC levels. The method was validated to demonstrate the specificity, recovery, limit of quantification, accuracy and precision of measurements. The assay has been used to support preclinical pharmacokinetic and toxicokinetic studies of PM01183 in nonclinical species. The main PK parameters in dogs (3 male and 3 female, respectively) were calculated as follows: maximum concentration (Cmax, 12.9+/-0.6 and 10.2+/-3.0 ng/mL) and the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC, 24.9+/-0.7 and 22.6+/-6.1 ng h/mL). The results showed that plasma samples could be monitored for PM01183 for long enough to accurately estimate pharmacokinetics information.
27999618	Complex systems analysis of bladder cancer susceptibility reveals a role for decarboxylase activity in two genome-wide association studies.	BACKGROUND: Bladder cancer is common disease with a complex etiology that is likely due to many different genetic and environmental factors. The goal of this study was to embrace this complexity using a bioinformatics analysis pipeline designed to use machine learning to measure synergistic interactions between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in two genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and then to assess their enrichment within functional groups defined by Gene Ontology. The significance of the results was evaluated using permutation testing and those results that replicated between the two GWAS data sets were reported. RESULTS: In the first step of our bioinformatics pipeline, we estimated the pairwise synergistic effects of SNPs on bladder cancer risk in both GWAS data sets using Multifactor Dimensionality Reduction (MDR) machine learning method that is designed specifically for this purpose. Statistical significance was assessed using a 1000-fold permutation test. Each single SNP was assigned a p-value based on its strongest pairwise association. Each SNP was then mapped to one or more genes using a window of 500 kb upstream and downstream from each gene boundary. This window was chosen to capture as many regulatory variants as possible. Using Exploratory Visual Analysis (EVA), we then carried out a gene set enrichment analysis at the gene level to identify those genes with an overabundance of significant SNPs relative to the size of their mapped regions. Each gene was assigned to a biological functional group defined by Gene Ontology (GO). We next used EVA to evaluate the overabundance of significant genes in biological functional groups. Our study yielded one GO category, carboxy-lysase activity (GO:0016831), that was significant in analyses from both GWAS data sets. Interestingly, only the gamma-glutamyl carboxylase (GGCX) gene from this GO group was significant in both the detection and replication data, highlighting the complexity of the pathway-level effects on risk. The GGCX gene is expressed in the bladder, but has not been previously associated with bladder cancer in univariate GWAS. However, there is some experimental evidence that carboxy-lysase activity might play a role in cancer and that genes in this pathway should be explored as drug targets. This study provides a genetic basis for that observation. CONCLUSIONS: Our machine learning analysis of genetic associations in two GWAS for bladder cancer identified numerous associations with pairs of SNPs. Gene set enrichment analysis found aggregation of risk-associated SNPs in genes and significant genes in GO functional groups. This study supports a role for decarboxylase protein complexes in bladder cancer susceptibility. Previous research has implicated decarboxylases in bladder cancer etiology; however, the genes that we found to be significant in the detection and replication data are not known to have direct influence on bladder cancer, suggesting some novel hypotheses. This study highlights the need for a complex systems approach to the genetic and genomic analysis of common diseases such as cancer.
27299121	Chondroblastoma of the Medial Malleolus: A Case Report of A Rare Tumor at an Extremely Uncommon Site.	INTRODUCTION: Tumors of the medial malleolus are rare. Chondrogenic tumors of the medial malleolus are extremely rare. Chondroblastoma of the medial malleolus has not been reported previously in the English literature. The purpose is to present a rare tumor occurring at an unusual site and its successful management. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of a 30 years old female with chondroblastoma of the medial malleolus with its clinical features, radiographic features, differential diagnosis, and management at an unusual site. Treatment comprised of an open biopsy followed by aggressive curettage, phenolization and bone cement. Symptoms resolved after treatment with resumption of normal activities and no signs of recurrence at 1 year follow-up. CONCLUSION: This case appears to be the first reported case of chondroblastoma occurring at medial malleolus. The present case report will increase the awareness of this rare tumor occurring at this unusual site thereby avoiding any chance of misdiagnosis.
27279955	The prevalence of hepatitis B virus infection in Nigerian children prior to vaccine introduction into the National Programme on Immunization schedule.	INTRODUCTION: Hepatitis B virus infection is a major global health problem of public health importance. In a bid to control the infection, the Nigerian government in 2004 introduced hepatitis B vaccine into the National Program on Immunization. There are no studies on the prevalence of hepatitis B in adolescent prior to 2004. The study was aimed at determining the seroprevalence and predictors of viral Hepatitis B in Nigerian children aged 11-19 years. METHODS: A cross sectional analytical study was conducted in July 2014. Multi-staged sampling technique was used to select 749 children from six secondary schools in Calabar, Cross River State, Nigeria. Ethical clearance was obtained from the Cross River State Medical Ethical Committee. A validated structured interviewer administered questionnaire was used to obtain information from participants following parental consent. Blood samples were obtained for qualitative detection of HBsAg using rapid chromatographic immunoassays with test kits from ABON (China) having sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of >99%, 97% and 98.5% respectively. Data was analyzed using SPSS version 20.2. RESULTS: Nine of the749 students screened were positive for HBsAg giving an overall prevalence of 1.2%. The sex specific prevalence was 0.8% for males and 1.8% for females. After multivariate analysis, age was the predictor of hepatitis B infection (OR 3.92; 95% CI 1.22-12.63; p-value 0.02). CONCLUSION: The prevalence of HBV infection was low. Despite the low prevalence, the introduction of the vaccine is justifiable in view of the public health importance of the infection.
26925690	Cancers among South-East Asian Nationals in Brunei Darussalam.	BACKGROUND: Worldwide, the incidence of cancers is increasing and is becoming a major public health issue, including those in the Asia Pacific region. South-East Asia is a region with diverse populations with different disease spectra. This study looked at the spectrum of cancers among South-East Asians working in Brunei Darussalam. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The cancer registry from 1994 to 2012 maintained by the State Laboratory was retrospectively reviewed. Crude incidence rates were calculated based on the population census of 2010. RESULTS: Altogether, there was a total of 418 cancer cases diagnosed among South-East Asians, giving an incidence of 5.1% (n=418/8,253). The affected nationals in decreasing frequency were Malaysians (53.1%), followed by Filipinos (25.8%), Indonesians (15.3%), Thais (3.8%), Myanmese (1.7%) and Vietnamese (0.2%) with no recorded cases for Singapore and the People's Republic of Laos. The overall mean age of diagnosis was 46.1+/-4.2 years old, with an increasing trend over the years (p<0.05 ANOVA). The overall gender ratio was 42.3:57.7 (male:female), more females among the Filipinos and Indonesians, more males among the Thais, and equal representation among the Malaysians and the Myanmese. The most common were cancers of the digestive system (19.9%), followed by female reproductive/gynecologic system (16.0%), breast (15.6%), hematological/lymphatic (12.0%) and head/neck (8.1%). There were differences in the prevalence of cancers among the various nationalities with highest crude incidence rate among the Myanmese (141.2/100,000), followed by the Malaysian (88.5/100,000), and the Filipinos (40.6/100,000) and the lowest among the Thais (18.4/100,000), Indonesians (10.5/100,000) and the Vietnamese (6.3/100,000). CONCLUSIONS: Cancers among South-East Asian residing in Brunei Darussalam accounted for 5.1% of all cancers. The most common cancers were cancers of the digestive, gynecologic/female reproductive system and breast with certain types slowly increasing in proportions. There mean age of diagnoses was increasing.
26885527	Lifestyle Interventions to Prevent Type 2 Diabetes: A Systematic Review of Economic Evaluation Studies.	Objective. To summarize key findings of economic evaluations of lifestyle interventions for the primary prevention of type 2 diabetes (T2D) in high-risk subjects. Methods. We conducted a systematic review of peer-reviewed original studies published since January 2009 in English, French, and Spanish. Eligible studies were identified through relevant databases including PubMed, Medline, National Health Services Economic Evaluation, CINHAL, EconLit, Web of sciences, EMBASE, and the Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature. Studies targeting obesity were also included. Data were extracted using a standardized method. The BMJ checklist was used to assess study quality. The heterogeneity of lifestyle interventions precluded a meta-analysis. Results. Overall, 20 studies were retained, including six focusing on obesity control. Seven were conducted within trials and 13 using modeling techniques. T2D prevention by physical activity or diet or both proved cost-effective according to accepted thresholds, except for five inconclusive studies, three on diabetes prevention and two on obesity control. Most studies exhibited limitations in reporting results, primarily with regard to generalizability and justification of selected sensitivity parameters. Conclusion. This confirms that lifestyle interventions for the primary prevention of diabetes are cost-effective. Such interventions should be further promoted as sound investment in the fight against diabetes.
28352821	Role of Laparoscopic Splenectomy in Elderly Immune Thrombocytopenia.	The management of older patients with chronic primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is still very challenging because of the fragility of older patients who frequently have severe comorbidities and/or disabilities. Corticosteroid-based first-line therapies fail in most of the cases and patients require a second-line treatment, choosing between rituximab, thrombopoietin-receptor agonists and splenectomy. The choice of the best treatment in elderly patients is a compromise between effectiveness and safety and laparoscopic splenectomy may be a good option with a complete remission rate of 67% at 60 months. But relapse and complication rates remain higher than in younger splenectomized ITP patients because elderly patients undergo splenectomy with unfavorable conditions (age >60 year-old, presence of comorbidities, or multiple previous treatments) which negatively influence the outcome, regardless the hematological response. For these reasons, a good management of concomitant diseases and the option to not use the splenectomy as the last possible treatment could improve the outcome of old splenectomized patients.
27667933	Sumakuru, a deeply-diverging new genus of lyssomanine jumping spiders from Ecuador (Araneae: Salticidae).	The lyssomanine jumping spider genus Sumakuru gen. n. is here described for Sumakuru bigal sp. n., from the Bigal River Biological Reserve in Ecuador. Known from a single male, the embolus of the palp takes the form of a smoothly arching curve, and appears fully mobile, being connected to the tegulum by a thin sclerite and a twisted hematodocha. Data from four gene regions (28S, 16SND1, CO1, wingless) indicate that Sumakuru is the sister group to all other sampled lyssomanines, diverging deeply on the stem lineage of the clade of other known lyssomanines. Unlike previous molecular results, the sampled species of Lyssomanes Hentz, 1845 are supported as monophyletic, with Chinoscopus Simon, 1900 as the sister to Lyssomanes.
27445757	Corticostriatal Dysfunction in Huntington's Disease: The Basics.	The main input to the basal ganglia, the corticostriatal pathway, shows some of the earliest signs of neuropathology in Huntington's disease (HD), an inherited neurodegenerative condition that typically strikes in mid-life with progressively deteriorating cognitive, emotional, and motor symptoms. Although an effective treatment remains elusive, research on transgenic animal models has implicated dysregulation of glutamate (Glu), the excitatory amino acid released by corticostriatal neurons, in HD onset. Abnormalities in the control of Glu transmission at the level of postsynaptic receptors and Glu transport proteins play a critical role in the loss of information flow through downstream circuits that set the stage for the HD behavioral phenotype. Parallel but less-well characterized changes in dopamine (DA), a key modulator of Glu activation, ensure further deficits in neuronal communication throughout the basal ganglia. Continued analysis of corticostriatal Glu transmission and its modulation by DA, including analysis at the neurobehavioral level in transgenic models, is likely to be an effective strategy in the pursuit of HD therapeutics.
27008807	PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATION OF NORMOGLYCEMIC, ANTI-HYPERGLYCEMIC AND DYSLIPIDEMIC ACTIVITIES OF DIFFERENT EXTRACTS OF TINOSPORA CRISPA ON DIABETIC RAT.	Tinospora crispa is an indigenous medicinal plant belonging to Menispermaceae family, known localy as "akar patawali" or as "akar seruntum". Different parts of this plant are used for various therapeutic purposes for treatment of hypertension, stimulation of appetite, protection from mosquito bites and to treat ailments like jaundice, wounds, intestinal worms and skin infections, tooth and stomach aches, coughs, asthma and pleurisy. The stems were washed, dried, pulverized using Wiley Laboratory Mill apparatus and stored in dry air-tight plastic containers until use. Then, they were extracted successively with petroleum ether, chloroform, methanol and finally with water by maceration. The solvent was evaporated from each extract (using rotary evaporator), dried extract were stored at -4 degrees C until used. Animals were randomly divided into six groups and each group having 6 animals for two sets of experiments. In the first test, healthy rats were treated orally with the plant extracts (1 g/kg) suspended in Tween 80. In the second test, the diabetic rats were fasted overnight. The test groups of 6 diabetic rats were treated orally with extracts of Tinospora crispa (1 g/kg), glibenclamide (10 mg/kg) and 10% Tween 80, (10 mL/kg), respectively. In these results, there was no significant effect on blood glucose levels in normal rats treated with different extracts of Tinospora crispa. The water extract of Tinospora crispa decreased the glucose levels in diabetic rats and has the ability to reduce lipid profile in diabetic rats as compared to control diabetic rats.
26975974	Inborn Errors of Metabolism.	Inborn errors of metabolism are single gene disorders resulting from the defects in the biochemical pathways of the body. Although these disorders are individually rare, collectively they account for a significant portion of childhood disability and deaths. Most of the disorders are inherited as autosomal recessive whereas autosomal dominant and X-linked disorders are also present. The clinical signs and symptoms arise from the accumulation of the toxic substrate, deficiency of the product, or both. Depending on the residual activity of the deficient enzyme, the initiation of the clinical picture may vary starting from the newborn period up until adulthood. Hundreds of disorders have been described until now and there has been a considerable clinical overlap between certain inborn errors. Resulting from this fact, the definite diagnosis of inborn errors depends on enzyme assays or genetic tests. Especially during the recent years, significant achievements have been gained for the biochemical and genetic diagnosis of inborn errors. Techniques such as tandem mass spectrometry and gas chromatography for biochemical diagnosis and microarrays and next-generation sequencing for the genetic diagnosis have enabled rapid and accurate diagnosis. The achievements for the diagnosis also enabled newborn screening and prenatal diagnosis. Parallel to the development the diagnostic methods; significant progress has also been obtained for the treatment. Treatment approaches such as special diets, enzyme replacement therapy, substrate inhibition, and organ transplantation have been widely used. It is obvious that by the help of the preclinical and clinical research carried out for inborn errors, better diagnostic methods and better treatment approaches will high likely be available.
28025436	The clinical and systemic effects of periodontal treatment in diabetic and non-diabetic obese patients.	The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the response to periodontal management in obese individuals with poorly controlled diabetes mellitus (DM) and obese individuals without DM. Changes in clinical and biochemical parameters were also investigated. Seventeen obese patients with poorly controlled DM and 14 obese non-DM patients with generalized chronic periodontitis were enrolled. The anthropometric measurements, periodontal parameters, and serum levels of lipid (triglyceride, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol) and glucose (fasting plasma glucose [FPG], insulin, insulin resistance [IR], hemoglobin [Hb]A1c) metabolism, pro-inflammatory mediators (high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, tumor necrosis factor-alpha [TNF-alpha] and Pentraxim-3), and interleukin-6 were measured before and at 3 months, and 6 months after full-mouth scaling and root planing (FM-SRP) together with full-mouth disinfection (FMD). A significant reduction in TNF-alpha (P < 0.001) values was observed in both groups following periodontal healing. However, significant changes in FPG (P < 0.05), HbA1C (P < 0.05), and the homeostasis model assessment of IR (HOMA-IR; P < 0.05) were only observed after 3 months in the DM group. Our findings suggest that obesity with or without DM does not seem to be a modifying factor for the clinical outcome of FM-SRP and FMD.(J Oral Sci 58, 523-531, 2016).
27000733	Cord blood versus haploidentical stem cell transplantation for hematological malignancies.	Umbilical cord blood (UCB) and haploidentical donor stem cell sources represent common alternative donor strategies used when a matched sibling donor (MRD) or matched unrelated donor (MUD) is not available for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Both donor sources require less stringent human leukocyte antigen (HLA) matching and thereby increase the donor pool for patients without a complete HLA-matched donor. Although a randomized trial comparing these donor sources is ongoing, currently available comparisons rely on observational data and small phase II trials. In hematologic malignancies, both donor sources offer the chance of eradicating disease, albeit with different results for engraftment time, graft failure, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), transplant-related mortality (TRM), and relapse risk. This review focuses on comparing those outcomes and providing clinicians with evidence to help guide the decision between these alternative donor sources.
27635334	Investigation of population structure in Gulf of Mexico Seepiophila jonesi (Polychaeta, Siboglinidae) using cross-amplified microsatellite loci.	BACKGROUND: Vestimentiferan tubeworms are some of the most recognizable fauna found at deep-sea cold seeps, isolated environments where hydrocarbon rich fluids fuel biological communities. Several studies have investigated tubeworm population structure; however, much is still unknown about larval dispersal patterns at Gulf of Mexico (GoM) seeps. As such, researchers have applied microsatellite markers as a measure for documenting the transport of vestimentiferan individuals. In the present study, we investigate the utility of microsatellites to be cross-amplified within the escarpiid clade of seep vestimentiferans, by determining if loci originally developed for Escarpia spp. could be amplified in the GoM seep tubeworm, Seepiophila jonesi. Additionally, we determine if cross-amplified loci can reliably uncover the same signatures of high gene flow seen in a previous investigation of S. jonesi. METHODS: Seventy-seven S. jonesi individuals were collected from eight seep sites across the upper Louisiana slope (<1,000 m) in the GoM. Forty-eight microsatellite loci that were originally developed for Escarpia laminata (18 loci) and Escarpia southwardae (30 loci) were tested to determine if they were homologous and polymorphic in S. jonesi. Loci found to be both polymorphic and of high quality were used to test for significant population structuring in S. jonesi. RESULTS: Microsatellite pre-screening identified 13 (27%) of the Escarpia loci were homologous and polymorphic in S. jonesi, revealing that microsatellites can be amplified within the escarpiid clade of vestimentiferans. Our findings uncovered low levels of heterozygosity and a lack of genetic differentiation amongst S. jonesi from various sites and regions, in line with previous investigations that employed species-specific polymorphic loci on S. jonesi individuals retrieved from both the same and different seep sites. The lack of genetic structure identified from these populations supports the presence of significant gene flow via larval dispersal in mixed oceanic currents. DISCUSSION: The ability to develop "universal" microsatellites reduces the costs associated with these analyses and allows researchers to track and investigate a wider array of taxa, which is particularly useful for organisms living at inaccessible locations such as the deep sea. Our study highlights that non-species specific microsatellites can be amplified across large evolutionary distances and still yield similar findings as species-specific loci. Further, these results show that S. jonesi collected from various localities in the GoM represents a single panmictic population, suggesting that dispersal of lecithotrophic larvae by deep sea currents is sufficient to homogenize populations. These data are consistent with the high levels of gene flow seen in Escarpia spp., which advocates that differences in microhabitats of seep localities lead to variation in biogeography of separate species.
27637819	Using focus groups to identify characteristics of an ideal work environment for Advanced Practice Clinicians.	Advanced Practice Clinicians (APCs) in collaborative practice represent a diverse and valuable group of health care professionals, including nurse practitioners, physician assistants, nurse anesthetists, and nurse midwives. Because these healthcare professionals have been identified as part of the solution to physician shortages, it is critical for health networks to examine and address issues affecting collaborative relationships. We invited our network APCs to participate in focus group sessions to determine both attributes and barriers to an ideal work environment. Four major themes emerged: (1) compensation, (2) network representation, (3) employment structure, and (4) workplace culture. While issues relating to compensation and representation were prevalent, discussions also revealed the importance of relationships and communication. To ensure successful collaboration and, thereby, reduce clinician turnover, leaders must address gaps between the existing and ideal states in structural factors affecting job satisfaction (Themes 1-3) as well as the behavioral factors represented in workplace culture (Theme 4).
26989827	Documenting the Effects of Armed Conflict on Population Health.	War and other forms of armed conflict have profound adverse effects on population health. It is important to document these effects to inform the general public and policy makers about the consequences of armed conflict, provide services to meet the needs of affected populations, protect human rights and document violations of international humanitarian law, and help to prevent future armed conflict. Documentation can be accomplished with surveillance, epidemiological surveys, and rapid assessment. Challenges include inadequate or absent data systems, social breakdown, forced migration, reporting biases, and the fog of war. The adverse effects of the Iraq War on population health demonstrate how the effects of armed conflict on population health can be documented. We recommend the establishment of an independent mechanism, operated by the United Nations or a multilateral organization, to investigate and document the effects of armed conflict on population health.
27005495	Biological evaluation and molecular docking of some chromenyl-derivatives as potential antimicrobial agents.	Various thiosemicarbazones (TSCs) and their heterocyclic thiadiazolines (TDZ) possess important biological effects. In addition, chromenyl derivatives exhibit a wide range of pharmacological activities. Based on these findings and as a continuation of our research on nitrogen and sulfur containing compounds, we investigated a series of previously reported chromenyl-TSCs (1a-j) and chromenyl-TDZs (2a-j) for their in vitro antimicrobial activities against two bacterial and four fungal strains. MIC and MBC/MFC (microg/mL) values of these compounds were evaluated and compared to those of Spectinomycin, Moxifloxacin and Fluconazole, used as reference drugs. For a better understanding of the drug-receptor interactions, all the compounds were further subjected to molecular docking against four targets that were chosen based on the specific mechanism of action of the reference drugs used in the antimicrobial screening. All compounds tested showed equal or higher antibacterial/antifungal activities relative to the used reference drugs. In silico studies (molecular docking) revealed that all the investigated compounds showed good binding energies towards four receptor protein targets and supported their antimicrobial properties.

27907020	Comparing Facebook Users and Facebook Non-Users: Relationship between Personality Traits and Mental Health Variables - An Exploratory Study.	Over one billion people use Facebook as a platform for social interaction and self-presentation making it one of the most popular online sites. The aim of the present study was to investigate differences in various personality traits and mental health variables between Facebook users and people who do not use this platform. The data of 945 participants (790 Facebook users, 155 Facebook non-users) were collected. Results indicate that Facebook users score significantly higher on narcissism, self-esteem and extraversion than Facebook non-users. Furthermore, they have significantly higher values of social support, life satisfaction and subjective happiness. Facebook non-users have (marginally) significantly higher values of depression symptoms than Facebook users. In both groups, extraversion, self-esteem, happiness, life satisfaction, resilience and social support, on the one hand, and depression, anxiety and stress symptoms, on the other hand, are negatively correlated. Neuroticism is positively associated with depression, anxiety and stress symptoms. However, significant differences exist between Facebook users and Facebook non-users regarding some associations of personality traits and mental health variables. Compared to Facebook non-users, the present results indicate that Facebook users have higher values of certain personality traits and positive variables protecting mental health. These findings are of particular interest considering the high importance of social online-platforms in the daily life of many people.
27386591	[A choice of a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug with regard to gastrointestinal and cardiovascular' risks].	NSAIDs are effective drugs among analgesics and antiinflammatory drugs used widely in clinical practice. It is important to emphasize that the range of users of NSAIDs in population are patients with chronic disorders of the joints and spine. However,when prescribing NSAIDs one should consider risk factors of side-effects not only from the gastrointestinal tract, but cardiovascular events as well. The potential negative risks of using NSAIDs promote an active research on creation of ne...y medicinal substances which are able to minimize NSAID-induced complications. The use of oxide-nitrogen-associated NSAIDs, in particular amtolmetin guacil1in patients with risk factors of side-effects from the gastrointestinal tract and cardiovascular system seems to be promising.It is noted that amtolmetin guacil has balanced analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects and is well tolerated.
27434060	Genetic Homogeneity Revealed Using SCoT, ISSR and RAPD Markers in Micropropagated Pittosporum eriocarpum Royle- An Endemic and Endangered Medicinal Plant.	Pittosporum eriocarpum Royle, a medicinally important taxon, is endemic to Uttarakhand region of Himalaya. It has become endangered due to over-collection and the loss of habitats. As raising plants through seeds in this plant is problematic, a reliable protocol for micropropagation using nodal explants has been developed. High shoot regeneration (95%) occurred in MS medium augmented with BA 0.4mg/l in combination IBA 0.6mg/l. In vitro regenerated shoots were rooted in MS medium supplemented with three auxins, of which 0.6 mg/l indole butyric acid proved to be the best for rooting (90%) with maximum number of roots per shoot. Thereafter, rooted plants were hardened and nearly 73% of rooted shoots were successfully acclimatized and established in the field. Start codon targeted (SCoT), inter simple sequence repeats (ISSR) and random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers were used to validate the genetic homogeneity amongst nine in vitro raised plantlets with mother plant. DNA fingerprints of in vitro regenerated plantlets displayed monomorphic bands similar to mother plant, indicating homogeneity among the micropropagated plants with donor mother plant. The similarity values were calculated based on SCoT, ISSR and RAPD profiles which ranged from 0.89 to 1.00, 0.91 to 1.00 and 0.95 to 1.00 respectively. The dendrograms generated through Unweighted Pair Group Method with arithmetic mean (UPGMA) analysis revealed 97% similarity amongst micropropagated plants with donor mother plant, thus confirming genetic homogeneity of micropropagated clones. This is the first report on micropropagation and genetic homogeneity assessment of P. eriocarpum. The protocol would be useful for the conservation and large scale production of P. eriocarpum to meet the demand for medicinal formulations and also for the re-introduction of in vitro grown plants in the suitable natural habitats to restore the populations.
27586422	Isolation of Pancreatic Islets from Nonhuman Primates.	Nonhuman primates (NHP) constitute a highly relevant pre-clinical animal model to develop strategies for beta cell replacement. The close phylogenetic and immunologic relationship between NHP and humans results in cross-reactivity of various biological agents with NHP cells, as well as a very similar cytoarchitecture between islets from human and NHP that is strikingly different from that observed in rodent islets. The composition and location of endocrine cells in human or NHP islets, randomly distributed and associated with blood vessels, have functional consequences and a predisposition for paracrine interactions. Furthermore, translation of approaches that proved successful in rodent models to the clinic has been limited. Consequently, data collected from NHP studies can form the basis for an IND submission to the FDA. This chapter describes in detail the key aspects for isolation of islets from NHP, from organ procurement up to assessment of islet function, comparing and emphasizing the similarities between isolation procedures for human and NHP islets.
28169769	Hospice nurses' emotional challenges in their encounters with the dying.	The purpose of this study was to explore nurses' emotional challenges when caring for the dying in hospices. The study has a qualitative design, and knowledge was developed through a dialectical exchange between theory and data. Ten individual in-depth interviews were conducted with nurses recruited from two hospices in Denmark. Although all of the nurses said that they experienced emotional challenges or felt emotionally touched during their work, the study found a variety of opinions related to the extent to which their emotional reactions should be revealed in their role as a hospice professional. The participants described their emotional challenges as being simultaneously draining and enriching experiences leading to personal and professional growth and development. The study may contribute to increased awareness of emotional challenges for hospice nurses, which involve continuous reflection and balancing between meeting the dying as a human being and meeting the dying as a hospice professional.
27691992	EARLY COST-EFFECTIVENESS ANALYSIS OF NEW MEDICAL TESTS: RESPONSE.	As strong advocates and adopters of early cost-effectiveness modeling for test evaluation, we were excited to see the recent article "The Early Bird Catches the Worm: Early Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of New Medical Tests," in which Buisman and colleagues present a succinct and generalizable framework for conducting this type of analysis. The authors have done an excellent job in identifying and summarizing the key components of this methodology, as well as highlighting fundamental differences between early analyses versus the traditional late-stage approach. As the number of medical tests coming to market continues to grow, there is an ever growing need to develop rigorous methodology in this area, and we commend the authors for this timely work.
27151697	Postmenopausal osteoporosis - clinical, biological and histopathological aspects.	Osteoporosis is one of the most common disorders in postmenopausal women, affecting the quality of life and increasing the risk for fractures in minor traumas. Changes in the bone microarchitecture causes static changes in the body and affects motility. In this study, we analyzed two groups of women, one with physiological menopause and one with surgically induced menopause. The diagnosis of osteoporosis was suspected based on the clinical symptoms and confirmed by assessing bone mineral density by the dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA). Comparing some clinical and biological aspects there was noted that a much higher percentage of women with surgically induced menopause exhibited increases in body mass index, changes in serum lipids, cholesterol, triglycerides, blood glucose, serum calcium, magnesemia and osteocalcin. In contrast, no significant differences were observed in the histopathological aspects of bone tissue examined from these two groups. In all patients, there was identified a significant reduction in the number of osteocytes and osteoblasts, the expansion of haversian channels, reducing the number of trabecular bone in the cancellous bone with wide areola cavities often full of adipose tissue, non-homogenous demineralization of both the compact bone and the cancellous bone, atrophy and even absence of the endosteal, and the presence of multiple microfractures. Our study showed that early surgically induced menopause more intensely alters the lipid, carbohydrate and mineral metabolism, thus favoring the onset of osteoporosis.
27029450	[Diagnosis and treatment of psychogenic dizziness in patients with arterial hypertension].	OBJECTIVE: To analyze the prevalence, methods of diagnosis and treatment of psychogenic dizziness in patients with arterial hypertension and evaluate the efficacy of treatment with noophen and betahistin. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Fifty-eight patients were studied. Patients of the main group received noophen and patients of the comparison group were treated with betahistin. Treatment efficacy was assessed on days 1 and 60 by the scores on VAS, HARS, MFI-20 scales. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The prevalence of psychogenic dizziness in patients with arterial hypertension was 47%. Noophen in dose 500 mg/day significantly (p<0.001) reduced the severity of dizziness, anxiety, asthenia, and headache compared to baseline and to the efficacy of betahistin as well. The drug showed good tolerability.
27200370	Improve the Anaerobic Biodegradability by Copretreatment of Thermal Alkali and Steam Explosion of Lignocellulosic Waste.	Effective alteration of the recalcitrance properties like crystallization of cellulose, lignin shield, and interlinking of lignocellulosic biomass is an ideal way to utilize the full-scale potential for biofuel production. This study exhibited three different pretreatment effects to enhance the digestibility of corn stover (CS) for methane production. In this context, steam explosion (SE) and thermal potassium hydroxide (KOH-60 degrees C) treated CS produced the maximal methane yield of 217.5 and 243.1 mL/gvs, which were 40.0% and 56.4% more than untreated CS (155.4 mL/gvs), respectively. Copretreatment of thermal potassium hydroxide and steam explosion (CPTPS) treated CS was highly significant among all treatments and improved 88.46% (292.9 mL/gvs) methane yield compared with untreated CS. Besides, CPTPS also achieved the highest biodegradability up to 68.90%. Three kinetic models very well simulated dynamics of methane production yield. Moreover, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses declared the most effective changes in physicochemical properties after CPTPS pretreatment. Thus, CPTPS might be a promising approach to deconstructing the recalcitrance of lignocellulosic structure to improve the biodegradability for AD.
27446813	YopN and TyeA Hydrophobic Contacts Required for Regulating Ysc-Yop Type III Secretion Activity by Yersinia pseudotuberculosis.	Yersinia bacteria target Yop effector toxins to the interior of host immune cells by the Ysc-Yop type III secretion system. A YopN-TyeA heterodimer is central to controlling Ysc-Yop targeting activity. A + 1 frameshift event in the 3-prime end of yopN can also produce a singular secreted YopN-TyeA polypeptide that retains some regulatory function even though the C-terminal coding sequence of this YopN differs greatly from wild type. Thus, this YopN C-terminal segment was analyzed for its role in type III secretion control. Bacteria producing YopN truncated after residue 278, or with altered sequence between residues 279 and 287, had lost type III secretion control and function. In contrast, YopN variants with manipulated sequence beyond residue 287 maintained full control and function. Scrutiny of the YopN-TyeA complex structure revealed that residue W279 functioned as a likely hydrophobic contact site with TyeA. Indeed, a YopN W279G mutant lost all ability to bind TyeA. The TyeA residue F8 was also critical for reciprocal YopN binding. Thus, we conclude that specific hydrophobic contacts between opposing YopN and TyeA termini establishes a complex needed for regulating Ysc-Yop activity.
27395866	A new species of Tricholabiodes Radoszkowski, 1885 (Hymenoptera: Mutillidae) from Saudi Arabia.	A new species, Tricholabiodes aldryhimi Soliman, sp. nov., with a posteromesal bifurcal sessile process on the third metasomal sternum is described and illustrated from Najd Region, Saudi Arabia. The new species looks like T. brothersi Lelej, 2010 in having a bifurcal process on S3 but differs from it mainly in colour and the shape of the genitalia.
27575485	The Molecular Mechanisms of the Antibacterial Effect of Picosecond Laser Generated Silver Nanoparticles and Their Toxicity to Human Cells.	Silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) are known to have antibacterial properties. They are commonly produced by chemical synthesis which involves the use of harmful reducing agents. Contras, the laser technique is able to generate high-purity Ag NPs in water with specified surface charge characteristics. In the past, the molecular mechanisms contributing to the bactericidal effects of Ag NPs have been investigated extensively, but little is known of the antibacterial and toxic effects and mechanisms involved in laser-generated Ag NPs. In the current study Ag NPs were generated by picosecond laser ablation. Their antibacterial activity was determined on the gram-negative bacteria E. coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and the gram positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus including the methicillin resistant strain MRSA. Results showed that the laser generated Ag NPs exhibited strong dose-dependent antibacterial activity against all the three bacterial strains tested. Using E.coli as a model system, the laser Ag NPs treatment induced significantly high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS). These ROS did not include detectable hydroxyl radicals, suggesting for the first time the selective ROS induction in bacterial cells by laser generated Ag NPs. The increased ROS was accompanied by significantly reduced cellular glutathione, and increased lipid peroxidation and permeability, suggesting ROS related bacterial cell damage. The laser generated Ag NPs exhibited low toxicity (within 72 hours) to five types of human cells although a weak significant decrease in cell survival was observed for endothelial cells and the lung cells. We conclude that picosecond laser generated Ag NPs have a broad spectrum of antibacterial effects against microbes including MRSA with minimal human cell toxicity. The oxidative stress is likely the key mechanism underlying the bactericidal effect, which leads to lipid peroxidation, depletion of glutathione, DNA damages and eventual disintegration of the cell membrane.
27774455	DTI Image Registration under Probabilistic Fiber Bundles Tractography Learning.	Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) image registration is an essential step for diffusion tensor image analysis. Most of the fiber bundle based registration algorithms use deterministic fiber tracking technique to get the white matter fiber bundles, which will be affected by the noise and volume. In order to overcome the above problem, we proposed a Diffusion Tensor Imaging image registration method under probabilistic fiber bundles tractography learning. Probabilistic tractography technique can more reasonably trace to the structure of the nerve fibers. The residual error estimation step in active sample selection learning is improved by modifying the residual error model using finite sample set. The calculated deformation field is then registered on the DTI images. The results of our proposed registration method are compared with 6 state-of-the-art DTI image registration methods under visualization and 3 quantitative evaluation standards. The experimental results show that our proposed method has a good comprehensive performance.
27123435	Family fun or cultural free-for-all? A critique of the 2015 National Football League Super Bowl commercials.	BACKGROUND: The purpose of this cross-sectional study was to enumerate and describe violent and risky behaviors as well as other general health behaviors exhibited in the advertisements during the National Football League (NFL) Super Bowl 2015. METHODS: Commercials during the NFL Super Bowl 2015 were assessed for violent and risky behaviors. Additional health behaviors were indicated such as the advertisement of unhealthy food, promotion of physical activity, and sexual content. RESULTS: A total of 110 commercials were documented, accounting for 64 minutes of broadcast time. Commercials promoting automobiles, television shows, food, and movies were the most prevalent, representing just over half (53.7%) of all of the advertisements featured. Depictions of unsafe driving were found in 10.9% (n = 12) of the commercials. All 12 commercials contained some sort of risky or wild driving behavior, and speeding was observed in 11 of the 12 commercials. A total of 32 (29.1%) of the commercials were coded as including violent content.Physical activity behavior was present in 3 (2.7%) of the commercials. Conversely, substance use was observed in 3 (2.7%) of the commercials, none of which included health promotion messaging. Of the 110 commercials aired during the 2015 Super Bowl, 12.7% (n = 14) included sexual content. CONCLUSION: Parents should consider the possibility that their children may observe acts of violence or conflicting safety messages during commercial breaks.
27976788	[Delayed diagnosis in a patient with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in a psychiatric hospital].	A 51-year-old female teacher of dance was referred to the diagnostic unit of our psychiatric hospital with symptoms of anxiety and depression. The clinical image was suggestive of organic pathology, but this could not be determined with certainty until a late stage. We discuss the course of the patient's illness. Her symptoms appeared to be psychiatric and closely resembled those of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. We comment on some of the signs that could have led to an earlier diagnosis and we discuss the tools that are needed.
27227161	Factors Associated With Condom Breakage During Anal Intercourse: A Cross-Sectional Study of Men Who Have Sex With Men Recruited in an Online Survey.	BACKGROUND: Within the United States, HIV affects men who have sex with men (MSM) disproportionally compared to the general population. In 2011, MSM represented nearly two-thirds of all new HIV infections while representing less than 2% of the US male population. Condoms continue to be the foundation of many HIV prevention programs; however, the failure rate of condoms during anal intercourse among MSM is estimated to be 0.5% to 8%, and condom breakages leave those affected at high risk for HIV transmission. OBJECTIVE: Estimate the frequency of condom breakage and associated demographic and behavioral factors during last act of anal intercourse using data from a national online HIV prevention survey of MSM. METHODS: From March 19 to April 16, 2009, data were collected on 9005 MSM through an online survey of US MSM recruited through a social networking site. Using multivariable logistic regression and controlling for several demographic and sexual risk behaviors, we estimated odds ratios of the association between condom breakage and several risk factors. RESULTS: In the study, 8063 participants reported having at least one male sexual partner in the last 12 months. The median age of participants was 21 years (range 18-65). More than two-thirds (68.2%, 5498/8063) reported anal intercourse during last sex and 16.90% (927/5498) reported using a condom during last anal intercourse act. Condom breakage was reported by 4.4% (28/635) participants who engaged in receptive anal intercourse and 3.5% (16/459) participants who engaged in insertive anal intercourse, with an overall failure rate of 4.0% (95% CI 3.2%-6.0%). Age (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] per 5 years: 0.53 (95% CI 0.30-0.94), number of male sex partners (aOR per 5 sex partners: 1.03 (95% CI 1.00-1.08), and being high or buzzed during sex with a casual sex partner (aOR: 3.14, 95% CI 1.02-9.60) were associated with condom breakage. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate condom breakage is an important problem for MSM that may be more common for younger men, for men with more partners, and during sex with casual partners after alcohol consumption or drug use. A better understanding of why condom breakage occurs more often in these groups is needed to improve educational efforts. Further, during this time of expanded interest in new condom designs, consideration should be given to how condom design might minimize breakage during anal sex.
27242441	Anti-GAD65 Containing Cerebrospinal Fluid Does not Alter GABAergic Transmission.	Glutamic acid decarboxylase of 65 kDa (GAD65) antibodies have been reported in a variety of neurological disorders such as stiff-person syndrome (SPS), sporadic ataxia and some cases of epilepsy. Since the target is believed to be the cytoplasmic enzyme GAD65, the key enzyme of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) synthesis, the pathophysiological role of these antibodies is poorly understood. Here, we stereotactically injected human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) containing GAD65-antibodies into the hippocampus of rats in vivo and then prepared hippocampal slices 1-2 days after post-operative recovery. We characterized both evoked and spontaneous GABAergic transmission in vitro using sharp microelectrode and patch-clamp recordings in CA1 neurons. Intracellular recordings with sharp microelectrodes from CA1 neurons showed that evoked GABAAR- or GABABR-mediated inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSP) remained unaltered in anti-GAD65 tissue. These results were confirmed with patch-clamp recordings showing no difference in evoked gabazine-sensitive inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs). In addition, spontaneous IPSCs also showed no difference between anti-GAD65 tissue and controls with respect to the mean frequency, the mean amplitude and the sIPSC distribution. In conclusion, stereotactic injection of GAD65-antibodies into the hippocampus leaves evoked and spontaneous GABAergic synaptic transmission intact. Hence, dysfunction of the inhibitory GABAergic system does not appear to be the major mechanism of epileptogenicity in this disease.
27017160	Resection of colorectal liver metastases and extra-hepatic disease: a systematic review and proportional meta-analysis of survival outcomes.	BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) accounts for 9.7% of all cancers with 1.4 million new cases diagnosed each year. 19-31% of CRC patients develop colorectal liver metastases (CRLM), and 23-38% develop extra-hepatic disease (EHD). The aim of this systematic review was to determine overall survival (OS) in patients resected for CRLM and known EHD. METHODS: A systematic review was undertaken to identify studies reporting OS after resection for CRLM in the presence of EHD. Proportional meta-analyses and relative risk of death before five years were assessed between patient groups. RESULTS: A total of 15,144 patients with CRLM (2308 with EHD) from 52 studies were included. Three and 5-year OS were 58% and 26% for lung, 37% and 17% for peritoneum, and 35% and 15% for lymph nodes, respectively. The combined relative risk of death by five years was 1.49 (95% CI = 1.34-1.66) for lung, 1.59 (95% CI = 1.16-2.17) for peritoneal and 1.70 (95% CI = 1.57-1.84) for lymph node EHD, in favour of resection in the absence of EHD. CONCLUSION: This review supports attempts at R0 resection in selected patients and rejects the notion that EHD is an absolute contraindication to resection.
26832253	Outage capacity of FSO link with pointing errors and link blockage.	In this paper, we analyze the outage capacity performance of free-space optical (FSO) systems. More precisely, taking the stochastic temporary blockage of the laser beam, atmospheric turbulence, misalignment between transmitter laser and receiver photodiode and path loss into account, we derive novel accurate analytical expressions for the outage capacity. The intensity fluctuations of the received signal are modeled by a Gamma-Gamma distribution with parameters directly related to the wide range of atmospheric conditions. The analytical results are validated by Monte Carlo simulations. Furthermore, when the intensity fluctuations are caused only by atmospheric turbulence, derived expressions are reduced to the simpler forms already presented in literature. The numerical and simulation results show that the link blockage causes appearance of the outage floor that is a significant energetic characteristic of an FSO system. The results also show that there exists an optimal value of the laser beam radius at the waist for minimizing outage probability in order to achieve the specified outage capacity. This optimal value depends on atmospheric turbulence strength and standard deviation of pointing errors, but it is also strongly dependent on the probability of link blockage.
27403166	Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation Modulates Neurogenesis and Microglia Activation in the Mouse Brain.	Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has been suggested as an adjuvant tool to promote recovery of function after stroke, but the mechanisms of its action to date remain poorly understood. Moreover, studies aimed at unraveling those mechanisms have essentially been limited to the rat, where tDCS activates resident microglia as well as endogenous neural stem cells. Here we studied the effects of tDCS on microglia activation and neurogenesis in the mouse brain. Male wild-type mice were subjected to multisession tDCS of either anodal or cathodal polarity; sham-stimulated mice served as control. Activated microglia in the cerebral cortex and neuroblasts generated in the subventricular zone as the major neural stem cell niche were assessed immunohistochemically. Multisession tDCS at a sublesional charge density led to a polarity-dependent downregulation of the constitutive expression of Iba1 by microglia in the mouse cortex. In contrast, both anodal and, to an even greater extent, cathodal tDCS induced neurogenesis from the subventricular zone. Data suggest that tDCS elicits its action through multifacetted mechanisms, including immunomodulation and neurogenesis, and thus support the idea of using tDCS to induce regeneration and to promote recovery of function. Furthermore, data suggest that the effects of tDCS may be animal- and polarity-specific.
27242933	Synaptic Cell Adhesion Molecules in Alzheimer's Disease.	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative brain disorder associated with the loss of synapses between neurons in the brain. Synaptic cell adhesion molecules are cell surface glycoproteins which are expressed at the synaptic plasma membranes of neurons. These proteins play key roles in formation and maintenance of synapses and regulation of synaptic plasticity. Genetic studies and biochemical analysis of the human brain tissue, cerebrospinal fluid, and sera from AD patients indicate that levels and function of synaptic cell adhesion molecules are affected in AD. Synaptic cell adhesion molecules interact with Abeta, a peptide accumulating in AD brains, which affects their expression and synaptic localization. Synaptic cell adhesion molecules also regulate the production of Abeta via interaction with the key enzymes involved in Abeta formation. Abeta-dependent changes in synaptic adhesion affect the function and integrity of synapses suggesting that alterations in synaptic adhesion play key roles in the disruption of neuronal networks in AD.
27416065	iTRAQ-Based Proteomics Investigation of Aqueous Humor from Patients with Coats' Disease.	BACKGROUND: Coats' disease is an uncommon form of retinal telangiectasis, and the identification of novel proteins that contribute to the development of Coats' disease is useful for improving treatment efficacy. Proteomic techniques have been used to study many eye diseases; however, few studies have used proteomics to study the development of Coats' disease. METHODS: Isobaric tagging for relative and absolute protein quantification (iTRAQ) was employed to screen differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) in the aqueous humor (AH) between stage 3A patients (n = 8), stage 3B patients (n = 14), stage 4 patients (n = 2) and control patients (n = 20). Differentially co-expressed proteins (DCPs) were present in all three stages of Coats' disease and were considered disease-specific proteins. These proteins were further analyzed using Gene Ontology (GO) functional annotations. RESULTS: A total of 819 proteins were identified in the AH, 222 of which were significantly differentially expressed (fold change > 2 and P < 0.05) in the samples from at least one stage of Coats' disease. Of the DEPs, 46 were found among all three stages of Coats' disease and the controls; therefore, they were considered Coats' disease-specific proteins (DCPs). A GO classification analysis indicated that the DCPs were closely related to structural molecule activity, cell adhesion molecule binding and receptor binding. Western blotting confirmed the expression levels of haptoglobin and apolipoprotein C-I were significantly up-regulated in Coats' disease. CONCLUSIONS: The 46 Coats' disease-specific proteins may provide additional insights into the mechanism of Coats' disease and represent potential biomarkers for identifying individuals with Coats' disease.
26875578	[Cytomegalovirus infection after haploidentical stem cell transplantation may reduce relapse risk in leukemia].	OBJECTIVE: To analyze the relationship between cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation and leukemia relapse after haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (haplo-HSCT). METHODS: A total of 61 patients diagnosed as hematological malignancies undergoing haplo-HSCT were analyzed retrospectively in our center. RESULTS: In the cohort, 36 patients had CMV reactivation after haplo-HSCT. The 100-day cumulative incidence of CMV reactivation was 59%. Compared with that in patients without CMV reactivation after transplantation, the incidence of leukemia relapse was lower in patients with CMV reactivation (16.9% vs 40.0%, P=0.034). The correlation of CMV reactivation and decreased relapse rate was only found in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (P=0.019). In multivariate analysis, relapsed disease status before transplant was a significant negative predictor of overall survival (OS) and relapse after transplant (RR was 2.866 and 3.331 respectively). CMV reactivation after transplant had a protective effect on disease relapse (RR=0.300, P=0.047). CONCLUSIONS: The rate of CMV reactivation after haplo-HSCT is high. CMV reactivation may reduce risk of relapse in patients diagnosed as acute myeloid leukemia undergoing haplo-HSCT. However, CMV reactivation is one of the important predictors of non-relapse death after transplant, active anti-viral treatment is still needed.
26871169	Statistics of highly heterogeneous flow fields confined to three-dimensional random porous media.	We present a strong relationship between the microstructural characteristics of, and the fluid velocity fields confined to, three-dimensional random porous materials. The relationship is revealed through simultaneously extracting correlation functions R_{uu}(r) of the spatial (Eulerian) velocity fields and microstructural two-point correlation functions S_{2}(r) of the random porous heterogeneous materials. This demonstrates that the effective physical transport properties depend on the characteristics of complex pore structure owing to the relationship between R_{uu}(r) and S_{2}(r) revealed in this study. Further, the mean excess plot was used to investigate the right tail of the streamwise velocity component that was found to obey light-tail distributions. Based on the mean excess plot, a generalized Pareto distribution can be used to approximate the positive streamwise velocity distribution.
26866012	Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy With Significant Coronary Stenosis and Atrioventricular Conduction Block: A Rare Case Report With 3 Year Follow-Up.	INTRODUCTION: Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TCMP) is a rare acute cardiomyopathy characterized by acute chest pain syndrome, similar to myocardial infarction, except that no significant stenosis is observed on coronary angiography in patients with this condition; these findings aid the diagnosis of TCMP. CASE PRESENTATION: We discuss an unusual case of TCMP in a 45-year-old woman with complete heart block and significant coronary artery stenosis. Maximal exercise test and perfusion scan after 1 month from the acute event did not show any ischemia; therefore, revascularization was not recommended. Her follow-up with normal echocardiographic data 3 years after the first event showed no recurrence. CONCLUSIONS: The present case and a few previous cases have showed that severe coronary artery disease may be occur in patients with TCMP and that TCMP may be associated with a high-degree atrioventricular block. The association between atrioventricular conduction block and TCMP as well as significant coronary stenosis is rarely reported; therefore, coronary angiography should be performed in all patients with clinical TCMP and the previous definition should be reconsidered. The occurrence of arrhythmia and later recovery is expected in these patients (due to a catecholamine surge).
27378859	Mathematical Model of Evolution of Brain Parcellation.	We study the distribution of brain and cortical area sizes [parcellation units (PUs)] obtained for three species: mouse, macaque, and human. We find that the distribution of PU sizes is close to lognormal. We propose the mathematical model of evolution of brain parcellation based on iterative fragmentation and specialization. In this model, each existing PU has a probability to be split that depends on PU size only. This model suggests that the same evolutionary process may have led to brain parcellation in these three species. Within our model, region-to-region (macro) connectivity is given by the outer product form. We show that most experimental data on non-zero macaque cortex macroscopic-level connections can be explained by the outer product power-law form suggested by our model (62% for area V1). We propose a multiplicative Hebbian learning rule for the macroconnectome that could yield the correct scaling of connection strengths between areas. We thus propose an evolutionary model that may have contributed to both brain parcellation and mesoscopic level connectivity in mammals.
26973562	Processing Information about Support Exchanges in Close Relationships: The Role of a Knowledge Structure.	People develop knowledge of interpersonal interaction patterns (e.g., prototypes and schemas), which shape how they process incoming information. One such knowledge structure based on attachment theory was examined: the secure base script (the prototypic sequence of events when an attachment figure comforts a close relationship partner in distress). In two studies (N = 53 and N = 119), participants were shown animated film clips in which geometric figures depicted the secure base script and asked to describe the animations. Both studies found that many people readily recognize the secure-base script from these minimal cues quite well, suggesting that this script is not only available in the context of specific relationships (i.e., a relationship-specific knowledge): The generalized (abstract) structure of the script is also readily accessible, which would make it possible to apply it to any relationship (including new relationships). Regression analyses suggested that participants who recognized the script were more likely to (a) include more animation elements when describing the animations, (b) see a common theme in different animations, (c) create better organized stories, and (d) later recall more details of the animations. These findings suggest that access to this knowledge structure helps a person organize and remember relevant incoming information. Furthermore, in both Study 1 and Study 2, individual differences in the ready recognition of the script were associated with individual differences in having access to another related knowledge: indicators suggesting that a potential relationship partner can be trusted to be supportive and responsive at times of stress. Results of Study 2 also suggest that recognizing the script is associated with those items of an attachment measure that concern giving and receiving support. Thus, these knowledge structures may shape how people process support-relevant information in their everyday lives, potentially affecting relationship outcomes and mental and physical health.
27445623	Psychological Distress in Out-Patients Assessed for Chronic Pain Compared to Those with Rheumatoid Arthritis.	Background. Patients diagnosed with chronic pain (CP) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) represent two samples with overlapping symptoms, such as experiencing significant pain. Objectives. To compare the level of psychological distress among patients diagnosed CP attending a specialist pain clinic with those attending a specialist RA clinic. Measures. A cross-sectional study was conducted at an academic specialist chronic pain and rheumatology clinic. Participants. 330 participants included a CP group (n = 167) and a RA group (n = 163) completed a booklet of questionnaires regarding demographic characteristics, duration, and severity of their pain. Psychological and personality variables were compared between the CP and RA participants using a Multivariate Analysis of Covariance (MANCOVA). Results. Level of psychological distress based on the subscales of the DASS (depression, anxiety, and stress), PASS (escape avoidance, cognitive anxiety, fear of pain, and physiological anxiety), and PCS (rumination, magnification, and helplessness) was significantly higher in the CP group compared to the RA group. Categorization of individuals based on DASS severity resulted in significant differences in rates of depression and anxiety symptoms between groups, with a greater number of CP participants displaying more severe depressive and anxiety symptoms. Discussion and Conclusions. This study found greater levels of psychological distress among CP individuals referred to an academic pain clinic when compared to RA patients referred to an academic rheumatology clinic.
26933474	A Mechanistic Study on the Amiodarone-Induced Pulmonary Toxicity.	Amiodarone- (AM-) induced pulmonary toxicity (AIPT) is still a matter of research and is poorly understood. In attempting to resolve this issue, we treated Sprague-Dawley rats with AM doses of 80 mg/kg/day/i.p. for one, two, three, and four weeks. The rats were weighed at days 7, 14, 21, and 28 and bronchoalveolar lavages (BAL) were obtained to determine total leukocyte count (TLC). For each group, lung weighing, histopathology, and homogenization were performed. Fresh homogenates were used for determination of ATP content, lipid peroxides, GSH, catalase, SOD, GPx, GR activities, NO, and hydroxyproline levels. The results showed a significant decrease in body weight and GSH depletion together with an increase in both lung weight and lung/body weight coefficient in the first week. Considerable increases in lung hydroxyproline level with some histopathological alterations were apparent. Treatment for two weeks produced a significant increase in BAL fluid, TLC, GR activity, and NO level in lung homogenate. The loss of cellular ATP and inhibition of most antioxidative protective enzymatic system appeared along with alteration in SOD activity following daily treatment for three weeks, while, in rats treated with AM for four weeks, more severe toxicity was apparent. Histopathological diagnosis was mostly granulomatous inflammation and interstitial pneumonitis in rats treated for three and four weeks, respectively. As shown, it is obvious that slow oedema formation is the only initiating factor of AIPT; all other mechanisms may occur as a consequence.
27304858	Statin Use and Its Association with Essential Tremor and Parkinson's Disease.	BACKGROUND: Statins have potent anti-inflammatory and immunomodulating effects, and may have neuroprotective properties in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). There are no studies about the use of statins in the related tremor disorder, essential tremor (ET). We determined whether statin use differed in ET cases vs. controls and PD cases vs. METHODS: One hundred and thirty nine ET cases, 108 PD cases, and 124 controls participated in a research study of the epidemiology of movement disorders. They were frequency matched based on age and gender. Statin use was assessed by self-report. RESULTS: In adjusted logistic regression analyses, statin use (current or ever) was inversely associated with PD (ORs 0.56-0.63), with marginal values (p values = 0.07-0.187). In similar adjusted models, ET was not associated with statin use (p values = 0.45-0.50). However, ET was inversely associated with longer-term statin use (adjusted OR 0.27, p values = 0.04-0.048). CONCLUSIONS: We observed a marginally significant inverse association between PD and statin use. Although in primary analyses we found no evidence that statin use was protective in ET, there was an inverse association in analyses that assessed longer term use of statins. Further observational studies are warranted.
27000810	[The prognostic value of basic laboratory blood tests in predicting the results of cardiac rehabilitation in post STEMI patients].	UNLABELLED: The possibility of complications and death from cardiovascular causes in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) is an important element in the assessment of their clinical condition. It is believed that the prognosis of patients after ACS is affected, among others, by leukocytosis, anemia, hyperglycemia, thrombocytopenia, and increased volume of these cells and decreased GFR. AIM: The aim of the study was an attempt to use basic laboratory blood tests and an index of own design to predict the results of in-hospital cardiac rehabilitation (phase II) of post STEMI patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included 100 post STEMI patients, 70 men and 30 women, aged 60,9+/-11,8 years, admitted for cardiac rehabilitation to the Department of Internal Diseases and Cardiac Rehabilitation, MU in Lodz. On admission fasting blood cell count was performed, serum glucose and creatinine level was determined (GFR assessment). The following results were considered abnormal: glucose level >/=100mg/dl, GFR <60 ml/min/1,73m(2), RBC <4x10(6)/mul, WBC >10x10(3)/mul, PLT <150x10(3)/mul. Exercise test was performed twice in all patients - before and after the completion of the II phase of rehabilitation to assess its effects. RESULTS: Basing on logistic regression analysis and the results of individual odds ratio (OR) of the tested blood parameters, their prognostic impact on the risk of cardiac rehabilitation failure was determined. This risk was defined on the basis of patient's inability to tolerate workload increment >/=20 Watt despite the applied cardiac rehabilitation program. The most statistically significant risk factors were selected as the result of logistic regression model building on the basis of which cardiac rehabilitation failure index was determined. Leukocytosis and anemia determined most significantly the failure of cardiac rehabilitation (respectively: OR=6,4 and OR=2,9;p=0,01). They were used to construct a rehabilitation failure index with the values 0-2, as follows: 0 - corresponds to the situation of the absence of leukocytosis and anemia, 1 - corresponds to the situation of the occurrence of leucocytosis or anemia in post STEMI patients and was associated with 3,5-fold increase in the risk of not obtaining the full effect of cardiac rehabilitation, 2 - corresponds to the situation of the simultaneous occurrence of both parameters (leukocytosis and anemia) and was associated with 12,25-fold increase in the risk of not obtaining full effect of cardiac rehabilitation. CONCLUSIONS: Peripheral blood cell count is essential in predicting cardiac rehabilitation effects. Leukocytosis and anemia determine to the greatest degree the failure of cardiac rehabilitation. Cardiac rehabilitation failure index may be useful in classifying post STEMI patients into an appropriate model of rehabilitation.
28144337	Formose reaction controlled by boronic acid compounds.	Formose reactions were carried out in the presence of low molecular weight and macromolecular boronic acid compounds, i.e., sodium phenylboronate (SPB) and a copolymer of sodium 4-vinylphenylboronate with sodium 4-styrenesulfonate (pVPB/NaSS), respectively. The boronic acid compounds provided different selectivities; sugars of a small carbon number were formed favorably in the presence of SPB, whereas sugar alcohols of a larger carbon number were formed preferably in the presence of pVPB/NaSS.
27110040	Induced expression of microsomal cytochrome b5 determined at mRNA and protein levels in rats exposed to ellipticine, benzo[a]pyrene, and 1-phenylazo-2-naphthol (Sudan I).	ABSTRACT: The microsomal protein cytochrome b5 , which is located in the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum, has been shown to modulate many reactions catalyzed by cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes. We investigated the influence of exposure to the anticancer drug ellipticine and to two environmental carcinogens, benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) and 1-phenylazo-2-naphthol (Sudan I), on the expression of cytochrome b5 in livers of rats, both at the mRNA and protein levels. We also studied the effects of these compounds on their own metabolism and the formation of DNA adducts generated by their activation metabolite(s) in vitro. The relative amounts of cytochrome b5 mRNA, measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis, were induced by the test compounds up to 11.7-fold in rat livers. Western blotting using antibodies raised against cytochrome b5 showed that protein expression was induced by up to sevenfold in livers of treated rats. Microsomes isolated from livers of exposed rats catalyzed the oxidation of ellipticine, BaP, and Sudan I and the formation of DNA adducts generated by their reactive metabolite(s) more effectively than hepatic microsomes isolated from control rats. All test compounds are known to induce CYP1A1. This induction is one of the reasons responsible for increased oxidation of these xenobiotics by microsomes. However, induction of cytochrome b5 can also contribute to their enhanced metabolism. GRAPHICAL ABSTRACT:
27418820	Efficacy and safety of ipratropium bromide/salbutamol sulphate administered in a hydrofluoroalkane metered-dose inhaler for the treatment of COPD.	BACKGROUND: The use of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) has contributed to the depletion of the stratospheric ozone layer resulting in serious health concerns. Ipratropium bromide/salbutamol sulphate CFC-pressurized metered-dose inhalers (IB/SAL-CFC pMDI) have been in widespread use for many years without any apparent ill consequences. This combination has now been reformulated using the hydrofluoroalkane (HFA) propellant. This study sought to establish the clinical noninferiority of a new HFA-containing IB/SAL pMDI to the conventional IB/SAL-CFC pMDI in subjects with mild/moderate COPD. METHODS: This was a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, multicenter study in two consecutive periods: a 14-day run-in period followed by a 85-day treatment period. Eligible mild-to-moderate stable COPD subjects aged 40-75 years were enrolled into the study and entered the run-in period during which subjects withdrew all the bronchodilators, except for salbutamol as rescue medication. Subjects were randomized to 85 days treatment with either IB/SAL-HFA or IB/SAL-CFC, 20 mug qid. RESULTS: Of the 290 randomized patients, 249 completed the study. The primary efficacy variable was the change in forced expiratory volume in one second from predose to 60 minutes after dosing on day 85. At the end of the treatment period, the adjusted mean change in forced expiratory volume in one second at 60 minutes was 123 mL in the IB/SAL-HFA pMDI group and 115 mL in the IB/SAL-CFC pMDI group. Because the lower limit of the 95% confidence interval for the between-group difference (-62 mL) was well within the noninferiority margin (-100 mL), the HFA formulation was deemed clinically noninferior to the CFC formulation. This finding was supported by secondary efficacy assessments. Both formulations of IB/SAL were well tolerated during the prolonged multiple dosing. CONCLUSION: It is concluded that IB/SAL-HFA pMDI provides effective bronchodilation of similar degree to that achieved with IB/SAL-CFC pMDI. Therefore, IB/SAL-HFA pMDI is a valuable alternative to IB/SAL-CFC pMDI.
27423167	Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy for Body Dysmorphic Disorder by Proxy.	Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) is a distressing or impairing preoccupation with a perceived defect in physical appearance. BDD by proxy (BDDBP) is a significant but understudied variant of BDD in which the primary preoccupation involves perceived imperfections of another person. Like BDD, individuals with BDDBP engage in time-consuming rituals to "fix" the other person's appearance or alleviate distress. Avoidance is common and the impact of BDDBP on social functioning is profound. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is the best-studied and most promising psychological treatment for BDD, but no studies have examined its generalizability to the BDDBP variant. We tested feasibility, acceptability, and treatment outcome of CBT modified for BDDBP in a sample of 6 adults with primary BDDBP. Treatment was delivered in weekly individual sessions over 12-20weeks. Mean symptom severity (BDDBP-YBOCS) dropped from the moderately severe range at pretreatment to the subclinical range at posttreatment, t(6)=10.7, p<.001, d=3.3. One hundred percent of treatment completers were responders (>/=30% reduction in BDDBP-YBOCS). Insight also improved. Treatment gains were maintained at 3-month follow-up. To our knowledge, this represents the first treatment study for BDDBP.
27448153	Structural and Functional Brain Correlates of Cognitive Impairment in Euthymic Patients with Bipolar Disorder.	INTRODUCTION: Cognitive impairment in the euthymic phase is a well-established finding in bipolar disorder. However, its brain structural and/or functional correlates are uncertain. METHODS: Thirty-three euthymic bipolar patients with preserved memory and executive function and 28 euthymic bipolar patients with significant memory and/or executive impairment, as defined using two test batteries, the Rivermead Behavioural Memory Test (RBMT) and the Behavioural Assessment of the Dysexecutive Syndrome (BADS), plus 28 healthy controls underwent structural MRI using voxel-based morphometry (VBM). Twenty-seven of the cognitively preserved patients, 23 of the cognitively impaired patients and 28 controls also underwent fMRI during performance of the n-back working memory task. RESULTS: No clusters of grey or white matter volume difference were found between the two patient groups. During n-back performance, the cognitively impaired patients showed hypoactivation compared to the cognitively preserved patients in a circumscribed region in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Both patient groups showed failure of de-activation in the medial frontal cortex compared to the healthy controls. CONCLUSIONS: Cognitive impairment in euthymic bipolar patients appears from this study to be unrelated to structural brain abnormality, but there was some evidence for an association with altered prefrontal function.
27499622	Proretinal nanoparticles: stability, release, efficacy, and irritation.	Despite many potent biological activities, retinoids such as retinoic acid (RA) and retinal possess dose-related broad side effects. In this study, we show that this problem, which has been unsolvable for a long time, can be tackled through a controlled release strategy in which retinal is continuously delivered to the skin via sustained release from proretinal nanoparticles. The water dispersible proretinal nanoparticles are stable when kept in water at neutral pH and at room temperature for 8 months under light-proof conditions, and show sustained release of retinal into human synthetic sebum at a pH of 5. In the daily topical application tests performed for 4 weeks on rats' skin, the nanoparticles showed superior ability to increase epidermal thickness compared to RA and retinal, with no skin irritation observed for the proretinal particles, but severe skin irritation observed for RA and free retinal. When tested under occlusion conditions in human volunteers, insignificant skin irritation was observed for the proretinal nanoparticles. The 12-week, double-blind, split-face study on human volunteers indicates better antiaging efficacy of the particles as compared to the free RA.
26878006	An Unusual Case of Cauda Equina Secondary to Spinal Metastasis of Thyroid Cancer.	INTRODUCTION: Cauda equina secondary to metastatic follicular thyroid cancer of the lumbosacral area is a rare entity. CASE REPORT: We report an unusual case of a 52-year-old male who presented with backache, lower limb weakness, and perianal numbness. A CT-scan of the lumbosacral area showed an enhancing mass at the L4, L5 and S1 vertebrae. Histopathology after excision revealed a metastatic thyroid cancer. Hence, a CT scan of the neck and chest was performed which showed a nodule in the left lobe of the thyroid and a mass in the left chest wall. A total thyroidectomy and excision of the chest wall lesion was undergone, which was diagnosed as a follicular carcinoma of the thyroid. CONCLUSION: Metastatic workup of spinal metastasis should include evaluation of the thyroid gland.
26831878	[Advantages and disadvantages of three-dimensional technique in laparoscopic gastrectomy for gastric cancer].	Recently, the technological advancements have led to the introduction of new three-dimension (3D) laparoscopic system. 3D technique in laparoscopic radical gastrectomy provides an abdominal strong stereoscopic depth and accurate operative field, and can be helpful for the beginner to shorten the learning curve. Moreover, spatial orientation becomes more accurate with 3D technique. 3D technique also has the advantages of clearer anatomical level, better vessel exposure, lymph node dissection and digestive tract reconstruction. However, there are still some defects of 3D laparoscopic system. For example, the surgeon may not adapt to 3D vision at the beginning, and special equipment is required to display the data.
27228619	[Activity patterns and foraging behavior of Apis cerana cerana in the urban gardens in winter].	Bees and other pollinating insects are the important parts of biodiversity due to their great role in plant reproduction and crop production. To explore the role of city garden in native bees conservation, activity patterns, visiting behaviors and flowering plants with nectar or pollen were recorded in south Sichuan in winter. The results showed that, worker bees (Apis cerana cerana) were active to collect food out hive under suitable weather conditions, the duration of working was long. Peaks of the number of outgoing, entrance and foragers without pollen appeared at 14:00-15:00, and bimodal patterns were observed. While, peak of bees with pollen appeared at 11:00, and a unimodal pattern was observed. Time significantly affected the activity of workers. The workload of honey bees on nectar and pollen collection were different, just less than twenty percent foragers carrying pollen. Temperature and humidity also affected flights of bees to some degree, and bee activities showed similar patterns on different days. However, the activities had diverse characteristics in some time. Though a less number of plants were in flowering, most of them could be utilized by A. cerana cerana, and colonies could effectively get the food resource by behavior adjustment. In addition, visiting activities of bees on the flowers of main garden plants, such as Camellia japonica, showed obvious rhythm. Increasing the flowering plants with nectar and pollen in winter by scientific management of urban gardens would facilitate the creation of suitable habitats for A. cerana cerana and maintaining the wild population.
27310812	Diminished Auditory Responses during NREM Sleep Correlate with the Hierarchy of Language Processing.	Natural sleep provides a powerful model system for studying the neuronal correlates of awareness and state changes in the human brain. To quantitatively map the nature of sleep-induced modulations in sensory responses we presented participants with auditory stimuli possessing different levels of linguistic complexity. Ten participants were scanned using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during the waking state and after falling asleep. Sleep staging was based on heart rate measures validated independently on 20 participants using concurrent EEG and heart rate measurements and the results were confirmed using permutation analysis. Participants were exposed to three types of auditory stimuli: scrambled sounds, meaningless word sentences and comprehensible sentences. During non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, we found diminishing brain activation along the hierarchy of language processing, more pronounced in higher processing regions. Specifically, the auditory thalamus showed similar activation levels during sleep and waking states, primary auditory cortex remained activated but showed a significant reduction in auditory responses during sleep, and the high order language-related representation in inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) cortex showed a complete abolishment of responses during NREM sleep. In addition to an overall activation decrease in language processing regions in superior temporal gyrus and IFG, those areas manifested a loss of semantic selectivity during NREM sleep. Our results suggest that the decreased awareness to linguistic auditory stimuli during NREM sleep is linked to diminished activity in high order processing stations.
26973451	Deficits in the Sensitivity to Pitch Sweeps by School-Aged Children Wearing Cochlear Implants.	Sensitivity to static changes in pitch has been shown to be poorer in school-aged children wearing cochlear implants (CIs) than children with normal hearing (NH), but it is unclear whether this is also the case for dynamic changes in pitch. Yet, dynamically changing pitch has considerable ecological relevance in terms of natural speech, particularly aspects such as intonation, emotion, or lexical tone information. Twenty one children with NH and 23 children wearing a CI participated in this study, along with 18 NH adults and 6 CI adults for comparison. Listeners with CIs used their clinically assigned settings with envelope-based coding strategies. Percent correct was measured in one- or three-interval two-alternative forced choice tasks, for the direction or discrimination of harmonic complexes based on a linearly rising or falling fundamental frequency. Sweep rates were adjusted per subject, in a logarithmic scale, so as to cover the full extent of the psychometric function. Data for up- and down-sweeps were fitted separately, using a maximum-likelihood technique. Fits were similar for up- and down-sweeps in the discrimination task, but diverged in the direction task because psychometric functions for down-sweeps were very shallow. Hits and false alarms were then converted into d' and beta values, from which a threshold was extracted at a d' of 0.77. Thresholds were very consistent between the two tasks and considerably higher (worse) for CI listeners than for their NH peers. Thresholds were also higher for children than adults. Factors such as age at implantation, age at profound hearing loss, and duration of CI experience did not play any major role in this sensitivity. Thresholds of dynamic pitch sensitivity (in either task) also correlated with thresholds for static pitch sensitivity and with performance in tasks related to speech prosody.
26893619	Clinical and radiographic observations from four patients with primary hepatic lymphoma.	The aim of the present study was to delineate the radiographic and clinical features of primary hepatic lymphoma (PHL). Four histopathologically confirmed cases of PHL were analyzed with respect to the radiological, clinical and pathological characteristics. The main clinical manifestations included upper right quadrant pain and lymphoma-associated B symptoms, such as fever, night sweating and weight loss. All the patients had elevated serum levels of lactate dehydrogenase. Furthermore, all the patients underwent plain and enhanced computed tomography examinations, which identified low-density lesions without marked enhancement. Solitary masses were observed in two cases, while multiple focal lesions were noted in one case and diffuse multi-speckled nodules were observed in one case. Two patients underwent abdominal magnetic resonance imaging, which revealed lesions that were hyperintense on T1-weighted imaging (WI) scans and hypointense on T2WI scans, and exhibited slight to moderate enhancement with a dynamic contrast-enhanced protocol. In one case, vessels were visible within the lesion. Therefore, the present study concluded that PHL is a rare condition that exhibits non-specific clinical and radiological features. A combination of imaging results and clinical manifestations can be used to facilitate a diagnosis of PHL.
27997899	Bufalin Inhibits hTERT Expression and Colorectal Cancer Cell Growth by Targeting CPSF4.	BACKGROUND/AIMS: Bufalin can induce apoptosis in certain human cancer cell lines, but bufalin has not yet been thoroughly evaluated in colorectal cancer cells. Cleavage and polyadenylation specific factor 4 (CPSF4) and human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) play important roles in colorectal cancer growth. The aim of this study was to investigate the roles and interactions of bufalin, CPSF4 and hTERT and the effects of bufalin in human colorectal cancer. METHODS: We treated LoVo and SW620 cells with bufalin to investigate the effect of bufalin on proliferation, apoptosis and migration. We verified the relationship between CPSF4 and hTERT using pulldown assays, luciferase reporter assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays. RESULTS: Bufalin inhibited the proliferation and migration of and induced apoptosis in LoVo and SW620 cells. We identified CPSF4 as an hTERT promoter-binding protein in colorectal cancer cells. CONCLUSION: Our study identified bufalin as a potential small molecule inhibitor for cancer therapy.
28033602	[Erythropoietin stimulating agents in chronic kidney disease: indications and contraindications].	Erythropoietin (EPO) deficiency is important complication of chronic kidney disease. It downregulates red cells maturation and production causing renal anemia. It is associated with reduced quality of life, increased risk of blood transfusions and cardiovascular morbidity. It is possible to substitute EPOwith recombinant human EPOor its derivatives - erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESA). ESA therapy reduces blood transfusions, improves quality of life and can raise hemoglobin to 10-11.5 g/dl. Higher hemoglobin targets bring more harm than benefit - including increased risk for stroke, hypertension and vascular access thrombosis and mortality. Initiation of ESA therapy should be preceded by excluding the other causes of anemia and balancing ESA advantages and disadvantages in every patient. In patients with previous stroke, previous or current malignancy risks of ESA therapy may outweigh the risks of red cell transfusions.
27187778	Assessment of the Tumor Redox Status in Head and Neck Cancer by 62Cu-ATSM PET.	PURPOSE: Tumor redox is an important factor for cancer progression, resistance to treatments, and a poor prognosis. The aim of the present study was to define tumor redox (over-reduction) using 62Cu-diacetyl-bis(N4-methylthiosemicarbazone) (62Cu-ATSM) PET and compare its prognostic potential in head and neck cancer (HNC) with that of 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-D-glucose (18F-FDG). METHODS: Thirty HNC patients (stage II-IV) underwent pretreatment 62Cu-ATSM and 18F-FDG PET scans. Maximum standardized uptake values (SUVATSM and SUVFDG) and tumor-to-muscle activity concentration ratios (TMRATSM and TMRFDG) were measured. Reductive-tumor-volume (RTV) was then determined at four thresholds (40%, 50%, 60%, and 70% SUVATSM), and total-lesion-reduction (TLR) was calculated as the product of the mean SUV and RTV for 62Cu-ATSM. In 18F-FDG, metabolic-tumor-volume (MTV) and total-lesion-glycolysis (TLG) were obtained at a threshold of 40%. A ROC analysis was performed to determine % thresholds for RTV and TLR showing the best predictive performance, and these were then used to determine the optimal cut-off values to stratify patients for each parameter. Progression-free-survival (PFS) and cause-specific-survival (CSS) were evaluated by the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: The means +/- standard deviations of PFS and CSS periods were 16.4+/-13.4 and 19.2+/-12.4 months, respectively. A ROC analysis determined that the 70% SUVATSM threshold for RTV and TLR was the best for predicting disease progression and cancer death. Optimal cut-offs for each index were SUVATSM = 3.6, SUVFDG = 7.9, TMRATSM = 3.2, TMRFDG = 5.6, RTV = 2.9, MTV = 8.1, TLR = 14.0, and TLG = 36.5. When the cut-offs for TMRATSM and TLR were set as described above in 62Cu-ATSM PET, patients with higher TMRATSM (p = 0.03) and greater TLR (p = 0.02) showed significantly worse PFS, while patients with greater TLR had significantly worse CSS (p = 0.02). Only MTV in 18F-FDG PET predicted differences in PSF and CSS (p = 0.03 and p = 0.03, respectively). CONCLUSION: Tumor redox parameters measured by 62Cu-ATSM PET may be determinants of HNC patient outcomes and help define optimal patient-specific treatments.
26985319	Potent and Selective CK2 Kinase Inhibitors with Effects on Wnt Pathway Signaling in Vivo.	The Wnt pathway is an evolutionarily conserved and tightly regulated signaling network with important roles in embryonic development and adult tissue regeneration. Impaired Wnt pathway regulation, arising from mutations in Wnt signaling components, such as Axin, APC, and beta-catenin, results in uncontrolled cell growth and triggers oncogenesis. To explore the reported link between CK2 kinase activity and Wnt pathway signaling, we sought to identify a potent, selective inhibitor of CK2 suitable for proof of concept studies in vivo. Starting from a pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidine lead (2), we identified compound 7h, a potent CK2 inhibitor with picomolar affinity that is highly selectivity against other kinase family enzymes and inhibits Wnt pathway signaling (IC50 = 50 nM) in DLD-1 cells. In addition, compound 7h has physicochemical properties that are suitable for formulation as an intravenous solution, has demonstrated good pharmacokinetics in preclinical species, and exhibits a high level of activity as a monotherapy in HCT-116 and SW-620 xenografts.
27730181	Factors associated with medication adherence in school-aged children with asthma.	Adherence to preventive asthma treatment is poor, particularly in children, yet the factors associated with adherence in this age group are not well understood. Adherence was monitored electronically over 6 months in school-aged children who attended a regional emergency department in New Zealand for an asthma exacerbation and were prescribed twice-daily inhaled corticosteroids. Participants completed questionnaires including assessment of family demographics, asthma responsibility and learning style. Multivariable analysis of factors associated with adherence was conducted. 101 children (mean (range) age 8.9 (6-15) years, 51% male) participated. Median (interquartile range) preventer adherence was 30% (17-48%) of prescribed. Four explanatory factors were identified: female sex (+12% adherence), Asian ethnicity (+19% adherence), living in a smaller household (-3.0% adherence per person in the household), and younger age at diagnosis (+2.7% for every younger year of diagnosis) (all p<0.02). In school-aged children attending the emergency department for asthma, males and non-Asian ethnic groups were at high risk for poor inhaled corticosteroid adherence and may benefit most from intervention. Four factors explained a small proportion of adherence behaviour indicating the difficulty in identifying adherence barriers. Further research is recommended in other similar populations.
27453992	Tongue and Lower Lip Movement in Semivowel /w/ Production.	AIMS: Previous studies have shown significant correlations between the acoustic characteristics of /w/ and speech intelligibility. To understand the articulatory pattern in /w/ production, the current study investigated the movement characteristics of the tongue and lower lip in whip productions in comparison to bib productions. METHODS: Data from 19 typical adult male participants were collected using electromagnetic articulography. A number of kinematic measures of tongue body (approximately 25 mm posterior to the tongue apex) and lower lip movements were analyzed. RESULTS: The findings suggested different movement patterns of the tongue body and lower lip in whip and bib productions. The amount of lip movement in the anterior-posterior plane exhibited by each speaker did not vary between whip and bib. However, speakers did exhibit more tongue retraction/advancement, greater overall tongue movement, and faster tongue movement speed in whip than in bib. CONCLUSION: Tongue movement in the anterior-posterior plane, such as tongue retraction and advancement, was found to be crucial for the production of /w/ in typical male speakers. Thus, the articulatory kinematics of the tongue in the anterior-posterior plane and its coordination with the lips need to be further examined in speakers with dysarthria to understand the underlying kinematic characteristics that influence speech intelligibility.
26937235	Analysis of small-angle X-ray scattering data in the presence of significant instrumental smearing.	A laboratory-scale small-angle X-ray scattering instrument with pinhole collimation has been used to assess smearing effects due to instrumental resolution. A new, numerically efficient method to smear ideal model intensities is developed and presented. It allows for directly using measured profiles of isotropic but otherwise arbitrary beams in smearing calculations. Samples of low-polydispersity polymer spheres have been used to show that scattering data can in this way be quantitatively modeled even when there is substantial distortion due to instrumental resolution.
27713770	The role of Vitamin D in immuno-inflammatory responses in Ankylosing Spondylitis patients with and without Acute Anterior Uveitis.	Hypothesis:Abnormal Vitamin D (Vit D) level could have consequences on the immuno-inflammatory processes in Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS). Aim:The purpose of this study was to analyze the role of Vitamin D in the interplay between immune and inflammation effectors in AS associated-Acute Anterior Uveitis (AAU). Methods and Results:25-hydroxyvitamin D (Vit D), LL-37 peptide, IL-8 and Serum Amyloid A (SAA) were identified and quantified in the serum/ plasma of thirty-four AS patients [eleven AS patients presenting AAU (AAU AS patients) and twenty-three AS patients without AAU (wAAU AS patients)] and eighteen healthy individuals (Control) using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Acute-phase SAA level was significantly higher in AS patients compared to Controls. Contrary with wAAU AS patients, significantly elevated levels of IL-8, and diminished levels of Vit D characterized AAU AS patients. Regarding LL-37, its level decreased concomitantly with the level of Vit D. When AS patients were subgrouped based on AAU presence or on Vit D level, important associations between immuno-inflammatory assessed markers and AS features were noticed. Generally, Vit D levels were associated indirectly with leukocytes/ neutrophils number or with ESR, CRP, and Fibrinogen levels. The levels of SAA and IL-8 associated directly with AAU or with AAU relapses, especially in AS patients with Vit D insufficiency, while SAA associated directly with infection/ inflammatory markers and with disease activity indexes or with the degree of functional limitation. Discussion:Altered levels of Vit D affect the balance between LL-37, IL-8 and SAA, suggesting an association with AAU, an extra-articular manifestation of AS. Abbreviations:Vit D = Vitamin D, AS = Ankylosing Spondylitis, AAU = Acute Anterior Uveitis, AAU AS = AS patients with AAU, wAAU AS = AS patients without AAU, SSZ = Sulphasalazine, Leu = Leukocytes, Neu = Neutrophils.
26834243	GPR56 identifies primary human acute myeloid leukemia cells with high repopulating potential in vivo.	Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a genetically heterogeneous hematologic malignancy, which is initiated and driven by a rare fraction of leukemia stem cells (LSCs). Despite the difficulties of identifying a common LSC phenotype, there is increasing evidence that high expression of stem cell gene signatures is associated with poor clinical outcome. Identification of functionally distinct subpopulations in this disease is therefore crucial to dissecting the molecular machinery underlying LSC self-renewal. Here, we combined next-generation sequencing technology with in vivo assessment of LSC frequencies and identified the adhesion G protein-coupled receptor 56 (GPR56) as a novel and stable marker for human LSCs for the majority of AML samples. High GPR56 expression was significantly associated with high-risk genetic subgroups and poor outcome. Analysis of GPR56 in combination with CD34 expression revealed engraftment potential of GPR56(+)cells in both the CD34(-)and CD34(+)fractions, thus defining a novel LSC compartment independent of the CD34(+)CD38(-)LSC phenotype.
27350934	The burden of tetanus in Uganda.	BACKGROUND: The successful scale-up of safe male circumcision (SMC) in Uganda has been hinged on client's safety and quality of services. However, after the recent three tetanus deaths after circumcision a review of all tetanus cases in one of the hospitals where the cases occurred was initiated. This was to ascertain the potential for an association between tetanus infection and circumcision. Routinely collected national data were also reviewed to determine the burden of tetanus in Uganda and contextualize these incidents. METHODS: A review of medical charts of tetanus cases identified from the inpatients registry at Masafu hospital, Busia district for the period 2009/2010-2013/2014. Data were abstracted from the inpatients registries, charts and HMIS annual reports, and a key informant interview conducted with the in-charge of the ward that treats tetanus patients. All quantitative data were captured in an electronic database. Routine facility data from the National District health Information Software-2 (DHIS-2) for all the 112 districts were also used. Descriptive analysis and Poisson regression models were used for statistical analysis using STATA version 13.0. RESULTS: Data from the routine DHIS-2 showed a high and increasing burden of tetanus from the emergency/out-patient department records over the 4 year period, highest among females aged 5+ years in all the regions. At the Masafa hospital, the chart review revealed a total of 25 tetanus cases and all were males. Nearly a third (32 %) was aged 7-15 years, with no evidence of circumcision apart from only one case. The rate of tetanus infection among male inpatients over the review period was 2-6 per 1000. The case fatality rate was nearly a half (47.4 %) with deaths occurring within 2 days after admission, and rates of patients' self-discharge against medical advice were high, 36.8 %. The most common tetanus entry wounds were due to road traffic accidents, followed by diabetic foot. Anti-tetanus serum was only not readily available. CONCLUSION: The burden of tetanus is increasing, especially among females aged 5+ years. Tetanus entry wounds among the inpatients in Masafa hospital were mostly due to road traffic accidents, and young males. The tetanus case fatality was very high (47.4 %) and so was patient requested discharge. There is a need to do more to protect the population against tetanus infection, especially among females, and males who need either initial or booster tetanus immunization as SMC is scaled up.
27140182	Three Arachidonoylamide Derivatives Inhibit Pro-Inflammatory Genes Expression by Modulating NF-kB and AP1 Activities.	BACKGROUND: Since the anti-inflammatory activity of arachidonic acid derivatives was previously reported, we synthesized three new amide derivatives of arachidonic acid (AA-Ds) and tested their anti-inflammatory effects on an in vitro skin inflammation model. Aim of our study was to find derivatives of natural compounds able to down regulate inflammatory signal transduction pathway. METHODS: Human keratinocytes cell line (HaCaT) was cultured and induced by cytokines in the presence of AA-Ds. Cytokines administration elicited an inflammatory response mediated by NF-kB and STAT-1 activation that induced proinflammatory genes expression. RESULTS: By real time PCR we found that 24 hours after induction all AA-Ds significantly inhibit inducible Nitric Oxide Synthase (iNOS), TNFalpha, Inhibitor alpha of NF-kB, chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 9 and 10 genes expression. We analyzed their molecular effects in particular on the iNOS gene expression. Since iNOS transcript half-life did not change with AA-Ds treatment, we excluded a prominent role of post-transcriptional regulation for this gene and focused our attention on its transcriptional regulation. Starting three-five hours after cytokines induction, HaCaT cells, pretreated with each compound, showed inhibition of both NF-kB DNA-binding and NF-kB p65-Ser536 phosphorylation. STAT1 activation was inhibited only by AA-D4 derivative. To explain why the inhibition of iNOS expression began late after induction we analyzed activities of others key transcription factors. AA-Ds treatment elicited early increases of AP1 DNA binding as well as c-Jun, c-Fos and Fra-1 mRNA levels. Our data agree with the repressing effects of AP1 on human iNOS promoter previously described in others cell systems (Kleinert et al.). CONCLUSION: AA-Ds shown to be good candidates as inhibitors of several pro-inflammatory genes induction and our study provides indications for their possible use as new antiinflammatory drugs.
27313782	Treatment, Outcome and Prognostic Factors in Renal Cell Carcinoma - A Single Center Study (2000-2010).	In Switzerland efficient availability of novel drugs for renal cell cancer (RCC) has been granted early. Since the advent of the targeted agents for RCC the usage of these drugs has been reported to improve progression free survival. Here, we find that patients who are able to receive sequential targeted therapy, including tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) and mTOR inhibitors (mTORi), have a largely better outcome than those who have less exposure to these agents. The value of the prognostic scores developed by Motzer and Heng is fully reflected by the outcomes according to prognostic risk groups in our unselected patient cohort. Also, the use of surgical intervention appears to be an important prognostic factor, however with a somehow diminished effect by novel systemic therapies. The importance of multiple lines of targeted therapies is underlined by this retrospective analysis. For patients with metastatic RCC not receiving targeted therapy the median OS was 22.6 months compared to those with one TKI 25.4 months. Patients receiving a second-line therapy (median overall survival 27.6 months) and those patients with three or more lines of therapy (43.8 months) have the greatest benefit. Also, exposure to a mTORi improves survival versus non-exposure to mTORi (63.3 vs. 22.3 months, p=0.038). In conclusion a trend towards improved survival is confirmed for an unselected population when the full variety of therapeutic options is available and can be used for the individual patient.
27445919	The Role of Subjective Task Value in Service-Learning Engagement among Chinese College Students.	Most service-learning studies in higher education focused on its effects on students' development. The dynamic processes and mechanisms of students' development during service-learning, however, have not been explored thoroughly. Student engagement in service-learning may affect service-learning outcomes and be affected by subjective task value at the same time. The present study aimed to explore the effect of subjective task value on Chinese college student engagement during service-learning. Fifty-four Chinese college students participated in a 9-weeks service-learning program of interacting with children with special needs. Students' engagement and subjective task value were assessed via self-report questionnaires and 433 weekly reflective journals. The results indicated that the cognitive, emotional and behavioral engagement of Chinese college students demonstrated different developmental trends during service-learning process. Subjective task value played an essential role in student engagement in service-learning activities. However, the role of subjective task value varied with different stages. Finally, the implications for implementing service-learning in Chinese education were discussed.
26831938	Mapping time-course mitochondrial adaptations in the kidney in experimental diabetes.	Oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) drives ATP production by mitochondria, which are dynamic organelles, constantly fusing and dividing to maintain kidney homoeostasis. In diabetic kidney disease (DKD), mitochondria appear dysfunctional, but the temporal development of diabetes-induced adaptations in mitochondrial structure and bioenergetics have not been previously documented. In the present study, we map the changes in mitochondrial dynamics and function in rat kidney mitochondria at 4, 8, 16 and 32 weeks of diabetes. Our data reveal that changes in mitochondrial bioenergetics and dynamics precede the development of albuminuria and renal histological changes. Specifically, in early diabetes (4 weeks), a decrease in ATP content and mitochondrial fragmentation within proximal tubule epithelial cells (PTECs) of diabetic kidneys were clearly apparent, but no changes in urinary albumin excretion or glomerular morphology were evident at this time. By 8 weeks of diabetes, there was increased capacity for mitochondrial permeability transition (mPT) by pore opening, which persisted over time and correlated with mitochondrial hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) generation and glomerular damage. Late in diabetes, by week 16, tubular damage was evident with increased urinary kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1) excretion, where an increase in the Complex I-linked oxygen consumption rate (OCR), in the context of a decrease in kidney ATP, indicated mitochondrial uncoupling. Taken together, these data show that changes in mitochondrial bioenergetics and dynamics may precede the development of the renal lesion in diabetes, and this supports the hypothesis that mitochondrial dysfunction is a primary cause of DKD.
26977190	Application of 7-azaisatins in enantioselective Morita-Baylis-Hillman reaction.	7-Azaisatin and 7-azaoxindole skeletons are valuable building blocks in diverse biologically active substances. Here 7-azaisatins turned out to be more efficient electrophiles than the analogous isatins in the enantioselective Morita-Baylis-Hillman (MBH) reactions with maleimides using a bifunctional tertiary amine, beta-isocupreidine (beta-ICD), as the catalyst. This route allows a convenient approach to access multifunctional 3-hydroxy-7-aza-2-oxindoles with high enantiopurity (up to 94% ee). Other types of activated alkenes, such as acrylates and acrolein, could also be efficiently utilized.
26909351	Conservative Management of a Scar Abscess formed in a Cesarean-induced Isthmocele.	BACKGROUND: Abscesses located in the cesarean-section (CS) induced isthmoceles are rarely encountered and are usually treated surgically, mostly by hysterectomy. CASE DESCRIPTION: We here report the case of a 40-year-old primiparous woman presenting a symptomatic abscess in the isthmocele 10 years after a CS. She was treated by antibiotics and was closely monitored by clinical evaluation, ultrasonography, and pelvic magnetic resonance imaging. This treatment led to complete resolution of symptoms and a disappearance of the abscess at imagery. CONCLUSION: Our report shows that a conservative medical management of isthmocele abscesses can be an effective approach in women wishing to preserve their uterus.
26875871	Can a simple question predict prolonged uroflow lag times in children?	OBJECTIVE: It is our experience that some children with bowel and bladder dysfunction (BBD) who have bladder neck dysfunction had a tendency to complain of dizziness when we subjected the patients with dizziness to tilt-table testing to confirm the diagnosis of autonomic dysfunction. From these findings we postulated that patients who complain of dizziness are likely to have prolonged lag times that are a proxy for bladder neck dysfunction (BND). STUDY DESIGN: This was an Institute Review Board-approved study in which we enrolled new patients in a sequential fashion who were referred to our outpatient urology offices for evaluation of BBD over a 3-month period. All patients were asked if they frequently experienced dizziness when they rapidly stood from a sitting or lying down position or when they raised their head rapidly. An analysis of the following parameters was undertaken: prevalence of dizziness, bladder neck dysfunction, and comorbid psychiatric problems. Uroflowmetry findings were analyzed as well. RESULTS: Tilt-table group: In the tilt-table group the median age of the patients was 14.5 (4.5-18) years for the five males and five females who were tested. All males and four out of five females experienced a blood pressure drops of 20 mmHg or more on table tilting and three experienced syncope. All patients had prolonged lag times, with an average lag time of 16.5 s. All these patients were able to tolerate alpha-blockers once they were adequately hydrated and salt loaded. Alpha-blocker dosing was increased gradually. In the questionnaire group, 212 patients were initially enrolled: 125 girls and 87 boys. Eleven of 12 males and eleven of 16 females had prolonged lag times when dizziness was present. Sensitivity was 92% and 69%, specificity was 80% and 91% respectively for male and females. Analysis of the psychiatric history revealed a statistically significant association with dizziness and neuropsychiatric problems in the patients and family members. CONCLUSION: We have been able to show a high degree of sensitivity in male patients and a high degree of specificity in female patients that a simple question, "Do you get dizzy on rising in the morning or with rapid standing?", is a reliable marker for BND in children. We have also seen that there is an association between dizziness and psychiatric problems in patients and in family members. It appears from our results and the available literature that autonomic dysfunction is commonly associated with BND and dizziness can be a simple proxy question to identify this problem.
28090581	Two-faced activity of RNF8: What "twists" it from a genome guardian to a cancer facilitator?	The RING finger protein 8 (RNF8)-induced ubiquitination signaling cascade promotes DNA repair and maintains genomic stability. Our study reveals an unexpected action of RNF8 in promoting cancer metastasis, cancer stem cell formation, and chemoresistance through the regulation of TWIST lysine 63 (K63)-linked ubiquitination, suggesting that RNF8 may serve as a new cancer prognosis marker and therapeutic target.
27997548	Using Diffusion Tensor Imaging to Evaluate Microstructural Changes and Outcomes after Radiofrequency Rhizotomy of Trigeminal Nerves in Patients with Trigeminal Neuralgia.	Trigeminal neuralgia is characterized by facial pain that may be sudden, intense, and recurrent. Our aim was to investigate microstructural tissue changes of the trigeminal nerve in patients with trigeminal neuralgia resulting from neurovascular compression by diffusion tensor imaging, and to test the predictive value of diffusion tensor imaging for determining outcomes after radiofrequency rhizotomy. Forty-three patients with trigeminal neuralgia were recruited, and diffusion tensor imaging was performed before radiofrequency rhizotomy. By selecting the cisternal segment of the trigeminal nerve manually, we measured the volume of trigeminal nerve, fractional anisotropy, apparent diffusion coefficient, axial diffusivity, and radial diffusivity. The apparent diffusion coefficient and mean value of fractional anisotropy, axial diffusivity, and radial diffusivity were compared between the affected and normal side in the same patient, and were correlated with pre-rhizotomy and post-rhizotomy visual analogue scale pain scores. The results showed the affected side had significantly decreased fractional anisotropy, increased apparent diffusion coefficient and radial diffusivity, and no significant change of axial diffusivity. The volume of the trigeminal nerve on affected side was also significantly smaller. There was a trend of fractional anisotropy reduction and visual analogue scale pain score reduction (P = 0.072). The results suggest that demyelination without axonal injury, and decreased size of the trigeminal nerve, are the microstructural abnormalities of the trigeminal nerve in patients with trigeminal neuralgia caused by neurovascular compression. The application of diffusion tensor imaging in understanding the pathophysiology of trigeminal neuralgia, and predicting the treatment effect has potential and warrants further study.
27703328	Effect of low dose of intrathecal pethidine on the incidence and intensity of shivering during cesarean section under spinal anesthesia: a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial.	INTRODUCTION: Shivering is among the unpleasant and potentially harmful side effects of spinal anesthesia. The aim of this randomized double-blind clinical trial was to compare the antishivering effect of two different doses of intrathecal pethidine on the incidence and intensity of shivering and other side effects in patients who underwent cesarean section. METHODS: In this study, 150 parturient females scheduled for nonemergent cesarean section were randomly allocated to three groups. Spinal anesthesia was performed with 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine (12.5 mg), plus 0.5 mL of 0.9% saline in the standard group (S group), and the same dose of bupivacaine with 5 mg (P5 group) or 10 mg of pethidine (P10 group). Demographic and surgical data, incidence and intensity of shivering (primary outcome), hemodynamic indices, forehead and core temperatures, maximum sensory level, Apgar scores, and adverse events were evaluated by a blinded observer. RESULTS: There were no significant differences between the three study groups regarding the demographic and surgical data, hemodynamic indices, core temperatures, and maximum sensory level (P>0.05). The incidence and intensity of shivering were significantly less in the P5 and P10 groups (P<0.001) when compared with the S group. There were no significant differences between groups for secondary outcomes, except pruritus, which was more common in the P5 and P10 groups when compared with the S group (P=0.01). CONCLUSION: Low dose of intrathecal pethidine is safe, and can decrease the incidence and intensity of shivering during cesarean section, without having major side effects.
27373628	Isopetrosynol, a New Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase 1B Inhibitor, from the Marine Sponge Halichondria cf. panicea Collected at Iriomote Island.	A new polyacetylene compound, isopetrosynol (1), was isolated from the Okinawan marine sponge Halichondria cf. panicea together with petrosynol (2), adociacetylene D (3), (5R)-3,15,27-triacontatriene-1,29-diyn-5-ol (4), and petrosterol (5). The structure of 1 was assigned on the basis of spectroscopic data for 1 and 2. Compound 1 inhibited protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) activity with an IC50 value of 8.2+/-0.3 microM, while compound 2, a diastereomer of 1, showed only 28.9+/-4.5% inhibition at 21.6 microM. The IC50 values of compounds 3 and 4 were 7.8+/-0.5 and 12.2+/-0.5 microM, respectively. Oleanolic acid, a positive control, inhibited PTP1B activity at 0.7+/-0.1 microM (IC50) in the same experiment. The inhibitory activity of 1 was stronger than that of its diastereomer (2). This is the first study to show the inhibitory effects of polyacetylene compounds on PTP1B.
26841175	[Geriatric assessment in physicians' practices: evolution and current application].	There is substantial variation in the health of the older population. Primary care physicians are in demand of a quick overview of their patients' health in order to determine who is at risk of decline and dependency. A geriatric assessment aims to meet these requirements. Its intention is to facilitate care tailored to the individual needs. The following article gives an account of how geriatric assessment is currently applied in primary care. It provides evidence as to its effectiveness and critically discusses the use of standard instruments. Currently, easy to administer instruments are being tested in primary care for targeting frail older people and assessing their needs.
27855776	Periprosthetic bone density changes after MiniHipTM cementless femoral short stem: one-year results of dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry study.	INTRODUCTION: The purpose of the current study was to investigate the reaction of the femur to the implantation of the MiniHipTM in terms of: (1) bone density change during one year; (2) correlations between stem length, CCD (caput-collum-diaphyseal), femoral offset, T-value, and bone density; (3) other co-variables that influence the change of bone density. PATIENTS AND METHODS: MiniHipTM implant was performed for 62 patients. The age range of the patients who underwent treatment was 25-78 years. Periprothestic bone density was determined within two weeks postoperatively, after three, six, and twelve months utilizing the DEXA scan. RESULTS: The highest change was observed in the first three months post-implantation, while significant decrease in density was recorded at proximal Gruen zones 1, 2, and 7, and at distal Gruen zone 4. The decrease in density reached a plateau between the third and sixth months after operation. Afterwards, bone density recovered up to the 12th postoperative month. The correlation analysis showed significant difference between Gruen zone 1 and stem size and CCD. The same significant trend was not reached for Gruen zone 7. Femoral offset showed no correlation. Covariance analysis was unable to establish connection of the results with diagnosis, pairings, or gender. DISCUSSION: MiniHipTM densitometric results are promising and comparable to good results of the other representatives of the femoral neck partially-sustaining short stem prostheses with a lower proximal bone density reduction. Periprosthetic bone resorption is a multifactorial process where stem size, CCD angle, and patient-specific variables such as T-value have an impact on the periprosthetic bone remodeling. In particular, this applies to Gruen zone 1.
27266212	A 10-Year Clinical Experience of Gestational Trophoblastic Disease at Rajavithi Hospital, 2001-2010.	BACKGROUND: Gestational trophoblastic disease (GTD) develops from abnormal cellular proliferation of trophoblasts following fertilization and is categorized as either an hydatidiform mole (HM) or a gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN). OBJECTIVE: To analyze the clinical characteristics, incidence and treatment outcomes of GTD at Rajavithi Hospital. MATERIAL AND METHOD: Medical records of women diagnosed with GTD at Rajavithi Hospital from January 1, 2001 to December 31, 2010 were retrospectively reviewed. Disease diagnosis, treatment and follow-up data were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 329 cases of GTD were reviewed. HM was diagnosed in 167 patients (incidence 2.32 per 1,000 deliveries); 26 patients were lost to follow-up; and 49 of the remaining 141 patients (34.8%) developed post-molar GTN. In multivariable analysis, uterus >16 week size and pre-treatment human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) level >250,000 mIU/mL were the significant risk factors for developing post-molar GTN. Of 162 patients with GTN (incidence 2.25 per 1,000 deliveries), 15 patients were lost to follow-up, and 116 patients, 29 patients and 2 patients were classified as having low-risk GTN, high-risk GTN and placental site trophoblastic disease respectively. The overall survival rate in the low-risk group was 100% whereas in the high-risk group it was 86.2%. A modified WHO prognostic score of more than five was the significant risk factor for developing resistant GTN. CONCLUSION: GTD treatment at Rajavithi Hospital showed excellent clinical outcomes. Uterus >16 weeks size and pre- treatment hCG > 250,000 mIU/mL were the significant risk factors for developing post-molar GTN in HM patients. Classifying GTN patients into low- and high-risk groups was useful in planning treatment and counseling.
27395890	First record of the Indo-Pacific areolate grouper Epinephelus areolatus (Forsskal, 1775) (Perciformes: Epinephelidae) in the Mediterranean Sea.	The number of alien species in the Mediterranean Sea is steadily increasing and it seems that the pace has been accelerating since the turn of the century (Galil et al. 2014). In 2015 alone five additional fish species have been reported, Epinephelus geoffroyi (Klunzinger, 1870) (Golani et al. 2015); Stolephorus indicus (van Hasselt, 1823) (Fricke et al. 2015); Sardinella gibbosa (Bleeker, 1849) (Stern et al. 2015); Mobula japanica (Muller & Henle, 1841) (Capape et al. 2015); and Cryptocentrus caeruleopunctatus (Ruppell, 1830) (Rothman & Goren 2015). Among the ca. 100 alien fish species reported from the Mediterranean to date (Galil & Goren 2014), five Indo-Pacific species belong to the genus Epinephelus Bloch, 1793: Epinephelus coioides (Hamilton, 1822), Epinephelus fasciatus (Forsskal, 1775), Epinephelus malabaricus (Bloch and Schneider, 1804) Epinephelus merra Bloch, 1793 (Golani et al. 2013a) and Epinephelus geoffroyi (Klunzinger, 1870) (Golani et al. 2015). Additional alien Epinephelus species reported from the Mediterranean are excluded for various reasons (Golani et al. 2013b). Here we report the finding of a sixth Indo-Pacific species of this genus along the Mediterranean coast of Israel.
27349052	[The links between neuropsychology and neurophysiology].	AIM: The aim of the study was to establish current scope of knowledge regarding associations between neurophysiological functioning, neuropsychology and psychoterapy. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A systematic review was performed including 93 publications from Science Server, which contains the collections of Elsevier, Springer Journals, SCI-Ex/ICM, MEDLINE/PubMed, and SCOPUS. The works have been selected basing on following key words: 'neuropsychology, neurocognitive correlates, electrodermal response, event related potential, EEG, pupillography, electromiography' out of papers published between 2004-2015. RESULTS: Present reports on the use of neurophysiological methods in psychology can be divided into two areas: experimental research and research of the practical use of conditioning techniques and biofeedback in the treatment of somatic disease. Among the experimental research the following have been distinguished: research based on the startle reflex, physiological reaction to novelty, stress, type/amount of cognitive load and physiological correlates of emotion; research on the neurophysiological correlates of mental disorders, mostly mood and anxiety disorders, and neurocognitive correlates: of memory, attention, learning and intelligence. Among papers regarding the use of neurophysiological methods in psychology two types are the most frequent: on the mechanisms of biofeedback, related mainly to neuro- feedback, which is a quickly expanding method of various attention and mental disorders'treatment, and also research of the use of conditioning techniques in the treatment of mental disorders, especially depression and anxiety. A special place among all the above is taken by the research on electrophysiological correlates of psychotherapy, aiming to differentiate between the efficacy of various psychotherapeutic schools (the largest amount of publications regard the efficacy of cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy) in patients of different age groups and different diagnosis.
27239480	Comparison of Intranasal Outer Membrane Vesicles with Cholera Toxin and Injected MF59C.1 as Adjuvants for Malaria Transmission Blocking Antigens AnAPN1 and Pfs48/45.	Purified protein vaccines often require adjuvants for efficient stimulation of immune responses. There is no licensed mucosal adjuvant on the market to adequately boost the immune response to purified antigens for intranasal applications in humans. Bacterial outer membrane vesicles (OMV) are attractive candidates potentially combining antigenic and adjuvant properties in one substance. To more precisely characterize the potential of Escherichia coli OMV for intranasal vaccination with heterologous antigens, immune responses for AnAPN1 and Pfs48/45 as well as ovalbumin as a reference antigen were assessed in mice. The intranasal adjuvant cholera toxin (CT) and parenteral adjuvant MF59C.1 were used in comparison. Vaccinations were administered intranasally or subcutaneously. Antibodies (total IgG and IgM as well as subclasses IgG1, IgG2a, IgG2b, and IgG3) were measured by ELISA. T cell responses (cytotoxic T cells, Th1, Th17, and regulatory T cells) were determined by flow cytometry. When OMV were used as adjuvant for intranasal immunization, antibody and cellular responses against all three antigens could be induced, comparable to cholera toxin and MF59C.1. Antigen-specific IgG titres above 1 : 10(5) could be detected in all groups. This study provides the rationale for further development of OMV as a vaccination strategy in malaria and other diseases.
27051434	Role of Mas receptor in renal blood flow response to angiotensin-(1-7) in ovariectomized estradiol treated rats.	The angiotensin 1-7 (Ang 1-7), is abundantly produced in kidneys and antagonizes the function of angiotensin II through Mas receptor (MasR) or other unknown mechanisms. In the current study, the role of MasR and steroid hormone estrogen on renal blood flow response to Ang 1-7 administration was investigated in ovariectomized (OV) female rats. OV female Wistar-rats received estradiol (500 mug/kg/week) or vehicle for two weeks. In the day of the experiment, the animals were anesthetized, cannulated, and the responses including mean arterial pressure, renal blood flow (RBF), and renal vascular resistance at the constant level of renal perfusion pressure to graded infusion of Ang 1-7 at 0, 100 and 300 ng/kg/min were determined in OV and OV estradiol-treated (OVE) rats, treated with vehicle or MasR antagonist; A779. RBF response to Ang 1-7 infusion increased dose-dependently in vehicle (Pdose <0.001) and A779-treated (Pdose <0.01) animals. However, when MasR was blocked, the RBF response to Ang 1-7 significantly increased in OV animals compared with OVE rats (P<0.05). When estradiol was limited by ovariectomy, A779 increased RBF response to Ang 1-7 administration, while this response was attenuated in OVE animals.
27253450	High Expression of HULC Is Associated with Poor Prognosis in Osteosarcoma Patients.	Osteosarcoma (OS) is the most common primary bone cancer in childhood. OS is an aggressive disease, and metastatic patients evolve with very poor clinical outcomes. Genetically, OSs are extremely complex tumors, and the related metastatic process is not well understood in terms of the biology of the disease. In this context, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have emerged as an important class of gene expression regulators that play key roles in the invasion and metastasis of several human tumors. Here, we evaluated the expression of HULC, which is an lncRNA that is associated with the tumor metastatic process, and assessed its potential role as a prognostic marker in OS. HULC expression was evaluated in primary OS samples using real-time RT-PCR. HULC expression status was determined by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, and its association with survival was assessed using the Kaplan-Meier method. The HULC expression level was not significantly associated with the clinicopathological characteristics of the OS patients. However, our data demonstrated that higher levels of expression of HULC were associated with lower survival rates in OS patients, both in terms of overall and event-free survival. Elevated HULC expression was associated with poor clinical outcomes among the OS patients, which suggests that HULC could be a potential prognostic biomarker in OS.
27579438	Complete Vesicourethral Anastomotic Disruption Following Prostatectomy.	Vesicourethral anastomotic (VUA) disruption with bladder displacement into the abdominal cavity following robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy (RALP) is an exceedingly rare complication. There have been no cited case reports after robotic surgery but case reports after open radical prostatectomy have been noted. Other complications related to VUA include bleeding with or without pelvic hematoma, bladder neck contracture, or severe stress urinary incontinence. Following radical prostatectomy, studies estimate the rate of VUA leakage to be 1.4% and no exact rate of complete disruption is known given its rarity. However, the majority of these cases are managed conservatively and rarely require reoperation. To date, there are no published studies that describe complete VUA and bladder displacement secondary to a large pelvic hematoma following prostatectomy. We report a rare case of VUA disruption after RALP successfully managed with conservative treatment.
27453860	Depressive symptoms and bone mineral density in menopause and postmenopausal women: A still increasing and neglected problem.	BACKGROUND: The association between depression and loss of bone mineral density (BMD) has been reported as controversial. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the current study was to investigate whether an association exists between depression and low BMD during the menopausal and postmenopausal period. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional descriptive study was used to generate menopause symptoms experienced by Arabian women at the Primary Health Care Centers in Qatar. A multi-stage sampling design was used, and a representative sample of 1650 women aged 45-65 years were included during July 2012 and November 2013. This prospective study explored the association between bone density and major depressive disorder in women. Bone mineral densitometry measurements (BMD) (g/m(2)) were assessed at the BMD unit using a lunar prodigy DXA system (Lunar Corp., Madison, WI). Data on body mass index (BMI), clinical biochemistry variables including serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D were collected. The Beck Depression Inventory was administered for depression purposes. RESULTS: Out of 1650 women 1182 women agreed to participate in the study (71.6%). The mean age and standard deviation (SD) of the menopausal age were 48.71 +/- 2.96 with depressed and 50.20 +/- 3.22 without depressed (P < 0.001). Furthermore, the mean and SD of postmenopausal age were 58.55 +/- 3.27 with depression and 57.78 +/- 3.20 without depression (P < 0.001). There were statistically significant differences between menopausal stages with regards to a number of parity, and place of living. There were statistically significant differences between menopausal stages with regards to BMI, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, Vitamin D deficiency, calcium deficiency and shisha smoking habits. Overall, osteopenia and osteoporosis and bone loss were significantly lower in postmenopausal women than in menopausal women (P < 0.001). Similarly, T-score and Z-score were lower with depression menopause and postmenopausal women (P < 0.001). The multivariate logistic regression analyses revealed that the depression, the mean serum Vitamin D deficiency, calcium level deficiency, less physical activity, comorbidity, number of parity, systolic and diastolic blood pressure and shisha smoking habits were considered as the main risk factors associated with bone mineral loss after adjusting for age, BMI and other variables. CONCLUSION: Depression is associated with low BMD with a substantially greater BMD decrease in depressed women and cases of clinical depression. Depression should be considered as an important risk factor for osteoporosis.
28025647	Corrigendum to "The Effects of Cytokines in Adipose Stem Cell-Conditioned Medium on the Migration and Proliferation of Skin Fibroblasts In Vitro".	[This corrects the article DOI: 10.1155/2013/578479.].
26882115	The Frequency of Huntington Disease and Huntington Disease-Like 2 in the South African Population.	BACKGROUND: Huntington disease (HD) has most recently been estimated to affect between 10.6 and 13.7 per 100,000 individuals in European populations. However, prevalence is known to differ geographically. In South Africa, the only published estimates are from a survey performed in the 1970s, an era when the disease was believed to be rare or absent in black individuals and molecular confirmation was absent. The disease phenotype in South Africa is currently attributable to mutations in both the huntington and junctophilin-3 genes, which underlie the well-known HD and the rarer HD-like 2 (HDL2) respectively. This study aimed at providing improved minimum estimates of disease frequency in South Africa, based on molecular genetic testing data. METHODS: A review of all testing records for HD and HDL2 over a 20-year period was undertaken. HDL2 is virtually indistinguishable on clinical features, thus necessitating its inclusion. RESULTS: Based on molecular diagnostic records, minimum estimates of disease frequency are: 5.1, 2.1 and 0.25 (per 100,000 individuals) for the white, mixed ancestry and black population groups respectively. CONCLUSION: Although ascertainment remains incomplete, these minimum estimates suggest that disease frequencies are significantly higher than those previously reported in South Africa.
27847643	Novel perspectives on swept-source optical coherence tomography.	Technologies for multimodal digital imaging of vitreoretinal diseases have improved the accuracy of diagnosis and the depth of the knowledge of the mechanisms of disease and their response to treatments. Optic coherence tomography (OCT) has become a mandatory tool for the management and for the follow-up of retinal pathologies. OCT technology evolved in the last two decades from time-domain to spectral domain and recently to the swept-source OCTs (SS-OCT). SS-OCT improved the depth of imaging and the scan speed, thus adding novel algorithms and features such as for vitreous and vitreoretinal interface evaluation, choroid segmentation and mapping, OCT angiography and En-face OCT. The multimodal approach using SS-OCT is expected to advance the understanding of retinal pathologies such as age related macular degeneration, diabetic maculopathy, central serous chorioretinopathy, the pachychoroid spectrum and macular telangiectasia. Surgical vitreoretinal diseases such as vitreo-macular traction syndrome, epiretinal membrane, retinal detachment, proliferative vitreoretinal retinopathy and diabetic traction retinal detachment also will be better understood and documented with SS-OCT. This technology also provides great utility for a broad spectrum of ophthalmic pathologies including glaucoma, uveitis, tumors and anterior segment evaluation.
27547585	Bone lesions in Chinese POEMS syndrome patients: imaging characteristics and clinical implications.	Objective. Bone lesion is crucial for diagnosing and management of polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, monoclonal protein, and skin change (POEMS) syndrome, a rare plasma cell disorder. This study is to compare the effectiveness of X-ray skeletal survey (SS) and computed tomography (CT) for detecting bone lesions in Chinese POEMS syndrome patients, and to investigate the relationship between bone lesion features and serum markers. Methods. SS and chest/abdomen/pelvic CT images of 38 Chinese patients (26 males, 12 females, aged 21-70 years) with POEMS syndrome recruited at our medical center between January 2013 and January 2015 were retrospectively analyzed. Bone lesions identified by CT were further categorized according to the size (<5 mm, 5-10 mm, >10 mm) and appearance (osteosclerotic, lytic, mixed). The percentage of plasma cells in bone marrow smears, type of immunoglobulin, platelet (Plt), and levels of serum bone metabolic markers and inflammatory factors including alkaline phosphatase (ALP), calcium, phosphate, parathyroid hormone (PTH), beta-isomerized C-telopeptide (beta-CTx), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and interleukin (IL)-6 levels were also recorded. Results. Of the 38 POEMS syndrome patients, the immunoglobulin heavy chain isotypes were IgA in 25 patients (65.8%; 25/38) and IgG in 13 patients (34.2%; 13/38), and the light chain isotypes were lambda in 35 patients (92.1%; 35/38) and kappa in 3 patients (7.9%; 3/38). There were 23 patients with thrombocytosis. More patients with bone lesions were detected by CT than by SS (97.4% vs. 86.8%). The most commonly affected location was the pelvis (89.5%), followed by the spine, clavicle/scapula/sternum/ribs, skull, and long bones. Of the 38 POEMS syndrome patients, 35 (94.6%) had osteosclerotic and 32 (86.5%) had mixed lesions. Osteosclerotic lesions were typically scattered, variable in size, and plaque-like, whereas mixed lesions were pouch-shaped or soup bubble-like with a clear sclerotic margin and were generally larger. Although the majority of bone lesions were small in size, 23 (62.2%) had at least one lesion >10 mm. There was no correlation between serum marker levels and bone lesion patterns after Bonferroni correction (all P > 0.001). Conclusions. CT is more sensitive and accurate than SS in detecting bone lesions in POEMS syndrome.
27853107	Mechanisms underlying the toxic effects of antimony species in human embryonic kidney cells (HEK-293) and their comparison with arsenic species.	Antimony cytotoxicity was assessed in human embryonic kidney cells (HEK-293). Uptake, mitochondrial respiratory activity, ROS generation and diffusional kinetics were measured using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP). Furthermore, the toxic effect induced by Sb was compared with As toxicity in regard to ROS generation and diffusional kinetics, which provides information on the protein aggregation process. Our results show a favored uptake of Sb(III) and a more severe effect, decreasing the mitochondrial activity more than in the presence of Sb(V). In comparison with As, the Sb species did not generate a significant increase in ROS generation, which was observed with As(III) and As(V). FRAP analysis yielded important information on the diffusion and binding dynamics of live cells in presence of these metalloids. The mobile fraction showed a strong decrease with the As species and Sb(III). The diffusion rate and the koff-rate were significantly decreased for the As and Sb species but were more strong in the presence of As(III).
27635398	Annotating the Function of the Human Genome with Gene Ontology and Disease Ontology.	Increasing evidences indicated that function annotation of human genome in molecular level and phenotype level is very important for systematic analysis of genes. In this study, we presented a framework named Gene2Function to annotate Gene Reference into Functions (GeneRIFs), in which each functional description of GeneRIFs could be annotated by a text mining tool Open Biomedical Annotator (OBA), and each Entrez gene could be mapped to Human Genome Organisation Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) gene symbol. After annotating all the records about human genes of GeneRIFs, 288,869 associations between 13,148 mRNAs and 7,182 terms, 9,496 associations between 948 microRNAs and 533 terms, and 901 associations between 139 long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) and 297 terms were obtained as a comprehensive annotation resource of human genome. High consistency of term frequency of individual gene (Pearson correlation = 0.6401, p = 2.2e - 16) and gene frequency of individual term (Pearson correlation = 0.1298, p = 3.686e - 14) in GeneRIFs and GOA shows our annotation resource is very reliable.
27242765	Snapshot of a Bacterial Microbiome Shift during the Early Symptoms of a Massive Sponge Die-Off in the Western Mediterranean.	Ocean warming is affecting marine benthic ecosystems through mass mortality events that involve marine invertebrates, in particular bivalves, corals, and sponges. Among these events, extensive die-offs of Ircinia fasciculata sponges have been recurrently reported in western Mediterranean. The goal of our study was to test whether the temperature-related mass sponge die-offs were associated with or preceded by an early unbalanced bacterial microbiome in the sponge tissues. We took advantage of the early detection of disease and compared the microbiomes of healthy vs. early diseased I. fasciculata tissues. Our results showed a microbiome shift in early diseased tissues. The abundance of Gammaproteobacteria and Acidobacteria increased and that of Deltaproteobacteria decreased in diseased vs. healthy tissues. The change in community composition was also noticeable at the operational taxonomic unit (OTU) level. Diseased tissues contained more bacterial sequences previously identified in injured or stressed sponges and corals than healthy tissues. Bacterial diversity increased significantly in diseased tissues, which contained a higher number of low abundance OTUs. Our results do not support the hypothesis of one particular pathogen, whether a Vibrio or any other bacteria, triggering the Northwestern Mediterranean mass mortalities of I. fasciculata. Our data rather suggest an early disruption of the bacterial microbiome balance in healthy sponges through a shift in OTU abundances, and the purported consequent decline of the sponge fitness and resistance to infections. Opportunistic bacteria could colonize the sponge tissues, taking benefit of the sponge weakness, before one or more virulent pathogens might proliferate ending in the mass sponge die-off.
26850041	Subchronic exposure to static magnetic field differently affects zinc and copper content in murine organs.	PURPOSE: Static magnetic fields (SMF) have been widely used in research, medicine and industry. Since zinc and copper play an important role in biological systems, we studied the effects of the subchronic continuous SMF exposure on their distribution in murine tissues. MATERIALS AND METHODS: For 30 days, mice were exposed to inhomogeneous, vertical, downward or upward oriented SMF of 1 mT averaged intensity with spatial gradient in vertical direction. RESULTS: SMF decreased the amount of copper and zinc in liver. In brain, zinc levels were increased and copper levels were decreased. In spleen, zinc content was reduced, while copper amount remained unchanged. CONCLUSIONS: Subchronic exposure to SMF differently affected copper and zinc content in examined organs, and the changes were more pronounced for the downward oriented field. The outcome could be attributed to the protective, rather than the harmful effect of SMF.
27313866	Cationic Thiolated Poly(aspartamide) Polymer as a Potential Excipient for Artificial Tear Formulations.	Dry eye disease is a relatively common ocular problem, which causes eye discomfort and visual disorders leading to a decrease in the quality of life. The aim of this study was to find a possible excipient for eye drop formulations, which is able to stabilize the tear film. A cationic thiolated polyaspartamide polymer, poly[(N-mercaptoethylaspartamide)-co-(N-(N',N'-dimethylaminoethyl)aspartamide)] (ThioPASP-DME), was used as a potential vehicle. Besides satisfying the basic requirements, the chemical structure of ThioPASP-DME is similar to those of ocular mucins as it is a protein-like polymer bearing a considerable number of thiol groups. The solution of the polymer is therefore able to mimic the physiological properties of the mucins and it can interact with the mucus layer via disulphide bond formation. The resultant mucoadhesion provides a prolonged residence time and ensures protective effect for the corneal/conjunctival epithelium. ThioPASP-DME also has an antioxidant effect due to the presence of the thiol groups. The applicability of ThioPASP-DME as a potential excipient in eye drops was determined by means of ocular compatibility tests and through examinations of the interactions with the mucosal surface. The results indicate that ThioPASP-DME can serve as a potential eye drop excipient for the therapy of dry eye disease.
27446230	Commentary on the article "Postpartum women's use of medicines and breastfeeding practices: a systematic review".	This commentary follows the article of Moni R. Saha and her co-authors, entitled "Postpartum women's use of medicines and breastfeeding practices: a systematic review." As highlighted in this systematic review, medication use is common during the postpartum period often creating difficulty for mothers. Several studies illustrate the negative impact medication has on breastfeeding, initiation and duration despite reassuring advice from health professionals. Current data only describe the use of medication and behavior adopted by mothers when medication is prescribed. The factors influencing maternal behaviors have not been studied. Behaviors depend on knowledge, representations and attitudes. To better understand the behaviors of mothers faced with medication, we conducted a qualitative study, utilizing semi-structured interviews to investigate knowledge, risk perception and difficulties women experienced. The study consisted of a description and comparison of the perceived needs of two populations: 19 breastfeeding mothers and 12 health professionals. Divergences between the two populations were highlighted, focusing specifically, on knowledge needed by the women. This commentary is intended to highlight the need for further research essential to explain the influences on maternal behavior when medication is a consideration, allowing health professionals to better help mothers deal with these situations frequently affecting their breastfeeding plans.
26831503	The choice between hip prosthetic bearing surfaces in total hip replacement: a protocol for a systematic review and network meta-analysis.	BACKGROUND: Prosthetic hip implants have many combinations of bearing surface materials, sizes, and fixation techniques, which can determine the quality of life of patients after primary total hip replacement (THR) and the likelihood of needing revision surgery. When an implant fails, patients require revision THR, which is distressing to the patient and expensive for the health care payer. Primary THR is one of the most common elective procedures performed worldwide, with over 300,000 performed annually in the USA and over 80,000 in England and Wales. It is important to review all available randomised controlled trial (RCT) evidence to determine which implant bearing surface materials, size, and fixation technique are most effective for patients. METHODS/DESIGN: This is a protocol for a systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs comparing outcomes of hip implant bearing surfaces, size, and fixation techniques used in THR. Implant combinations compared in the literature include four bearing surface combinations (metal-on-polyethylene, metal-on-metal, ceramic-on-polyethylene, and ceramic-on-ceramic); two femoral head sizes (large vs small heads); and four fixation techniques (uncemented, cemented, hybrid, and reverse hybrids). The primary outcome will be revision surgery. We will also collect data on patient characteristics, mortality, quality of life, and other outcomes. In network meta-analysis, we will estimate the relative effectiveness of every implant bearing surface, head size (large vs small), and fixation permutation, using evidence where implants have been compared directly in an RCT and indirectly through common comparators in different RCTs. DISCUSSION: There has been much debate about materials used for prosthetic implants in THR. Different combinations of prosthetic materials, sizes, and fixation, can vary widely in cost and fail at different rates for different patient groups. Given the number of THRs performed yearly, and the increasing use of expensive implants, it is important to review evidence to inform surgeons, patients, and health care providers of optimal implant bearing combinations for given patient characteristics. This review will inform a cost-effectiveness model that will include evidence from other sources, to determine the most effective and cost-effective implant bearing combination for patients.

27228771	[Long-Term Different Fertilizations Changed the Chemical and Spectrum Characteristics of DOM of the Irrigation-Desert Soil in North-Western China].	By using Ultraviolet-visible Spectrometry, Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometer and Elemental Analyzer, spectrum and chemical characteristics of soil DOM affected by long-term different fertilizations were investigated in irrigation-desert soil in North-western China based on an experiment started from 1988. Four different fertilization treatments were included, i. e., organic fertilizer (OF), green manure (GM), chemical fertilizer (CF) and a control of no fertilization (CK). The results showed that fertilization could increase the contents of DOM. Compared to CK, the treatments of OF, GM, CF increased the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) by 37%, 29%, 16%; increased the dissolved nitrogen (DON) by 334%, 257%, 182%; increased the total carbohydrate (TCs) by 90%, 25%, 2%; and increased the total organic acids (TOAs) by 195%, 116%, 58%; respectively. Furthermore, DOC, DON, TCs, and TOAs in the OF treatment were significantly higher than those in CK, they were also significantly higher in the GM and CF treatments except for TCs. The ultraviolet-visible analysis showed that fertilizations enhanced the SUVA(254), SUVA(260), SUVA(272) and SUVA(280) of DOM, indicating that fertilizations increased the aromatic and hydrophobic percentage, humification degree, and average molecular weight, and thus resulting in more stability of DOM. Same trends were showed for all the 4 ultraviolet spectrum absorption values in different fertilizations, i. e., the strongest effect was found in the OF treatment, and then was the GM treatment and CF treatment successively. From the results by the Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometry, the characteristic peak of aromatic in the OF treatment was observed shifting from 1 625 to 1 649 cm(-1), which was close to the characteristic peak of humin, suggesting that the aromaticity of DOM in the OF treatment was higher than the other treatments. The characteristic peaks of C-O at 1 260-1 000 cm(-1) belonging to sugar, alcohol, and carboxylic acid were highest in the GM treatment, showing that the green manure could increase rich oxygen radicals. The highest characteristic peaks of N-H at 3 559, 3 419 and 1 456 cm(-1) were observed in the CF treatment, indicating that the chemical fertilizer could increase amine substances. The contents of C, O and N in the OF, GM, CF treatments were also increased respectively according to the elemental analysis.
27752376	Refractory IgD Multiple Myeloma Treated with Daratumumab: A Case Report and Literature Review.	Patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma have poor prognosis. A recent analysis of patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma who were refractory to both proteasome inhibitors and immunomodulatory drugs showed the median overall survival of 9 months only. Daratumumab is the first-in-class human monoclonal antibody against CD38 cells which was studied in phase I/II trials for treatment of these patients with relapsed refractory multiple myeloma. It showed an overall response rate of 36% and a median overall survival (OS) of 17 months in these patients. We report a case of 40-year-old man with immunoglobulin D (IgD) multiple myeloma whose disease was refractory to at least 5 different chemotherapy regimens including proteasome inhibitors and immunomodulatory drugs. The clinical studies assessing daratumumab did not include any patients with IgD myeloma which is a rare form of multiple myeloma and to our knowledge is the first study reporting use of daratumumab in IgD myeloma.
27876985	In vitro anti-leishmanial activity of Satureja hortensis and Artemisia dracunculus extracts on Leishmania major promastigotes.	Cutaneous leishmaniasis is one of the important skin diseases with diverse clinical manifestations. With an incidence of 0.7-1.3 million cases annually, this disease is often reported from six countries, including Iran. Accordingly, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the anti-leishmanial effect of the three plant hydroalcoholic extracts including fleawort (Plantago psyllium L.), savory (Satureja hortensis L.) and tarragon (Artemisia dracunculus L.) on Leishmania major promastigotes. The hydroalcoholic extract from each plant was extracted and its anti-leishmanial effect was evaluated in different concentrations (100-1000 microg/ml) and at various hours (24, 48 and 72 h). Savory herb inhibitory concentration 50 % (IC50) at 24, 48 and 72 h was 790.81, 398.11 and 298.42 microg/ml, respectively. In addition, tarragon herb IC50 at 24, 48 and 72 h was 962.03, 688.36 and 585.51 microg/ml, respectively. Moreover, the fleawort extract was showed the lowest effect, considering that its effect at the concentration of 1000 microg/ml was 48 % after 72 h (P > 0.05). Furthermore, the statistical analysis showed a significant difference for interaction between concentration and time regarding the tarragon and savory extracts with a P value of lower than 0.05. According to the results, the anti-leishmanial effect of the tarragon and savory extracts may make it possible to use them in the treatment of cutaneous leishmaniasis as a complementary or alternative therapy; however, further studies are necessary and should be evaluated in cell culture and in vivo conditions to confirm it.
28006779	Cardiorenal Syndrome Type 5 in Sepsis: Role of Endotoxin in Cell Death Pathways and Inflammation.	BACKGROUND/AIMS: Cardiorenal Syndrome Type 5 (CRS Type 5) is characterized by concomitant cardiac and renal dysfunction in the setting of different systemic disorders, such as sepsis. In this study, we investigated the possible relationship between endotoxin levels, renal cell death and inflammation in septic patients with CRS Type 5. METHODS: We enrolled 11 patients with CRS Type 5. CRS Type 5 was defined according to the current classification system. AKI was defined by Acute Kidney Injury Network (AKIN) criteria. Acute cardiac dysfunction was documented by echocardiography as acute left and/or right ventricular dysfunction leading to decreased ejection fraction. Endotoxin activity was measured by the Endotoxin Activity Assay (EAA). Plasma from CRS Type 5 patients was incubated with renal tubular cells (RTCs) and cell death levels were evaluated. Plasma cytokines levels were measured as well. RESULTS: Accordingly to EAA levels, patients were divided into two groups: 45.4% of patients had low endotoxin activity level (negative EAA), while 54.5% of patients showed high endotoxin activity (positive EAA). RTCs incubated with plasma from EAA positive patients showed significantly higher apoptosis levels and higher caspase-3 activation compared to cells incubated with plasma from EAA negative patients, and a significant positive correlation was observed between EAA levels and RTC apoptosis levels. Furthermore, IL-6 and IFN-gamma levels were significantly higher in CRS Type 5 patients with positive EAA. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest a possible relationship between endotoxin levels and renal cell death in septic patients with CRS Type 5. Furthermore, this study highlights the presence of renal apoptosis, the immune deregulation and the strong inflammation in CRS Type 5 patients, especially in those with high endotoxin activity.
26894014	Novel Principles and Techniques to Create a Natural Design in Female Hairline Correction Surgery.	UNLABELLED: Female hairline correction surgery is becoming increasingly popular. However, no guidelines or methods of female hairline design have been introduced to date. METHODS: The purpose of this study was to create an initial framework based on the novel principles of female hairline design and then use artistic ability and experience to fine tune this framework. An understanding of the concept of 5 areas (frontal area, frontotemporal recess area, temporal peak, infratemple area, and sideburns) and 5 points (C, A, B, T, and S) is required for female hairline correction surgery (the 5A5P principle). The general concepts of female hairline correction surgery and natural design methods are, herein, explained with a focus on the correlations between these 5 areas and 5 points. RESULTS: A natural and aesthetic female hairline can be created with application of the above-mentioned concepts. CONCLUSION: The 5A5P principle of forming the female hairline is very useful in female hairline correction surgery.
26986969	Antioxidants Abrogate Alpha-Tocopherylquinone-Mediated Down-Regulation of the Androgen Receptor in Androgen-Responsive Prostate Cancer Cells.	Tocopherylquinone (TQ), the oxidation product of alpha-tocopherol (AT), is a bioactive molecule with distinct properties from AT. In this study, AT and TQ are investigated for their comparative effects on growth and androgenic activity in prostate cancer cells. TQ potently inhibited the growth of androgen-responsive prostate cancer cell lines (e.g., LAPC4 and LNCaP cells), whereas the growth of androgen-independent prostate cancer cells (e.g., DU145 cells) was not affected by TQ. Due to the growth inhibitory effects induced by TQ on androgen-responsive cells, the anti-androgenic properties of TQ were examined. TQ inhibited the androgen-induced activation of an androgen-responsive reporter and inhibited the release of prostate specific antigen from LNCaP cells. TQ pretreatment was also found to inhibit AR activation as measured using the Multifunctional Androgen Receptor Screening assay. Furthermore, TQ decreased androgen-responsive gene expression, including TM4SF1, KLK2, and PSA over 5-fold, whereas AT did not affect the expression of androgen-responsive genes. Of importance, the antiandrogenic effects of TQ on prostate cancer cells were found to result from androgen receptor protein down-regulation produced by TQ that was not observed with AT treatment. Moreover, none of the androgenic endpoints assessed were affected by AT. The down-regulation of androgen receptor protein by TQ was abrogated by co-treatment with antioxidants. Overall, the biological actions of TQ were found to be distinct from AT, where TQ was found to be a potent inhibitor of cell growth and androgenic activity in androgen-responsive prostate cancer cells.
27660409	Update on corticosteroids for diabetic macular edema.	Diabetic macular edema (DME) remains an important cause of visual loss. Although anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) agents are generally used as first-line treatments for patients with center-involving DME, there is an important role for corticosteroids as well. Corticosteroids may be especially useful in pseudophakic patients poorly responsive to anti-VEGF therapies, in patients wishing to reduce the number of required injections, and in pregnant patients. Intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide has been used for many years but is not approved for this indication. An extended-release bioerodable dexamethasone delivery system and an extended-release nonbioerodable fluocinolone acetonide insert have both achieved regulatory approval for the treatment of DME. All intravitreal corticosteroids are associated with risks of cataract progression, elevation of intraocular pressure, and endophthalmitis. There is no current consensus regarding the use of corticosteroids, but they are valuable for selected patients with center-involving DME.
27336790	Phenotyping Adults with Non-Cystic Fibrosis Bronchiectasis: A 10-Year Cohort Study in a French Regional University Hospital Center.	BACKGROUND: Data concerning phenotypes in bronchiectasis are scarce. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to describe the clinical, functional and microbiological phenotypes of patients with bronchiectasis. METHODS: A monocentric retrospective study in a university hospital in France was conducted over 10 years (2002-2012). Non-cystic fibrosis patients with tomographic confirmation of bronchiectasis were included. The clinical, functional and microbiological data of patients were analyzed relying on the underlying etiology. RESULTS: Of the 311 included patients, an etiology was found for 245 of them. At the time of diagnosis, the median age was 61 years and the mean FEV1 was 63% of predicted. The main causes of bronchiectasis were post-infectious (50%, mostly related to tuberculosis), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD; 13%) and idiopathic (11%). Other causes were immune deficiency (6%), asthma (4%), autoimmunity (3%), tumor (2%) and other causes (4%). The comparison of phenotypic traits shows significant differences between COPD, congenital and idiopathic groups in term of sex (p = 0.0175), tobacco status (p < 0.0001), FEV1 (p = 0.0412) and age at diagnosis (p < 0.001), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) colonization (p = 0.0276) and lobectomy (0.0093). Functional follow-up was available in 30% of patients with a median duration of 2.7 years. Presence of PA was associated with a lower median FEV1 at diagnosis (43% p < 0.003) but not with a faster rate of decline in FEV1. CONCLUSION: Distinctive clinical, functional and microbiological features were found for idiopathic, congenital and COPD-related bronchiectasis. A prospective follow-up of these subgroups is necessary to validate their relevance in the management of bacterial colonization and specific complications of these bronchiectases.
27132437	Uterine rupture in pregnancy: two case reports and review of literature.	Rupture of a gravid uterus is an obstetric emergency. Risks factors include a scarred uterus but also spontaneous rupture of an un- scarred uterus during pregnancy is possible. The authors present two cases of a spontaneous complete uterine rupture during pregnancy. The first case had only a past history of dilatation and curettage for abortion; the second case had a past history of dilatation and curettage for abortion and a monolateral laparoscopic salpingectomy for ectopic pregnancy. They presented with abdominal pain and after ultrasound scan, uterine ruptures were diagnosed. These cases show that there should be a high index of suspicious of uterine rupture in a gravid woman with a history of curettage for the possible presence of misunderstood uterine scar and in women with a past history of salpingectomy with or without corneal resection. Appropriate counseling and close follow-up might help to avoid such obstetrical catastrophes. To provide more insight into the possible risk factors for prelabor uterine rupture in pregnancy, a literature review was performed.
27222409	Open-labelled observations of language dysfunction in old ischemic stroke patients with aphasia when given plant and marine-based nutrient supplements for 12 weeks.	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to explore the effect of functional foods on aphasia related to a previous ischemic stroke. When stroke-related neurological deficits result in physical dependency and poor selfcare that persists longer than 6 months, full recovery is almost impossible and the patient often requires long-term care. The functional foods, EASE123 and BioBalance#6, include numerous plant and marine-based nutrient supplements that could prove beneficial for such patients. METHODS AND STUDY DESIGN: This open-labelled study included 10 patients diagnosed with prior ischemic stroke and aphasia lasting longer than 6 months. Each patient was administered 6 tablets of EASE123 at 10:30 AM and at 90 minutes before sleeping, and 3 tablets of BioBalance# 6 at 2:30 PM. After a treatment period of 12 weeks, the patients were followed during a 4-week withdrawal period. Functional improvement was assessed by scores and subscores on the Concise Chinese Aphasia Test (CCAT) at weeks 4, 8, 12, and 16. RESULTS: Average total CCAT scores and matching ability improved significantly at weeks 4, 8, 12, and 16 (p<0.05). Simple response scores improved significantly at weeks 8 and 12 (p<0.05). Auditory comprehension improved significantly at weeks 4 and 12 (p<0.05), and reading comprehension, at week 12 (p<0.05). Repetition ability improved significantly at weeks 8, 12, and 16 (p<0.05), and spontaneous writing, at weeks 4, 12, and 16 (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Matching, repetition, and average total CCAT scores improved over the course of the study. Therefore, 6 months after ischemic stroke, EASE123 and BioBalance# 6 administration may improve stroke-related aphasia.
27546543	Possibilities of the exposure reduction of hands during the preparation and application of radiopharmaceuticals.	BACKGROUND: The current routinely used methods of estimating the skin equivalent dose relies on the finger dosimetry which usually largely underestimates the real maximum exposure and thus appropriate correction factors have to be used. METHODS: The group under the investigation consisted of 10 workers preparing and 5 workers administering radiopharmaceuticals labelled with 18F. The monitoring was carried out using 12 pairs of thermoluminiscent dosimeters (TLDs) placed on each hand of the worker. A total of 46 measurements were completed. The maximum exposure of the skin of hands, defined in terms of the quantity of the personal dose equivalent Hp(0.07), was related to the unit activity of radiopharmaceutical with which the worker came into the contact during the measurement. RESULTS: The exposure of the hands of workers handling 18F-labelled radiopharmaceuticals showed significant inhomogeneity. Out of 15 workers, in 53 % of cases, the maximum skin exposure was observed on the tip of their index finger. It was estimated that in about 60 % of the cases (during the preparation and administration of radiopharmaceuticals), the exposure may exceed the 3/10 of the annual dose limit. Moreover, in 40 % of all cases, the exposure may even be higher than this dose limit. The established relevant correction factors reached the values up to 8 (as for preparations) and 13 (as for administrations). CONCLUSIONS: The study resulted in the establishment of the appropriate correction factors and in the recommendations of procedures aimed at the further reduction of the exposure of extremities (Tab. 3, Fig. 2, Ref. 17).
27725829	A Linear Analysis of Coupled Wilson-Cowan Neuronal Populations.	Let a neuronal population be composed of an excitatory group interconnected to an inhibitory group. In the Wilson-Cowan model, the activity of each group of neurons is described by a first-order nonlinear differential equation. The source of the nonlinearity is the interaction between these two groups, which is represented by a sigmoidal function. Such a nonlinearity makes difficult theoretical works. Here, we analytically investigate the dynamics of a pair of coupled populations described by the Wilson-Cowan model by using a linear approximation. The analytical results are compared to numerical simulations, which show that the trajectories of this fourth-order dynamical system can converge to an equilibrium point, a limit cycle, a two-dimensional torus, or a chaotic attractor. The relevance of this study is discussed from a biological perspective.
27063794	Congenital cerebral malformations and dysfunction in fetuses and newborns following the 2013 to 2014 Zika virus epidemic in French Polynesia.	We detected an unusual increase in congenital cerebral malformations and dysfunction in fetuses and newborns in French Polynesia, following an epidemic of Zika virus (ZIKV), from October 2013 to March 2014. A retrospective review identified 19 cases, including eight with major brain lesions and severe microcephaly, six with severe cerebral lesions without microcephaly and five with brainstem dysfunction without visible malformations. Imaging revealed profound neurological lesions (septal and callosal disruption, ventriculomegaly, abnormal neuronal migration, cerebellar hypoplasia, occipital pseudocysts, brain calcifications). Amniotic fluid was drawn from seven cases at gestation weeks 20 to 29. ZIKV RNA was detected by RT-PCR and infectious ZIKV isolates were obtained in four of five microcephalic, but not in two non-microcephalic cases with severe brain lesions. Medical termination of pregnancy was performed in eleven cases; two cases with brainstem dysfunction died in the first months of life; six cases are alive, with severe neurological impairment. The results show that four of seven tested fetuses with major neurological injuries were infected with ZIKV in utero. For other non-microcephalic, congenital abnormalities we were not able to prove or exclude ZIKV infection retrospectively. The unusual occurrence of brain malformations or dysfunction without microcephaly following a ZIKV outbreak needs further studies.
27252720	Morphology, Structure, and Ontogeny of Trichomes of the Grape Genus (Vitis, Vitaceae).	Trichomes are widely distributed on surfaces of different organs in the grape genus Vitis and are of taxonomic utility. To explore the morphology, structure and ontogeny of Vitis trichomes, we investigated the diversity and distribution of trichomes in 34 species of Vitis. Two main types of trichomes in Vitis are documented: non-glandular and glandular. Within non-glandular trichomes, ribbon and simple trichomes are found on different vegetative plant organs. The morphology and ontogeny of these types of trichomes are further examined with light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. The ultrastructure of the glandular trichomes is explored with transmission electron microscopy. The ribbon trichomes are twisted, greatly elongated and unicellular, and this trichome type may be a morphological synapomorphy of Vitis and its closest tropical relative Ampelocissus and Pterisanthes in Vitaceae. The simple trichomes are documented in most species sampled in the genus. The glandular trichomes are multicellular, non-vascularized and composed of both epidermis and subjacent layers. We show that prickles occurring along the stems and petioles of Vitis davidii are modified glandular trichomes. We observed that glandular trichomes of V. romanetii secrete mucilage and volatile substances which trap insectes on the glands. Transmission electron microscopy indicates that metabolic products accumulate in vacuoles, the cytoplasm and intercellular spaces. We infer that glandular trichomes and young prickles are involved in the secretion of these metabolic products and the intercellular spaces may be the places of temporary storage of these secretions.
27408594	Description of a new catfish genus (Siluriformes, Loricariidae) from the Tocantins River basin in central Brazil, with comments on the historical zoogeography of the new taxon.	This study presents the description of a new genus of the catfish subfamily Neoplecostominae from the Tocantins River basin. It can be distinguished from other neoplecostomine genera by the presence of (1) three hypertrophied bicuspid odontodes on the lateral portion of the body (character apparently present in mature males); (2) a large area without odontodes around the snout; (3) a post-dorsal ridge on the caudal peduncle; (4) a straight tooth series in the dentary and premaxillary rows; (5) the absence of abdominal plates; (6) a conspicuous series of enlarged papillae just posterior to the dentary teeth; and (7) caudal peduncle ellipsoid in cross section. We used maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods to estimate a time-calibrated tree with the published data on 116 loricariid species using one nuclear and three mitochondrial genes, and we used parametric biogeographic analyses (DEC and DECj models) to estimate ancestral geographic ranges and to infer the colonization routes of the new genus and the other neoplecostomines in the Tocantins River and the hydrographic systems of southeastern Brazil. Our phylogenetic results indicate that the new genus and species is a sister taxon of all the other members of the Neoplecostominae, originating during the Eocene at 47.5 Mya (32.7-64.5 Mya 95% HPD). The present distribution of the new genus and other neoplecostomines may be the result of a historical connection between the drainage basins of the Paraguay and Parana rivers and the Amazon basin, mainly through headwater captures.
27547199	Advances and Limitations of Disease Biogeography Using Ecological Niche Modeling.	Mapping disease transmission risk is crucial in public and animal health for evidence based decision-making. Ecology and epidemiology are highly related disciplines that may contribute to improvements in mapping disease, which can be used to answer health related questions. Ecological niche modeling is increasingly used for understanding the biogeography of diseases in plants, animals, and humans. However, epidemiological applications of niche modeling approaches for disease mapping can fail to generate robust study designs, producing incomplete or incorrect inferences. This manuscript is an overview of the history and conceptual bases behind ecological niche modeling, specifically as applied to epidemiology and public health; it does not pretend to be an exhaustive and detailed description of ecological niche modeling literature and methods. Instead, this review includes selected state-of-the-science approaches and tools, providing a short guide to designing studies incorporating information on the type and quality of the input data (i.e., occurrences and environmental variables), identification and justification of the extent of the study area, and encourages users to explore and test diverse algorithms for more informed conclusions. We provide a friendly introduction to the field of disease biogeography presenting an updated guide for researchers looking to use ecological niche modeling for disease mapping. We anticipate that ecological niche modeling will soon be a critical tool for epidemiologists aiming to map disease transmission risk, forecast disease distribution under climate change scenarios, and identify landscape factors triggering outbreaks.
28078161	A Case-Control Association Study of RANTES (-28C>G) Polymorphism as a Risk Factor for Parkinson's Disease in Isparta, Turkey.	Background. Recent studies have revealed that inflammatory processes are involved in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). Multiple lines of evidence have suggested that chemokines and their receptors are involved in several neurodegenerative disorders. We have examined whether genetic polymorphisms at the genes encoding chemokines IL-8 (-251A>T), MCP-1 (-2518A/G), and RANTES (-28C>G) and chemokine receptors CCR2 (V64I) and CCR5 (-Delta32) were associated with sporadic PD risk in Isparta, Turkey. Method. The pilot case-control association study included 30 PD patients and 60 control subjects, who were all genotyped with PCR-RFLP for the five polymorphisms. Their genotype and haplotype frequencies were compared statistically. Results. One SNP (-28C>G) in RANTES revealed a significant association with PD (P (allele) < 0.0001, p-trend = 0.0007). The risk allele (G) in the homozygous and dominant models (OR = 17.29 and 32.10, 95% CI = 0.86-347.24 and 1.74-591.937, resp.) suggests additional PD risk. The haplotype TGCAN from the IL-8 (-251A>T), MCP-1 (-2518A>G), RANTES (-28C>G), CCR-2 (V64I), and CCR-5 (-Delta32) has protective effect (OR = 0.08 [CI = 0.01-0.63], p = 0.019). Conclusions. Our data are the first indication of the role of RANTES (-28C>G) in PD risk.
27990084	Salvage intraperitoneal chemotherapy for relapsed type II endometrial cancer: A pilot case-control study.	OBJECTIVE: Epithelial ovarian cancer and relapsed type II endometrial cancer share common characteristics. Although the role of intraperitoneal (IP) chemotherapy in the treatment of epithelial ovarian cancer has been well-established, its role in the treatment of relapsed type II endometrial cancer remains to be elucidated. MATERIAL AND METHODS: From January 2000 to December 2012, patients who were diagnosed with relapsed type II endometrial cancer and underwent secondary cytoreductive surgery, patients with residual tumors less than 1 cm in diameter were initially screened for this study. Of the screened patients, consecutive patients who received salvage IP chemotherapy (IP platinum plus intravenous paclitaxel) were considered the case group. The case study group was matched to a control group that was composed of patients who received salvage systemic chemotherapy (intravenous platinum plus intravenous paclitaxel) in a 1:2 ratio. The overall survival was compared between the case group and the control group, and the IP treatment-related toxicities were reported. RESULTS: In total, 11 patients were assigned into the case group and 22 patients were assigned into the control group. The median overall survival (95% confidence interval) was 40.5 (25.5-56.2) months for the case group versus 28.0 (18.0-37.0) for the control group (hazard ratio=0.37 (95% confidence interval, 0.15-0.95); p=0.032, by the log-rank test). The most commonly observed toxicity was of gastrointestinal origin (81.8%). Toxicities that stemmed from hematological, cardiovascular, neurological, and catheter-related complications were similar to results published in other studies on IP chemotherapy for ovarian cancer. CONCLUSION: Salvage IP chemotherapy may potentially confer a longer overall survival than conventional systemic chemotherapy in the treatment of relapsed type II endometrial cancer.
28097038	Quantitative Analysis in Combination with Fingerprint Technology and Chemometric Analysis Applied for Evaluating Six Species of Wild Paris Using UHPLC-UV-MS.	A fast method was developed by ultra high performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) for simultaneous determination of polyphyllin I and polyphyllin II. Chemometric analyses including principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) based on UHPLC chromatography were used to evaluate 38 batches from six species of Paris. Variable importance of projection was applied to select important peaks. Meanwhile, similarity analysis of UHPLC fingerprint was used to evaluate the sample of Paris polyphylla yunnanensis (PPY) and P. axialis (PA). The results indicated that the total content of saponins in PPY and PA collected from Baoshan City of Yunnan Province above 8.07 mg/g was stronger than that from other areas of the rest of species. PLS-DA showed better performance than PCA with regard to classifying the samples. Retention time during 20-27 minutes of UHPLC was screened as significant peak for distinguishing Paris of different species and original geography. All of PPY and PA with similarity value were more than 0.80. It indicated that quantitative analysis combined with chemometric and similarity analyses could evaluate the different species of Paris effectively and comprehensively.
27047379	Therapeutic Efficacy and Safety of Paeoniae Radix Rubra Formulae in Relieving Hyperbilirubinemia Induced by Viral Hepatitis: A Meta-Analysis.	OBJECTIVE: Hyperbilirubinemia is one of the most devastating pathologies induced by various liver diseases. Formulae related to Paeoniae Radix Rubra (PRR) at high doses have been applied to treat hyperbilirubinemia in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to assess the efficacy and safety of formulae relevant to high-dose PRR in patients suffering from hyperbilirubinemia induced by viral hepatitis. METHODS: We performed a meta-analysis of randomized-controlled clinical trials to evaluate the efficacy and safety of formulae that apply a high dose of PRR for hyperbilirubinemia. Seven databases were searched until April, 2015. All studies were included according to detailed criteria and assessed for methodological quality. The outcome measurements were recorded for further analysis using the RevMan 5.2.11 software. RESULTS: Fifteen articles involving 1323 patients with hyperbilirubinemia were included. Formulae with high-dose PRR might promote the efficacy of either a combined application ([OR: 3.98, 95% CI (2.91, 5.43)]; P < 0.01) or a single application ([OR: 4.00, 95% CI (1.50, 10.68)]; P < 0.01) for hyperbilirubinemia. The indices of TBIL, ALT, and AST significantly decreased ([MD: -75.57, 95% CI (-94.88, -56.26)], [MD: -26.54, 95% CI (-36.19, -16.88)], and ([MD: -28.94, 95% CI (-46.26, -11.61)]; P < 0.01), respectively. In addition, formulae with high-dose PRR could enhance the treatment efficacy of hyperbilirubinemia triggered by hepatitis B ([OR: 2.98, 95% CI (1.75, 5.05)]; P < 0.01). Furthermore, the efficacy was enhanced with an increasing dosage of PRR. Two articles reported that no side effects occurred in clinical trials, and three studies noted that patients presented light digestive tract symptoms. CONCLUSION: Formulae relevant to high-dose PRR ameliorate hyperbilirubinemia and might constitute a promising therapeutic approach. For widespread acceptance by practitioners, more rigorously designed multicenter, double-blind, randomized, and large-scale controlled trials are required.
27375617	Detecting the Hidden Properties of Immunological Data and Predicting the Mortality Risks of Infectious Syndromes.	BACKGROUND: To extract more information, the properties of infectious disease data, including hidden relationships, could be considered. Here, blood leukocyte data were explored to elucidate whether hidden information, if uncovered, could forecast mortality. METHODS: Three sets of individuals (n = 132) were investigated, from whom blood leukocyte profiles and microbial tests were conducted (i) cross-sectional analyses performed at admission (before bacteriological tests were completed) from two groups of hospital patients, randomly selected at different time periods, who met septic criteria [confirmed infection and at least three systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria] but lacked chronic conditions (study I, n = 36; and study II, n = 69); (ii) a similar group, tested over 3 days (n = 7); and (iii) non-infected, SIRS-negative individuals, tested once (n = 20). The data were analyzed by (i) a method that creates complex data combinations, which, based on graphic patterns, partitions the data into subsets and (ii) an approach that does not partition the data. Admission data from SIRS+/infection+ patients were related to 30-day, in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: The non-partitioning approach was not informative: in both study I and study II, the leukocyte data intervals of non-survivors and survivors overlapped. In contrast, the combinatorial method distinguished two subsets that, later, showed twofold (or larger) differences in mortality. While the two subsets did not differ in gender, age, microbial species, or antimicrobial resistance, they revealed different immune profiles. Non-infected, SIRS-negative individuals did not express the high-mortality profile. Longitudinal data from septic patients displayed the pattern associated with the highest mortality within the first 24 h post-admission. Suggesting inflammation coexisted with immunosuppression, one high-mortality sub-subset displayed high neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio values and low lymphocyte percents. A second high-mortality subset showed monocyte-mediated deficiencies. Numerous within- and between-subset comparisons revealed statistically significantly different immune profiles. CONCLUSION: While the analysis of non-partitioned data can result in information loss, complex (combinatorial) data structures can uncover hidden patterns, which guide data partitioning into subsets that differ in mortality rates and immune profiles. Such information can facilitate diagnostics, monitoring of disease dynamics, and evaluation of subset-specific, patient-specific therapies.
26937373	Saliva as a diagnostic tool for oral and systemic diseases.	Early disease detection is not only vital to reduce disease severity and prevent complications, but also critical to increase success rate of therapy. Saliva has been studied extensively as a potential diagnostic tool over the last decade due to its ease and non-invasive accessibility along with its abundance of biomarkers, such as genetic material and proteins. This review will update the clinician on recent advances in salivary biomarkers to diagnose autoimmune diseases (Sjogren's syndrome, cystic fibrosis), cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, HIV, oral cancer, caries and periodontal diseases. Considering their accuracy, efficacy, ease of use and cost effectiveness, salivary diagnostic tests will be available in dental offices. It is expected that the advent of sensitive and specific salivary diagnostic tools and the establishment of defined guidelines and results following rigorous testing will allow salivary diagnostics to be used as chair-side tests for several oral and systemic diseases in the near future.
27008795	ALCOHOL DEPENDENCE--NEUROBIOLOGY AND TREATMENT.	The consequences of alcohol dependence concern serious health care, social and economic problems. The scope of many studies is to better understand mechanisms underlying alcohol addiction in order to work out new, more effective treatment strategies. Alcohol affects many neurotransmission systems within the brain. In general, acute alcohol enhances inhibitory transmission, up-regulating the GABAergic system and impairing glutamatergic function, therefore interfering the balance between excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs. Chronic alcohol consumption, meanwhile, in order to restore equilibrium leads to neuroadaptive changes caus- ing both decreased GABAergic and increased glutamatergic activity. Also function of other neurotransmitters and modulators is modified by the presence of alcohol, including glycine, adenosine, serotonin and dopamine. Moreover, a significant impact of alcohol on the endogenous opioid system, nicotinic cholinergic transmission and the endocannabinoids system has been also established. At present, only four medications are approved for the treatment of alcohol dependence in Europe, that is naltrexone, acamprosate, disulfiram and the most recent nalmefene. Among other promising strategies the following drugs are mentioned: baclofen, topiramate, ondansetron, aripiprazole, rimonabant and varenicline. Additionally, the role of appetite-regulating hormones, neuroimmune modulators or the body's stress-response system modulators in reducing alcohol consumption is currently of great interest, however, further investigations are needed.
27439012	Assessing the Impact of Community Engagement Interventions on Health Worker Motivation and Experiences with Clients in Primary Health Facilities in Ghana: A Randomized Cluster Trial.	BACKGROUND: Health worker density per 1000 population in Ghana is one of the lowest in the world estimated to be 2.3, below the global average of 9.3. Low health worker motivation induced by poor working conditions partly explain this challenge. Albeit the wage bill for public sector health workers is about 90% of domestic government expenditure on health in countries such as Ghana, staff motivation and performance output remain a challenge, suggesting the need to complement financial incentives with non-financial incentives through a community-based approach. In this study, a systematic community engagement (SCE) intervention was implemented to engage community groups in healthcare quality assessment to promote mutual collaboration between clients and healthcare providers, and enhance health worker motivation levels. SCE involves structured use of existing community groups and associations to assess healthcare quality in health facilities. Identified quality gaps are discussed with healthcare providers, improvements made and rewards given to best performing facilities for closing quality care gaps. PURPOSE: To evaluate the effect of SCE interventions on health worker motivation and experiences with clients. METHODS: The study is a cluster randomized trial involving health workers in private (n = 38) and public (n = 26) primary healthcare facilities in two administrative regions in Ghana. Out of 324 clinical and non-clinical staff randomly interviewed at baseline, 234 (72%) were successfully followed at end-line and interviewed on workplace motivation factors and personal experiences with clients. Propensity score matching and difference-in-difference estimations were used to estimate treatment effect of the interventions on staff motivation. RESULTS: Intrinsic (non-financial) work incentives including cordiality with clients and perceived career prospects appeared to be prime sources of motivation for health staff interviewed in intervention health facilities while financial incentives were ranked lowest. Intervention health facilities that were assessed by female community groups (Coef. = 0.2720, p = 0.0118) and informal groups with organized leadership structures like Artisans (Coef. = 0.2268, p = 0.0368) associated positively with higher intrinsic motivation levels of staff. CONCLUSION: Community-based approach to health worker motivation is a potential complementary strategy that needs policy deliberation to explore its prospects. Albeit financial incentives remain critical sources of staff motivation, innovative non-financial approaches like SCE should complement the latter.
28154529	Grouping and Segregation of Sensory Events by Actions in Temporal Audio-Visual Recalibration.	Perception in multi-sensory environments involves both grouping and segregation of events across sensory modalities. Temporal coincidence between events is considered a strong cue to resolve multisensory perception. However, differences in physical transmission and neural processing times amongst modalities complicate this picture. This is illustrated by cross-modal recalibration, whereby adaptation to audio-visual asynchrony produces shifts in perceived simultaneity. Here, we examined whether voluntary actions might serve as a temporal anchor to cross-modal recalibration in time. Participants were tested on an audio-visual simultaneity judgment task after an adaptation phase where they had to synchronize voluntary actions with audio-visual pairs presented at a fixed asynchrony (vision leading or vision lagging). Our analysis focused on the magnitude of cross-modal recalibration to the adapted audio-visual asynchrony as a function of the nature of the actions during adaptation, putatively fostering cross-modal grouping or, segregation. We found larger temporal adjustments when actions promoted grouping than segregation of sensory events. However, a control experiment suggested that additional factors, such as attention to planning/execution of actions, could have an impact on recalibration effects. Contrary to the view that cross-modal temporal organization is mainly driven by external factors related to the stimulus or environment, our findings add supporting evidence for the idea that perceptual adjustments strongly depend on the observer's inner states induced by motor and cognitive demands.
27689116	Splenic abscess due to fungal infection after kidney transplantation; a case report.	Splenic abscess is one of the rare and potentially life-threatening complications after kidney transplantation. Splenic abscess generally occurs in patients who have immunodeficiency state. It becomes more important with the increased use of immunosuppressed drugs and organ transplantation. The clinical presentation of splenic abscess is insidious, often with constitutional symptoms. Left upper quadrant tenderness is an uncommon sign. Therefore, its diagnosis is difficult and requires a high degree of clinical suspicion. We report a case under renal transplantation with recurrent fungal infection in different organs with two episodes of fungemia who died after splenectomy.
26886644	Differences and Similarities in the Clinicopathological Features of Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors in China and the United States: A Multicenter Study.	The presentation, pathology, and prognosis of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PNETs) in Asian patients have not been studied in large cohorts. We hypothesized that the clinicopathological features of PNETs of Chinese patients might be different from those of US patients. The objectives of this study were to address whether PNETs in Chinese patients exhibit unique clinicopathological features and natural history, and can be graded and staged using the WHO/ENETS criteria. This is a retrospective review of medical records of patients with PNETs in multiple academic medical centers in China (7) and the United States (2). Tumor grading and staging were based on WHO/ENETS criteria. The clinicopathological features of PNETs of Chinese and US patients were compared. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to find associations between survival and patient demographics, tumor grade and stage, and other clinicopathological characteristics. A total of 977 (527 Chinese and 450 US) patients with PNETs were studied. In general, Chinese patients were younger than US patients (median age 46 vs 56 years). In Chinese patients, insulinomas were the most common (52.2%), followed by nonfunctional tumors (39.7%), whereas the order was reversed in US patients. Tumor grade distribution was similar in the 2 countries (G1: 57.5% vs 55.0%; G2: 38.5% vs 41.3%; and G3: 4.0% vs 3.7%). However, age, primary tumor size, primary tumor location, grade, and stage of subtypes of PNETs were significantly different between the 2 countries. The Chinese nonfunctional tumors were significantly larger than US ones (median size 4 vs 3 cm) and more frequently located in the head/neck region (54.9% vs 34.8%). The Chinese and US insulinomas were similar in size (median 1.5 cm) but the Chinese insulinomas relatively more frequently located in the head/neck region (48.3% vs 26.1%). Higher grade, advanced stage, metastasis, and larger primary tumor size were significantly associated with unfavorable survival in both countries. Several clinicopathological differences are found between Chinese and US PNETs but the PNETs of both countries follow a similar natural history. The WHO tumor grading and ENETS staging criteria are applicable to both Chinese and US patients.
27818807	Successful Use of Tocilizumab in a Patient with Coexisting Rheumatoid Arthritis and Ulcerative Colitis.	Tocilizumab is an interleukin-6 receptor inhibitor licensed for moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We report a case of Tocilizumab monotherapy for severe active RA in a patient with coexisting ulcerative colitis (UC). The patient was intolerant to multiple disease-modifying drugs, so Tocilizumab monotherapy was commenced. We found clinical improvement in both RA and UC. There was no major adverse event after 2 years. Manufacturer advised caution in using Tocilizumab in patient with gastrointestinal ulceration due to an increased risk of bowel perforation. However, alternative treatments such as glucocorticoid and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may carry a higher bowel perforation risk. The presence of gastrointestinal ulceration therefore should not constitute an absolute contraindication for Tocilizumab therapy. Future studies of registry data will inform clinician of the Tocilizumab-related risk of gastrointestinal toxicity in "real-life" settings. Contrary to previous case report, we found Tocilizumab therapy to have a positive effect on UC. Laboratory studies supported a role for interleukin-6 in the pathophysiology of UC. Further clinical trial to evaluate the therapeutic role of Tocilizumab in UC would be warranted.
26962311	Plasma levels of N-telopeptide of Type I collagen in periodontal health, disease and after treatment.	BACKGROUND: To determine plasma concentrations of bone resorption marker cross-linked N-terminal telopeptide (NTx) of Type I collagen in periodontal health, disease and after nonsurgical periodontal therapy in chronic periodontitis group. In addition, to know the association between plasma NTx levels and the different clinical parameters. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty subjects were divided on the basis of their periodontal status and were categorized as Group I: Healthy, Group II: Gingivitis, and Group III: Chronic periodontitis. Group III subjects were treated with scaling and root planing, 6-8 weeks later blood samples were analyzed, and they constituted Group IV. NTx levels in plasma were analyzed by competitive - enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. All data were analyzed using statistical software (SPSS) (alpha = 0.05). RESULTS: All the samples tested positive for the presence of NTx. The mean NTx concentration was highest in Group III (18.77 nanomole Bone Collagen Equivalent [nm BCE]) and the lowest in Group IV (16.02 nm BCE). The values of Group I and Group II fell between the highest and the lowest values (16.23 nm BCE and 16.70 nm BCE, respectively). The difference in mean NTx levels in Group III and Group IV were statistically significant. NTx levels in all the groups positively correlated with the clinical parameters. All data were analyzed using statistical software (SPSS) (alpha = 0.05). CONCLUSION: Within the limits of this study, it may be suggested that plasma NTx levels may provide distinguishing data between periodontally healthy diseased sites and after nonsurgical therapy of diseased sites.
27065789	Extracellular Vesicles and a Novel Form of Communication in the Brain.	In numerous neurodegenerative diseases, the interplay between neurons and glia modulates the outcome and progression of pathology. One particularly intriguing mode of interaction between neurons, astrocytes, microglia, and oligodendrocytes is characterized by the release of extracellular vesicles that transport proteins, lipids, and nucleotides from one cell to another. Notably, several proteins that cause disease, including the prion protein and mutant SOD1, have been detected in glia-derived extracellular vesicles and observed to fuse with neurons and trigger pathology in vitro. Here we review the structural and functional characterization of such extracellular vesicles in neuron-glia interactions. Furthermore, we discuss possible mechanisms of extracellular vesicle biogenesis and release from activated glia and microglia, and their effects on neurons. Given that exosomes, the smallest type of extracellular vesicles, have been reported to recognize specific cellular populations and act as carriers of very specialized cargo, a thorough analysis of these vesicles may aid in their engineering in vitro and targeted delivery in vivo, opening opportunities for therapeutics.
27058802	High on-treatment platelet reactivity and outcomes after percutaneous endovascular procedures in patients with peripheral artery disease.	BACKGROUND: High on-treatment platelet reactivity (HPR) predicts adverse cardiovascular events in patients with coronary artery disease. The impact of HPR in patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) after peripheral endovascular procedures is unclear. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 385 patients with PAD and successful percutaneous endovascular procedure were included. Patients received aspirin as a long-term treatment in addition to the P2Y12 receptor antagonist clopidogrel, as recommended after such a procedure for at least 1 month. Platelet function was assessed on a Multiplate analyzer. The primary endpoint was target lesion revascularization (TLR) at one year. Restenosis (>/= 75 %) in duplex sonography, mortality at one year and identification of independent predictors of TLR were secondary endpoints. RESULTS: TLR rates were similar in HPR and no-HPR patients (14.3 % vs. 12.7 %, hazard rate (HR) 0.94, 95 % CI 0.48 - 1.84, P = 0.86). Restenosis (>/= 75 %) in duplex sonography did not differ between the two study groups (15.6 % vs. 16.9 %, HR 1.16, 95% CI 0.62 - 2.12, P = 0.64). Independent predictors of TLR were intervention of restenotic lesions, total vessel occlusions and critical limb ischemia, but not HPR (adjusted HR 1.07, 95% CI 0.55 - 2.10, P = 0.84). No difference in mortality at one year was observed (1.3 % vs. 1.6 %, HR 1.28, 95 % CI 0.15 - 11.0, P = 0.82). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with PAD, HPR did not have a significant impact on outcomes within the first year after percutaneous endovascular intervention.
26973855	New crossroads for potential therapeutic intervention in cancer - intersections between CDCP1, EGFR family members and downstream signaling pathways.	Signaling pathways regulated by the receptor CDCP1 play central roles in promoting cancer and in mediating resistance to chemo- and targeted-therapies. In this perspective we briefly summarize these findings as well as data demonstrating poorer outcomes for several malignancies that exhibit elevated CDCP1 expression. Promising data from preclinical studies suggest that CDCP1 targeted agents, including therapeutic antibodies, could be useful in the treatment of cancer patients selected on the basis of activation of CDCP1 and its signaling partners including EGFR, HER2, Met and Src.
28079391	OUR PRELIMINARY EXPERIENCE WITH A NEW METHOD OF DIEAp FLAP DISSECTION.	BACKGROUND: The abdominal tissue is an ideal source for autologous breast reconstruction. We propose a new approach for intramuscular dissection of a DIEP flap in this paper. METHODS: A total of 84 women underwent breast reconstruction after mastectomy. From this group, 49 patients were treated with traditional DIEP flap of which 21 had unilateral procedure and 28 had bilateral procedure. This new type of dissection was performed in 35 women, with unilateral approach in 14 cases and bilateral approach in 21 cases. RESULTS: The statistical differences are not significant in the two groups with regards to complications (p > 0.1). Mean operative time in this new approach was 3 hours and 10 minutes per flap. Mean operative time in the traditional dissection of DIEP was 3 hours and 41 minutes per flap. The operative time of the new approach is significantly shorter than the dissection of the traditional DIEP flap (p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: The approach to DIEP flap dissection proposed by the authors is a new concept in autologous breast reconstruction. In this type of dissection no fascia is resected and it is more reliable than a traditional DIEP flap for the ease of dissection and for the presence of a small protective cuff of muscle around the vessel with a lower risk of perforator injury.It is a reproducible option of dissection, useful also in less experienced hands and it is a time reducing technique compared with the traditional DIEP flap.
28018325	Sensitive Quantitative Analysis of the Meconium Bacterial Microbiota in Healthy Term Infants Born Vaginally or by Cesarean Section.	For decades, babies were thought to be born germ-free, but recent evidences suggest that they are already exposed to various bacteria in utero. However, the data on population levels of such pioneer gut bacteria, particularly in context to birth mode, is sparse. We herein aimed to quantify such bacteria from the meconium of 151 healthy term Japanese infants born vaginally or by C-section. Neonatal first meconium was obtained within 24-48 h of delivery; RNA was extracted and subjected to reverse-transcription-quantitative PCR using specific primers for Clostridium coccoides group, C. leptum subgroup, Bacteroides fragilis group, Atopobium cluster, Prevotella, Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus, Enterococcus, Enterobacteriaceae, Staphylococcus, Enterococcus, Streptococcus, C. perfringens, and C. difficile. We detected several bacterial groups in both vaginally- and cesarean-born infants. B. fragilis group, Enterobacteriaceae, Enterococcus, Streptococcus, and Staphylococcus were detected in more than 50% of infants, with counts ranging from 105 to 108 cells/g sample. About 30-35% samples harbored Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus (104-105 cells/g); whereas C. coccoides group, C. leptum subgroup and C. perfringens were detected in 10-20% infants (103-105 cells/g). Compared to vaginally-born babies, cesarean-born babies were significantly less often colonized with Lactobacillus genus (6% vs. 37%; P = 0.01) and Lactobacillus gasseri subgroup (6% vs. 31%; P = 0.04). Overall, seven Lactobacillus subgroups/species, i.e., L. gasseri subgroup, L. ruminis subgroup, L. casei subgroup, L. reuteri subgroup, L. sakei subgroup, L. plantarum subgroup, and L. brevis were detected in the samples from vaginally-born group, whereas only two members, i.e., L. gasseri subgroup and L. brevis were detected in the cesarean group. These data corroborate that several bacterial clades may already be present before birth in term infants' gut. Further, lower detection rate of lactobacilli in cesarean-born babies suggests that the primary source of lactobacilli in infant gut is mainly from maternal vaginal and-to a lesser extent-anal microbiota during vaginal delivery, and that the colonization by some important Lactobacillus species is delayed in babies delivered via cesarean-section.
27179226	Clinical strategies for the management of intestinal obstruction and pseudo-obstruction. A Delphi Consensus study of SICUT (Societa Italiana di Chirurgia d'Urgenza e del Trauma).	BACKGROUND: Intestinal obstructions/pseudo-obstruction of the small/large bowel are frequent conditions but their management could be challenging. Moreover, a general agreement in this field is currently lacking, thus SICUT Society designed a consensus study aimed to define their optimal workout. METHODS: The Delphi methodology was used to reach consensus among 47 Italian surgical experts in two study rounds. Consensus was defined as an agreement of 75.0% or greater. Four main topic areas included nosology, diagnosis, management and treatment. RESULTS: A bowel obstruction was defined as an obstacle to the progression of intestinal contents and fluids generally beginning with a sudden onset. The panel identified four major criteria of diagnosis including absence of flatus, presence of >3.5 cm ileal levels or >6 cm colon dilatation and abdominal distension. Panel also recommended a surgical admission, a multidisciplinary approach, and a gastrografin swallow for patients presenting occlusions. Criteria for immediate surgery included: presence of strangulated hernia, a >10 cm cecal dilatation, signs of vascular pedicles obstructions and persistence of metabolic acidosis. Moreover, rules for non-operative management (to be conducted for maximum 72 hours) included a naso-gastric drainage placement and clinical and laboratory controls each 12 hours. Non-operative treatment should be suspended if any suspects of intra-abdominal complications, high level of lactates, leukocytosis (>18.000/mm3 or Neutrophils >85%) or a doubling of creatinine level comparing admission. Conversely, consensus was not reached regarding the exact timing of CT scan and the appropriateness of colonic stenting. CONCLUSIONS: This consensus is in line with current international strategies and guidelines, and it could be a useful tool in the safe basic daily management of these common and peculiar diseases. KEY WORDS: Delphi study, Intestinal obstruction, Large bowel obstruction, Pseudo-obstruction, Small bowel.
27594916	Metabolic engineering of Zymomonas mobilis for 2,3-butanediol production from lignocellulosic biomass sugars.	BACKGROUND: To develop pathways for advanced biofuel production, and to understand the impact of host metabolism and environmental conditions on heterologous pathway engineering for economic advanced biofuels production from biomass, we seek to redirect the carbon flow of the model ethanologen Zymomonas mobilis to produce desirable hydrocarbon intermediate 2,3-butanediol (2,3-BDO). 2,3-BDO is a bulk chemical building block, and can be upgraded in high yields to gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel. RESULTS: 2,3-BDO biosynthesis pathways from various bacterial species were examined, which include three genes encoding acetolactate synthase, acetolactate decarboxylase, and butanediol dehydrogenase. Bioinformatics analysis was carried out to pinpoint potential bottlenecks for high 2,3-BDO production. Different combinations of 2,3-BDO biosynthesis metabolic pathways using genes from different bacterial species have been constructed. Our results demonstrated that carbon flux can be deviated from ethanol production into 2,3-BDO biosynthesis, and all three heterologous genes are essential to efficiently redirect pyruvate from ethanol production for high 2,3-BDO production in Z. mobilis. The down-selection of best gene combinations up to now enabled Z. mobilis to reach the 2,3-BDO production of more than 10 g/L from glucose and xylose, as well as mixed C6/C5 sugar streams derived from the deacetylation and mechanical refining process. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms the value of integrating bioinformatics analysis and systems biology data during metabolic engineering endeavors, provides guidance for value-added chemical production in Z. mobilis, and reveals the interactions between host metabolism, oxygen levels, and a heterologous 2,3-BDO biosynthesis pathway. Taken together, this work provides guidance for future metabolic engineering efforts aimed at boosting 2,3-BDO titer anaerobically.
28066479	SWATH-MS Quantitative Analysis of Proteins in the Rice Inferior and Superior Spikelets during Grain Filling.	Modern rice cultivars have large panicle but their yield potential is often not fully achieved due to poor grain-filling of late-flowering inferior spikelets (IS). Our earlier work suggested a broad transcriptional reprogramming during grain filling and showed a difference in gene expression between IS and earlier-flowering superior spikelets (SS). However, the links between the abundances of transcripts and their corresponding proteins are unclear. In this study, a SWATH-MS (sequential window acquisition of all theoretical spectra-mass spectrometry) -based quantitative proteomic analysis has been applied to investigate SS and IS proteomes. A total of 304 proteins of widely differing functionality were observed to be differentially expressed between IS and SS. Detailed gene ontology analysis indicated that several biological processes including photosynthesis, protein metabolism, and energy metabolism are differentially regulated. Further correlation analysis revealed that abundances of most of the differentially expressed proteins are not correlated to the respective transcript levels, indicating that an extra layer of gene regulation which may exist during rice grain filling. Our findings raised an intriguing possibility that these candidate proteins may be crucial in determining the poor grain-filling of IS. Therefore, we hypothesize that the regulation of proteome changes not only occurs at the transcriptional, but also at the post-transcriptional level, during grain filling in rice.
27348892	Serological surveillance for antibodies against Erysipelothrix species in wild boar and deer in Japan.	We investigated the seroprevalence of antibodies against Erysipelothrix in wild animals in Japan. Serum samples were collected from 48 wild boar, 26 Yezo deer and 26 Japanese deer in Japan. Growth agglutination (GA) test was performed to estimate antibody titers. As a result, positive results were obtained from 32 (66.7%), 1 (3.6%) and 6 (23.1%) samples from wild boar, Yezo deer and Japanese deer, respectively. Our findings suggest that wild animals may be an important reservoir of Erysipelothrix.
26979854	[Young adult with psychotic disorders have problems relating to sexuality, intimacy and relationships. An explanatory study based on focus group].	BACKGROUND: Research has shown that young adults with psychotic disorders frequently have problems relating to sexuality, intimacy and relationships. Such problems are often neglected in clinical practice. AIM: To perform a study that explores, on the basis of focus groups, how issues such as sexuality, intimacy and relationships can be addressed as part of the treatment of adolescents suffering from a psychotic disorder. METHOD: We created eight focus groups consisting of clients attending the department of psychotic disorders and caregivers who worked there. The meetings of each focus group were fully transcribed and analysed by means of Nvivo. RESULTS: Clients indicated they wanted to address the topics of sexuality, intimacy and relationships in a group setting. They expressed the wish to have mixed gender groups and decided that in the group discussions the main focus should be on the exchange of personal experiences. CONCLUSION: In our view, it is desirable that psychiatry should pay more attention to the subject of sexuality. By giving adolescents suffering from psychotic disorders the opportunity to discuss their experiences, problems and feelings of insecurity in a group setting and in a low-threshold environment, psychiatrists can greatly improve the quality of care that they provide for their patients.
27959906	Mapping the Prevalence of Physical Inactivity in U.S. States, 1984-2015.	BACKGROUND: Physical inactivity is a leading cause of morbidity, disability and premature mortality in the U.S. and worldwide. This study aimed to map the prevalence of physical inactivity across U.S. states over the past three decades, and estimate the over-time adjusted changes in the prevalence of physical inactivity in each state. METHODS: Individual-level data (N = 6,701,954) were taken from the 1984-2015 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), an annually repeated cross-sectional survey of state-representative adult population. Prevalence of self-reported leisure-time physical inactivity was estimated by state and survey year, accounting for the BRFSS sampling design. Logistic regressions were performed to estimate the changes in the prevalence of physical inactivity over the study period for each state, adjusting for individual characteristics including sex, age, race/ethnicity, education, marital status, and employment status. RESULTS: The prevalence of leisure-time physical inactivity varied substantially across states and survey years. In general, the adjusted prevalence of physical inactivity gradually declined over the past three decades in a majority of states. However, a substantial proportion of American adults remain physically inactive. Among the 50 states and District of Columbia, 45 had over a fifth of their adult population without any leisure-time physical activity, and 8 had over 30% without physical activity in 2015. Moreover, the adjusted prevalence of physical inactivity in several states (Arizona, North Carolina, North Dakota, Utah, West Virginia, and Wyoming) remained largely unchanged or even increased (Minnesota and Ohio) over the study period. CONCLUSIONS: Although the prevalence of physical inactivity declined over the past three decades in a majority of states, the rates remain substantially high and vary considerably across states. Closely monitoring and tracking physical activity level using the state physical activity maps can help guide policy and program development to promote physical activity and reduce the burden of chronic disease.
27314044	Treatment of Glioma Using neuroArm Surgical System.	The use of robotic technology in the surgical treatment of brain tumour promises increased precision and accuracy in the performance of surgery. Robotic manipulators may allow superior access to narrow surgical corridors compared to freehand or conventional neurosurgery. This paper reports values and ranges of tool-tissue interaction forces during the performance of glioma surgery using an MR compatible, image-guided neurosurgical robot called neuroArm. The system, capable of microsurgery and stereotaxy, was used in the surgical resection of glioma in seven cases. neuroArm is equipped with force sensors at the end-effector allowing quantification of tool-tissue interaction forces and transmits force of dissection to the surgeon sited at a remote workstation that includes a haptic interface. Interaction forces between the tool tips and the brain tissue were measured for each procedure, and the peak forces were quantified. Results showed maximum and minimum peak force values of 2.89 N (anaplastic astrocytoma, WHO grade III) and 0.50 N (anaplastic oligodendroglioma, WHO grade III), respectively, with the mean of peak forces varying from case to case, depending on type of the glioma. Mean values of the peak forces varied in range of 1.27 N (anaplastic astrocytoma, WHO grade III) to 1.89 N (glioblastoma with oligodendroglial component, WHO grade IV). In some cases, ANOVA test failed to reject the null hypothesis of equality in means of the peak forces measured. However, we could not find a relationship between forces exerted to the pathological tissue and its size, type, or location.
27032097	Hepatitis B Infection, Viral Load and Resistance in HIV-Infected Patients in Mozambique and Zambia.	BACKGROUND: Few data on the virological determinants of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection are available from southern Africa. METHODS: We enrolled consecutive HIV-infected adult patients initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART) at two urban clinics in Zambia and four rural clinics in Northern Mozambique between May 2013 and August 2014. HBsAg screening was performed using the Determine(R) rapid test. Quantitative real-time PCR and HBV sequencing were performed in HBsAg-positive patients. Risk factors for HBV infection were evaluated using Chi-square and Mann-Whitney tests and associations between baseline characteristics and high level HBV replication explored in multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS: Seventy-eight of 1,032 participants in Mozambique (7.6%, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 6.1-9.3) and 90 of 797 in Zambia (11.3%, 95% CI: 9.3-13.4) were HBsAg-positive. HBsAg-positive individuals were less likely to be female compared to HBsAg-negative ones (52.3% vs. 66.1%, p<0.001). Among 156 (92.9%) HBsAg-positive patients with an available measurement, median HBV viral load was 13,645 IU/mL (interquartile range: 192-8,617,488 IU/mL) and 77 (49.4%) had high values (>20,000 UI/mL). HBsAg-positive individuals had higher levels of ALT and AST compared to HBsAg-negative ones (both p<0.001). In multivariable analyses, male sex (adjusted odds ratio: 2.59, 95% CI: 1.22-5.53) and CD4 cell count below 200/mul (2.58, 1.20-5.54) were associated with high HBV DNA. HBV genotypes A1 (58.8%) and E (38.2%) were most prevalent. Four patients had probable resistance to lamivudine and/or entecavir. CONCLUSION: One half of HBsAg-positive patients demonstrated high HBV viremia, supporting the early initiation of tenofovir-containing ART in HIV/HBV-coinfected adults.
26905186	Impact of Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement on Surgical Volumes and Outcomes in a Tertiary Academic Cardiac Surgical Practice.	BACKGROUND: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) was FDA approved for the Sapien valve (Edwards Lifesciences) in the United States in November 2011. We sought to examine the impact of TAVR post-FDA approval on aortic valve surgery at our institution. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective data were collected on 573 consecutive patients that underwent surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) or TAVR with either the Sapien or Sapien XT from January 1, 2009 through December 31, 2014. RESULTS: Patients were divided into the following groups: SAVR before TAVR (n = 215), SAVR post TAVR (n = 163), and TAVR (n = 195). The 30-day mortality was not different among the 3 groups, but the mortality for the SAVR post TAVR group was better than the SAVR before TAVR group (p = 0.03). Postoperative hospital length of stay, ventilation hours, and atrial fibrillation were all decreased in the TAVR group. The number of isolated SAVRs increased after TAVR from 60 per year in group 1 to 67 per year in group 2. The total number of all isolated aortic valve procedures (SAVR + TAVR) increased from 60 per year to 177 per year. The TAVR group was divided into the following subgroups to examine the procedural learning curve: patients 1 to 50, patients 51 to 100, and patients 101 to 195. Mortality was higher in group 1 (8%) vs group 2 (0%) and group 3 (1%). CONCLUSIONS: Since initiation of the TAVR program at our institution, the total number of aortic valve procedures has increased. Transcatheter aortic valve replacement patients had more preoperative comorbidities, but no difference in postoperative morbidity or mortality and shorter length of stay. Transcatheter aortic valve replacement mortality has continued to improve since the inception of the program.
27747857	Three-dimensional printing-guided percutaneous transcatheter closure of secundum atrial septal defect with rim deficiency: First-in-human series.	BACKGROUND: This study aimed to prospectively evaluate the use of 3-dimensional printing (3DP) for the percutaneous transcatheter closure of a secundum atrial septal defect (ASD) with rim deficiency less than 5 mm. METHODS: Patients with ASD were scanned using multi-slice computed tomography to acquire raw data for virtual 3DP reconstruction models. Different ASD occluders were tried on the 3DP models to select the optimal size for intraoperative use. The patients were followed up 1 month postoperatively, and 3DP models were again manufactured to observe the operative effects. RESULTS: From January to April 2016, 6 patients (5 females and 1 male) were recruited. Their average age was 29.5 +/- 17.6 years, and the mean ASD size was 13.4 +/- 1.3 mm. ASD occlusion succeeded in 5 of 6 cases. There were 1, 2, and 3 cases with 0-mm distance from the defect rim to the aorta, inferior vena cava, and superior vena cava, respectively. ASD occluder sizes were consistent between preoperative simulation and intraoperative placement in 4 cases. One case had occluder size change from 30 mm to 34 mm. CONCLUSIONS: A 3DP model presents ASD in a more visible way and allows more direct preoperative simulation to choose the most appropriate size of occluder, as compared with conventional imaging techniques. This technique is likely to extend the current indications for ASD with an insufficient rim.
27936067	Deletion at the GCNT2 Locus Causes Autosomal Recessive Congenital Cataracts.	PURPOSE: The aim of this study is to identify the molecular basis of autosomal recessive congenital cataracts (arCC) in a large consanguineous pedigree. METHODS: All participating individuals underwent a detailed ophthalmic examination. Each patient's medical history, particularly of cataracts and other ocular abnormalities, was compiled from available medical records and interviews with family elders. Blood samples were donated by all participating family members and used to extract genomic DNA. Genetic analysis was performed to rule out linkage to known arCC loci and genes. Whole-exome sequencing libraries were prepared and paired-end sequenced. A large deletion was found that segregated with arCC in the family, and chromosome walking was conducted to estimate the proximal and distal boundaries of the deletion mutation. RESULTS: Exclusion and linkage analysis suggested linkage to a region of chromosome 6p24 harboring GCNT2 (glucosaminyl (N-acetyl) transferase 2) with a two-point logarithm of odds score of 5.78. PCR amplifications of the coding exons of GCNT2 failed in individuals with arCC, and whole-exome data analysis revealed a large deletion on chromosome 6p in the region harboring GCNT2. Chromosomal walking using multiple primer pairs delineated the extent of the deletion to approximately 190 kb. Interestingly, a failure to amplify a junctional fragment of the deletion break strongly suggests an insertion in addition to the large deletion. CONCLUSION: Here, we report a novel insertion/deletion mutation at the GCNT2 locus that is responsible for congenital cataracts in a large consanguineous family.
27829980	Exploring the ecological function of CRISPR-Cas virus defense.	Virus-host interaction is a key process in understanding the ecology and evolution of life. The study of the CRISPR-Cas RNA-guided adaptive immune systems of bacteria and archaea has added to our understanding of the virus defense mechanisms of microorganisms. The molecular details of the CRISPR-Cas systems are well explored and have allowed development a new generation of gene editing tools. However, the actual role and importance of CRISPR-Cas virus defense in nature is complex to study and have attracted less attention. Metagenomic analysis of microbial populations and the study of viruses-host systems in the laboratory have begun to unravel this question. Key findings in the field are described, with focus on recent developments.
27997598	Use of Proton Pump Inhibitors and the Risk of Hospitalization for Infectious Gastroenteritis.	INTRODUCTION: To quantify the association between PPI use, type and dose and infectious gastroenteritis hospitalization in a population-based cohort of middle-aged and older adults. METHODS: Prospective study of 38,019 concession card holders followed up over 6 years in the Sax Institute's 45 and Up Study. Data from the baseline questionnaire were linked to prescription medication, hospitalization, notifiable disease, cancer registry and death datasets from 2006-2012. Associations between PPI use and gastroenteritis hospitalization were examined using Cox regressions with age as the underlying time variable. RESULTS: Among 38,019 participants, the median age was 69.7 years, and 57.3% were women. Compared to non-users, current PPI users were more likely to be older, and have a higher BMI. During follow-up there were 1,982 incident gastroenteritis hospitalizations (crude rate: 12.9 per 1000 person-years, 95% CI: 12.3-13.5). PPI use was significantly associated with infectious gastroenteritis hospitalization (aHR 1.4, 95% CI: 1.2-1.5). Among current users, a dose-response relationship was observed between the average daily dose (DDD) dispensed per day and infectious gastroenteritis hospitalization (Ptrend<0.001). We also observed higher rates of infectious gastroenteritis hospitalization and greater PPI use among participants with a history of chronic bowel problems (aHR 2.2, 95% CI: 1.9-2.5). There was no difference in risk by type of PPI. Recent use of H2 receptors was not associated with gastroenteritis hospitalization. CONCLUSION: PPI use is associated with an increased risk of infectious gastroenteritis hospitalization. Clinicians should be aware of this risk when considering PPI therapy.
27078050	Parents' early life stressful experiences, their present well-being, and that of their children.	Parents' early life stressful experiences have lifelong consequences, not only for themselves but also for their children. The current study utilized a sample of military families (n = 266) including data from both active-duty and civilian parents and their adolescent children. Hypotheses reflecting principles of persistence, transmission, and proximity as pertaining to parents and their children were examined. The impact of parents' childhood experiences on their functioning later in life and, consequently, their adolescent children's well-being were examined. Adults who encountered more stressful childhood experiences, including relatively prevalent and less severe adversities (e.g., verbal conflict between parents) experienced poorer functioning than adults who encountered little early stress. Civilian parents' current functioning was related to adolescent children's well-being, whereas the functioning of active-duty parents was generally not related to children's well-being. Persistence, transmission, and proximity hypotheses were generally supported but with variations attributable to whether an adult was a military member. (PsycINFO Database Record
27904683	Rapamycin targets Interleukin 6 (IL-6) expression and suppresses endothelial cell invasion stimulated by tumor cells.	mTOR inhibitors have potent antiangiogenic and anti-lymphangiogenic effects in addition to their growth inhibitory effects in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Lymphatogenous spread is much more predominant in HNSCC than hematogenous spread and significantly decreases survival. In this study we evaluated the effects of rapamycin on targeting tumor-stroma crosstalk in HNSCC. HNSCC tumor cells (FaDu) and human lymphatic endothelial cells (HMEC-1A) were co-cultured in various combinations using transwell cell culture inserts to study tumor-stroma crosstalk and the effects of mTOR inhibitor rapamycin. Levels of growth factors and cytokines in cell culture media were measured using Milliplex bead immunoassay (EMD Millipore) and ELISA assay (R&D Systems). We found that conditioned media collected from tumor cells or co-culture with tumor cells significantly increased the invasiveness of lymphatic and blood vascular endothelial cells (P<0.05), while there was no effect of conditioned media collected from endothelial cell cultures or co-culture with endothelial cells on tumor cell invasiveness. There was a significant effect of rapamycin on both baseline and tumor cell stimulated invasiveness of endothelial cells (P<0.05). Importantly the level of IL-6 secreted in media increased significantly in tumor-endothelial cell co-culture compared to monocultures. Rapamycin significantly suppressed secretion of IL-6 by tumor cells (P<0.05). Thus, HNSCC cells produce chemotactic stimuli that promote endothelial cell invasion toward tumor cells that can stimulate lymphangiogenesis. Rapamycin effectively reverted the stimulatory effect of IL-6 secreted by tumor cells on endothelial cell invasiveness.
26985315	Discovery of Aryl Sulfonamides as Isoform-Selective Inhibitors of NaV1.7 with Efficacy in Rodent Pain Models.	We report on a novel series of aryl sulfonamides that act as nanomolar potent, isoform-selective inhibitors of the human sodium channel hNaV1.7. The optimization of these inhibitors is described. We aimed to improve potency against hNaV1.7 while minimizing off-target safety concerns and generated compound 3. This agent displayed significant analgesic effects in rodent models of acute and inflammatory pain and demonstrated that binding to the voltage sensor domain 4 site of NaV1.7 leads to an analgesic effect in vivo. Our findings corroborate the importance of hNaV1.7 as a drug target for the treatment of pain.
27536131	Comparison of bevacizumab plus chemotherapy with chemotherapy alone in advanced non-small-lung cancer patients.	Bevacizumab plus chemotherapy was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a first-line treatment for advanced nonsquamous, non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in 2006. This study retrospectively compared the efficacy of bevacizumab plus chemotherapy with chemotherapy alone as the first-line and second-line treatment as well as the maintenance treatment for advanced NSCLC patients. A total of 1,352 patients were included and we analyzed the efficacy evaluation according to the criteria of the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST), survival, and adverse reactions. The data showed that for bevacizumab plus chemotherapy as the first-line treatment, the median progression-free survival (mPFS) and median overall survival (mOS) were 11.5 and 17.0 months, respectively, compared to 7.0 and 14 months, respectively, in patients who received chemotherapy alone (P<0.01). With bevacizumab plus chemotherapy as maintenance treatment, the mPFS and mOS were 6.0 and 17.4 months, respectively, compared to 3.0 and 15.0 months, respectively, with chemotherapy alone (P<0.01). With bevacizumab plus chemotherapy as the second-line treatment, the mPFS was 3.0 months compared to only 2.0 months with chemotherapy alone (P<0.01). The overall responses to the different regimens showed that the remission rate with bevacizumab plus chemotherapy was higher than that with chemotherapy alone (31.8% vs 25.5%, P<0.05), although there was no statistical difference in the disease control rate with either first- or second-line treatment. In conclusion, chemotherapy plus bevacizumab as the first-line and maintenance treatment, led to better curative rates and tolerable adverse reactions compared with chemotherapy alone in advanced NSCLC patients. Bevacizumab combined with cytotoxic drugs was suitable as the second-line treatment for such patients.
27447169	Individual and Environmental Factors Influencing Adolescents' Dietary Behavior in Low- and Middle-Income Settings.	OBJECTIVE: Given the public health importance of improving dietary behavior in chronic disease prevention in low- and middle-income countries it is crucial to understand the factors influencing dietary behavior in these settings. This study tested the validity of a conceptual framework linking individual and environmental factors to dietary behavior among Ecuadorian adolescents aged 10-16 years. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted in 784 school-going Ecuadorian adolescents in urban and rural Southern Ecuador. Participants provided data on socio-economic status, anthropometry, dietary behavior and its determining factors. The relationships between individual (perceived benefits and barriers, self-efficacy, habit strength, and a better understanding of healthy food) and environmental factors (physical environment: accessibility to healthy food; social environment: parental permissiveness and school support), and their association with key components of dietary behavior (fruit and vegetables, sugary drinks, breakfast, and unhealthy snack intake) were assessed using structural equation modeling. RESULTS: The conceptual model performed well for each component of eating behavior, indicating acceptable goodness-of-fit for both the measurement and structural models. Models for vegetable intake and unhealthy snacking showed significant and direct effects of individual factors (perceived benefits). For breakfast and sugary drink consumption, there was a direct and positive association with socio-environmental factors (school support and parental permissiveness). Access to healthy food was associated indirectly with all eating behaviors (except for sugary drink intake) and this effect operated through socio-environmental (parental permissiveness and school support) and individual factors (perceived benefits). CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated that key components of adolescents' dietary behaviors are influenced by a complex interplay of individual and environmental factors. The findings indicate that the influence of these factors varied by type of dietary behavior.
27930736	Analysis of a Smartphone-Based Architecture with Multiple Mobility Sensors for Fall Detection.	During the last years, many research efforts have been devoted to the definition of Fall Detection Systems (FDSs) that benefit from the inherent computing, communication and sensing capabilities of smartphones. However, employing a smartphone as the unique sensor in a FDS application entails several disadvantages as long as an accurate characterization of the patient's mobility may force to transport this personal device on an unnatural position. This paper presents a smartphone-based architecture for the automatic detection of falls. The system incorporates a set of small sensing motes that can communicate with the smartphone to help in the fall detection decision. The deployed architecture is systematically evaluated in a testbed with experimental users in order to determine the number and positions of the sensors that optimize the effectiveness of the FDS, as well as to assess the most convenient role of the smartphone in the architecture.
27924716	Allergen quantification in surface dust samples from German day care centers.	Indoor allergens are among the main causes of allergic rhinitis and asthma. Allergen exposure is not limited to private homes. Mite, cat, and dog allergens were measured in day care centers to determine whether these concentrations detected might exert significant influence on human health. In 20 day care centers across North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany, the surfaces of 171 rooms were vacuumed 4 times a year to collect dust (1340 samples in total). In all samples, domestic mite antigens (DM) and the main allergens of cats (Fel d 1) and dogs (Can f 1) were quantified using enzyme immunoassays. Provisional threshold limits (PTL) for increased risks of sensitization and allergic symptoms were estimated according to published values and conversion factors. The influence of room characteristics on allergen concentrations was analyzed in mixed linear models, also considering values below the limit of detection (LOD). Nearly all samples contained allergens (99% DM, 96% Fel d 1, and 96% Can f 1). The concentrations rarely exceeded levels that were previously found to induce symptoms in home environments, but were frequently higher than estimates for enhanced sensitization risk (13% DM, 43% Fel d 1, and 27% Can f 1). Upholstered furnishings had the highest dust and allergen loads, followed by carpets and smooth floors. Allergen concentrations on different surface types that were sampled in the same room at the same time were significantly correlated and analyzed in separate models. The highest DM concentrations were present in bedrooms and in autumn. Further, DM loads on floors decreased significantly in rooms that were renovated within the last 5 years. If there were no records that furnishings were vacuumed, there were then significantly higher Can f 1 loads. Sweeping floors elevated DM and cat allergen concentrations. In addition to mite allergens, cat and dog allergens were detected in nearly all samples from day care centers. Overall, the present results indicate that allergen concentrations may be reduced by renovation and appropriate cleaning procedures.
27092067	Unconscious Processing of Negative Animals and Objects: Role of the Amygdala Revealed by fMRI.	Previous studies have shown that emotional stimuli can be processed through the amygdala without conscious awareness. The amygdala is also involved in processing animate and social information. However, it is unclear whether different categories of pictures (e.g., animals, objects) elicit different activity in the amygdale and other regions without conscious awareness. The objective of this study was to explore whether the factors of category, emotion and picture context modulate brain activation for unconscious processing. Pictures denoting different nonhuman animals and objects in negative and neutral emotional valences were presented using a sandwich-masking paradigm. Half of them were presented with human-related information in the contexts, and half were not. Our results showed significant interaction among category, emotion and context in the amygdala and subcortical regions. Specifically, negative animals elicited stronger activation in these regions than negative objects, especially with human contexts. In addition, there were different correlation patterns between the amygdala and cortical regions according to whether they included human context. There were limited activations in cortical category-related networks. These results suggest that the amygdala and subcortical regions dominantly process negative animals, and contextual information modulates their activities, making threatening stimuli that are most relevant to human survival preferentially processed without conscious awareness.
27774328	A Case of Bilateral Permanent Subluxation of the Lateral Meniscus.	We report a case of bilateral, permanent subluxation of the lateral meniscus. To our knowledge, the present case is the first reported description of bilateral irreducible anterior dislocation of the posterior segment of the lateral meniscus. This disorder is characterized by a flipped meniscus sign of the lateral meniscus on sagittal magnetic resonance images of the knee joint, with no history of trauma or locking symptoms. A detailed examination of serial magnetic resonance images of the lateral meniscus can help differentiate this condition from malformation of the lateral meniscus, that is, a double-layered meniscus. We recommend two-stage treatment for this disorder. First, the knee joint is kept in straight position for 3 weeks after the lateral meniscus is reduced to the normal position. Second, if subluxation of the lateral meniscus recurs, meniscocapsular suture is then performed. Although subluxation of the lateral meniscus without locking symptoms is rare, it is important to be familiar with this condition to diagnose and treat it correctly.
27855391	Suppression of MicroRNA-219-5p Activates Keratinocyte Growth Factor to Mitigate Severity of Experimental Cirrhosis.	BACKGROUND/AIMS: Keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) plays a critical role in prevention of cirrhosis and enhancement of liver regeneration. However, the molecular regulation of KGF in liver is unknown. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) control the pathogenesis of cirrhosis, whereas the exact involved miRNAs and molecular signaling pathways remain ill-defined. Here we addressed these questions. METHODS: We examined the correlation of the levels of miR-219-5p and KGF in the liver biopsies from patients with liver diseases. The effects of overexpression or suppression of miR-219-5p on KGF were examined in both human and mouse hepatic stellate cells (HSCs). Bioinformatics analysis was applied to examine the binding of human/mouse miR-219-5p to the 3'-UTR of human/mouse KGF mRNA, respectively. Finally, adeno-associated viruses carrying antisense of miR-219-5p were infused into the liver from the mice that had developed cirrhosis by carbon tetrachloride (CCl4), and the effects on KGF levels and liver damage and function were examined. RESULTS: The levels of miR-219-5p and KGF in the liver biopsies were inversely correlated. MiR-219-5p inhibited KGF expression in both human and mouse HSCs, through directly binding the 3'-UTR of KGF mRNA. Expression of antisense of miR-219-5p significantly attenuated the levels of liver fibrosis, portal hypertension and sodium retention caused by CCl4. CONCLUSIONS: Suppression of miR-219-5p may benefit the liver regeneration and prevent cirrhosis through increasing KGF.
26998186	The role of etiopathogenetic aspects in prediction and prevention of discontinuous-hemorrhagic (Mallory-Weiss) syndrome.	The article contains an overview of the literature on Mallory-Weiss syndrome. It analyzes numerous etiological factors, provides new insights into the pathogenesis of the disease, gives a description of a previously unknown dependence of discontinuous-hemorrhagic syndrome on the topographic and structural features of the cardioesophageal area of the digestive tract, and gives scientific credence to methods of prediction, prevention, and treatment of the syndrome with complex involvement of granular sorbents.
27777948	The Role of Obesity in Sepsis Outcome among Critically Ill Patients: A Retrospective Cohort Analysis.	Background. The objective of this study was to assess the correlation between sepsis, obesity, and mortality of patients admitted to an Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Subjects and Methods. Data of all patients admitted to the ICU of a tertiary hospital during a 28-month period were retrospectively analyzed and included in the study. Results. Of 834 patients included, 163 (19.5%) were obese, while 25 (3.0%) were morbidly obese. Number of comorbidities (P < 0.001), bloodstream infection (P 0.033), and carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae colonization during ICU stay (P 0.005) were significantly associated with obesity, while nonobese patients suffered more frequently from spontaneous intracranial hemorrhage (P 0.038). Total ICU mortality was 22.5%. Increased mortality among obese ICU patients was observed. Sepsis was the main condition of admission for which obese patients had statistically lower survival than normal weight subjects (76.3% versus 43.7%; P 0.001). Mortality of septic patients upon admission was independently associated with SOFA score upon ICU admission (P 0.003), obesity (P 0.014), pneumonia (P 0.038), and development of septic shock (P 0.015). Conclusions. Our study revealed that sepsis upon ICU admission is adversely influenced by obesity but further studies are needed in order to assess the role of obesity in sepsis outcome.
26917377	Formation and characterization of pseudo-polyrotaxanes based on poly(p-dioxanone) and cyclodextrins.	Novel pseudo-polyrotaxanes (PPRs) consisting of poly(p-dioxanone) (PPDO) and cyclodextrins (CDs) were obtained via heat-cool (H-C) cycles. The optimum preparation condition for achieving the highest yield was investigated, which was selected as follow: 3 times H-C cycles in 72 h of PPDO and CDs dissolved in DMF at 60 degrees C. The PPRs were further characterized by using wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD), NMR, FT-IR, and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). It was found that PPDO could be wrapped by CDs units. Compare to the single PPDO chain, the PPRs have better thermal stability. Moreover, the hydrophilicity of PPRs is also enhanced significantly determined by the water static contact angle tests. In addition, hydrolytic degradation experiments showed that the PPRs had unique degradation behaviors. The construction of the PPRs based on the PPDO and CDs would further expand the application of PPDO as biomaterials.
26882784	Effectiveness and Safety of a Clinical Decision Rule to Reduce Repeat Ionized Calcium Testing: A Pre/Post Test Intervention.	The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act authorizes the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to reimburse hospitals that demonstrate meaningful use of certified electronic health record technology. We sought to demonstrate meaningful use by developing and implementing one clinical decision support rule in the computerized physician order entry system that targets clinician-ordered repeat ionized calcium measurement at the University of Connecticut Health Center. The rule consists of a pop-up computer reminder that is triggered by ordering a second ionized calcium test within 72 hours after an initial normal test, with no clear indication for repeat testing. We implemented the rule on December 14, 2010, and have reviewed all data collected through December 2014. We found that the number of repeat tests decreased from 46% to 14% with no significant increase in the number of serious adverse events. We conclude that computerized reminders can decrease unnecessary repeat testing in the inpatient setting.
27725824	Recent Developments in Systems Biology and Metabolic Engineering of Plant-Microbe Interactions.	Microorganisms play a crucial role in the sustainability of the various ecosystems. The characterization of various interactions between microorganisms and other biotic factors is a necessary footstep to understand the association and functions of microbial communities. Among the different microbial interactions in an ecosystem, plant-microbe interaction plays an important role to balance the ecosystem. The present review explores plant-microbe interactions using gene editing and system biology tools toward the comprehension in improvement of plant traits. Further, system biology tools like FBA (flux balance analysis), OptKnock, and constraint-based modeling helps in understanding such interactions as a whole. In addition, various gene editing tools have been summarized and a strategy has been hypothesized for the development of disease free plants. Furthermore, we have tried to summarize the predictions through data retrieved from various types of sources such as high throughput sequencing data (e.g., single nucleotide polymorphism detection, RNA-seq, proteomics) and metabolic models have been reconstructed from such sequences for species communities. It is well known fact that systems biology approaches and modeling of biological networks will enable us to learn the insight of such network and will also help further in understanding these interactions.
27841914	Carotid characteristics of black South Africans with five-year sustained hypertension.	INTRODUCTION: An important feature of hypertension is a reduction in large artery distensibility, which may be due to structural and functional adaptations. Black populations are particularly prone to the development of hypertension. We therefore compared the carotid characteristics between five-year sustained hypertensive and normotensive black South Africans, and investigated how carotid characteristics relate to cardiometabolic risk factors, inflammation, endothelial activation and health behaviours. METHODS: We included HIV-free black South Africans who were either consistently hypertensive (n = 351) or normotensive (n = 241) from 2005 to 2010. We assessed carotid characteristics, including intima-media thickness (IMT), distensibility and lumen diameter with B-mode ultrasound, and calculated Young's elastic modulus, cross-sectional wall area and beta-stiffness index. We measured the carotid dorsalis pedis pulse-wave velocity, brachial and central systolic blood pressure (cSBP) and determined metabolic, inflammatory and endothelial activation markers from blood samples. Health behaviours were reported in questionnaires. RESULTS: The hypertensive group presented with higher brachial and central blood pressure, thicker IMT and stiffer carotid arteries (all p < 0.001). However, after adjustment for cSBP but not mean arterial pressure (MAP), all significant differences in carotid characteristics were lost. The carotid thickness measurements did not differ after adjustment for MAP. After adjustment, metabolic, inflammatory and endothelial activation markers did not differ between the two groups. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that besides structural changes, functional adaptations are also involved in deterioration of the carotid wall characteristics of hypertensive black South Africans. These results highlight the importance of proper hypertension control in Africa.
27057601	Efficacy and Safety of Nedaplatin in Advanced Breast Cancer Therapy.	PURPOSE: To compare the time-to-treatment failure (TTF), overall survival (OS), overall response rate (ORR), and adverse effects of regimens including nedaplatin- or cisplatin-based chemotherapy for advanced breast cancer (ABC). METHODS: A total of 171 patients with ABC (admission between July 2008 and July 2013) were retrospectively analyzed. Patients received either nedaplatin 75 mg/m(2) (arm N; n = 85) or cisplatin 75 mg/m(2) (arm C; n = 86) in combination with other second-generation chemotherapeutic drugs, such as paclitaxel 175 mg/m(2), docetaxel 75 mg/m(2), gemcitabine 1.25 g/m(2), and navelbine 25 mg/m(2) every 21 days (nedaplatin, cisplatin, paclitaxel, docetaxel on day 1; gemcitabine, navelbine on days 1 and 8). The primary endpoint was TTF in each arm; secondary endpoints were OS, ORR, and toxicity. RESULTS: In the assessable patient population, in arm N, median TTF and OS was 13.87 months (95% CI: 11.55-16.19) and 31.53 months (95% CI: 28.42-34.64), respectively, with an ORR of 48.2%. In arm C, median TTF and OS was 8.7 months (95% CI: 5.82-11.59) and 24.87 months (95% CI: 18.98-30.75), respectively, with an ORR of 37.2%. The occurrence of grades 3 and 4 hematologic toxicity was more frequent (45.9% vs. 25.6%, p = 0.003) in arm N than in arm C. However, grade >/=2 nonhematologic toxicity was less frequent in arm N than in arm C (12.9% vs. 46.5%, p = 2.05 x 10(-7)). CONCLUSIONS: Nedaplatin-based chemotherapy regimen was well tolerated and efficiently improved patients' quality of life characterized by prolonged TTF and OS, with a marginal ORR.
27398554	CeO(2)-Co(3)O(4)/CuO Catalysts with Chrysanthemum-Like Morphology for Preferential CO Oxidation.	Inverse CeO(2)-Co(3)O(4)/CuO catalysts with chrysanthemum-like morphology were prepared by the co-precipitation method, and characterized via scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR), and N2 adsorption-desorption techniques. It is found that the filament is composed of ordered-array CuO nanocrystallites, and CeO(2) was dispersed on the outer surface of filament. The CeO(2)-Co(3)O(4)/CuO catalyst with thin filaments can form the long periphery at the CeO(2)-CuO contact interface and improve catalytic performance. Therefore, the CAT-350 catalyst with the thinnest filaments presents the highest catalytic activity among the as-prepared catalysts.
27410384	The Economic and Epidemiological Impact of Focusing Voluntary Medical Male Circumcision for HIV Prevention on Specific Age Groups and Regions in Tanzania.	BACKGROUND: Since its launch in 2010, the Tanzania National Voluntary Medical Male Circumcision (VMMC) Program has focused efforts on males ages 10-34 in 11 priority regions. Implementers have noted that over 70% of VMMC clients are between the ages of 10 and 19, raising questions about whether additional efforts would be required to recruit men age 20 and above. This analysis uses mathematical modeling to examine the economic and epidemiological consequences of scaling up VMMC among specific age groups and priority regions in Tanzania. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Analyses were conducted using the Decision Makers' Program Planning Tool Version 2.0 (DMPPT 2.0), a compartmental model implemented in Microsoft Excel 2010. The model was populated with population, mortality, and HIV incidence and prevalence projections from external sources, including outputs from Spectrum/AIDS Impact Module (AIM). A separate DMPPT 2.0 model was created for each of the 11 priority regions. Tanzania can achieve the most immediate impact on HIV incidence by circumcising males ages 20-34. This strategy would also require the fewest VMMCs for each HIV infection averted. Circumcising men ages 10-24 will have the greatest impact on HIV incidence over a 15-year period. The most cost-effective approach (lowest cost per HIV infection averted) targets men ages 15-34. The model shows the VMMC program is cost saving in all 11 priority regions. VMMC program cost-effectiveness varies across regions due to differences in projected HIV incidence, with the most cost-effective programs in Njombe and Iringa. CONCLUSIONS: The DMPPT 2.0 results reinforce Tanzania's current VMMC strategy, providing newfound confidence in investing in circumcising adolescents. Tanzanian policy makers and program implementers will continue to focus scale-up of VMMC on men ages 10-34 years, seeking to maximize program impact and cost-effectiveness while acknowledging trends in demand among the younger and older age groups.
28165944	A clinical procedures curriculum for undergraduate medical students: the eight-year history of a third-year immersive experience.	Background Procedural skills training is a critical component of medical education, but is often lacking in standard clinical curricula. We describe a unique immersive procedural skills curriculum for medical students, designed and taught primarily by emergency medicine faculty at The Ohio State University College of Medicine. Objectives The primary educational objective of this program was to formally introduce medical students to clinical procedures thought to be important for success in residency. The immersion strategy (teaching numerous procedures over a 7-day period) was intended to complement the student's education on third-year core clinical clerkships. Program design The course introduced 27 skills over 7 days. Teaching and learning methods included lecture, prereading, videos, task trainers, peer teaching, and procedures practice on cadavers. In year 4 of the program, a peer-team teaching model was adopted. We analyzed program evaluation data over time. Impact Students valued the selection of procedures covered by the course and felt that it helped prepare them for residency (97%). The highest rated activities were the cadaver lab and the advanced cardiac life support (97 and 93% positive endorsement, respectively). Lectures were less well received (73% positive endorsement), but improved over time. The transition to peer-team teaching resulted in improved student ratings of course activities (p<0.001). Conclusion A dedicated procedural skills curriculum successfully supplemented the training medical students received in the clinical setting. Students appreciated hands-on activities and practice. The peer-teaching model improved course evaluations by students, which implies that this was an effective teaching method for adult learners. This course was recently expanded and restructured to place the learning closer to the clinical settings in which skills are applied.
27310832	Erythropoietin Levels in Elderly Patients with Anemia of Unknown Etiology.	BACKGROUND: In many elderly patients with anemia, a specific cause cannot be identified. This study investigates whether erythropoietin levels are inappropriately low in these cases of "anemia of unknown etiology" and whether this trend persists after accounting for confounders. METHODS: This study includes all anemic patients over 60 years old who had erythropoietin measured between 2005 and 2013 at a single center. Three independent reviewers used defined criteria to assign each patient's anemia to one of ten etiologies: chronic kidney disease, iron deficiency, chronic disease, confirmed myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), suspected MDS, vitamin B12 deficiency, folate deficiency, anemia of unknown etiology, other etiology, or multifactorial etiology. Iron deficiency anemia served as the comparison group in all analyses. We used linear regression to model the relationship between erythropoietin and the presence of each etiology, sequentially adding terms to the model to account for the hemoglobin concentration, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and Charlson Comorbidity Index. RESULTS: A total of 570 patients met the inclusion criteria. Linear regression analysis showed that erythropoietin levels in chronic kidney disease, anemia of chronic disease and anemia of unknown etiology were lower by 48%, 46% and 27%, respectively, compared to iron deficiency anemia even after adjusting for hemoglobin, eGFR and comorbidities. CONCLUSIONS: We have shown that erythropoietin levels are inappropriately low in anemia of unknown etiology, even after adjusting for confounders. This suggests that decreased erythropoietin production may play a key role in the pathogenesis of anemia of unknown etiology.
28078145	Thirty Years Later: Evolution of Treatment for Acute Left Main Coronary Artery Occlusion.	Acute occlusion of left main coronary artery is a catastrophic event. We describe two patients with acute occlusion of the left main coronary artery treated thirty years apart. The first patient was treated in 1982 and survived the event without revascularization but developed severe heart failure. His survival was so unusual that it merited a case report at that time. The second patient was treated at the end of 2015. Early revascularization resulted in myocardial reperfusion and near normal left ventricular function. These patients exemplify the progress in therapeutic cardiology over the last 30 years.
28123997	Behavior Change with Fitness Technology in Sedentary Adults: A Review of the Evidence for Increasing Physical Activity.	Physical activity is closely linked with health and well-being; however, many Americans do not engage in regular exercise. Older adults and those with low socioeconomic status are especially at risk for poor health, largely due to their sedentary lifestyles. Fitness technology, including trackers and smartphone applications (apps), has become increasingly popular for measuring and encouraging physical activity in recent years. However, many questions remain regarding the effectiveness of this technology for promoting behavior change. Behavior change techniques such as goal setting, feedback, rewards, and social factors are often included in fitness technology. However, it is not clear which components are most effective and which are actually being used by consumers. We discuss additional strategies not typically included in fitness technology devices or apps that are promising for engaging inactive, vulnerable populations. These include action planning, restructuring negative attitudes, enhancing environmental conditions, and identifying other barriers to regular physical activity. We consider which strategies are most conducive to motivating behavior change among sedentary adults. Overall, fitness technology has the potential to significantly impact public health, research, and policies. We suggest ways in which app developers and behavior change experts can collaborate to develop successful apps. Advances are still needed to help inactive individuals determine how, when, where, and with whom they can increase their physical activity.
28139578	[Extradural spinal cord hemangioblastoma (a case report and literature review)].	Hemangioblastoma is a rare CNS vascular tumor that develops sporadically and can also be associated with von Hippel-Lindau disease. Hemangioblastomas account for 2-6% of all spinal cord tumors and are ranked third in the structure of intramedullary space-occupying lesions of the spinal cord. For the first time in our practice, we observed a dumbbell paravertebral hemangioblastoma. The international literature reports only 3 cases of the tumor with this growth type.
26909794	Syndecan-1-Induced ECM Fiber Alignment Requires Integrin alphavbeta3 and Syndecan-1 Ectodomain and Heparan Sulfate Chains.	Expression of the cell surface proteoglycan syndecan-1 (Sdc1) is frequently induced in stromal fibroblasts of invasive breast carcinomas. We have recently identified a correlation between stromal Sdc1 expression and extracellular matrix (ECM) fiber alignment, both in vitro and in vivo. ECMs derived from Sdc1-positive human mammary fibroblasts (HMF) showed an aligned fiber architecture, which contrasted markedly with the more random fiber arrangement in the ECM produced by Sdc1-negative HMFs. We further demonstrated that aligned fiber architecture promotes the directional migration and invasion of breast carcinoma cells. To decipher the molecular mechanisms governing the formation of an aligned, invasion-permissive ECM, a series of Sdc1 mutants was introduced into HMF. We found that both the ectodomain and heparan sulfate chains of Sdc1 were required for full activity of Sdc1 in regulating ECM alignment, while transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains were dispensable. Sdc1 regulates the activities of several integrins via its ectodomain. Integrins are key players in the assembly of fibronectin-rich ECM. In addition, integrins are capable of regulating cell morphology and cell shape and orientation may affect ECM architecture. Therefore, we investigated the role of integrins in Sdc1-mediated ECM fiber alignment. Sdc1-overexpressing HMF gained an enhanced spindle-shaped morphology when cultured in an overconfluent state under conditions permissive for ECM production, which was partially reversed by siRNA-mediated silencing of beta3 integrin expression. Moreover, suppression of alphavbeta3 integrin activity by a function-blocking antibody or beta3 knockdown largely abolished the aligned ECM fiber architecture and consequently the invasion-permissive properties of the ECM induced by Sdc1. The results suggest that Sdc1 may modulate fibronectin fibrillogenesis and/or alter cell morphology during ECM production through alphavbeta3 integrin, thereby mediating ECM fiber alignment. Understanding the mechanisms governing ECM organization may lead to the development of novel stroma-targeted therapy for breast cancer, aiming at converting an invasion-permissive to an invasion-restrictive microenvironment.
26933625	Neimark-Sacker bifurcation of a two-dimensional discrete-time predator-prey model.	In this paper, we study the dynamics and bifurcation of a two-dimensional discrete-time predator-prey model in the closed first quadrant [Formula: see text]. The existence and local stability of the unique positive equilibrium of the model are analyzed algebraically. It is shown that the model can undergo a Neimark-Sacker bifurcation in a small neighborhood of the unique positive equilibrium and an invariant circle will appear. Some numerical simulations are presented to illustrate our theocratical results and numerically it is shown that the unique positive equilibrium of the system is globally asymptotically stable.
27441309	Neurocysticercosis presenting as a 'Stroke Mimic'.	A 62 year old Nepalese gentleman presented with left sided weakness and sensory loss. Initial brain CT scanning was suggestive of acute infarction but a subsequent MRI scan showed cysts with oedema. Cysticercosis serology was positive and a diagnosis of neurocysticercosis was made. The patient made almost a complete recovery after treatment with albendazole, praziquantel and steroids. Neurocysticercosis should be considered in the diffierential diagnosis when patients originating from endemic areas present with focal neurological deficit.
26915867	Inhibition of High Mobility Group Box 1-Toll-Like Receptor-4 Signaling by Glycyrrhizin Contributes to the Attenuation of Cold Ischemic Injury of Liver in a Rat Model.	BACKGROUND: Cold ischemic injury in liver storage is an important issue pertaining to liver transplantation. Glycyrrhizin (GL), the glycoconjugated triterpene produced by the root of the licorice plant, has been used to treat chronic hepatitis; however, its function against cold ischemia injury remains unknown. METHODS: Livers from Wistar rats were reperfused at 37 degrees C for 60 minutes either immediately or after 24 hours of cold storage in histidine-tryptophan-ketoglutarate (HTK) solution containing different concentrations of GL (n = 30 for each group). Bile and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels in the effluent perfusates were determined. Apoptotic cells, high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), and nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB in liver grafts were assessed. The levels of inflammatory mediators (tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-alpha, interleukin [IL]-6) in the effluent perfusates were measured. RESULTS: Addition of GL to HTK solution significantly attenuated ischemic injury during reperfusion in a dose-dependent way, as evidenced by the lower liver injury scores, lower LDH leakage, and increased bile secretion. After reperfusion, livers stored in HTK solution containing GL had decreased expression of HMGB1, TLR4, and NF-kappaB, and less apoptosis compared with those stored without GL. The levels of TNF-alpha and IL-6 in the effluent were also decreased when stored in GL-containing HTK solution. CONCLUSION: The addition of GL to HTK solution attenuates cold ischemic injury during cold storage and the mechanism is at least partially attributable to the inhibition of TLR4 signaling.
27843479	Protective Effect of Psoralea corylifolia L. Seed Extract against Palmitate-Induced Neuronal Apoptosis in PC12 Cells.	The extract of Psoralea corylifolia seeds (PCE) has been widely used as a herbal medicine because of its beneficial effect on human health. In this study, we investigated the protective effects and molecular mechanisms of PCE on palmitate- (PA-) induced toxicity in PC12 cells, a neuron-like cell line. PCE significantly increased cell viability in PA-treated PC12 cells and showed antiapoptotic effects, as evidenced by decreased expression of cleaved caspase-3, cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, and bax protein as well as increased expression of bcl-2 protein. In addition, PCE treatment reduced PA-induced reactive oxygen species production and upregulated mRNA levels of antioxidant genes such as nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 and heme oxygenase 1. Moreover, PCE treatment recovered the expression of autophagy marker genes such as beclin-1 and p62, which was decreased by PA treatment. Treatment with isopsoralen, one of the major components of PCE extract, also recovered the expression of autophagy marker genes and reduced PA-induced apoptosis. In conclusion, PCE exerts protective effects against lipotoxicity via its antioxidant function, and this effect is mediated by activation of autophagy. PCE might be a potential pharmacological agent to protect against neuronal cell injury caused by oxidative stress or lipotoxicity.
26967234	[Changes in the prognosis and treatment of Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia. Literature overview and own experience].	Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia is defined by the presence of monoclonal immunoglobulin IgM type (M-IgM) and evidence of lymphoplasmacytic bone marrow infiltration. The disease has an indolent course, the treatment is only initiated when the disease has begun to damage its carrier. The following symptoms are regarded as proven indications for initiating therapy: B symptoms, symptomatic lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, anemia with hemoglobin below 100 g / l or thrombocytopenia < 100 x 10(9)/l, caused by lymphoplasmacytic bone marrow infiltration. Frequent indications for initiating treatment include clinical evidence of hyperviscosity or cryoglobulinemia. M-IgM tends to have a character of autoantibody reaching up to 50 %, which may harm the organism, and therefore any proven damage to the organism by an autoimmune activity of M-IgM is also an indication for treatment. The text includes an overview of rare and very rare types of damage to the organism by M-IgM autoimmune activity. A combination of rituximab, cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone (RCD) is recommended for the initial treatment, possibly extended to R-CHOP regimen (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin and prednisone). In our cohort of 43 patients the therapy involving a combination of R-CHOP achieved 3 (8.1 %) complete remissions and 31 (83.8 %) partial remissions. The remission in 75 % of the patients lasted more than 3 years. In case of recurrence after > 2 years, the same therapy can be used, in case of a relapse within a shorter period of time different treatment schedules are recommended. High-dose chemotherapy with an autologous transplant of stem cells obtained from peripheral blood is only recommended after the first recurrence for people under 65 years of age without contraindications. The text analyses the benefits of the new drugs for the treatment of Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia (bendamustine, thalidomide, lenalidomide, ibrutinib and high-dose chemotherapy).
27660759	Role of Long Noncoding RNA HOTAIR in the Growth and Apoptosis of Osteosarcoma Cell MG-63.	This study investigated the function of HOTAIR in the growth and apoptosis of OS MG-63 cell line in vitro and further clarified its mechanism. The expression levels of HOTAIR in OS MG-63 cell line and normal osteoblast hFOB1.19 cell line were determined by RT-PCR, respectively. The growth and apoptosis of MG-63 cells in vitro were investigated by MTT assay and flow cytometry assay after HOTAIR was knocked down with retroviral vector construction. And the expression levels of cell growth and apoptosis related factors TGF-beta, p53, Bcl-2, and TNF-alpha were determined to clarify the mechanism. We found that HOTAIR was highly expressed in osteosarcoma MG-63 cell line compared with normal osteoblast hFOB1.19 cell line. The proliferation rate was lower and the apoptosis rate was higher significantly in shHOTAIR MG-63 cells than those in EV MG-63 cells. TGF-beta and Bcl-2 were downregulated significantly when HOTAIR was knocked down. p53 and TNF-alpha were upregulated significantly when HOTAIR was knocked down. These results indicated that HOTAIR functioned as a carcinogenic lncRNA, which could promote the proliferation and inhibit the apoptosis of MG-63 cells in vitro. HOTAIR could be a potential target for the treatment of osteosarcoma.
27610394	Preclinical evaluation of mesenchymal stem cells overexpressing VEGF to treat critical limb ischemia.	Numerous clinical trials are utilizing mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) to treat critical limb ischemia, primarily for their ability to secrete signals that promote revascularization. These cells have demonstrated clinical safety, but their efficacy has been limited, possibly because these paracrine signals are secreted at subtherapeutic levels. In these studies the combination of cell and gene therapy was evaluated by engineering MSC with a lentivirus to overexpress vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). To achieve clinical compliance, the number of viral insertions was limited to 1-2 copies/cell and a constitutive promoter with demonstrated clinical safety was used. MSC/VEGF showed statistically significant increases in blood flow restoration as compared with sham controls, and more consistent improvements as compared with nontransduced MSC. Safety of MSC/VEGF was assessed in terms of genomic stability, rule-out tumorigenicity, and absence of edema or hemangiomas in vivo. In terms of retention, injected MSC/VEGF showed a steady decline over time, with a very small fraction of MSC/VEGF remaining for up to 4.5 months. Additional safety studies completed include absence of replication competent lentivirus, sterility tests, and absence of VSV-G viral envelope coding plasmid. These preclinical studies are directed toward a planned phase 1 clinical trial to treat critical limb ischemia.
27101009	Heterologous Expression and Biochemical Characterization of Two Lipoxygenases in Oriental Melon, Cucumis melo var. makuwa Makino.	Lipoxygenases (LOXs) are a class of non-heme iron-containing dioxygenases that catalyse oxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids to produce hydroperoxidation that are in turn converted to oxylipins. Although multiple isoforms of LOXs have been detected in several plants, LOXs in oriental melon have not attracted much attention. Two full-length LOX cDNA clones, CmLOX10 and CmLOX13 which have been isolated from oriental melon (Cucumis melo var. makuwa Makino) cultivar "Yumeiren", encode 902 and 906 amino acids, respectively. Bioinformatics analysis showed that CmLOX10 and CmLOX13 included all of the typical LOX domains and shared 58.11% identity at the amino acid level with each other. The phylogenetic analysis revealed that CmLOX10 and CmLOX13 were members of the type 2 13-LOX subgroup which are known to be involved in biotic and abiotic stress. Heterologous expression of the full-length CmLOX10 and truncated CmLOX13 in Escherichia coli revealed that the encoded exogenous proteins were identical to the predicted molecular weights and possessed the lipoxygenase activities. The purified CmLOX10 and CmLOX13 recombinant enzymes exhibited maximum activity at different temperature and pH and both had higher affinity for linoleic acid than linolenic acid. Chromatogram analysis of reaction products from the CmLOX10 and CmLOX13 enzyme reaction revealed that both enzymes produced 13S-hydroperoxides when linoleic acid was used as substrate. Furthermore, the subcellular localization analysis by transient expression of the two LOX fusion proteins in tobacco leaves showed that CmLOX10 and CmLOX13 proteins were located in plasma membrane and chloroplasts respectively. We propose that the two lipoxygenases may play different functions in oriental melon during plant growth and development.
26848271	Prognostic implications of immunohistochemistry markers for EGFR-TKI therapy in Chinese patients with advanced lung adenocarcinoma harboring EGFR mutations.	BACKGROUND: Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations in non-small-cell lung cancer predict dramatic clinical responses to tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) treatment. The conclusion on EGFR mutation-specific antibodies by immunohistochemistry (IHC) is not consistent. We evaluated the clinical availability of EGFR mutation-specific antibodies, investigating the prediction role of mutant EGFRs and other IHC markers in TKI therapy in patients with advanced lung adenocarcinoma. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed 637 primary lung adenocarcinomas from an unselected Chinese population. For IHC, antibodies against EGFR exon 19 E746_A750 deletions, exon 21 L858R mutations, thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1), and Napsin-A were applied. Positivity was defined as staining score >0. RESULTS: Specificities of E746_A750 and L858R antibodies were 99.6% and 99.3%, while sensitivities were 86.0% and 82.7%, respectively. Tumors with Napsin-A positivity, TTF-1 positivity, EGFR mutations, and lepidic pattern showed a lower marker of proliferation index (Ki67). Higher expression scores of mutant EGFR protein, TTF-1 positivity, lower Ki67 proliferation index, and lepidic pattern were associated with longer progression-free survival. CONCLUSION: High scores of mutant EGFR, Napsin-A positivity, TTF-1 positivity, lower Ki67 index, and lepidic pattern were favorable predictors for TKI therapy in patients with advanced lung adenocarcinoma.
27935992	Intense Exercise and Aerobic Conditioning Associated with Chromium or L-Carnitine Supplementation Modified the Fecal Microbiota of Fillies.	Recent studies performed in humans and rats have reported that exercise can alter the intestinal microbiota. Athletic horses perform intense exercise regularly, but studies characterizing horse microbiome during aerobic conditioning programs are still limited. Evidence has indicated that this microbial community is involved in the metabolic homeostasis of the host. Research on ergogenic substances using new sequencing technologies have been limited to the intestinal microbiota and there is a considerable demand for scientific studies that verify the effectiveness of these supplements in horses. L-carnitine and chromium are potentially ergogenic substances for athletic humans and horses since they are possibly able to modify the metabolism of carbohydrates and lipids. This study aimed to assess the impact of acute exercise and aerobic conditioning, associated either with L-carnitine or chromium supplementation, on the intestinal microbiota of fillies. Twelve "Mangalarga Marchador" fillies in the incipient fitness stage were distributed into four groups: control (no exercise), exercise, L-carnitine (10g/day) and chelated chromium (10mg/day). In order to investigate the impact of acute exercise or aerobic conditioning on fecal microbiota all fillies undergoing the conditioning program were analyzed as a separate treatment. The fillies underwent two incremental exercise tests before and after training on a treadmill for 42 days at 70-80% of the lactate threshold intensity. Fecal samples were obtained before and 48 h after acute exercise (incremental exercise test). Bacterial populations were characterized by sequencing the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene using the MiSeq Illumina platform, and 5,224,389 sequences were obtained from 48 samples. The results showed that, overall, the two most abundant phyla were Firmicutes (50.22%) followed by Verrucomicrobia (15.13%). The taxa with the highest relative abundances were unclassified Clostridiales (17.06%) and "5 genus incertae sedis" from the phylum Verrucomicrobia (12.98%). There was a decrease in the phylum Chlamydiae and in the genus Mycobacterium after the second incremental exercise test. Intense exercise changed the community's structure and aerobic conditioning was associated with changes in the composition and structure of the intestinal bacterial population of fillies. The intra-group comparison showed that chromium or L-carnitine induced moderate changes in the fecal microbiota of fillies, but the microbiota did not differ from the control group, which was exercised with no supplementation. Fecal pH correlated positively with Simpson's index, while plasma pH correlated negatively. Our results show that exercise and aerobic conditioning can change in the microbiota and provide a basis for further studies enrolling a larger number of horses at different fitness levels to better understand the effects of exercise and training on the intestinal microbiota of horses.
27494000	[Perspectives to improve the sexual health of sexual and gender identity minorities in Guatemala].	Sexual and gender identity minorities in Guatemala are disproportionally affected by HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STI). However, little is known about the health determinants among these minorities that contribute to infection risk. Health researchers from the United States and Guatemala sought to explore sexual health needs and identify characteristics of HIV/STI prevention programs for these minorities.Our partnership conducted 8 focus groups with gay and bisexual men, men who have sex with men, and transgender women; and 10 in-depth interviews with community leaders. We analyzed transcripts of the focus groups and in-depth interviews using constant comparison.We identified 24 factors that influence sexual health which we organized into 5 ecological domains and 16 characteristics of potentially successful programs to reduce HIV/STI risk.The identification of sexual risk factors and characteristics of potentially successful programs offers great potential to develop interventions to help reduce the risk of HIV/STI infection among these minorities in Guatemala.
28139593	[Dental 3d level simulators in the study of local anesthesia].	The purpose of the study was to develop a training protocol for local anesthesia in dental students. The study involved 90 2d year dental school students divided into 3 groups according to procedure training method: on skeletal preparations; by <<Typodont>> simulator and by combination of methods. Manipulation effectiveness criteria in skeletal preparations was penetrating the mandibular foramina by isolation of the corresponding region by latex scarf. In <<Typodont>> the effective injection was determined by light and sound signals. The results showed the necessity for combined approach as it gives an opportunity to identify mandible foramina by projecting on soft tissue marks with further skills developing on the simulator. When using the combined approach only 4 students successfully completed their task by initial injection while at the second attempt only 4 were not successful.
26941785	Chaotic Teaching-Learning-Based Optimization with Levy Flight for Global Numerical Optimization.	Recently, teaching-learning-based optimization (TLBO), as one of the emerging nature-inspired heuristic algorithms, has attracted increasing attention. In order to enhance its convergence rate and prevent it from getting stuck in local optima, a novel metaheuristic has been developed in this paper, where particular characteristics of the chaos mechanism and Levy flight are introduced to the basic framework of TLBO. The new algorithm is tested on several large-scale nonlinear benchmark functions with different characteristics and compared with other methods. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms other algorithms and achieves a satisfactory improvement over TLBO.
26889946	A fundamental study on the dynamics of multiple biomarkers in mouse excisional wounds for wound age estimation.	Wound age estimation is a classic but still modern theme in forensic practice. More experiments on different types of wound are needed to further improve its accuracy. In this study, mouse skin excisional wounds were created to simulate dermal defective injury. The neutrophil and macrophage infiltration, fibroblast and fibrocyte accumulation as well as their myofibroblastic transformation were examined. In addition, some wound healing-related molecules, including IL-1beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, MCP-1, CXCL12, VEGF-A, EGF, KGF, pro-col Ialpha2 and pro-col IIIalpha1, were quantified by Western blotting and real-time quantitative PCR. Neutrophils and macrophages profoundly infiltrated in the wound at 12 h-1 d and 3 d-10 d respectively. Fibroblasts and fibrocytes accumulated in the wound from 3 d, and transformed into contractile myofibroblasts from 5 d post injury. The transformation ratios of fibroblasts and fibrocytes were highest at 7 d-10 d and 10 d respectively (over 50%). MCP-1 and CXCL12 increased from 12 h to 5 d, and IL-1beta, TNF-alpha and pro-col IIIalpha1 up to 7 d. IL-6 and VEGF-A increased from 12 h to 1 d-10 d. Pro-col Ialpha2 increased from 7 d to 21 d. IFN-gamma decreased from 12 h to 10 d. By comprehensive analysis of these factors from the perspective of morphometrics, protein and gene expressions, this study provided us with fundamental information for wound age estimation, especially in the wounds with full-thickness defection.
26980368	Frailty and Constellations of Factors in Aging HIV-infected and Uninfected Women--The Women's Interagency HIV Study.	BACKGROUND: Biological similarities are noted between aging and HIV infection. Middle-aged adults with HIV infection may present as elderly due to accelerated aging or having more severe aging phenotypes occurring at younger ages. OBJECTIVES: We explored age-adjusted prevalence of frailty, a geriatric condition, among HIV+ and at risk HIV- women. DESIGN: Cross-sectional. SETTING: The Women's Interagency HIV Study (WIHS). PARTICIPANTS: 2028 middle-aged (average age 39 years) female participants (1449 HIV+; 579 HIV-). MEASUREMENTS: The Fried Frailty Index (FFI), HIV status variables, and constellations of variables representing Demographic/health behaviors and Aging-related chronic diseases. Associations between the FFI and other variables were estimated, followed by stepwise regression models. RESULTS: Overall frailty prevalence was 15.2% (HIV+, 17%; HIV-, 10%). A multivariable model suggested that HIV infection with CD4 count<200; age>40 years; current or former smoking; income </=$12,000; moderate vs low fibrinogen-4 (FIB-4) levels; and moderate vs high estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) were positively associated with frailty. Low or moderate drinking was protective. CONCLUSIONS: Frailty is a multidimensional aging phenotype observed in mid-life among women with HIV infection. Prevalence of frailty in this sample of HIV-infected women exceeds that for usual elderly populations. This highlights the need for geriatricians and gerontologists to interact with younger 'at risk' populations, and assists in the formulation of best recommendations for frailty interventions to prevent early aging, excess morbidities and early death.
28006004	Downregulation of TGF-beta Receptor-2 Expression and Signaling through Inhibition of Na/K-ATPase.	Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) is a multi-functional cytokine implicated in the control of cell growth and differentiation. TGF-beta signals through a complex of TGF-beta receptors 1 and 2 (TGFbetaR1 and TGFbetaR2) that phosphorylate and activate Smad2/3 transcription factors driving transcription of the Smad-target genes. The Na+/K+-ATPase is an integral plasma membrane protein critical for maintaining the electro-chemical gradient of Na+ and K+ in the cell. We found that inhibition of the Na+/K+ ATPase by ouabain results in a dramatic decrease in the expression of TGFbetaR2 in human lung fibrobalsts (HLF) at the mRNA and protein levels. This was accompanied by inhibition of TGF-beta-induced Smad phosphorylation and the expression of TGF-beta target genes, such as fibronectin and smooth muscle alpha-actin. Inhibition of Na+/K+ ATPase by an alternative approach (removal of extracellular potassium) had a similar effect in HLF. Finally, treatment of lung alveolar epithelial cells (A549) with ouabain also resulted in the downregulation of TGFbetaR2, the inhibition of TGF-beta-induced Smad phosphorylation and of the expression of mesenchymal markers, vimentin and fibronectin. Together, these data demonstrate a critical role of Na+/K+-ATPase in the control of TGFbetaR2 expression, TGF-beta signaling and cell responses to TGF-beta.
27003162	Proteomic Profiling of Mouse Liver following Acute Toxoplasma gondii Infection.	Toxoplasma gondii remains a global public health problem. However, its pathophysiology is still not-completely understood particularly the impact of infection on host liver metabolism. We performed iTRAQ-based proteomic analysis to evaluate early liver protein responses in BALB/c mice following infection with T. gondii PYS strain (genotype ToxoDB#9) infection. Our data revealed modification of protein expression in key metabolic pathways, as indicated by the upregulation of immune response and downregulation of mitochondrial respiratory chain, and the metabolism of fatty acids, lipids and xenobiotics. T. gondii seems to hijack host PPAR signaling pathway to downregulate the metabolism of fatty acids, lipids and energy in the liver. The metabolism of over 400 substances was affected by the downregulation of genes involved in xenobiotic metabolism. The top 10 transcription factors used by upregulated genes were Stat2, Stat1, Irf2, Irf1, Sp2, Egr1, Stat3, Klf4, Elf1 and Gabpa, while the top 10 transcription factors of downregulated genes were Hnf4A, Ewsr1, Fli1, Hnf4g, Nr2f1, Pparg, Rxra, Hnf1A, Foxa1 and Foxo1. These findings indicate global reprogramming of the metabolism of the mouse liver after acute T. gondii infection. Functional characterization of the altered proteins may enhance understanding of the host responses to T. gondii infection and lead to the identification of new therapeutic targets.
27499620	A year in the life of German patients with COPD: the DACCORD observational study.	INTRODUCTION: Randomized interventional trials generally recruit highly selected patients. In contrast, long-term, noninterventional studies can reflect standard of care of real-life populations. DACCORD (Die ambulante Versorgung mit langwirksamen Bronchodilatatoren: COPD-Register in Deutschland [Outpatient Care With Long-Acting Bronchodilators: COPD Registry in Germany]) is an ongoing observational study, conducted in primary and secondary care in Germany, aiming to describe the impact of disease and treatments on real-life patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). METHODS: Patients had a clinical and spirometry diagnosis of COPD, were aged >/=40 years, and were initiating or changing COPD maintenance medication. The only exclusion criteria were asthma and participation in a randomized clinical trial. Exacerbation data were collected every 3 months. COPD medication, COPD Assessment Test, and forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) were recorded at the end of the 1 year period. RESULTS: In the 6 months prior to baseline, 26.5% of the 3,974 patients experienced >/=1 exacerbation, compared with 26.1% over the 1-year follow-up (annualized rate 0.384). Importantly, only previous exacerbations and not poor lung function alone predicted an increased exacerbation risk. There was a general shift to lower disease severity from baseline to 1 year, predominantly as a consequence of a lower proportion of patients considered at high risk due to exacerbations. COPD Assessment Test mean change from baseline was -1.9, with 48.9% of patients reporting a clinically relevant improvement. Overall persistence to medication was high, with 77.2% of patients still receiving the same class of medication at 1 year. CONCLUSION: DACCORD suggests that in clinical practice, the large majority of COPD patients are symptomatic but seldom exacerbate and that widely used tools and treatment recommendations do not reflect this fully.
27418962	The effect of particle size and amount of inoculum on fungal treatment of wheat straw and wood chips.	BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to optimize the fungal treatment of lignocellulosic biomass by stimulating the colonization. Wheat straw and wood chips were treated with Ceriporiopsis subvermispora and Lentinula edodes with various amounts of colonized millet grains (0.5, 1.5 or 3.0 % per g of wet weight of substrate) added to the substrates. Also, wheat straw and wood chips were chopped to either 0.5 or 2 cm. Effectiveness of the fungal treatment after 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8 wk of incubation was determined by changes in chemical composition, in vitro gas production (IVGP) as a measure for rumen degradability, and ergosterol content as a measure of fungal biomass. RESULTS: Incomplete colonization was observed for C. subvermispora treated wheat straw and L. edodes treated wood chips. The different particle sizes and amounts of inoculum tested, had no significant effects on the chemical composition and the IVGP of C. subvermispora treated wood chips. Particle size did influence L. edodes treatment of wheat straw. The L. edodes treatment of 2 cm wheat straw resulted in a more selective delignification and a higher IVGP than the smaller particles. Addition of 1.5 % or 3 % L. edodes inoculum to wheat straw resulted in more selective delignification and a higher IVGP than addition of 0.5 % inoculum. CONCLUSION: Particle size and amount of inoculum did not have an effect on C. subvermispora treatment of wood chips. At least 1.5 % L. edodes colonized millet grains should be added to 2 cm wheat straw to result in an increased IVGP and acid detergent lignin (ADL) degradation.
26856512	Assessing health literacy in safety net primary care practices.	Health literacy is now recognized as a crucial element of patient safety. Measuring health literacy in busy primary care practices can be challenging. This article presents findings from a study in which a relatively recent tool, the Newest Vital Sign (NVS) was used in seven safety net primary care practices, five of which were nurse managed health centers. The NVS is a promising tool that could be used extensively in most primary care practices. Providers and staff felt the use of the NVS would be beneficial in identifying low health literacy patients. This study supported previous research on low health literacy as well as the predictors of health literacy. The study also confirmed the NVS as a tool that is efficient to administer while maintaining work flow.
27382495	Multifocal Head and Neck Neurofibromas with Osseous Abnormalities and Muscular Hypoplasia in a Child with Neurofibromatosis: Type I.	Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a clinically and genetically distinct disease involving both neuroectodermal and mesenchymal derivatives. Orofacial manifestations in NF1 have been documented before but occurrence of multifocal intraosseous (IO) and extraosseous (EO) neurofibromas is rare. The present case highlights the importance of imaging findings in the diagnosis and management of multifocal jaw, infratemporal, and parotid neurofibromas with muscular hypoplasia in an eight-year-old girl with NF1. Apart from orthopantomograms (OPG), three-dimensional computed tomography (3D CT) and cross-sectional reformations were valuable in delineating the extent of the lytic lesion and identifying additional bony deformities of the mandible. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) helped to identify the solid nature of the lesion and true extent of the soft tissue mass.
27065811	On Parallel Streams through the Mouse Dorsal Lateral Geniculate Nucleus.	The mouse visual system is an emerging model for the study of cortical and thalamic circuit function. To maximize the usefulness of this model system, it is important to analyze the similarities and differences between the organization of all levels of the murid visual system with other, better studied systems (e.g., non-human primates and the domestic cat). While the understanding of mouse retina and cortex has expanded rapidly, less is known about mouse dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN). Here, we study whether parallel processing streams exist in mouse dLGN. We use a battery of stimuli that have been previously shown to successfully distinguish parallel streams in other species: electrical stimulation of the optic chiasm, contrast-reversing stationary gratings at varying spatial phase, drifting sinusoidal gratings, dense noise for receptive field reconstruction, and frozen contrast-modulating noise. As in the optic nerves of domestic cats and non-human primates, we find evidence for multiple conduction velocity groups after optic chiasm stimulation. As in so-called "visual mammals", we find a subpopulation of mouse dLGN cells showing non-linear spatial summation. However, differences in stimulus selectivity and sensitivity do not provide sufficient basis for identification of clearly distinct classes of relay cells. Nevertheless, consistent with presumptively homologous status of dLGNs of all mammals, there are substantial similarities between response properties of mouse dLGN neurons and those of cats and primates.
27039754	p53, Cyclin D1, p21 (WAF1) and Ki-67 (MIB1) Expression at Invasive Tumour Fronts of Oral Squamous Cell Carcinomas and Development of Local Recurrence.	BACKGROUND: Expression of p53, cyclin D1, p21 (WAF1) and Ki-67 (MIB1) was evaluated in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) to test whether levels of these markers at invasive tumour fronts (ITFs) could predict the development of local recurrence. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Archived paraffin-embedded specimens from 51 patients with T1/T2 tumours were stained immunohistochemically and analysed quantitatively. Local recurrence-free survival was tested with Kaplan-Meier survival plots (log-rank test) using median values to define low and high expression groups and with a Cox's proportional hazards model in which the expression scores were entered as continuous variables. RESULTS: The assessment of expression of all markers was highly reliable, univariate analysis showing that patients with clear surgical margins, with low cyclin D1 and high p21 expression at the ITF had the best local recurrence-free survival. Multivariate analysis showed that these three parameters were independent prognostic factors but that neither p53 nor MIB1 expression were of prognostic value. CONCLUSIONS: Assessment of p53, cyclin D1, p21 (WAF1), and Ki-67 (MIB1) at the ITF could help to predict local recurrence in early stage oral squamous cell carcinoma cases.
26933432	Vitrectomy for Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy in a Patient with Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia.	INTRODUCTION: In this study, we report a case of proliferative diabetic retinopathy in a patient with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) in whom vitrectomy was performed with good results. CASE: A 57-year-old man presented with a chief complaint of decreased visual acuity (VA) in the left eye. Corrected VA of the left eye was 0.03, and ophthalmic examination showed fibrovascular membranes along the vascular arcade and a combined rhegmatogenous-traction retinal detachment with a macular hole. The patient began hemodialysis for diabetic nephropathy in March 2014; thrombocytopenia developed after dialysis was started, and HIT was diagnosed after further evaluation. Argatroban hydrate was being used during dialysis. Treatment was switched from warfarin to argatroban hydrate 6 days prior to vitrectomy being performed on the patient's left eye. Although there was bleeding with somewhat difficult hemostasis during the intraoperative treatment of the fibrovascular membranes, surgery was completed without complications and the postoperative course was good. DISCUSSION: Vitrectomy was performed with good results in this patient with HIT. Treatment with argatroban hydrate during surgery enabled surgery without the danger of intraoperative clotting.
27499741	CoSMoMVPA: Multi-Modal Multivariate Pattern Analysis of Neuroimaging Data in Matlab/GNU Octave.	Recent years have seen an increase in the popularity of multivariate pattern (MVP) analysis of functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) data, and, to a much lesser extent, magneto- and electro-encephalography (M/EEG) data. We present CoSMoMVPA, a lightweight MVPA (MVP analysis) toolbox implemented in the intersection of the Matlab and GNU Octave languages, that treats both fMRI and M/EEG data as first-class citizens. CoSMoMVPA supports all state-of-the-art MVP analysis techniques, including searchlight analyses, classification, correlations, representational similarity analysis, and the time generalization method. These can be used to address both data-driven and hypothesis-driven questions about neural organization and representations, both within and across: space, time, frequency bands, neuroimaging modalities, individuals, and species. It uses a uniform data representation of fMRI data in the volume or on the surface, and of M/EEG data at the sensor and source level. Through various external toolboxes, it directly supports reading and writing a variety of fMRI and M/EEG neuroimaging formats, and, where applicable, can convert between them. As a result, it can be integrated readily in existing pipelines and used with existing preprocessed datasets. CoSMoMVPA overloads the traditional volumetric searchlight concept to support neighborhoods for M/EEG and surface-based fMRI data, which supports localization of multivariate effects of interest across space, time, and frequency dimensions. CoSMoMVPA also provides a generalized approach to multiple comparison correction across these dimensions using Threshold-Free Cluster Enhancement with state-of-the-art clustering and permutation techniques. CoSMoMVPA is highly modular and uses abstractions to provide a uniform interface for a variety of MVP measures. Typical analyses require a few lines of code, making it accessible to beginner users. At the same time, expert programmers can easily extend its functionality. CoSMoMVPA comes with extensive documentation, including a variety of runnable demonstration scripts and analysis exercises (with example data and solutions). It uses best software engineering practices including version control, distributed development, an automated test suite, and continuous integration testing. It can be used with the proprietary Matlab and the free GNU Octave software, and it complies with open source distribution platforms such as NeuroDebian. CoSMoMVPA is Free/Open Source Software under the permissive MIT license. Website: http://cosmomvpa.org Source code: https://github.com/CoSMoMVPA/CoSMoMVPA.
26913224	Does Level of Response to SI Joint Block Predict Response to SI Joint Fusion?	BACKGROUND: The degree of pain relief required to diagnose sacroiliac joint (SIJ) dysfunction following a diagnostic SIJ block (SIJB) is not known. No gold standard exists. Response to definitive (i.e., accepted as effective) treatment might be a reference standard. METHODS: Subgroup analysis of 320 subjects enrolled in two prospective multicenter trials evaluating SIJ fusion (SIJF) in patients with SIJ dysfunction diagnosed by history, physical exam and standardized diagnostic SIJB. A 50% reduction in pain at 30 or 60 minutes following SIJB was considered confirmatory. The absolute and percentage improvements in Visual Analog Scale (VAS) SIJ pain and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) scores at 6 and 12 months after SIJF were correlated with the average acute improvement in SIJ pain with SIJB. RESULTS: The average pain reduction during the first hour after SIJB was 79.3%. Six months after SIJF, the overall mean VAS SIJ pain reduction was 50.9 points (0-100 scale) and the mean ODI reduction was 24.6 points. Reductions at 12 months after SIJF were similar. Examined in multiple ways, improvements in SIJ pain and ODI at 6 and 12 months did not correlate with SIJB findings. CONCLUSIONS: The degree of pain improvement during SIJB did not predict improvements in pain or ODI scores after SIJF. A 50% SIJB threshold resulted in excellent post-SIJF responses. Using overly stringent selection criteria (i.e. 75%) to qualify patients for SIJF has no basis in evidence and would withhold a beneficial procedure from a substantial number of patients with SIJ dysfunction. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level 1. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The degree of pain improvement during an SIJ block does not predict the degree of pain improvement after SIJ fusion.
26940461	Calorie restriction-induced SIRT6 activation delays aging by suppressing NF-kappaB signaling.	Calorie restriction (CR) extends lifespan from yeast to mammals. SIRT6 is a member of the sirtuin family of NAD(+)-dependent histone deacetylases, which is responsible for mediating the effects of CR. The transcription factor NF-kappaB, which is involved in inflammation and aging, has been shown to be regulated by SIRT6. Here we describe the crucial role of SIRT6 in aging and inflammation. We show that CR had improved renal insufficiency and enhanced SIRT6 expression after 6-month treatment in aged mice. Culture cells in low glucose (LG) conditions also showed resistance to cell senescence and enhanced SIRT6 expression compared to normal glucose (NG) group, showing beneficial effects of the CR-mimic cultural conditions. Moreover, SIRT6 overexpression is sufficient to delay the replicative senescence of WI38 by attenuating NF-kappaB signaling, while SIRT6 knockdown results in accelerated cell senescence and overactive NF-kappaB signaling. These findings confirm the key status of CR and disclose the critical role of SIRT6 on aging and inflammation.
27147032	Isolation, Proteomic Analysis, and Microscopy Confirmation of the Liver Nuclear Envelope Proteome.	Nuclei can be relatively easily extracted from homogenized liver due to the softness of the tissue and crudely separated from other cellular organelles by low-speed centrifugation due to the comparatively large size of nuclei. However, further purification is complicated by nuclear envelope continuity with the endoplasmic reticulum, invaginations containing mitochondria, and connections to the cytoskeleton. Subsequent purification to nuclear envelopes is additionally confounded by connections of inner nuclear membrane proteins to chromatin. For these reasons, it is necessary to confirm proteomic identification of nuclear envelope proteins by testing targeting of individual proteins. The proteomic identification of nuclear envelope fractions is affected by the tendencies of transmembrane proteins to have extreme isoelectric points, strongly hydrophobic peptides, posttranslational modifications, and a propensity to aggregate, thus making proteolysis inefficient. To circumvent these problems, we have developed a MudPIT approach that uses multiple extractions and sequential proteolysis to increase identifications. Here we describe methods for isolating nuclear envelopes, determining their proteome by MudPIT, and confirming their targeting to the nuclear periphery by microscopy.
27375481	Comparative Transcriptome Analysis Identifies CCDC80 as a Novel Gene Associated with Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension.	Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a heterogeneous disorder associated with a progressive increase in pulmonary artery resistance and pressure. Although various therapies have been developed, the 5-year survival rate of PAH patients remains low. There is thus an important need to identify novel genes that are commonly dysregulated in PAH of various etiologies and could be used as biomarkers and/or therapeutic targets. In this study, we performed comparative transcriptome analysis of five mammalian PAH datasets downloaded from a public database. We identified 228 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from a rat PAH model caused by inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor under hypoxic conditions, 379 DEGs from a mouse PAH model associated with systemic sclerosis, 850 DEGs from a mouse PAH model associated with schistosomiasis, 1598 DEGs from one cohort of human PAH patients, and 4260 DEGs from a second cohort of human PAH patients. Gene-by-gene comparison identified four genes that were differentially upregulated or downregulated in parallel in all five sets of DEGs. Expression of coiled-coil domain containing 80 (CCDC80) and anterior gradient two genes was significantly increased in the five datasets, whereas expression of SMAD family member six and granzyme A was significantly decreased. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis revealed a connection between CCDC80 and collagen type I alpha 1 (COL1A1) expression. To validate the function of CCDC80 in vivo, we knocked out ccdc80 in zebrafish using the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 system. In vivo imaging of zebrafish expressing a fluorescent protein in endothelial cells showed that ccdc80 deletion significantly increased the diameter of the ventral artery, a vessel supplying blood to the gills. We also demonstrated that expression of col1a1 and endothelin-1 mRNA was significantly decreased in the ccdc80-knockout zebrafish. Finally, we examined Ccdc80 immunoreactivity in a rat PAHmodel and found increased expression in the hypertrophied media and adventitia of the pre-acinar pulmonary arteries (PAs) and in the thickened intima, media, and adventitia of the obstructed intra-acinar PAs. These results suggest that increased expression of CCDC80 may be involved in the pathogenesis of PAH, potentially by modulating the expression of endothelin-1 and COL1A1.
27127521	Leukemia Stem Cell-Released Microvesicles Promote the Survival and Migration of Myeloid Leukemia Cells and These Effects Can Be Inhibited by MicroRNA34a Overexpression.	Leukemia stem cells (LSCs) play the major role in relapse of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Recent evidence indicates that microvesicles (MVs) released from cancer stem cells can promote tumor growth and invasion. In this study, we investigated whether LSCs-released MVs (LMVs) can regulate the malignance of AML cells and whether overexpression of tumor suppressive microRNA (miR), miR34a, is able to interrupt this process. LSCs were transfected with miRNA control (miRCtrl) or miR34a mimic for producing LMVs, respectively, defined as LMVs(miRCtrl) and LMVs(miR34a). The effect of miR34a transfection on LSC proliferation and the effects of LMVs(miRCtrl) or LMVs(miR34a) on the proliferation, migration, and apoptosis of AML cells (after LSC depletion) were determined. The levels of miR34a targets, caspase-3 and T cell immunoglobulin mucin-3 (Tim-3), were analyzed. Results showed that (1) LMVs(miRCtrl) promoted proliferation and migration and inhibited apoptosis of AML cells, which were associated with miR34a deficit; (2) transfection of miR34a mimic inhibited LSC proliferation and increased miR34a level in LMVs(miR34a); (3) LMVs(miR34a) produced opposite effects as compared with LMVs(miRCtrl), which were associated with the changes of caspase-3 and Tim-3 levels. In summary, LMVs support AML cell malignance and modulating miR34a could offer a new approach for the management of AML.
26856313	Spectrofluorometric Determination of Putrescine Using Orthophthaldehyde as a Fluorophore: A Novel Method.	This paper concerns spectrofluorometric analysis of putrescine using orthophthaladehyde as a fluorophore in aqueous alkaline medium. Wavelengths of excitation and emission in acid, neutral, and alkaline media were different. There is a maximum intensity of fluorescence in alkaline medium 24 h after complexation compared with other media. Putrescine and orthophthaladehyde are used at an equimolar ratio, and the product is kinetically stable in alkaline medium. Calibration curves obtained gave limits of detection and quantification of 39 and 65 ng/mL, respectively. The correlation coefficient obtained in alkaline medium was 0.992 at pH 12. Results obtained largely showed a good reproducibility of our method.
26930066	Spillover Effects of Loss of Control on Risky Decision-Making.	Decision making in risky situations is frequently required in our everyday lives and has been shown to be influenced by various factors, some of which are independent of the risk context. Based on previous findings and theories about the central role of perceptions of control and their impact on subsequent settings, spillover effects of subjective loss of control on risky decision-making are assumed. After developing an innovative experimental paradigm for inducing loss of control, its hypothesized effects on risky decision-making are investigated. Partially supporting the hypotheses, results demonstrated no increased levels of risk perceptions but decreased risk-taking behavior following experiences of loss of control. Thus, this study makes a methodological contribution by proposing a newly developed experimental paradigm facilitating further research on the effects of subjective loss of control, and additionally provides partial evidence for the spillover effects of loss of control experiences on risky decision-making.
27498534	HIDRADENITIS SUPPURATIVA: A CASE SERIES OF EIGHT PATIENTS.	INTRODUCTION: Hidradenitis suppurativa is a persistent, inflammatory and recurrent disease of the hair follicles which, in time, results in ugly scars. Inflammation and obstruction of channel of sweat glands used to be thought to be the basis of this disease. CASE REPORTS: This paper presents the cases of 8 patients operated on in the past 3 years. A possibility of an oversight in making the diagnosis, as well as an underestimation in the treatment should be taken into consideration. In addition to surgical methods the authors discuss other therapeutic possibilities taken from the available literature. This is a retrospective analysis of the surgical findings. The treatment was multidisciplinary but the surgical excision was the only option which provided healing without recurrence so far. In our series the excision could be done to the fascia or to leave a thin layer of adipose tissue. The reconstruction could be achieved by healing per secundam, by autologous skin or artificial graft, or by narrowing the wound with a skin portion. Our results achieved by stage, secondary stitches and rotation portions were satisfying. CONCLUSION: In case of advanced disease only surgery can lead to healing. We performed late surgery because the disease was diagnozed in advanced stages according to Hurlay. Wide excision was done in all our patients. The reconstruction was achieved with rotational flap in 3 patients, the wound healing per secundam in 4 patients and with primary suture in one patient. Our patients did not have recurrences of the primary disease. The disease was combined in one case with perianal fistula.
27932926	A dataset of fishes in and around Inle Lake, an ancient lake of Myanmar, with DNA barcoding, photo images and CT/3D models.	BACKGROUND: Inle (Inlay) Lake, an ancient lake of Southeast Asia, is located at the eastern part of Myanmar, surrounded by the Shan Mountains. Detailed information on fish fauna in and around the lake has long been unknown, although its outstanding endemism was reported a century ago. NEW INFORMATION: Based on the fish specimens collected from markets, rivers, swamps, ponds and ditches around Inle Lake as well as from the lake itself from 2014 to 2016, we recorded a total of 948 occurrence data (2120 individuals), belonging to 10 orders, 19 families, 39 genera and 49 species. Amongst them, 13 species of 12 genera are endemic or nearly endemic to the lake system and 17 species of 16 genera are suggested as non-native. The data are all accessible from the document "A dataset of Inle Lake fish fauna and its distribution (http://ipt.pensoft.net/resource.do?r=inle_fish_2014-16)", as well as DNA barcoding data (mitochondrial COI) for all species being available from the DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank (Accession numbers: LC189568-LC190411). Live photographs of almost all the individuals and CT/3D model data of several specimens are also available at the graphical fish biodiversity database (http://ffish.asia/INLE2016; http://ffish.asia/INLE2016-3D). The information can benefit the clarification, public concern and conservation of the fish biodiversity in the region.
27250057	Pulmonary Metastatic Choriocarcinoma from a Burned-out Testicular Tumor.	A 54-year-old man was referred to our hospital because of progressive dyspnea. Chest computed tomography showed multiple nodular shadows with a peripheral ground-glass halo. His clinical condition continued to deteriorate with the development of progressive respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. A histological examination of a transbronchial lung biopsy revealed choriocarcinoma. The patient died within nine days of admission. A histological examination of the right testis during an autopsy revealed a burned-out testicular tumor consisting of a teratoma and a fibrous scar. We herein report a rare case of pulmonary multiple metastatic choriocarcinoma originating from a burned-out testicular tumor.
27191029	A RARE CASE OF HYDATID CYST DISEASE OF THE BREAST: A CASE REPORT AND REVIEW OF LITERATURE.	Hydatid cyst of the breast is extremely rare even in endemic areas and it only accounts for 0.27% of all hydatid cyst disease cases. It can either be a primary site or part of a disseminated hydatidosis. Surgery remains to be a treatment of choice. Only few reports are published in the literatures and most of the reported cases have been diagnosed postoperatively as it is not easy to reach at a definitive diagnosis with clinical examination and radiological investigations only. This is a case of an isolated hydatid cyst of breast in an 18-year old woman from the Amhara region, Ethiopia. She presented with left breast painless lump of 5 years duration and a correct pre-operative diagnosed was made by fine needle aspiration cytology, then confirmed after surgery. We believe this disease should be included in the differential diagnosis of benign breast lumps especially in endemic areas.
27603014	The Anti-Inflammatory Effects of Blueberries in an Animal Model of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).	Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a trauma and stressor-related disorder that results in a prolonged stress response. It is associated with increased oxidative stress and inflammation in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus (HC). The only approved therapy for PTSD is selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs), but their efficacy is marginal. Recently, we demonstrated that over-production of norepinephrine (NE) as the possible reason for the lack of efficacy of SSRIs. Hence, there is a need for novel therapeutic approaches for the treatment of PTSD. In this study, we investigated the anti-inflammatory role of blueberries in modulating inflammatory markers and neurotransmitter levels in PTSD. Rats were fed either a blueberry enriched (2%) or a control diet. Rats were exposed to cats for one hour on days 1 and 11 of a 31-day schedule to simulate traumatic conditions. The rats were also subjected to psychosocial stress via daily cage cohort changes. At the end of the study, the rats were euthanized and the PFC and HC were isolated. Monoamines were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. Reactive oxygen species (ROS), gene and protein expression levels of inflammatory cytokines were also measured. In our PTSD model, NE levels were increased and 5-HT levels were decreased when compared to control. In contrast, a blueberry enriched diet increased 5-HT without affecting NE levels. The rate limiting enzymes tyrosine hydroxylase and tryptophan hydroxylase were also studied and they confirmed our findings. The enhanced levels free radicals, gene and protein expression of inflammatory cytokines seen in the PTSD group were normalized with a blueberry enriched diet. Decreased anxiety in this group was shown by improved performance on the elevated plus-maze. These findings indicate blueberries can attenuate oxidative stress and inflammation and restore neurotransmitter imbalances in a rat model of PTSD.
27431268	Menaquinone as a potential target of antibacterial agents.	The current trend of increasing infections by multidrug-resistant pathogens requires the discovery of novel antimicrobial agents with new target and selective toxicity towards pathogens. Menaquinone is a component of electron transport chains in a majority of anaerobic bacteria and Gram-positive bacteria. Due to its exclusivity in bacteria, menaquinone is thought to be a potential target for development of therapeutically effective antibacterial agents without side effects. In this review, we summarize inhibitors of menaquinone biosynthesis and antibiotics directly targeting menaquinone in bacteria.
27672391	Antiviral Therapy in Lamivudine-Resistant Chronic Hepatitis B Patients: A Systematic Review and Network Meta-Analysis.	The relative efficacy of different strategies for chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients with lamivudine resistance (LAM-R) has not yet been systematically studied. Clinical trials were searched in PUBMED, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CNKI databases up to February 15, 2016. Nine trials including 764 patients met the entry criteria. In direct meta-analysis, TDF showed a stronger antiviral effect than any one of ETV, LAM/ADV, and ADV against LAM-R hepatitis B virus. LAM/ADV therapy was superior to ADV in suppressing viral replication. ETV achieved similar rate of HBV DNA undetectable compared to ADV or LAM/ADV. In network meta-analysis, TDF had higher rates of HBV DNA undetectable compared to ETV (OR, 24.69; 95% CrI: 5.36-113.66), ADV (OR, 37.28; 95% CrI: 9.73-142.92), or LAM/ADV (OR, 21.05; 95% CrI: 5.70-77.80). However, among ETV, ADV, and LAM/ADV, no drug was clearly superior to others in HBV DNA undetectable rate. Moreover, no significant difference in the rate of ALT normalization or HBeAg loss was observed compared the four rescue strategies with each other. TDF appears to be a more effective rescue therapy than LAM/ADV, ETV, or ADV. LAM plus ADV therapy was a better treatment option than ETV or ADV alone for patients with LAM-R.
27154717	Additive and enhanced fluorescence effects of hairpin DNA template-based copper nanoparticles and their application for the detection of NAD(.).	DNA is an excellent molecular scaffold for the preparation of copper nanoparticles (CuNPs). However, screening and designing an efficient template for the formation of fluorescent CuNPs remains a challenge. Herein, we synthesized CuNPs using a novel hairpin DNA template with a poly T loop and a random double strand stem which performs efficient in the formation of fluorescent CuNPs. Besides, the additive and enhanced effects between the loop and stem sequences on the fluorescence of induced CuNPs was first proposed and investigated. On comparing different sequences, we found that both the circular poly T sequence on the loop region and the stem sequence play important roles in this fluorescence enhancement effect. A label-free analytical system for the quantitative detection of NAD(+) was designed, demonstrating excellent sensitivity. Based on our design concept proposed herein, any random double-stranded DNA can be used for the design of efficient templates for the formation of fluorescent CuNPs in biochemical sensing.
27285997	The Importance of Patient Involvement in Stroke Rehabilitation.	OBJECTIVE: To investigate the perceived needs for health services by persons with stroke within the first year after rehabilitation, and associations between perceived impact of stroke, involvement in decisions regarding care/treatment, and having health services needs met. METHOD: Data was collected, through a mail survey, from patients with stroke who were admitted to a university hospital in 2012 and had received rehabilitation after discharge from the stroke unit. The rehabilitation lasted an average of 2 to 4.6 months. The Stroke Survivor Needs Survey Questionnaire was used to assess the participants' perceptions of involvement in decisions on care or treatment and needs for health services in 11 problem areas: mobility, falls, incontinence, pain, fatigue, emotion, concentration, memory, speaking, reading, and sight. The perceived impact of stroke in eight areas was assessed using the Stroke Impact Scale (SIS) 3.0. Eleven logistic regression models were created to explore associations between having health services needs met in each problem area respectively (dependent variable) and the independent variables. In all models the independent variables were: age, sex, SIS domain corresponding to the dependent variable, or stroke severity in cases when no corresponding SIS domain was identified, and involvement in decisions on care and treatment. RESULTS: The 63 participants who returned the questionnaires had a mean age of 72 years, 33 were male and 30 were female. Eighty percent had suffered a mild stroke. The number of participants who reported problems varied between 51 (80%, mobility) and 24 (38%, sight). Involvement in decisions on care and treatment was found to be associated with having health services needs met in six problem areas: falls, fatigue, emotion, memory, speaking, and reading. CONCLUSIONS: The results highlight the importance of involving patients in making decisions on stroke rehabilitation, as it appears to be associated with meeting their health services needs.
27011355	Effects of an Exercise Programme on Functional Capacity, Body Composition and Risk of Falls in Patients with Cirrhosis: A Randomized Clinical Trial.	UNLABELLED: Patients with cirrhosis often have functional limitations, decreased muscle mass, and a high risk of falls. These variables could improve with exercise. The aim was to study the effects of moderate exercise on functional capacity, body composition and risk of falls in patients with cirrhosis. Twenty-three cirrhotic patients were randomized to an exercise programme (n = 14) or to a relaxation programme (n = 9). Both programmes consisted of a one-hour session 3 days a week for 12 weeks. At the beginning and end of the study, we measured functional capacity using the cardiopulmonary exercise test, evaluated body composition using anthropometry and dual energy X-ray absorptiometry, and estimated risk of falls using the Timed Up&Go test. In the exercise group, cardiopulmonary exercise test showed an increase in total effort time (p<0.001) and ventilatory anaerobic threshold time (p = 0.009). Upper thigh circumference increased and mid-arm and mid-thigh skinfold thickness decreased. Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry showed a decrease in fat body mass (-0.94 kg, 95%CI -0.48 to -1.41, p = 0.003) and an increase in lean body mass (1.05 kg, 95%CI 0.27 to 1.82, p = 0.01), lean appendicular mass (0.38 kg, 95%CI 0.06 to 0.69, p = 0.03) and lean leg mass (0.34 kg, 95%CI 0.10 to 0.57, p = 0.02). The Timed Up&Go test decreased at the end of the study compared to baseline (p = 0.02). No changes were observed in the relaxation group. We conclude that a moderate exercise programme in patients with cirrhosis improves functional capacity, increases muscle mass, and decreases body fat and the Timed Up&Go time. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01447537.
27881901	Applicant Personality and Procedural Justice Perceptions of Group Selection Interviews.	PURPOSE: We investigated how job applicants' personalities influence perceptions of the structural and social procedural justice of group selection interviews (i.e., a group of several applicants being evaluated simultaneously). We especially addressed trait interactions between neuroticism and extraversion (the affective plane) and extraversion and agreeableness (the interpersonal plane). DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: Data on personality (pre-interview) and justice perceptions (post-interview) were collected in a field study among job applicants (N = 97) attending group selection interviews for positions as teachers in a Norwegian high school. FINDINGS: Interaction effects in hierarchical regression analyses showed that perceptions of social and structural justice increased with levels of extraversion among high scorers on neuroticism. Among emotionally stable applicants, however, being introverted or extraverted did not matter to justice perceptions. Extraversion did not impact on the perception of social justice for applicants low in agreeableness. Agreeable applicants, however, experienced the group interview as more socially fair when they were also extraverted. IMPLICATIONS: The impact of applicant personality on justice perceptions may be underestimated if traits interactions are not considered. Procedural fairness ratings for the group selection interview were high, contrary to the negative reactions predicted by other researchers. There was no indication that applicants with desirable traits (i.e., traits predictive of job performance) reacted negatively to this selection tool. ORIGINALITY/VALUE: Despite the widespread use of interviews in selection, previous studies of applicant personality and fairness reactions have not included interviews. The study demonstrates the importance of previously ignored trait interactions in understanding applicant reactions.

26937656	Immune Responses to the Cancer Testis Antigen XAGE-1b in Non Small Cell Lung Cancer Caucasian Patients.	Immunotherapy approaches using checkpoint blockade, alone, or in combination with tumor antigen vaccination, or adoptive cell transfer, are emerging as promising approaches for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In preparation for upcoming combined immunotherapy approaches in NSCLC, here, we have assessed spontaneous immune responses to XAGE-1b, a tumor specific antigen of the Cancer Testis Antigen group that has been previously reported to be spontaneously immunogenic in the Japanese population, in a cohort of Caucasian patients with NSCLC. We found spontaneous serological responses to XAGE-1b in 9% of the patients. Importantly, these responses were limited to, and represented 13% of, patients with adenocarcinoma tumors, the most frequent histological subtype, for which immunotherapy approaches are under development. Using a set of overlapping peptides spanning the entire XAGE-1b protein, and in support of the serological data, we detected significant XAGE-1b specific CD4+ T cell responses in all XAGE-1b seropositive patients and identified several CD4+ T cell epitopes. Altogether, our results support the relevance of the XAGE-1b antigen in Caucasians NSCLC patients with adenocarcinoma, and the implementation of future immunotherapies exploiting the high immunogenicity of the antigen in this patient population.
27910762	Genetic Diversity and Relationships of 24 Strains of Genus Auricularia (Agaricomycetes) Assessed Using SRAP Markers.	Auricularia species are well known for their traditional edible and medicinal importance. In this study, sequence-related amplified polymorphism (SRAP) markers were used to evaluate the genetic diversity and relationships of 24 Auricularia strains obtained from different ecological regions of China. A total of 402 polymorphic loci were detected using 11 SRAP primer combinations with 100% polymorphic loci. The similarity coefficient ranged from 0.662 to 0.903, with an average of 0.73. Cluster analysis using the pair-group method using arithmetic average, based on the data from SRAP loci amplified by 11 primer pairs, showed that 24 Auricularia strains were distinguished into 4 groups with 73% similarity. The results of principal coordinate analysis were in accordance with pair-group method using arithmetic average clustering, and the first, most informative coordinate accounted for 74.38% of all the variations, which indicated a high level of genetic diversity among Auricularia strains. In general, SRAP markers provide a powerful tool to discriminate Auricularia strains and to evaluate their genetic relationships.
26835628	Dual wavelength laser-induced damage threshold measurements of alumina/silica and hafnia/silica ultraviolet antireflective coatings.	An approach for the measurement of the laser-induced damage threshold with two wavelengths combined was made while testing antireflective coatings for the wavelengths 266 and 532 nm. Samples were made of Al2O3/SiO2 and HfO2/SiO2 ion beam sputtered films. The results show that adding radiation of a second wavelength might lead to a significant reduction of the threshold. The damage morphology of single and dual wavelength tests is very similar and does not suggest an altered damage mechanism. Further investigations indicated that the dual wavelength threshold is a function of the temporal delay of the two pulses.
27489716	Post-biliary sphincterotomy bleeding despite covered metallic stent deployment.	OBJECTIVES: Several endoscopic techniques have been proposed for the management of post-sphincterotomy bleeding. Lately, self-expandable metal stents deployment has gained popularity especially as a rescue therapy when other endoscopic techniques fail. METHODS-RESULTS: We report the case report of a massive post-sphincterotomy bleeding in a patient with a self-expandable metal stent in the biliary tree. Despite the presence of a correctly positioned self-expandable metal stent, a new endoscopic session was required to control the bleeding. CONCLUSIONS: Self-expandable metal stent may be useful to manage post-endoscopic sphincterotomy bleeding. However, up to now there is no specifically designed self-expandable metal stent for such complication. Large new designed self-expandable metal stent may be a useful tool for biliary endoscopist.
27795897	Linking educational leadership styles to the HR architecture for new teachers in primary education.	This study aims to gain insight in the relationship between principals' leadership styles and the configuration of different HR practices for new teachers in primary education. Besides the longstanding interest in educational leadership as a key element in teacher and student performance, there is a growing interest in strategic human resource management (SHRM) in the educational sector. However, few educational studies link educational leadership to SHRM. In particular, this study examines the relationship between principals' instructional and transformational leadership style and principals' strategic and HR orientation in configuring HR practices for new teachers. Data were gathered using a mixed methods approach, including interviews with 75 principals as well as an online survey of 1058 teachers in Flemish primary education. Qualitative interview data were transformed and analysed together with the quantitative survey data using logistic regression and ANOVA analyses. The results indicate that both instructional and transformational leadership is associated with the strategic orientation of principals. The HR orientation, on the other hand, is not reflected in the principals' leadership style. Recommendations for further research in this area are discussed.
26965778	Alcoholic beverage preferences and associated drinking patterns by socioeconomic status among high-school drinkers in three metropolises of China.	To examine the association between socioeconomic status (SES) and adolescent alcoholic beverage preferences and the associated drinking patterns in China. The study used cross-sectional data collected from 136 junior or senior high schools, using a self-administered questionnaire. A total number of 7,075 subjects of drinking students were selected from three metropolises (Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou) via a two-stage stratified sampling method. Among the adolescent drinkers, 87.8% (95% CI: 86.5-89.0) reported that they drunk alcohol during the past years preceding the study, while 42.4% (95% CI: 40.4-44.4) of the subjects stated that they had drunk alcohol during the past 30 days. There were gradual increases in the usual quantity (>1 Standard Drink, SD) of alcoholic beverages with increasing SES, with highest rates reported by the high-level SES. Beer and grape wine were the most widely consumed alcoholic beverage, regardless of SES. Our findings suggest that high-level SES students have an increasing prevalence of drinking behaviour. Their confirmation by future studies which extend the sampling regions is required to further the prevention of adolescent alcohol abuse in China.
28032115	Epidemiology of age-related macular degeneration (AMD): associations with cardiovascular disease phenotypes and lipid factors.	Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of irreversible blindness in adults over 50 years old. Genetic, epidemiological, and molecular studies are beginning to unravel the intricate mechanisms underlying this complex disease, which implicate the lipid-cholesterol pathway in the pathophysiology of disease development and progression. Many of the genetic and environmental risk factors associated with AMD are also associated with other complex degenerative diseases of advanced age, including cardiovascular disease (CVD). In this review, we present epidemiological findings associating AMD with a variety of lipid pathway genes, cardiovascular phenotypes, and relevant environmental exposures. Despite a number of studies showing significant associations between AMD and these lipid/cardiovascular factors, results have been mixed and as such the relationships among these factors and AMD remain controversial. It is imperative that researchers not only tease out the various contributions of such factors to AMD development but also the connections between AMD and CVD to develop optimal precision medical care for aging adults.
27688741	Increased sialylation of site specific O-glycoforms of hemopexin in liver disease.	BACKGROUND: Non-invasive monitoring of liver disease remains an important health issue. Liver secreted glycoproteins reflect pathophysiological states of the organ and represent a rational target for serologic monitoring. In this study, we describe sialylated O-glycoforms of liver-secreted hemopexin (HPX) and quantify them as a ratio of disialylated to monosialylated form (S-HPX). METHODS: We measured S-HPX in serum of participants of the HALT-C trial using a LC-MS/MS-MRM assay. RESULTS: Repeated measurements of S-HPX in the samples of 23 disease-free controls, collected at four different time points, show that the ratio remains stable in the healthy controls but increases with the progression of liver disease. The results of measurement of S-HPX in serum of participants of the HALT-C trial show that it increased significantly (Kruskal-Wallis test, p < 0.01) in liver disease as the stage of fibrosis progressed in liver biopsies. We observed a 1.7-fold increase in fibrosis defined as Ishak score 3-4 (24.9 + 14.2, n = 22) and 4.7-fold increase in cirrhosis defined as Ishak score 5-6 (68.6 + 38.5; n = 24) compared to disease-free controls (14.7 + 6.7, n = 23). S-HPX is correlated with AFP, bilirubin, INR, ALT, and AST while inversely correlated with platelet count and albumin. In an independent verification set of samples, S-HPX separated the Ishak 5-6 (n = 15) from the Ishak 3-4 (n = 15) participants with AuROC 0.84; at the same time, the Ishak 3-4 group was separated from disease-free controls (n = 15) with AuROC 0.82. CONCLUSION: S-HPX, a measure of sialylated O-glycoforms of hemopexin, progressively increases in fibrotic and cirrhotic patient of HCV etiology and can be quantified by an LC-MS/MS-MRM assay in unfractionated serum of patients. Quantification of sialylated O-glycoforms of this liver secreted glycoprotein represents a novel measure of the stage of liver disease that could have a role in monitoring the progression of liver pathology.
27536091	Low cost biological lung volume reduction therapy for advanced emphysema.	BACKGROUND: Bronchoscopic lung volume reduction (BLVR), using biological agents, is one of the new alternatives to lung volume reduction surgery. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate efficacy and safety of biological BLVR using low cost agents including autologous blood and fibrin glue. METHODS: Enrolled patients were divided into two groups: group A (seven patients) in which autologous blood was used and group B (eight patients) in which fibrin glue was used. The agents were injected through a triple lumen balloon catheter via fiberoptic bronchoscope. Changes in high resolution computerized tomography (HRCT) volumetry, pulmonary function tests, symptoms, and exercise capacity were evaluated at 12 weeks postprocedure as well as for complications. RESULTS: In group A, at 12 weeks postprocedure, there was significant improvement in the mean value of HRCT volumetry and residual volume/total lung capacity (% predicted) (P-value: <0.001 and 0.038, respectively). In group B, there was significant improvement in the mean value of HRCT volumetry and (residual volume/total lung capacity % predicted) (P-value: 0.005 and 0.004, respectively). All patients tolerated the procedure with no mortality. CONCLUSION: BLVR using autologous blood and locally prepared fibrin glue is a promising method for therapy of advanced emphysema in term of efficacy, safety as well as cost effectiveness.
27895911	Under-five mortality among displaced populations in Meheba refugee camp, Zambia, 2008-2014.	BACKGROUND: Under-five mortality, which is the probability of a child dying before their fifth birthday, is of concern in Zambia as infant and child mortality rates are important social indicators. Displaced population in camps provide a basis for under-five mortality surveillance because detailed registration databases have been developed. Additionally, health data routinely collected on mortality allowed for a review of mortality trends and identification of correlating factors to under-five mortality. Literature suggests a number of factors that influence child mortality including biological, socio-econimic and environmental factors. However, while progress in reducing mortality is evident disparities in under-five mortality trends have been observed. METHODS: The study examined differential levels and trends of under-five mortality with correlating factors in Meheba refugee camp in Zambia which is presently in its post emergency phase. The retrospective cross-sectional study reviewed the ProGres and Health Information System (HIS) databases under-five mortality data for a seven (7) year period (2008-2014) and included all children aged less than five years in each year of review. STATA 12 (including Ordinary Least Squares Regression) and Microsoft Excel 2010 where used for data analysis and computation of findings. RESULTS: Malaria and respiratory infections accounted for 81 % of under-five deaths while cases of Diarrhoea were responsible for 10 % of reported mortalities. Seventy five percent (75 %) of all mortalities were reported in children aged less than 1 year (<1 year). While no significant variations in mortality were noted as a result of time, increased frequency of visits to health centre significantly (P < 0.05) reduced mortalities in children by 3/1000 in each year. CONCLUSION: In addition to improving health infrastructure and reducing distances to health facilities, the study also recommends sensitization programmes targeted at ensuring accessibility to health care services for children under-5 years. The study found that increased health centre visitations were associated with reduction in under-five mortality and encourages initiatives targeted at sensitizing communities to seek health care. Furthermore, collaboration between the health systems, community and Non Governmental Organisations (NGOs) is key in addressing higher infant mortality observed. It is envisaged that this will contribute to the reduction in mortality cases and will compliment already existing strategies.
28299173	Systematic assessment of multi-gene predictors of pan-cancer cell line sensitivity to drugs exploiting gene expression data.	Background: Selected gene mutations are routinely used to guide the selection of cancer drugs for a given patient tumour. Large pharmacogenomic data sets, such as those by Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC) consortium, were introduced to discover more of these single-gene markers of drug sensitivity. Very recently, machine learning regression has been used to investigate how well cancer cell line sensitivity to drugs is predicted depending on the type of molecular profile. The latter has revealed that gene expression data is the most predictive profile in the pan-cancer setting. However, no study to date has exploited GDSC data to systematically compare the performance of machine learning models based on multi-gene expression data against that of widely-used single-gene markers based on genomics data. Methods: Here we present this systematic comparison using Random Forest (RF) classifiers exploiting the expression levels of 13,321 genes and an average of 501 tested cell lines per drug. To account for time-dependent batch effects in IC 50 measurements, we employ independent test sets generated with more recent GDSC data than that used to train the predictors and show that this is a more realistic validation than standard k-fold cross-validation. Results and Discussion: Across 127 GDSC drugs, our results show that the single-gene markers unveiled by the MANOVA analysis tend to achieve higher precision than these RF-based multi-gene models, at the cost of generally having a poor recall (i.e. correctly detecting only a small part of the cell lines sensitive to the drug). Regarding overall classification performance, about two thirds of the drugs are better predicted by the multi-gene RF classifiers. Among the drugs with the most predictive of these models, we found pyrimethamine, sunitinib and 17-AAG. Conclusions: Thanks to this unbiased validation, we now know that this type of models can predict in vitro tumour response to some of these drugs. These models can thus be further investigated on in vivo tumour models. R code to facilitate the construction of alternative machine learning models and their validation in the presented benchmark is available at http://ballester.marseille.inserm.fr/gdsc.transcriptomicDatav2.tar.gz.
27555116	A comparative study on the antioxidant effects of hesperidin and ellagic acid against skeletal muscle ischemia/reperfusion injury.	The antioxidant effects of ellagic acid (EA) and hesperidin (HES) against skeletal muscle ischemia/reperfusion injury (I/R) were performed. Hindlimb ischemia has been induced by tourniquet occlusion for 2 h on left hindlimb. At the end of ischemia, the tourniquate has been removed and initiated reperfusion for 2 h. EA (100 mg/kg) has been applied orally before ischemia/reperfusion in the EA + I/R group. HES (100 mg/kg) has been given orally in the HES + I/R group. The left gastrocnemius muscle has been harvested and stored immediately at -80 degrees C until assessed for the levels of MDA and antioxidant enzymes activities. MDA level has statistically increased in I/R group (p < 0.05) compared to other groups. The muscle tissue antioxidant enzymes activities were lower than the other groups in the I/R group (p < 0.05). EA and HES treatments significantly reversed the damage level in I/R, also activity of tissue SOD increased in the EA + I/R and HES + I/R groups.
26915272	Yeast and Fungal Prions: Amyloid-Handling Systems, Amyloid Structure, and Prion Biology.	Yeast prions (infectious proteins) were discovered by their outre genetic properties and have become important models for an array of human prion and amyloid diseases. A single prion protein can become any of many distinct amyloid forms (called prion variants or strains), each of which is self-propagating, but with different biological properties (eg, lethal vs mild). The folded in-register parallel beta sheet architecture of the yeast prion amyloids naturally suggests a mechanism by which prion variant information can be faithfully transmitted for many generations. The yeast prions rely on cellular chaperones for their propagation, but can be cured by various chaperone imbalances. The Btn2/Cur1 system normally cures most variants of the [URE3] prion that arise. Although most variants of the [PSI+] and [URE3] prions are toxic or lethal, some are mild in their effects. Even the most mild forms of these prions are rare in the wild, indicating that they too are detrimental to yeast. The beneficial [Het-s] prion of Podospora anserina poses an important contrast in its structure, biology, and evolution to the yeast prions characterized thus far.
27697024	Systems Toxicology: Systematic Approach to Predict Toxicity.	Drug discovery is complex and expensive. Numerous drug candidates fail late in clinical trials or even after being released to the market. These failures are not only due to commercial considerations and less optimal drug efficacies but, adverse reactions originating from toxic effects also constitute a major challenge. During the last two decades, significant advances have been made enabling the early prediction of toxic effects using in silico techniques. However, by design, these essentially statistical techniques have not taken the disease driving pathophysiological mechanisms into account. The complexity of such mechanisms in combination with their interactions with drugspecific properties and environmental and life-style related factors renders the task of predicting toxicity on a purely statistical basis which is an insurmountable challenge. In response to this situation, an interdisciplinary field has developed, referred to as systems toxicology, where the notion of a network is used to integrate and model different types of information to better predict drug toxicity. In this study, we briefly review the merits and limitations of such recent promising predictive approaches integrating molecular networks, chemical compound networks, and protein drug association networks.
28119710	Artificial MicroRNA-Based Specific Gene Silencing of Grain Hardness Genes in Polyploid Cereals Appeared to Be Not Stable Over Transgenic Plant Generations.	Gene silencing by RNA interference is a particularly important tool in the study of gene function in polyploid cereal species for which the collections of natural or induced mutants are very limited. Previously we have been testing small interfering RNA-based approach of gene silencing in wheat and triticale. In this research, artificial microRNAs (amiRs) were studied in the same species and the same target genes to compare effectiveness of both gene silencing pathways. amiR cassettes were designed to silence Puroindoline a (Pina) and Puroindoline b (Pinb) hardness genes in wheat and their orthologues Secaloindoline a (Sina) and Secaloindoline b (Sinb) genes in triticale. Each of the two cassettes contained 21 nt microRNA (miR) precursor derived from conserved regions of Pina/Sina or Pinb/Sinb genes, respectively. Transgenic plants were obtained with high efficiency in two cultivars of wheat and one cultivar of triticale after using the Pinb-derived amiR vector for silencing of Pinb or Sinb, respectively. Lack of transgenic plants in wheat or very low transformation efficiency in triticale was observed using the Pina-derived amiR cassette, despite large numbers of embryos attempted. Silencing of Pinb in wheat and Sinb in triticale was highly efficient in the T1 generation. The transcript level of Pinb in wheat was reduced up to 92% and Sinb in triticale was reduced up to 98%. Moreover, intended silencing of Pinb/Sinb with Pinb-derived amiR cassette was highly correlated with simultaneous silencing of Pina/Sina in the same transgenic plants. High downregulation of Pinb/Pina genes in T1 plants of wheat and Sinb/Sina genes in T1 plants of triticale was associated with strong expression of Pinb-derived amiR. Silencing of the target genes correlated with increased grain hardness in both species. Total protein content in the grains of transgenic wheat was significantly lower. Although, the Pinb-derived amiR cassette was stably inherited in the T2 generation of wheat and triticale the silencing effect including strongly decreased expression of silenced genes as well as strong expression of Pinb-derived amiR was not transmitted. Advantages and disadvantages of posttranscriptional silencing of target genes by means of amiR and siRNA-based approaches in polyploid cereals are discussed.
27941188	Arthrogryposis multiplex congenital - multidisciplinary care - including own experience.	Arthrogryposis multiplex congenital (AMC) is a heterogeneous disorder, characterized by nonprogressive multiple intra-articular contractures, which can be recognized at birth. The prevalence in Europe is estimated at about 1 per 12,000. Etiopathogenesis of arthrogryposis is multifactorial. Symptoms of some forms of arthrogryposis can be found in the clinical presentation of selected genetic disorders, e.g. Pena Shokeir syndrome. Arthrogryposis can also result from environmental factors such as medication, trauma or chronic illness during pregnancy, as well as from oligohydramnios or abnormal structure of the uterus. In this particular disorder prenatal diagnosis is crucial, because it determines the level of hospital reference during the delivery of the affected child. The highest reference degree hospital is preferential, with staff prepared for the multidisciplinary approach to the treatment of the newborn. The key to success is rehabilitation treatment and it should be initiated as soon as possible. In a substantial number of cases, physical therapy can replace invasive corrective surgery, but even when orthopedic treatment is required, it should always be preceded and followed by rehabilitation.
28344772	Using complex networks for refining survival prognosis in prostate cancer patient.	Complex network theory has been used, during the last decade, to understand the structures behind complex biological problems, yielding new knowledge in a large number of situations. Nevertheless, such knowledge has remained mostly qualitative. In this contribution, I show how information extracted from a network representation can be used in a quantitative way, to improve the score of a classification task. As a test bed, I consider a dataset corresponding to patients suffering from prostate cancer, and the task of successfully prognosing their survival. When information from a complex network representation is added on top of a simple classification model, the error is reduced from 27.9% to 23.8%. This confirms that network theory can be used to synthesize information that may not readily be accessible by standard data mining algorithms.
26916293	Risk factors for incident venous thromboembolism in active cancer patients: A population based case-control study.	BACKGROUND: Independent risk factors for cancer-associated incident venous thromboembolism (VTE) and their magnitude of risk are not fully characterized. AIM: To identify non-cancer and cancer-specific risk factors for cancer-associated incident VTE. METHODS: In a population-based retrospective case-control study, we used Rochester Epidemiology Project and Mayo Clinic Cancer Registry resources to identify all Olmsted County, MN residents with active cancer-associated incident VTE, 1973-2000 (cases; n=570) and 1-3 residents with active cancer matched to each case on age, sex, date and duration of active cancer (controls; n=604). Using conditional logistic regression, we tested cancer and non-cancer characteristics for an association with VTE, including a cancer site VTE risk score. RESULTS: In the multivariable model, higher cancer site VTE risk score (OR=1.4 per 2-fold increase), cancer stage>/=2 (OR=2.2), liver metastasis (OR=2.7), chemotherapy (OR=1.8) and progesterone use (OR=2.1) were independently associated with VTE, as were BMI<18.5kg/m(2) (OR=1.9) or >/=35kg/m(2) (OR=4.0), hospitalization (OR=7.9), nursing home confinement (OR=4.7), central venous (CV) catheter (OR=8.5) and any recent infection (OR=1.7). In a subgroup analysis, platelet count>/=350x10(9)/L at time of cancer diagnosis was marginally associated with VTE (OR=2.3, p=0.07). CONCLUSION: Cancer site, cancer stage>/=2, liver metastasis, chemotherapy, progesterone, being underweight or obese, hospitalization/nursing home confinement, CV catheter, and infection are independent risk factors for incident VTE in active cancer patients.
27225749	Immunohistochemical Expression and Serum Levels of CD44 as Prognostic Indicators in Patients with Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.	BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: CD44 is often expressed in various types of tumor cells and involved in a number of biological behaviors of malignancy. The present study focused on the clinical significance of the expression of CD44st and CD44v6 in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). METHODS: The cohort consisted of 261 consecutive patients who had undergone complete resection of NSCLC. CD44 expression was evaluated in surgical specimens by immunohistochemical staining. Serum CD44 levels were determined using a sandwich ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay). RESULTS: In the immunohistochemical analysis, significant correlations were observed between CD44 expression and clinicopathological factors such as the T factor, N factor, pathological stage, and histological type. The 5-year survival rates according to CD44v6 expression were 65.8 and 80.6% in the higher and lower expression groups, respectively (p = 0.0053). According to ELISA, the group with higher expression of serum CD44v6 also showed a significantly more unfavorable prognosis than the lower expression group (p = 0.014). According to multivariate analysis using these significant variables, serum CD44v6 level was found to be an independent prognostic factor (p = 0.048). CONCLUSIONS: CD44v6 overexpression and higher serum CD44v6 levels were found to be significantly unfavorable prognostic factors.
26909060	New Perspectives in the Exploration of Korsakoff's Syndrome: The Usefulness of Neurophysiological Markers.	This perspective aims at underlining the usefulness of event-related potentials (ERP) to better understand the brain correlates of Korsakoff's syndrome (KS), a neuropsychiatric disease characterized by severe memory impairment and most frequently resulting as a neurological complication of alcohol-dependence (AD). While ERP have been broadly used in AD, it has up to now been very little applied in KS or in the comparison of KS and AD. Within the framework of dual-process models, an influential theory postulating that addictive states result from an imbalance between under-activated reflective system and over-activated automatic-affective one, this paper proposes: (1) a brief synthesis of the main results of ERP studies in AD and KS, and (2) new research avenues using ERP to identify the electrophysiological correlates of cognitive and emotional dysfunction in KS. These experimental perspectives aim at exploring the continuity hypothesis, which postulates a gradient of impairments from AD to KS. We conclude on the possibility of developing neuropsychological strategies with electrophysiological follow-up to ensure KS diagnosis and test the efficacy of patient's neurocognitive rehabilitation.
27588941	Attack Vulnerability of Network Controllability.	Controllability of complex networks has attracted much attention, and understanding the robustness of network controllability against potential attacks and failures is of practical significance. In this paper, we systematically investigate the attack vulnerability of network controllability for the canonical model networks as well as the real-world networks subject to attacks on nodes and edges. The attack strategies are selected based on degree and betweenness centralities calculated for either the initial network or the current network during the removal, among which random failure is as a comparison. It is found that the node-based strategies are often more harmful to the network controllability than the edge-based ones, and so are the recalculated strategies than their counterparts. The Barabasi-Albert scale-free model, which has a highly biased structure, proves to be the most vulnerable of the tested model networks. In contrast, the Erdos-Renyi random model, which lacks structural bias, exhibits much better robustness to both node-based and edge-based attacks. We also survey the control robustness of 25 real-world networks, and the numerical results show that most real networks are control robust to random node failures, which has not been observed in the model networks. And the recalculated betweenness-based strategy is the most efficient way to harm the controllability of real-world networks. Besides, we find that the edge degree is not a good quantity to measure the importance of an edge in terms of network controllability.
26836969	The effects of baseball bat mass properties on swing mechanics, ground reaction forces, and swing timing.	Swing trajectory and ground reaction forces (GRF) of 30 collegiate baseball batters hitting a pitched ball were compared between a standard bat, a bat with extra weight about its barrel, and a bat with extra weight in its handle. It was hypothesised that when compared to a standard bat, only a handle-weighted bat would produce equivalent bat kinematics. It was also hypothesised that hitters would not produce equivalent GRFs for each weighted bat, but would maintain equivalent timing when compared to a standard bat. Data were collected utilising a 500 Hz motion capture system and 1,000 Hz force plate system. Data between bats were considered equivalent when the 95% confidence interval of the difference was contained entirely within +/-5% of the standard bat mean value. The handle-weighted bat had equivalent kinematics, whereas the barrel-weighted bat did not. Both weighted bats had equivalent peak GRF variables. Neither weighted bat maintained equivalence in the timing of bat kinematics and some peak GRFs. The ability to maintain swing kinematics with a handle-weighted bat may have implications for swing training and warm-up. However, altered timings of kinematics and kinetics require further research to understand the implications on returning to a conventionally weighted bat.
27018074	Use of an Esophageal Heat Exchanger to Maintain Core Temperature during Burn Excisions and to Attenuate Pyrexia on the Burns Intensive Care Unit.	Introduction. Burns patients are vulnerable to hyperthermia due to sepsis and SIRS and to hypothermia due to heat loss during excision surgery. Both states are associated with increased morbidity and mortality. We describe the first use of a novel esophageal heat exchange device in combination with a heater/cooler unit to manage perioperative hypothermia and postoperative pyrexia. Material and Methods. The device was used in three patients with full thickness burns of 51%, 49%, and 45% body surface area to reduce perioperative hypothermia during surgeries of >6 h duration and subsequently to control hyperthermia in one of the patients who developed pyrexia of 40 degrees C on the 22nd postoperative day due to E. coli/Candida septicaemia which was unresponsive to conventional cooling strategies. Results. Perioperative core temperature was maintained at 37 degrees C for all three patients, and it was possible to reduce ambient temperature to 26 degrees C to increase comfort levels for the operating team. The core temperature of the pyrexial patient was reduced to 38.5 degrees C within 2.5 h of instituting the device and maintained around this value thereafter. Conclusion. The device was easy to use with no adverse incidents and helped maintain normothermia in all cases.
27826841	N6-Methyladenine: A Conserved and Dynamic DNA Mark.	Chromatin, consisting of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) wrapped around histone proteins, facilitates DNA compaction and allows identical DNA codes to confer many different cellular phenotypes. This biological versatility is accomplished in large part by posttranslational modifications to histones and chemical modifications to DNA. These modifications direct the cellular machinery to expand or compact specific chromatin regions and mark regions of the DNA as important for cellular functions. While each of the four bases that make up DNA can be modified (Iyer et al. 2011), this chapter will focus on methylation of the sixth position on adenines (6mA), as this modification has been poorly characterized in recently evolved eukaryotes, but shows promise as a new conserved layer of epigenetic regulation. 6mA was previously thought to be restricted to unicellular organisms, but recent work has revealed its presence in metazoa. Here, we will briefly describe the history of 6mA, examine its evolutionary conservation, and evaluate the current methods for detecting 6mA. We will discuss the enzymes that bind and regulate this mark and finally examine known and potential functions of 6mA in eukaryotes.
26885525	Biomechanical Comparison of Pedicle Screw Augmented with Different Volumes of Polymethylmethacrylate in Osteoporotic and Severely Osteoporotic Synthetic Bone Blocks in Primary Implantation: An Experimental Study.	This study was designed to compare screw stabilities augmented with different volumes of PMMA and analyze relationship between screw stability and volume of PMMA and optimum volume of PMMA in different bone condition. Osteoporotic and severely osteoporotic synthetic bone blocks were divided into groups A0-A5 and B0-B5, respectively. Different volumes of PMMA were injected in groups A0 to A5 and B0 to B5. Axial pullout tests were performed and F max was measured. F max in groups A1-A5 were all significantly higher than group A0. Except between groups A1 and A2, A3 and A4, and A4 and A5, there were significant differences on F max between any other two groups. F max in groups B1-B5 were all significantly higher than group B0. Except between groups B1 and B2, B2 and B3, and B4 and B5, there were significant differences on F max between any other two groups. There was significantly positive correlation between F max and volume of PMMA in osteoporotic and severely osteoporotic blocks. PMMA can significantly enhance pedicle screw stability in osteoporosis and severe osteoporosis. There were positive correlations between screw stability and volume of PMMA. In this study, injection of 3 mL and 4 mL PMMA was preferred in osteoporotic and severely osteoporotic blocks, respectively.
26928484	Higher Prevalence of Human Papillomavirus-Related Cervical Precancerous Abnormalities in HIV-Infected Compared to HIV-Uninfected Women.	INTRODUCTION: Persistent high risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV) has been associated with cervical abnormalities and cancer. There are few studies comparing HIV-infected with uninfected African American women from the Southern U.S. We evaluated medical records of a women's cohort in an urban clinic in Tennessee to assess the prevalence of hrHPV and cytology correlates, as well as HPV vaccination rates. METHODS: We reviewed medical records of 50 HIV infected and 304 HIV uninfected women, including Pap smears and hrHPV. RESULTS: HIV-infected women were older than HIV-uninfected women (p<0.0001) and were more likely to have hrHPV (p=<0.0001) and LGSIL/HGSIL (p=0.006). Within the HIV uninfected group, Hispanic women were younger than non-Hispanic African American women (p=0.04) and non-Hispanic white women (p=0.0002). Non-Hispanic African-American women were younger (p=0.004) than non-Hispanic white women. Both HIV-uninfected and HIV-infected women had an 11-fold and 5-fold odds, respectively, of having precancerous lesions when harboring hrHPV, compared to hrHPV-uninfected women. Of the 125 HIV-uninfected women, only 17% had received at least one dose of the HPV vaccine. None of the 21 vaccine recipients had evidence of SILs compared to 9% of vaccine non-recipients (p=0.35, Fisher's exact test). CONCLUSION: HIV-infected women remained at significantly higher risk for developing cervical precancerous lesions when exposed to hrHPV than their uninfected counterparts. Hispanic women were least likely to have been vaccinated. Missed HPV vaccination trended towards being associated with a higher odds of precancerous lesions. Routine HPV vaccination should be reinforced for adolescents and young women using public hospital facilities of all races and ethnic backgrounds.
27021248	Chromosome evolution in malaria mosquitoes inferred from physically mapped genome assemblies.	Polymorphic inversions in mosquitoes are distributed nonrandomly among chromosomes and are associated with ecological, behavioral, and physiological adaptations related to pathogen transmission. Despite their significance, the patterns and mechanism of genome rearrangements are not well understood. Recent sequencing and physical mapping of the genomes for 16 Anopheles mosquito species provided an opportunity to study chromosome evolution at the highest resolution. New studies revealed that fixed rearrangement accumulated [Formula: see text]3 times faster on the X chromosome than on autosomes. The highest densities of transposable elements (TEs) and satellites of different sizes have also been found on the X chromosome, suggesting a mechanism for the inversion generation. The high rate of X chromosome rearrangements is in sharp contrast with the paucity of polymorphic inversions on the X in the majority of anopheline species. This paper highlights the advances in understanding chromosome evolution in malaria vectors and discusses possible future directions in studying mechanisms and biological roles of genome rearrangements.
27767980	Hemorheological factors can be informative in comparing treatment possibilities of abdominal compartment syndrome.	BACKGROUND: Abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) is a life-threatening condition, of which pathomechanism hasn't been completely clarified, yet. Furthermore, surgical therapy still needs optimization. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to investigate microcirculatory and micro-rheological alterations in ACS, using various temporary abdominal closure methods, including three settings of vacuum-assisted closure technique (negative pressure wound therapy, NPWT). METHODS: On anesthetized pigs, by intraabdominally placed and filled-up silicone bags, intraabdominal pressure at 30 mmHg was maintained for 3 hours, and afterwards, decompressive laparotomy happened. In different experimental groups Bogota-bag or Vivano abdominal sets were applied (-50, -100, -150 mmHg) for 2 hours. Pressure monitoring was done by implanted sensors, hemorheological parameters were determined, and laser Doppler flowmetry tests were performed on the surface of intraabdominal organs. RESULTS: Treatment with Bogota-bag and -150 mmHg vacuum increased erythrocyte aggregation, while deformability declined. Blood viscosity increased after treatment with -150 mmHg vacuum. The microcirculatory parameters of the NPWT groups were better in small intestine. CONCLUSIONS: ACS resulted in impairment of macro- and micro-rheological parameters and abdominal organs' microcirculation. All of the used techniques improved the results, however, applying Bogota-bag or -150 mmHg vacuum set showed worse microcirculatory and micro-rheological data than the settings at -100 or -50 mmHg.
27917045	A biodiversity hotspot for Microgastrinae (Hymenoptera, Braconidae) in North America: annotated species checklist for Ottawa, Canada.	Microgastrinae wasps (Hymenoptera, Braconidae) from the city of Ottawa and its surroundings (a 50-km radius circle, ~7,800 km2) were studied based on 1,928 specimens collected between 1894 and 2010, and housed in the Canadian National Collection of Insects. A total of 158 species from 21 genera were identified, which is by far the highest number of species ever recorded for a locality in North America. An annotated checklist of species is provided. Choeras parasitellae (Bouche, 1834) and Pholetesor nanus (Reinhard, 1880) are recorded for the first time in the Nearctic (previously only known from the Palearctic region), Cotesia depressa (Viereck, 1912) is recorded for the first time in Canada (previously only known from the United States), and Cotesia hemileucae (Riley, 1881) and Protapanteles phlyctaeniae (Muesebeck, 1929) are recorded for the first time in the province of Ontario. In Ottawa the most diverse genera are Cotesia, Apanteles, Microplitis, Pholetesor, Microgaster, and Dolichogenidea, altogether comprising 77% of the species found in the area. A total of 73 species (46%) were represented by only one or two specimens, suggesting that the inventory for Ottawa is still relatively incomplete. Seasonal distribution showed several peaks of activity, in spring, summer, and early fall. That general pattern varied for individual species, with some showing a single peak of abundance either in the summer or towards the end of the season, others species attaining two peaks, in late spring and late summer, or in early summer and early fall, and yet others attaining up to three different peaks, in spring, summer and fall. At least 72 of the Microgastrinae species from Ottawa have been previously associated with 554 species of Lepidoptera as hosts - but those historical literature records are not always reliable and in many cases are based on data from areas beyond Ottawa. Thus, our knowledge of the associations between the 158 species of microgastrine parasitoids and the caterpillars of the 2,064 species of Lepidoptera recorded from Ottawa is still very incomplete.
27150870	Ischemic Acute Tubular Necrosis due to Diltiazem Overdose.	Diltiazem overdose has a high mortality rate due to cardiotoxicity associated with bradycardia and hypotension. A previous article reported that this type of overdose can cause acute tubular necrosis, which was not pathologically, but rather clinically, diagnosed. We herein report the case of a 55-year-old man who sustained nonoliguric acute kidney injury after taking 60 diltiazem tablets. A kidney biopsy performed six days after admission showed ischemic, not toxic, acute tubular necrosis. The patient's kidney function improved spontaneously. In this case report, we clarify the cause of renal impairment caused by diltiazem overdose pathologically. Physicians should therefore consider ischemic acute tubular necrosis as a cause of kidney injury in patients with diltiazem overdose.
27465404	Physician Burnout and the Calling to Care for the Dying.	BACKGROUND: Physician burnout raises concerns over what sustains physicians' career motivations. We assess whether physicians in end-of-life specialties had higher rates of burnout and/or calling to care for the dying. We also examined whether the patient centeredness of the clinical environment was associated with burnout. METHODS: In 2010 to 2011, we conducted a national survey of US physicians from multiple specialties. Primary outcomes were a validated single-item measure of burnout or sense of calling to end-of-life care. Primary predictors of burnout (or calling) included clinical specialty, frequency of encounters with dying patients, and patient centeredness of the clinical environments ("My clinical environment prioritizes the need of the patient over maximizing revenue"). RESULTS: Adjusted response rate among eligible respondents was 62% (1156 of 1878). Nearly a quarter of physicians (23%) experienced burnout, and rates were similar across all specialties. Half of the responding physicians (52%) agreed that they felt called to take care of patients who are dying. Burned-out physicians were more likely to report working in profit-centered clinical environments (multivariate odds ratio [OR] of 1.9; confidence interval [CI]: 1.3-2.8) or experiencing emotional exhaustion when caring for the dying (multivariate OR of 2.1; CI: 1.4-3.0). Physicians who identified their work as a calling were more likely to work in end-of-life specialties, to feel emotionally energized when caring for the dying, and to be religious. CONCLUSION: Physicians from end-of-life specialties not only did not have increased rates of burnout but they were also more likely to report a sense of calling in caring for the dying.
27782924	Recovery-Oriented Mental Health Practice in a Community Care Unit: An Exploratory Study.	A recovery-oriented model of care has become the major focus of mental health service delivery in the state of Victoria, Australia. However, there is a total absence of knowledge of recovery-oriented mental health practice in community care units (CCUs). Therefore, the aims of this exploratory study were to: (a) describe what aspects of the current model of care fit within the domains of recovery; and (b) describe the pragmatic processes that staff use to mold their care within the domains of recovery. Twenty-one key stakeholders provided informed voluntary consent to participate in one-to-one interviews. Six content domains evolved to include: (a) a common vision: "a continuous journey"; (b) promoting hope; (c) promoting autonomy and self-determination; (d) meaningful engagement; (e) holistic and personalized care; and (f) community participation and citizenship. The CCU appeared to be on a journey of transformation toward personal recovery. However, clinicians were grappling with an identified tension among personal recovery and clinical recovery. The tension among personal recovery and clinical recovery may be attributed to the psychosocial rehabilitation model of care, which was previously systemic in Victorian CCUs.
27007671	Phosphatidylserine Exposure in Human Red Blood Cells Depending on Cell Age.	BACKGROUND/AIMS: The exposure of phosphatidylserine (PS) on the outer membrane leaflet of red blood cells (RBCs) serves as a signal for suicidal erythrocyte death or eryptosis, which may be of importance for cell clearance from blood circulation. PS externalisation is realised by the scramblase activated by an increase of intracellular Ca2+ content. It has been described in literature that RBCs show an increased intracellular Ca2+ content as well as PS exposure when becoming aged up to 120 days (which is their life span). However, these investigations were carried out after incubation of the RBCs for 48 h. The aim of this study was to investigate this effect after short-time incubation using a variety of stimulating substances for Ca2+ uptake and PS exposure. METHODS: We separated RBCs by age in five different fractions by centrifugation using Percoll density gradient. The intracellular Ca2+ content and the PS exposure of RBCs with different age has been investigated after treatment with lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) as well as after activation of protein kinase C (PKC) using phorbol-12 myristate-13 acetate (PMA). For positive control RBCs were treated with 4-bromo-A23187. Measurement techniques included flow cytometry and live cell imaging (fluorescence microscopy). RESULTS: The percentage of RBCs showing increased Ca2+ content as well as the PS exposure did not change significantly in dependence on cell age after short-time incubation in control experiments (without stimulating substances) or using LPA or PMA. However, we confirm findings reported that Ca2+ content and the PS exposure of RBCs increased after 48 h incubation. CONCLUSION: No significant differences of intracellular Ca2+ content and PS exposure can be seen for RBCs of different age in resting state or after stimulation of Ca2+ uptake at short-time incubation.
27274247	Absence epilepsy and the CHD2 gene: an adolescent male with moderate intellectual disability, short-lasting psychoses, and an interstitial deletion in 15q26.1-q26.2.	Deletions of the 15q26 region encompassing the chromodomain helicase DNA binding domain 2 (CHD2) gene have been associated with intellectual disability, behavioral problems, and several types of epilepsy. Including the cases mentioned in ECARUCA (European cytogeneticists association register of unbalanced chromosome aberrations) and DECIPHER (database of genomic variation and phenotype in humans using ensembl resources), so far, a total of 13 intellectually disabled patients with a genetically proven deletion of the CHD2 gene are described, of whom eleven had a history of severe forms of epilepsy starting from a young age. In this article, a moderately intellectually disabled 15-year-old male with a 15q26.1-q26.2 interstitial deletion is reported, who was referred for analysis of two recent short-lasting psychotic episodes that were nonresponsive to antipsychotic treatment and recurrent disinhibited behaviors since early infancy. Careful interdisciplinary assessment revealed that the psychotic phenomena originated from a previously unrecognized absence epilepsy. Treatment with valproic acid was started which resulted in full remission of psychotic symptoms, and consequently, substantial improvement of behavior. It was concluded that in case of (rare) developmental disorders with genetically proven etiology, a detailed inventory of anamnestic data and description of symptomatology over time may elucidate epilepsy-related psychopathology for which a specific treatment regimen is needed.
27333288	Oligocene Termite Nests with In Situ Fungus Gardens from the Rukwa Rift Basin, Tanzania, Support a Paleogene African Origin for Insect Agriculture.	Based on molecular dating, the origin of insect agriculture is hypothesized to have taken place independently in three clades of fungus-farming insects: the termites, ants or ambrosia beetles during the Paleogene (66-24 Ma). Yet, definitive fossil evidence of fungus-growing behavior has been elusive, with no unequivocal records prior to the late Miocene (7-10 Ma). Here we report fossil evidence of insect agriculture in the form of fossil fungus gardens, preserved within 25 Ma termite nests from southwestern Tanzania. Using these well-dated fossil fungus gardens, we have recalibrated molecular divergence estimates for the origins of termite agriculture to around 31 Ma, lending support to hypotheses suggesting an African Paleogene origin for termite-fungus symbiosis; perhaps coinciding with rift initiation and changes in the African landscape.
27168985	Computational identification of miRNAs that modulate the differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells to osteoblasts.	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small endogenous noncoding RNAs that play an instrumental role in post-transcriptional modulation of gene expression. Genes related to osteogenesis (i.e., RUNX2, COL1A1 and OSX) is important in controlling the differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to bone tissues. The regulated expression level of miRNAs is critically important for the differentiation of MSCs to preosteoblasts. The understanding of miRNA regulation in osteogenesis could be applied for future applications in bone defects. Therefore, this study aims to shed light on the mechanistic pathway underlying osteogenesis by predicting miRNAs that may modulate this pathway. This study investigates RUNX2, which is a major transcription factor for osteogenesis that drives MSCs into preosteoblasts. Three different prediction tools were employed for identifying miRNAs related to osteogenesis using the 3'UTR of RUNX2 as the target gene. Of the 1,023 miRNAs, 70 miRNAs were found by at least two of the tools. Candidate miRNAs were then selected based on their free energy values, followed by assessing the probability of target accessibility. The results showed that miRNAs 23b, 23a, 30b, 143, 203, 217, and 221 could regulate the RUNX2 gene during the differentiation of MSCs to preosteoblasts.
26998072	Association between ALDH1+/CD133+ stem-like cells and tumor angiogenesis in invasive ductal breast carcinoma.	The growth and metastasis of tumors is dependent on angiogenesis; however, the association between tumor stem cells (TSCs) and tumor angiogenesis remains to be elucidated. The present study aimed to investigate the expression of the TSC markers aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 (ALDH1) and cluster of differentiation 133 (CD133) in invasive ductal breast carcinoma, and identify their correlation with tumor angiogenesis. Stem-like cells from the breast tissue of 120 patients, who were diagnosed with invasive ductal breast carcinoma at The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University (Zhengzhou, Henan, China) between January 2009 and December 2010, were collected by surgical resection and analyzed using immunohistochemical double staining. The expression of the vascular markers CD34, CD105 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were determined using single staining. Overall, 25.83% (31/120) of the specimens contained a large number of ALDH1+/CD133+ stem-like cells (ALDH1+/CD133+ tumor). ALDH1+/CD133+ expression is associated with microvessel density, VEGF-positive rate and estrogen receptor expression (P<0.05); however, ALDH1+/CD133+ expression was not associated with age, tumor diameter, lymph node metastasis, histological classification, progesterone receptor expression or human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 expression (P>0.05). The ALDH1+/CD133+ tumor phenotype and expression of VEGF were identified to be correlated in the present study (P=0.020). The present study revealed a close association between breast cancer TSC markers, including ALDH1 and CD133, and tumor angiogenesis. The results of the present study may provide a novel target and treatment strategy for future studies investigating tumor growth and metastasis.
27544756	The Association between Angiotensin Receptor Blocker Usage and Breast Cancer Characteristics.	PURPOSE: To evaluate the association between angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) usage and breast cancer characteristics and outcomes. METHODS: All patients who were treated in our institute for estrogen receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative early breast cancer between April 2005 and March 2012 and whose tumors were sent for Oncotype-DX analysis were included. Medical records were retrospectively reviewed. Data regarding ARB usage were retrieved. Usage of several prespecified medications for hypertension was also evaluated. Each medication group was compared with the rest of the cohort. RESULTS: A total of 671 patients were included. Forty-six (7%) patients were treated with ARB. ARB usage was associated with macroscopic nodal involvement (p < 0.001) and a more advanced stage at diagnosis (p < 0.001). These findings remained significant in the multivariate analysis. Patients treated with ARB also had a higher incidence of invasive lobular carcinoma subtype (p = 0.009), a worse 5-year breast cancer-specific survival (94.7 vs. 98.8%, p = 0.024) and a worse 5-year overall survival (94.6 vs. 98.8%, p = 0.015), but these differences were not demonstrated in the multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Patients treated with ARB presented with a more advanced breast cancer disease and some distinct histological features. Further research is required to elucidate the effect of ARB treatment on breast cancer.
27442411	Kidney diseases in children - early diagnosis and prevention.	Pediatric kidney diseases were in the focus of the World Kidney Day 2016. Macedonian pediatric nephrologists gave their contribution with public appearance in kindergartens, primary and secondary schools, with interactive lectures and discussion with the youngest about the kidney function, healthy life style and simple measures to prevent kidney and urinary tract diseases. Besides promotive appearance in the media, series of lectures were presented in front of the health professionals. The aim was to attract the attention of the professionals for early diagnosis and prevention of kidney disease. The action starts in utero, followed by early postnatal imaging and assessment, conservative treatment and in selected cases surgical treatment. The emphasis is on the multidisciplinary and comprehensive approach to children and adolescents with kidney diseases.
27785098	Single-shot lamina thoracic paravertebral block with ketofol for modified radical mastectomy.	We describe the use of single-shot lamina thoracic paravertebral block (TPVB) with sedation for a 56-year-old female patient who had modified radical mastectomy with axillary clearance. Two years ago, she suffered vocal cord palsy post thyroidectomy, which was managed with tracheostomy. The tracheostomy tube was removed 8 months later, leaving the patient with persistent hoarseness of voice and left vocal cord palsy. She declined general anesthesia and consented for TPVB. The surgery lasted 95 minutes and was successfully completed with TPVB. Her vital signs were stable during the operation. She had low pain scores, minimal opioid use, early alimentation, and no postoperative nausea and vomiting and was discharged early. We present the anesthetic management of this case in our setting, where TPVB under ultrasound guidance and modern drug-delivery systems for sedation are unavailable.
27829937	The effect of oversewing the staple line in laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy: randomized control trial.	INTRODUCTION: Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) is one of the most popular bariatric procedures. The procedure is associated with serious staple-line complications such as bleeding, leaks, and stenosis. AIM: To determine whether oversewing the staple line, compared with clipping, in LSG reduces the incidence of postoperative bleeding. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We conducted a parallel-group, prospective, randomized controlled trial (RCT) of 100 patients who underwent LSG for obesity at a single institution between May 2014 and August 2015. Patients were assigned to one of two groups for reinforcement of the staple line: the oversewing group (staple line oversewn) or the clipping group (staple line clipped). The primary outcome was reoperation for hemodynamic instability caused by staple-line bleeding within 72 h postoperatively. The secondary outcomes were operative duration, length of hospital stay, postoperative leaks, and postoperative stenosis. RESULTS: Mean operative duration was longer in the oversewing group (78.2 +/-20.5 min) than in the clipping group (64.1 +/-16.5 min, p < 0.001). Mean length of hospital stay was comparable in both groups. Postoperatively, there was no significant between-group difference in bleeding (oversewing, n = 0 vs. clipping, n = 2 (4.6%); p = 0.21) or in stenosis and leakage (both outcomes: oversewing, n = 0, vs. clipping, n = 1 (2.3%); p = 0.46). CONCLUSIONS: Oversewing the staple line prolongs operative duration. No conclusions can be drawn regarding the effects of oversewing on staple-line bleeding, postoperative leakage and stenosis, or length of hospital stay.
27453774	One-Step Selective Hydroxylation of Benzene to Phenol with Hydrogen Peroxide Catalysed by Copper Complexes Incorporated into Mesoporous Silica-Alumina.	Benzene was hydroxylated with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in the presence of catalytic amounts of copper complexes in acetone to yield phenol at 298 K. At higher temperature, phenol was further hydroxylated with H2O2 by catalysis of copper complexes to yield p-benzoquinone. The kinetic study revealed that the rate was proportional to concentrations of benzene and H2O2, but to the square root of concentration of a copper(II) complex ([Cu(tmpa)]2+: tmpa = tris(2-pyridylmethyl)amine). The addition of a spin trapping reagent resulted in formation of a spin adduct of hydroperoxyl radical (HO2*), as observed by EPR spectroscopy, inhibiting phenol formation. HO2* produced by the reaction of [Cu(tmpa)]2+ with H2O2 acts as a chain carrier for the radical chain reactions for formation of phenol. When [Cu(tmpa)]2+ was incorporated into mesoporous silica-alumina (Al-MCM-41) by a cation exchange reaction, the selectivity to production of phenol was much enhanced by prevention of hydroxylation of phenol, which was not adsorbed to Al-MCM-41. The high durability with turnover number of 4320 for the hydroxylation of benzene to phenol with H2O2 was achieved using [Cu(tmpa)]2+ incorporated into Al-MCM-41 as an efficient and selective catalyst.
27907144	A New Efficient Method for Detecting Phase Singularity in Cardiac Fibrillation.	BACKGROUND: The point of phase singularity (PS) is considered to represent a spiral wave core or a rotor in cardiac fibrillation. Computational efficiency is important for detection of PS in clinical electrophysiology. We developed a novel algorithm for highly efficient and robust detection of PS. METHODS: In contrast to the conventional method, which calculates PS based on the line integral of the phase around a PS point equal to +/-2pi (the Iyer-Gray method), the proposed algorithm (the location-centric method) looks for the phase discontinuity point at which PS actually occurs. We tested the efficiency and robustness of these two methods in a two-dimensional mathematical model of atrial fibrillation (AF), with and without remodeling of ionic currents. RESULTS: 1. There was a significant association, in terms of the Hausdorff distance (3.30 +/- 0.0 mm), between the PS points measured using the Iyer-Gray and location-centric methods, with almost identical PS trajectories generated by the two methods. 2. For the condition of electrical remodeling of AF (0.3 x ICaL), the PS points calculated by the two methods were satisfactorily co-localized (with the Hausdorff distance of 1.64 +/- 0.09 mm). 3. The proposed location-centric method was substantially more efficient than the Iyer-Gray method, with a 28.6-fold and 28.2-fold shorter run times for the control and remodeling scenarios, respectively. CONCLUSION: We propose a new location-centric method for calculating PS, which is robust and more efficient compared with the conventionally used method.
27698587	Flora-On: Occurrence data of the vascular flora of mainland Portugal.	The Flora-On dataset currently includes 253,310 occurrence records for the class Embryopsidae (vascular plants), comprising data collated via the platform http://flora-on.pt/ relating to observation records of vascular plants across mainland Portugal. Observations are uploaded directly to the database primarily by experienced botanists and naturalists, typically on a weekly basis, and consist of geo-referenced data points for species (or infraspecific taxa) along with their date of observation and phenological state. The Flora-On project aims to compile and make publicly accessible chorological, ecological, morphological and photographic information for the entire vascular flora of Portugal. The project's website offers powerful query and visualization capabilities, of which we highlight the probabilistic bioclimatic and phenological queries which operate based on the empirical density distributions of species in those variables. Flora-On was created and continues to be maintained by volunteers who are Associate members of Sociedade Portuguesa de Botanica (Botanical Society of Portugal). Given its focus on research-grade and current data, the Flora-On project represents a significant contribution to the knowledge of the present distribution and status of the Portuguese flora.
27125747	Deficiency of Soluble alpha-Klotho as an Independent Cause of Uremic Cardiomyopathy.	Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the major cause of mortality for patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Cardiac hypertrophy, occurring in up to 95% patients with CKD (also known as uremic cardiomyopathy), increases their risk for cardiovascular death. Many CKD-specific risk factors of uremic cardiomyopathy have been recognized, such as secondary hyperparathyroidism, indoxyl sulfate (IS)/p-cresyl, and vitamin D deficiency. However, several randomized controlled trials have recently shown that these risk factors have little impact on the mortality of CVD. Klotho is a type 1 membrane protein predominantly produced in the kidney, and CKD is known to be a Klotho-deficient state. Because of its important role in FGF23 and phosphate metabolism, Klotho is believed to affect cardiac growth and function indirectly through FGF23 and phosphate. Recent studies showed that soluble Klotho protects the heart against stress-induced cardiac hypertrophy by inhibiting TRPC6 channel-mediated abnormal Ca(2+) signaling in the heart, and the decreased level of circulating soluble Klotho in CKD is an important cause of uremic cardiomyopathy independent of FGF23 and phosphate. These new evidence suggested that Klotho is an independent contributing factor for uremic cardiomyopathy and a possible new target for treatment of this disease.
27247934	Differentially Expressed miRNAs in Tumor, Adjacent, and Normal Tissues of Lung Adenocarcinoma.	Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths. Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the major type of lung cancer. The aim of this study was to characterize the expression profiles of miRNAs in adenocarcinoma (AC), one major subtype of NSCLC. In this study, the miRNAs were detected in normal, adjacent, and tumor tissues by next-generation sequencing. Then the expression levels of differential miRNAs were quantified by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). In the results, 259, 401, and 389 miRNAs were detected in tumor, adjacent, and normal tissues of pooled AC samples, respectively. In addition, for the first time we have found that miR-21-5p and miR-196a-5p were gradually upregulated from normal to adjacent to tumor tissues; miR-218-5p was gradually downregulated with 2-fold or greater change in AC tissues. These 3 miRNAs were validated by qRT-PCR. Lastly, we predicted target genes of these 3 miRNAs and enriched the potential functions and regulatory pathways. The aberrant miR-21-5p, miR-196a-5p, and miR-218-5p may become biomarkers for diagnosis and prognosis of lung adenocarcinoma. This research may be useful for lung adenocarcinoma diagnosis and the study of pathology in lung cancer.
27003783	Retrograde Axonal Degeneration in Parkinson Disease.	In spite of tremendous research efforts we have not yet achieved two of our principal therapeutic goals in the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD), to prevent its onward progression and to provide restoration of systems that have already been damaged by the time of diagnosis. There are many possible reasons for our inability to make progress. One possibility is that our efforts thus far may not have been directed towards the appropriate cellular compartments. Up until now research has been largely focused on the loss of neurons in the disease. Thus, neuroprotection approaches have been largely aimed at blocking mechanisms that lead to destruction of the neuronal cell body. Attempts to provide neurorestoration have been almost entirely focused on replacement of neurons. We herein review the evidence that the axonal component of diseased neuronal systems merit more of our attention. Evidence from imaging studies, from postmortem neurochemical studies, and from genetic animal models suggests that the axons of the dopaminergic system are involved predominantly and early in PD. Since the mechanisms of axonal destruction are distinct from those of neuron cell body degeneration, a focus on axonal neurobiology will offer new opportunities for preventing their degeneration. At present these mechanisms remain largely obscure. However, defining them is likely to offer new opportunities for neuroprotection. In relation to neurorestoration, while it has been classically believed that neurons of the adult central nervous system are incapable of new axon growth, recent evidence shows that this is not true for the dopaminergic projection. In conclusion, the neurobiology of axons is likely to offer many new approaches to protective and restorative therapeutics.
27607466	Effects of Different Substrates on Lignocellulosic Enzyme Expression, Enzyme Activity, Substrate Utilization and Biological Efficiency of Pleurotus Eryngii.	BACKGROUND/AIMS: Pleurotus eryngii is one of the most valued and delicious mushrooms which are commercially cultivated on various agro-wastes. How different substrates affect lignocellulosic biomass degradation, lignocellulosic enzyme production and biological efficiency in Pleurotus eryngii was unclear. METHODS AND RESULTS: In this report, Pleurotus eryngii was cultivated in substrates including ramie stalks, kenaf stalks, cottonseed hulls and bulrush stalks. The results showed that ramie stalks and kenaf stalks were found to best suitable to cultivate Pleurotus eryngii with the biological efficiency achieved at 55% and 57%, respectively. In order to establish correlations between different substrates and lignocellulosic enzymes expression, the extracellular proteins from four substrates were profiled with high throughput TMT-based quantitative proteomic approach. 241 non-redundant proteins were identified and 74 high confidence lignocellulosic enzymes were quantified. Most of the cellulases, hemicellulases and lignin depolymerization enzymes were highly up-regulated when ramie stalks and kenaf stalks were used as carbon sources. The enzyme activities results suggested cellulases, hemicellulases and lignin depolymerization enzymes were significantly induced by ramie stalks and kenaf stalks. CONCLUSION: The lignocelluloses degradation, most of the lignocellulosic enzymes expressions and activities of Pleurotus eryngii had positive correlation with the biological efficiency, which depend on the nature of lignocellulosic substrates. In addition, the lignocellulosic enzymes expression profiles during Pleurotus eryngii growth in different substrates were obtained. The present study suggested that most of the lignocellulosic enzymes expressions and activities can be used as tools for selecting better performing substrates for commercial mushroom cultivation.
28066057	THE RENIN-ANGIOTENSIN SYSTEM AND THE BIOLOGY OF SKELETAL MUSCLE: MECHANISMS OF MUSCLE WASTING IN CHRONIC DISEASE STATES.	Sarcopenia and cachexia are muscle-wasting syndromes associated with aging and with many chronic diseases such as congestive heart failure, diabetes, cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and renal failure. While mechanisms are complex, these conditions are often accompanied by elevated angiotensin II (Ang II). We found that Ang II infusion in rodents leads to skeletal muscle wasting via alterations in insulin-like growth factor-1 signaling, increased apoptosis, enhanced muscle protein breakdown via the ubiquitin-proteasome system, and decreased appetite resulting from downregulation of hypothalamic orexigenic neuropeptides orexin and neuropeptide Y. Furthermore, Ang II inhibits skeletal muscle stem cell proliferation, leading to lowered muscle regenerative capacity. Distinct stem cell Ang II receptor subtypes are critical for regulation of muscle regeneration. In ischemic mouse congestive heart failure model skeletal muscle wasting and attenuated muscle regeneration are Ang II dependent. These data suggest that the renin-angiotensin system plays a critical role in mechanisms underlying cachexia in chronic disease states.
27453620	Assessing Syntactic Deficits in Chinese Broca's aphasia using the Northwestern Assessment of Verbs and Sentences-Chinese (NAVS-C).	BACKGROUND: English-speaking patients with Broca's aphasia and agrammatism evince difficulty with complex grammatical structures, including verbs and sentences. A few studies have found similar patterns among Chinese-speaking patients with broca's aphasia, despite structural differences between these two languages. However, no studies have explicitly examined verb properties, including the number and optionality of arguments (participant roles) selected by the verb, and only a few studies have examined sentence deficits among Chinese patients. In addition, there are no test batteries presently available to assess syntactically important properties of verbs and sentences in Chinese patients. AIMS: This study used a Chinese version of the Northwestern Assessment of Verbs and Sentences (NAVS; Thompson, 2011), originally developed for English speakers with aphasia, to examine the verb and sentence deficit patterns among Chinese speakers with aphasia. As in the original NAVS, the Chinese version (NAVS-C) assessed verbs by the number and optionality of arguments as well as sentence canonicity, in the both production and comprehension. METHODS AND PROCEDURES: Fifteen Chinese patients with Broca's aphasia and fifteen age-matched healthy normal controls participated in this study. All NAVS-C tests were administered, in which participants were asked either to produce or identify verbs and sentences coinciding with action pictures. OUTCOMES & RESULTS: Despite grammatical differences between Chinese and English, the impairment caused by structural complexity of verbs and sentences was replicated in Chinese-speaking patients using the NAVS-C. Verbs with more arguments were significantly more impaired than those with fewer arguments and verbs with optional arguments were significantly more impaired than those with obligatory arguments. One deviation from English-speaking patients, however, is that the Chinese-speaking patients exhibited greater difficulty with subject relative clauses than with object relative clauses because the former, rather than the latter, involve non-canonical order in Chinese. Similar to English-speaking patients, Chinese patients exhibited more difficulty with object extracted wh-questions than with subject extracted wh-questions. Suggesting that wh-movement in Logical Form may also cause processing difficulty. Moreover, Chinese-speaking patients exhibited similar performance in both production and comprehension, indicating the deficits in both modalities. CONCLUSIONS: The number and optionality of verb arguments as well as canonicity of the Agent-Theme order in sentences impacts Chinese-speaking individuals with aphasia as it does in the case of English-speaking patients. These findings indicate that the NAVS-C is a useful tool for detailing deficit patterns associated with syntactic processing in patients with aphasia cross-linguistically.
27239204	A Comparative Evaluation of the Mechanical Properties of Two Calcium Phosphate/Collagen Composite Materials and Their Osteogenic Effects on Adipose-Derived Stem Cells.	Adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) are ideal seed cells for use in bone tissue engineering and they have many advantages over other stem cells. In this study, two kinds of calcium phosphate/collagen composite scaffolds were prepared and their effects on the proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of ADSCs were investigated. The hydroxyapatite/beta-tricalcium phosphate (HA/beta-TCP) composite scaffolds (HTPSs), which have an additional beta-tricalcium phosphate, resulted in better proliferation of ADSCs and showed osteogenesis-promoting effects. Therefore, such composite scaffolds, in combination with ADSCs or on their own, would be promising for use in bone regeneration and potential clinical therapy for bone defects.
26963612	Drosophila Cyclin G Is a Regulator of the Notch Signalling Pathway during Wing Development.	Notch signalling regulates a multitude of differentiation processes during Drosophila development. For example, Notch activity is required for proper wing vein differentiation which is hampered in mutants of either the receptor Notch, the ligand Delta or the antagonist Hairless. Moreover, the Notch pathway is involved in several aspects of Drosophila oogenesis as well. We have identified Drosophila Cyclin G (CycG) as a molecular interaction partner of Hairless, the major antagonist in the Notch signalling pathway, in vitro and in vivo. Loss of CycG was shown before to cause female sterility and to disturb the architecture of the egg shell. Nevertheless, Notch dependent processes during oogenesis appeared largely unaffected in cycG mutant egg chambers. Loss of CycG modified the dominant wing phenotypes of Notch, Delta and Hairless mutants. Whereas the Notch loss of function phenotype was ameliorated by a loss of CycG, the phenotypes of either Notch gain of function or of Delta or Hairless loss of function were enhanced. In contrast, loss of CycG had only a minor effect on the wing vein phenotype of mutants affecting the EGFR signalling pathway emphasizing the specificity of the interaction of CycG and Notch pathway members.
26982697	Cluster Randomised Trials in Cochrane Reviews: Evaluation of Methodological and Reporting Practice.	OBJECTIVE: Systematic reviews can include cluster-randomised controlled trials (C-RCTs), which require different analysis compared with standard individual-randomised controlled trials. However, it is not known whether review authors follow the methodological and reporting guidance when including these trials. The aim of this study was to assess the methodological and reporting practice of Cochrane reviews that included C-RCTs against criteria developed from existing guidance. METHODS: Criteria were developed, based on methodological literature and personal experience supervising review production and quality. Criteria were grouped into four themes: identifying, reporting, assessing risk of bias, and analysing C-RCTs. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews was searched (2nd December 2013), and the 50 most recent reviews that included C-RCTs were retrieved. Each review was then assessed using the criteria. RESULTS: The 50 reviews we identified were published by 26 Cochrane Review Groups between June 2013 and November 2013. For identifying C-RCTs, only 56% identified that C-RCTs were eligible for inclusion in the review in the eligibility criteria. For reporting C-RCTs, only eight (24%) of the 33 reviews reported the method of cluster adjustment for their included C-RCTs. For assessing risk of bias, only one review assessed all five C-RCT-specific risk-of-bias criteria. For analysing C-RCTs, of the 27 reviews that presented unadjusted data, only nine (33%) provided a warning that confidence intervals may be artificially narrow. Of the 34 reviews that reported data from unadjusted C-RCTs, only 13 (38%) excluded the unadjusted results from the meta-analyses. CONCLUSIONS: The methodological and reporting practices in Cochrane reviews incorporating C-RCTs could be greatly improved, particularly with regard to analyses. Criteria developed as part of the current study could be used by review authors or editors to identify errors and improve the quality of published systematic reviews incorporating C-RCTs.
27806056	Cross-Mating Compatibility and Competitiveness among Aedes albopictus Strains from Distinct Geographic Origins - Implications for Future Application of SIT Programs in the South West Indian Ocean Islands.	The production of large numbers of males needed for a sustainable sterile insect technique (SIT) control program requires significant developmental and operational costs. This may constitute a significant economic barrier to the installation of large scale rearing facilities in countries that are undergoing a transition from being largely dependent on insecticide use to be in a position to integrate the SIT against Aedes albopictus. Alternative options available for those countries could be to rely on outsourcing of sterile males from a foreign supplier, or for one centralised facility to produce mosquitoes for several countries, thus increasing the efficiency of the mass-rearing effort. However, demonstration of strain compatibility is a prerequisite for the export of mosquitoes for transborder SIT applications. Here, we compared mating compatibility among Ae. albopictus populations originating from three islands of the South Western Indian Ocean, and assessed both insemination rates and egg fertility in all possible cross-mating combinations. Furthermore, competitiveness between irradiated and non-irradiated males from the three studied strains, and the subsequent effect on female fertility were also examined. Although morphometric analysis of wing shapes suggested phenoptypic differences between Ae. albopictus strains, perfect reproductive compatibility between them was observed. Furthermore, irradiated males from the different islands demonstrated similar levels of competitiveness and induced sterility when confronted with fertile males from any of the other island populations tested. In conclusion, despite the evidence of inter-strain differences based on male wing morphology, collectively, our results provide a new set of expectations for the use of a single candidate strain of mass-reared sterile males for area-wide scale application of SIT against Ae. albopictus populations in different islands across the South Western Indian Ocean. Cross-mating competitiveness tests such as those applied here are necessary to assess the quality of mass reared strains for the trans-border application of sterile male release programs.

27441000	Fasudil inhibits LPS-induced migration of retinal microglial cells via regulating p38-MAPK signaling pathway.	PURPOSE: To investigate the effect and possible molecular mechanisms of fasudil on retinal microglial (RMG) cell migration. METHODS: Primary cultured RMG cells were incubated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), fasudil, and/or SB203580 (a p38 inhibitor). RMG cell motility was determined with the scratch wound assay and the Transwell migration assay. The phosphorylation of p38 and levels of matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2) and MMP-9 were measured with western blot. RESULTS: In the scratch-induced migration assay, as well as in the Transwell migration assay, the results indicated that LPS stimulated the migratory potential of RMG cells and fasudil significantly reduced LPS-stimulated RMG cell migration in a concentration-dependent manner. However, fasudil had no effect on RMG cell migration in the absence of LPS stimulation. Moreover, fasudil reduced the level of phosphor-p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p-p38-MAPK) in a concentration-dependent manner, without effects on the levels of phospho-p44/42 (p-ERK1/2) and phospho-c-Jun N-terminal kinase (p-JNK). Cotreatment with SB203580 (a p38 inhibitor) and fasudil resulted in the synergistic reduction of MMP-2, MMP-9, and p-p38-MAPK, as well as a reduction in the LPS-stimulated migration capabilities of the RMG cells, suggesting fasudil suppresses the LPS-stimulated migration of RMG cells via directly downregulating the p38-MAPK signaling pathway. CONCLUSIONS: Our studies indicated that fasudil inhibited LPS-stimulated RMG cell migration via suppression of the p38-MAPK signaling pathway.
27933272	Autophagy-Dependent Secretion: Contribution to Tumor Progression.	Autophagy is best known as a lysosomal degradation and recycling pathway to maintain cellular homeostasis. During autophagy, cytoplasmic content is recognized and packed in autophagic vacuoles, or autophagosomes, and targeted for degradation. However, during the last years, it has become evident that the role of autophagy is not restricted to degradation alone but also mediates unconventional forms of secretion. Furthermore, cells with defects in autophagy apparently are able to reroute their cargo, like mitochondria, to the extracellular environment; effects that contribute to an array of pathologies. In this review, we discuss the current knowledge of the physiological roles of autophagy-dependent secretion, i.e., the effect on inflammation and insulin/hormone secretion. Finally, we focus on the effects of autophagy-dependent secretion on the tumor microenvironment (TME) and tumor progression. The autophagy-mediated secreted factors may stimulate cellular proliferation via auto- and paracrine signaling. The autophagy-mediated release of immune modulating proteins changes the immunosuppresive TME and may promote an invasive phenotype. These effects may be either direct or indirect through facilitating formation of the mobilized vesicle, aid in anterograde trafficking, or alterations in homeostasis and/or autonomous cell signaling.
28101514	[18F]FDG Uptake in the Aortic Wall Smooth Muscle of Atherosclerotic Plaques in the Simian Atherosclerosis Model.	Atherosclerosis is a self-sustaining inflammatory fibroproliferative disease that progresses in discrete stages and involves a number of cell types and effector molecules. Recently, [18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose- ([18F]FDG-) positron emission tomography (PET) has been suggested as a tool to evaluate atherosclerotic plaques by detecting accumulated macrophages associated with inflammation progress. However, at the cellular level, it remains unknown whether only macrophages exhibit high uptake of [18F]FDG. To identify the cellular origin of [18F]FDG uptake in atherosclerotic plaques, we developed a simian atherosclerosis model and performed PET and ex vivo macro- and micro-autoradiography (ARG). Increased [18F]FDG uptake in the aortic wall was observed in high-cholesterol diet-treated monkeys and WHHL rabbits. Macro-ARG of [18F]FDG in aortic sections showed that [18F]FDG was accumulated in the media and intima in the simian model as similar to that in WHHL rabbits. Combined analysis of micro-ARG with immunohistochemistry in the simian atherosclerosis model revealed that most cellular [18F]FDG uptake observed in the media was derived not only from the infiltrated macrophages in atherosclerotic plaques but also from the smooth muscle cells (SMCs) of the aortic wall in atherosclerotic lesions.
27579409	The Endoscopic Removal of Eroded Foreign Bodies in the Ureter.	A complication of using foreign materials in surgery is potential erosion into nearby tissues. The endoscopic removal of foreign bodies that have eroded into the urinary tract is a safe and minimally invasive option that has previously been described, most commonly in the bladder and urethra. We present the case of a patient who had a remote history of a pyeloplasty and was found to have different foreign bodies eroding into the ureter causing symptoms. To our knowledge, this is the first case where a patient presented with two different types of ureteral foreign body erosions that were each effectively treated endoscopically.
27478306	The Expression of T Cell FOXP3 and T-Bet Is Upregulated in Severe but Not Euthyroid Hashimoto's Thyroiditis.	Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT) is an organ-specific autoimmune disorder characterized by progressive thyroid failure. Th1 and Treg subset of CD4(+) cells have been implicated in the pathogenesis; however, less is known about their respective roles across the spectrum of HT clinical presentations. To shed more light on CD4(+) subsets role in HT, we investigated the mRNA expression levels of several Th1/Treg-associated transcription factors (T-bet/ETS1, HIF1alpha/BLIMP1/FOXP3) in peripheral blood T cells of 10 hypothyroid, untreated HT patients, 10 hypothyroid patients undergoing hormone replacement therapy, 12 euthyroid HT subjects, and 11 healthy controls by the qRT-PCR. Compared to euthyroid HT patients and controls, both hypothyroid (2.34-fold difference versus controls, P < 0.01) and thyroxine-supplemented patients (2.5-fold, P < 0.001) showed an increased FOXP3 mRNA expression in T cells. Similarly, mRNA expression levels of T-bet were upregulated in severely affected but not in euthyroid HT subjects (2.37-fold and 3.2-fold, hypothyroid and thyroxine-supplemented HT patients versus controls, resp., P < 0.01). By contrast, no differences in mRNA expression levels of ETS1, BLIMP1, and HIF1alpha were observed across the study groups. In summary, severe but not euthyroid HT was associated with robust upregulation of T-bet and FOXP3 mRNA in peripheral T cells, independent of the thyroid hormone status but proportional to disease activity.
28269967	Representing Residence, Living Situation, and Living Conditions: An Evaluation of Terminologies, Standards, Guidelines, and Measures/Surveys.	Social determinants of health play an important role in diagnosis, prevention, health outcomes, and quality of life. The objective of this study was to examine existing standards, vocabularies, and terminologies for items related to Residence, Living Situation, and Living Conditions and to synthesize them into model representations. Sources were identified through literature and keyword searches, and an examination of commonly used resources. Each source was systematically analyzed by two reviewers, mapped to topic area(s), and further mapped to a model representation. A total of 27 sources were identified and reviewed. Seven of the sources had no items, i.e. concepts, elements, or values, related to the three topic areas while SNOMED-CT had the most items at 436 followed by the US Census at 174. While none of the identified sources encompassed a complete representation for documenting the three topic areas, their synthesis together results overall in more comprehensive representations.
27114990	Mendelian Susceptibility to Mycobacterial Disease due to IL-12Rbeta1 Deficiency in Three Iranian Children.	Mendelian susceptibility to mycobacterial diseases (MSMD) is a rare inheritance syndrome, characterized by a disseminated infection with mycobacterium in children following BCG vaccination at birth. Regarding the vaccination program in Iran, it may consider as a public health problem. The pathogenesis of MSMD is dependent on either insufficient production of IFN-gamma (gamma) or inadequate response to it. Here, we want to introduce three cases including two siblings and one girl from two unrelated families with severe mycobacterial infections referred to Immunology, Asthma and Allergy Research Institute (IAARI), from 2013 to 2015; their MSMD was confirmed by both cytokine assessment and genetic analysis. Regarding the clinical features of the patients, cell proliferation against a mitogen and BCG antigen was ordered in a lymphocyte transformation test (LTT) setting. ELISA was performed for the measurement of IL-12p70 and IFN- gamma in whole blood samples activated by BCG + recombinant human IFN-gamma and BCG + recombinant human IL-12, respectively. In contrast to mitogen, the antigen-dependent proliferation activity of the patients' leukocytes was significantly lower than that in normal range. We identified a homozygous mutation in IL12RB1 gene for two kindred who had a homozygous mutation affecting an essential splice site. For the third patient, a novel frameshift deletion in IL12RB1 gene was found. The genetic study results confirmed the impaired function of stimulated lymphocytes to release IFN-gamma following stimulation with BCG+IL-12 while the response to rhIFN-gamma for IL-12p70 production was relatively intact. Our findings show that cellular and molecular assessments are needed for precise identification of immunodeficiency disorders especially those without clear-cut diagnostic criteria.
26998123	Study on the therapeutic effect of neural progenitor cells in mice of a glioma murine model.	Glioma is a common malignacy of the brain that affects elderly patients in particular. Despite treatment, however, the survival rate is 12 months. The aim of the present study was to examine the therapeutic effect of neural progenitor cells (NPCs) on a glioma murine model, and to determine the possible mechanism of action. A glioma murine model was constructed and the tumor volume and tumor growth rate were measured. The therapeutic effect of cell injection on the glioma mouse model mice was confirmed. The quantitative polymerase chain reaction method was used to detect the expression of proto-oncogene and tumor suppressor gene. Intracranial injection of NPCs was performed to determine cell apoptosis. Preliminary results showed the mechanism of cell therapy effect at the transcription and cellular level. Compared with the model group, the tumor volume of the mice of the cell therapy group was significantly reduced from the 6th to 8th week, and the tumor growth rate was downregulated. The mechanism of action identified that NPCs regulate gene expression in tumor tissues, increase the expression of tumor suppressor gene, downregulate the gene expression of tumor cells, and reverse the proto-oncogene and imbalance of gene expression in gliomas. In conclusion, the new type of cell injection method can regulate the proto-oncogene of tumor tissue and tumor suppressor gene, improve the function phenotype of the cell, and effectively improve the clinical symptoms of mice with gliomas.
28156407	Spirometry in Greenland: a cross-sectional study on patients treated with medication targeting obstructive pulmonary disease.	Background Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is globally increasing in frequency and is expected to be the third largest cause of death by 2020. Smoking is the main risk factor of developing COPD. In Greenland, more than half of the adult population are daily smokers, and COPD may be common. International guidelines recommend the usage of spirometry as a golden standard for diagnosing COPD. The current number of spirometries performed among patients treated with medication targeting obstructive pulmonary disease in Greenland remains unexplored. Objective To estimate the prevalence of patients aged 50 years or above treated with medication targeting obstructive pulmonary disease and the extent to which spirometry was performed among them within 2 years. Design An observational, cross-sectional study based on the review of data obtained from electronic medical records in Greenland was performed. The inclusion criterion was that patients must have been permanent residents aged 50 years or above who had medication targeting obstructive pulmonary disease prescribed within a period of 15 months prior to data extraction. A full review of electronic patient records was done on each of the identified users of medication targeting obstructive pulmonary disease. Information on age, gender, town and spirometry was registered for each patient within the period from October 2013 to October 2015. Results The prevalence of patients treated with medication targeting obstructive pulmonary disease aged 50 years or above was 7.9%. Of those, 34.8% had spirometry performed within 2 years and 50% had a forced expiratory volume (1 sec)/ forced vital capacity (FEV1/FVC) under 70% indicating obstructive pulmonary disease. Conclusion The use of medication targeting obstructive pulmonary disease among patients over 50 years old is common in Greenland. About one third of the patients had a spirometry performed within 2 years. To further increase spirometry performance, it is recommended to explore possible barriers in health care professionals' usage of spirometry in different health care settings in Greenland.
26831505	The CATFISH study protocol: an evaluation of a water fluoridation scheme.	BACKGROUND: Tooth decay is the commonest disease of childhood. We have known for over 90 years that fluoride can prevent tooth decay; it is present in nearly all toothpastes and can be provided in mouthwashes, gels and varnishes. The oldest method of applying fluoride is via the water supply at a concentration of 1 part per million. The two most important reviews of water fluoridation in the United Kingdom (the York Review and MRC Report on water fluoridation and health) concluded that whilst there was evidence to suggest water fluoridation provided a benefit in caries reduction, there was a need to improve the evidence base in several areas. METHODS/DESIGN: This study will use a natural experiment to assess the incidence of caries in two geographical areas, one in which the water supply is returned to being fluoridated following a discontinuation of fluoridation and one that continues to have a non-fluoridated water supply. The oral health of two discrete study populations will be evaluated - those born 9 months after the water fluoridation was introduced, and those who were in their 1st year of school after the introduction of fluoridated water. Both populations will be followed prospectively for 5 years using a census approach in the exposed group along with matched numbers recruitment in a non-exposed control. Parents of the younger cohort will complete questionnaires every 6 months with child clinical examination at ages 3 and 5, whilst the older cohort will have clinical examinations only, at approximately 5, 7 and 11 years old. DISCUSSION: This project provides a unique opportunity to conduct a high quality evaluation of the reintroduction of a water fluoridation scheme, which satisfies the inclusion criteria stipulated by the York systematic review and can address the design issues identified in the MRC report. The research will make a major contribution to the understanding of the costs and effects of water fluoridation in the UK in the 21st Century. Its findings will help inform UK policy on this important public health intervention and may have a significant impact on public health policy in other developed countries. There is currently true equipoise in relation to the effectiveness of water fluoridation in contemporary populations and while the biological plausibility is well established, there is a need to examine impact on the changing epidemiological status of dental decay.
27703455	Modulation of Phenotype and Function of Human CD4+CD25+ T Regulatory Lymphocytes Mediated by cAMP-Elevating Agents.	We have shown that cholera toxin (CT) and other cyclic AMP (cAMP)-elevating agents induce upregulation of the inhibitory molecule CTLA-4 in human resting CD4+ T lymphocytes, which following the treatment acquired suppressive functions. In this study, we evaluated the effect of cAMP-elevating agents on human CD4+CD25+ T cells, which include the T regulatory cells (Tregs) that play a pivotal role in the maintenance of immunological tolerance. We found that cAMP-elevating agents induce upregulation of CTLA-4 in CD4+CD25- and further enhance its expression in CD4+CD25+ T cells. We observed an increase of two isoforms of mRNA coding for the membrane and the soluble CTLA-4 molecules, suggesting that the regulation of CTLA-4 expression by cAMP is at the transcriptional level. In addition, we found that the increase of cAMP in CD4+CD25+ T cells converts the CD4+CD25+Foxp3- T cells in CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ T cells, whereas the increase of cAMP in CD4+CD25- T cells did not upregulate Foxp3 in the absence of activation stimuli. To investigate the function of these cells, we performed an in vitro suppression assay by culturing CD4+CD25+ T cells untreated or pre-treated with CT with anti-CD3 mAbs-stimulated autologous peripheral blood mononuclear cell. We found that CT enhances the inhibitory function of CD4+CD25+ T cells, CD4+, and CD8+ T cell proliferation and IFNgamma production are strongly inhibited by CD4+CD25+ T cells pre-treated with cAMP-elevating agents. Furthermore, we found that CD4+CD25+ T lymphocytes pre-treated with cAMP-elevating agents induce the upregulation of CD80 and CD86 co-stimulatory molecules on immature dendritic cells (DCs) in the absence of antigenic stimulation, however without leading to full DC maturation. These data show that the increase of intracellular cAMP modulates the phenotype and function of human CD4+CD25+ T cells.
27023132	Ezetimibe Promotes Brush Border Membrane-to-Lumen Cholesterol Efflux in the Small Intestine.	Ezetimibe inhibits Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 (NPC1L1), an apical membrane cholesterol transporter of enterocytes, thereby reduces intestinal cholesterol absorption. This treatment also increases extrahepatic reverse cholesterol transport via an undefined mechanism. To explore this, we employed a trans-intestinal cholesterol efflux (TICE) assay, which directly detects circulation-to-intestinal lumen 3H-cholesterol transit in a cannulated jejunal segment, and found an increase of TICE by 45%. To examine whether such increase in efflux occurs at the intestinal brush border membrane(BBM)-level, we performed luminal perfusion assays, similar to TICE but the jejunal wall was labelled with orally-given 3H-cholesterol, and determined elevated BBM-to-lumen cholesterol efflux by 3.5-fold with ezetimibe. Such increased efflux probably promotes circulation-to-lumen cholesterol transit eventually; thus increases TICE. Next, we wondered how inhibition of NPC1L1, an influx transporter, resulted in increased efflux. When we traced orally-given 3H-cholesterol in mice, we found that lumen-to-BBM 3H-cholesterol transit was rapid and less sensitive to ezetimibe treatment. Comparison of the efflux and fractional cholesterol absorption revealed an inverse correlation, indicating the efflux as an opposite-regulatory factor for cholesterol absorption efficiency and counteracting to the naturally-occurring rapid cholesterol influx to the BBM. These suggest that the ezetimibe-stimulated increased efflux is crucial in reducing cholesterol absorption. Ezetimibe-induced increase in cholesterol efflux was approximately 2.5-fold greater in mice having endogenous ATP-binding cassette G5/G8 heterodimer, the major sterol efflux transporter of enterocytes, than the knockout counterparts, suggesting that the heterodimer confers additional rapid BBM-to-lumen cholesterol efflux in response to NPC1L1 inhibition. The observed framework for intestinal cholesterol fluxes may provide ways to modulate the flux to dispose of endogenous cholesterol efficiently for therapeutic purposes.
27418881	Expansion or compression of long-term care in Germany between 2001 and 2009? A small-area decomposition study based on administrative health data.	BACKGROUND: Studies state profound cross-country differences in healthy life years and its time trends, suggesting either the health scenario of expansion or compression of morbidity. A much-discussed question in public health research is whether the health scenarios are heterogeneous or homogeneous on the subnational level as well. Furthermore, the question arises whether the morbidity trends or the mortality trends are the decisive drivers of the care need-free life years (CFLY), the life years with care need (CLY), and, ultimately, the health scenarios. METHODS: This study uses administrative census data of all beneficiaries in Germany from the Statutory Long-Term Care Insurance 2001-2009. We compute the CFLY and CLY at age 65+ for 412 counties. The CFLY and CLY gains are decomposed into the effects of survival and of the prevalence of care need, and we investigate their linkages with the health scenarios by applying multinomial regression models. RESULTS: We show an overall increase in CFLY, which is higher for men than for women and higher for severe than for any care need. However, spatial variation in CFLY and in CLY has increased. In terms of the health scenarios, a majority of counties show an expansion of any care need but a compression of severe care need. There is high spatial heterogeneity, with expansion-counties surrounding compression-counties and vice versa, which is mainly caused by divergent trends in the prevalence of care need. We show that mortality is responsible for the absolute changes in CFLY and CLY, while morbidity is the decisive driver that determines the health scenario of a county. CONCLUSION: Combining regionalized administrative data and advanced statistical methods permits a deeper insight into the complex relationship between health and mortality. Our findings demonstrate a compression of life years with severe care need, which however, depends on the region of residence. To attenuate regional inequalities, more efforts are needed that improve health by medical and infrastructural interventions and by the exchange of insights in the efficiency of small- and large-area policy measures between the vanguard and the rearguard counties. In future research, the underlying latent mechanisms should be investigated in more detail.
27708577	Neuroanatomical Alterations in Tinnitus Assessed with Magnetic Resonance Imaging.	Previous studies of anatomical changes associated with tinnitus have provided inconsistent results, with some showing significant cortical and subcortical changes, while others have found effects due to hearing loss, but not tinnitus. In this study, we examined changes in brain anatomy associated with tinnitus using anatomical scans from 128 participants with tinnitus and hearing loss, tinnitus with clinically normal hearing, and non-tinnitus controls with clinically normal hearing. The groups were matched for hearing loss, age and gender. We employed voxel- and surface-based morphometry (SBM) to investigate gray and white matter volume and thickness within regions-of-interest (ROI) that were based on the results of previous studies. The largest overall effects were found for age, gender, and hearing loss. With regard to tinnitus, analysis of ROI revealed numerous small increases and decreases in gray matter and thickness between tinnitus and non-tinnitus controls, in both cortical and subcortical structures. For whole brain analysis, the main tinnitus-related significant clusters were found outside sensory auditory structures. These include a decrease in cortical thickness for the tinnitus group compared to controls in the left superior frontal gyrus (SFG), and a decrease in cortical volume with hearing loss in left Heschl's gyrus (HG). For masked analysis, we found a decrease in gray matter volume in the right Heschle's gyrus for the tinnitus group compared to the controls. We found no changes in the subcallosal region as reported in some previous studies. Overall, while some of the morphological differences observed in this study are similar to previously published findings, others are entirely different or even contradict previous results. We highlight other discrepancies among previous results and the increasing need for a more precise subtyping of the condition.
27239262	Structure and function of the telomeric CST complex.	Telomeres comprise the ends of eukaryotic chromosomes and are essential for cell proliferation and genome maintenance. Telomeres are replicated by telomerase, a ribonucleoprotein (RNP) reverse transcriptase, and are maintained primarily by nucleoprotein complexes such as shelterin (TRF1, TRF2, TIN2, RAP1, POT1, TPP1) and CST (Cdc13/Ctc1, Stn1, Ten1). The focus of this review is on the CST complex and its role in telomere maintenance. Although initially thought to be unique to yeast, it is now evident that the CST complex is present in a diverse range of organisms where it contributes to genome maintenance. The CST accomplishes these tasks via telomere capping and by regulating telomerase and DNA polymerase alpha-primase (polalpha-primase) access to telomeres, a process closely coordinated with the shelterin complex in most organisms. The goal of this review is to provide a brief but comprehensive account of the diverse, and in some cases organism-dependent, functions of the CST complex and how it contributes to telomere maintenance and cell proliferation.
26903953	Susceptibility of Austrian Clinical Klebsiella and Enterobacter Isolates Linked to Patient-Related Data.	The aim of the study was to analyze the antimicrobial susceptibility of Austrian clinical Klebsiella sp. and Enterobacter sp. isolates linked to patient-related data over a time period from 1998 to 2014. The main findings of this study were (i) a marked difference of antibiotic susceptibility rates between different infection sites for both Klebsiella sp. and Enterobacter sp., (ii) significantly greater percentages of resistant isolates among both Klebsiella sp. and Enterobacter sp. in male patients compared to female patients and (iii) significantly greater percentages of resistant isolates among both Klebsiella sp. and Enterobacter sp. from hospital-derived samples compared to samples from the community. In conclusion, our statistical data analysis clearly indicated a strong association of patient-related data and Klebsiella sp. and Enterobacter sp. susceptibility profiles.
28030621	HIV Clinical Pathway: A New Approach to Combine Guidelines and Sustainability of Anti-Retroviral Treatment in Italy.	The present article describes the case study of a "real world" HIV practice within the debate concerning the strategic role of Clinical Governance (CG) tools in the management of a National Healthcare System's sustainability. The study aimed at assessing the impact of a Clinical Pathway (CP) implementation, required by the Regional Healthcare Service, in terms of effectiveness (virological and immunological conditions) and efficiency (economic resources absorption), from the budget holder perspective. Data derived from a multi-centre cohort of patients treated in 6 Hospitals that provided care to approximately 42% of the total HIV+ patients, in Lombardy Region, Italy. Two phases were compared: Pre-CP (2009-2010) vs. Post-CP implementation (2011-2012). All HIV infected adults, observed in the participating hospitals during the study periods, were enrolled and stratified into the 3 categories defined by the Regional CP: first-line, switch for toxicity/other, and switch for failure. The study population was composed of 1,284 patients (Pre-CP phase) and 1,135 patients (Post-CP phase). The results showed that the same level of virological and immunological effectiveness was guaranteed to HIV+ patients: 81.2% of Pre-CP phase population and 83.2% of Post-CP phase population had undetectable HIV-RNA (defined as <50 copies/mL) at 12-month follow up. CD4+ cell counts increased by 28 +/- 4 cells/mm3 in Pre-CP Phase and 39 +/- 5 cells/mm3 in Post-CP Phase. From an economic point of view, the CP implementation led to a substantial advantage: the mean total costs related to the management of the HIV disease (ART, hospital admission and laboratory tests) decreased (-8.60%) in the Post-CP phase (p-value < 0.0001). Results confirmed that the CP provided appropriateness and quality of care, with a cost reduction for the budget holder.
26933676	Four billion people facing severe water scarcity.	Freshwater scarcity is increasingly perceived as a global systemic risk. Previous global water scarcity assessments, measuring water scarcity annually, have underestimated experienced water scarcity by failing to capture the seasonal fluctuations in water consumption and availability. We assess blue water scarcity globally at a high spatial resolution on a monthly basis. We find that two-thirds of the global population (4.0 billion people) live under conditions of severe water scarcity at least 1 month of the year. Nearly half of those people live in India and China. Half a billion people in the world face severe water scarcity all year round. Putting caps to water consumption by river basin, increasing water-use efficiencies, and better sharing of the limited freshwater resources will be key in reducing the threat posed by water scarcity on biodiversity and human welfare.
26891639	Walking with a four wheeled walker (rollator) significantly reduces EMG lower-limb muscle activity in healthy subjects.	OBJECTIVE: To investigate the immediate effect of four-wheeled- walker(rollator)walking on lower-limb muscle activity and trunk-sway in healthy subjects. METHODS: In this cross-sectional design electromyographic (EMG) data was collected in six lower-limb muscle groups and trunk-sway was measured as peak-to-peak angular displacement of the centre-of-mass (level L2/3) in the sagittal and frontal-planes using the SwayStar balance system. 19 subjects walked at self-selected speed firstly without a rollator then in randomised order 1. with rollator 2. with rollator with increased weight-bearing. RESULTS: Rollator-walking caused statistically significant reductions in EMG activity in lower-limb muscle groups and effect-sizes were medium to large. Increased weight-bearing increased the effect. Trunk-sway in the sagittal and frontal-planes showed no statistically significant difference between conditions. CONCLUSION: Rollator-walking reduces lower-limb muscle activity but trunk-sway remains unchanged as stability is likely gained through forces generated by the upper-limbs. Short-term stability is gained but the long-term effect is unclear and requires investigation.
27477652	Synthesis and Biological Evaluation of 1-(2-Aminophenyl)-3-arylurea Derivatives as Potential EphA2 and HDAC Dual Inhibitors.	A series of 1-(2-aminophenyl)-3-arylurea novel derivatives were synthesized and evaluated against Ephrin type-A receptor 2 (EphA2) and histone deacetylases (HDACs) kinase. Most of the compounds exhibited inhibitory activity against EphA2 and HDAC. The antiproliferative activities were evaluated by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) (thiazolyl blue, tetrazolium blue) against the human cancer cell lines HCT116, K562 and MCF7. Compounds 5a and b showed the most potent inhibitory activity against EphA2 and HDAC. However, compound 5b exhibited higher potency against HCT116 (IC50=5.29 microM) and MCF7 (IC50=7.42 microM). 1-(2-Aminophenyl)-3-arylurea analogues may serve as new EphA2-HDAC dual inhibitors.
26931436	Flow Cytometric Evaluation of Double/Triple Hit Lymphoma.	"Double" or "triple" hit lymphomas (D/THL) with recurrent translocations involving MYC/8q24 and BCL2/18q21 and/or BCL6/3q27 are characterized by a poor prognosis, but their identification is hampered by the clinicopathologic overlap with other disease categories. Cases with circulating blastic-appearing cells may initially cause concern for lymphoblastic leukemia a diagnostic dilemma, which has not been well studied. There is only limited literature regarding the flow cytometric (FC) D/THL phenotype and its clinical correlates. The FC features of 20 D/THL (11 BCL2(+)/MYC(+), 5 BCL6(+)/MYC(+), 4 BCL2(+)/BCL6(+)/MYC(+)) were evaluated, compared to 20 B-lymphoblastic leukemias (B-LBL), and correlated with overall survival. Most (89%, 17/19) D/THL were CD10(+), 47% (9/19) lacked surface light chain, and a significant subset underexpressed CD45 (47%, 9/19), CD20 (42% 8/19), and/or CD19 (39%, 7/18), which did not vary by genetic subgroup. Compared to B-LBL, D/THL less frequently underexpressed CD45 (p = 0.0001) and CD20 (p = 0.0004). Lower levels of BCL2 expression were noted in the BCL6(+)/MYC(+) and BCL2(+)/BCL6(+)/MYC(+) subgroups versus BCL2(+)/MYC(+) cases (p = 0.0014). Of the flow cytometric parameters assessed, dim CD45 expression correlated with inferior survival (p = 0.01). Although there is some overlap with B-LBL, D/THL demonstrates a characteristic immunophenotype which may have prognostic significance and warrants further investigation.
27051556	Effect of Various Sugary Beverages on Salivary pH, Flow Rate, and Oral Clearance Rate amongst Adults.	Introduction. Diet is a major aetiological factor for dental caries and enamel erosion. This study was undertaken with the aim of assessing the effect of selected locally available beverages on salivary pH, flow rate, and oral clearance rate amongst adults. Materials and Method. This clinical trial comprised 120 subjects. Test beverages undertaken were pepsi, fruit drink, coffee, and sweetened milk. Statistical analysis was carried out using SPSS version 17. Descriptive statistics, one-way ANOVA, and post hoc Tukey's test were applied in the statistical tests. Results. It was found that salivary pH decreased for all the beverages immediately after consumption and the salivary flow rate increased after their consumption. The oral clearance rate of sweetened milk was found to be the least at 6.5 minutes and that of pepsi was found to be 13 minutes. However, the oral clearance rates of fruit drink and coffee were found to be equal at 15 minutes. Conclusion. Although it was found out that liquids cleared rapidly from the oral cavity, they had a significant cariogenic and erosive potential. Hence, it is always advised to minimise the consumption of beverages, especially amongst children and young adults to maintain a good oral health.
27936014	Inhibition of Interleukin-6 Receptor in a Murine Model of Myocardial Ischemia-Reperfusion.	BACKGROUND: Interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels are upregulated in myocardial infarction. Recent data suggest a causal role of the IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) in coronary heart disease. We evaluated if IL-6R blockade by a monoclonal antibody (MR16-1) prevents the heart from adverse left ventricular remodeling in a mouse model of ischemia-reperfusion (I/R). METHODS: CJ57/BL6 mice underwent I/R injury (left coronary artery ligation for 45 minutes) or sham surgery, and thereafter received MR16-1 (2mg/mouse) 5 minutes before reperfusion and 0.5mg/mouse weekly during four weeks, or control IgG treatment. Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging (CMR) and hemodynamic measurements were performed to determine cardiac function after four weeks. RESULTS: I/R caused left ventricular dilatation and a decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). However, LVEF was significantly lower in the MR16-1 treatment group compared to the IgG group (28+/-4% vs. 35+/-6%, p = 0.02; sham 45+/-6% vs. 43+/-4%, respectively; p = NS). Cardiac relaxation (assessed by dP/dT) was not significantly different between the MR16-1 and IgG groups. Also, no differences were observed in histological myocardial fibrosis, infarct size and myocyte hypertrophy between the groups. CONCLUSION: Blockade of the IL-6R receptor by the monoclonal MR16-1 antibody for four weeks started directly after I/R injury did not prevent the process of cardiac remodeling in mice, but rather associated with a deterioration in the process of adverse cardiac remodeling.
27069353	Robust Sliding Mode Control Based on GA Optimization and CMAC Compensation for Lower Limb Exoskeleton.	A lower limb assistive exoskeleton is designed to help operators walk or carry payloads. The exoskeleton is required to shadow human motion intent accurately and compliantly to prevent incoordination. If the user's intention is estimated accurately, a precise position control strategy will improve collaboration between the user and the exoskeleton. In this paper, a hybrid position control scheme, combining sliding mode control (SMC) with a cerebellar model articulation controller (CMAC) neural network, is proposed to control the exoskeleton to react appropriately to human motion intent. A genetic algorithm (GA) is utilized to determine the optimal sliding surface and the sliding control law to improve performance of SMC. The proposed control strategy (SMC_GA_CMAC) is compared with three other types of approaches, that is, conventional SMC without optimization, optimal SMC with GA (SMC_GA), and SMC with CMAC compensation (SMC_CMAC), all of which are employed to track the desired joint angular position which is deduced from Clinical Gait Analysis (CGA) data. Position tracking performance is investigated with cosimulation using ADAMS and MATLAB/SIMULINK in two cases, of which the first case is without disturbances while the second case is with a bounded disturbance. The cosimulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy which can be employed in similar exoskeleton systems.
27488911	An automated method measures variability in P-glycoprotein and ABCG2 densities across brain regions and brain matter.	Changes in P-glycoprotein and ABCG2 densities may play a role in amyloid-beta accumulation in Alzheimer's disease. However, previous studies report conflicting results from different brain regions, without correcting for changes in vessel density. We developed an automated method to measure transporter density exclusively within the vascular space, thereby correcting for vessel density. We then examined variability in transporter density across brain regions, matter, and disease using two cohorts of post-mortem brains from Alzheimer's disease patients and age-matched controls. Changes in transporter density were also investigated in capillaries near plaques and on the mRNA level. P-glycoprotein density varied with brain region and matter, whereas ABCG2 density varied with brain matter. In temporal cortex, P-glycoprotein density was 53% lower in Alzheimer's disease samples than in controls, and was reduced by 35% in capillaries near plaque deposits within Alzheimer's disease samples. ABCG2 density was unaffected in Alzheimer's disease. No differences were detected at the transcript level. Our study indicates that region-specific changes in transporter densities can occur globally and locally near amyloid-beta deposits in Alzheimer's disease, providing an explanation for conflicting results in the literature. When differences in region and matter are accounted for, changes in density can be reproducibly measured using our automated method.
26883554	Effects of dietary supplementation of pioglitazone on metabolism, milk yield, and reproductive performance in transition dairy cows.	The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of dietary supplementation of pioglitazone (PGT), a specific ligand for PPARgamma, on metabolic dynamics, milk production, and reproductive performance of transition dairy cows. Eighty multiparous Holstein cows in their second or more lactations were blocked by the calving date and parity and assigned randomly to four dietary groups (n = 20 cow/treatment) including control (no PGT-/-), supplemented with PGT (6-mg PGT/kg body weight) from Day -14 to +21 relative to parturition (PGT+/+) or only during prepartum (PGT+/-) or postpartum periods (PGT-/+). Postpartum body condition score and body weight loss decreased (P < 0.05) in all PGT-supplemented groups. Milk yield was not affected by PGT supplementation (P > 0.05). Percentage of milk fat decreased (P < 0.05) in all PGT-treated groups; however, milk fat yield was lower (P < 0.05) in PGT (+/+) and PGT (+/-) groups compared with PGT (-/-). Peripartum (Day -7 to +7) concentrations of plasma nonesterified fatty acids and beta-Hydroxybutyrate decreased in PGT (+/+) but not in the PGT (-/-) group (P < 0.05). During the postpartum period, PGT reduced (P > 0.05) plasma concentrations of nonesterified fatty acids in all PGT-treated groups but did not affect beta-Hydroxybutyrate level. Plasma concentrations of triglycerides decreased in all PGT-supplemented groups. Supplementation of PGT increased the peripartum concentrations of plasma glucose in PGT (+/+) and PGT (+/-) groups compared with control. Plasma concentrations of insulin-like growth factor 1 were higher in PGT (+/+) compared with the control group during both the peripartum and postpartum periods. Plasma concentrations of growth hormone and insulin were not affected by PGT treatment (P > 0.05). Mean days to ovulation were lower in PGT (+/+) and PGT (-/+), and the proportion of cows ovulating by Day 14 postpartum was higher in PGT (+/+) compared with control. Days open were shorter in PGT (+/+), PGT (+/-), and PGT (-/+) groups compared with control. However, the proportion of pregnant cows at 120 days in milk were higher in all PGT-supplemented groups. The results showed positive effects of dietary supplementation of PGT, especially supplementation during both the prepartum and postpartum periods, on metabolic dynamics, ovarian function, and reproductive performance in transition dairy cows.

26880452	Impact of acute kidney injury on distant organ function: recent findings and potential therapeutic targets.	Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common complication in critically ill patients and subsequently worsens outcomes. Although many drugs to prevent and treat AKI have shown benefits in preclinical models, no specific agent has been shown to benefit AKI in humans. Moreover, despite remarkable advances in dialysis techniques that enable management of AKI in hemodynamically unstable patients with shock, dialysis-requiring severe AKI is still associated with an unacceptably high mortality rate. Thus, focusing only on kidney damage and loss of renal function has not been sufficient to improve outcomes of patients with AKI. Recent data from basic and clinical research have begun to elucidate complex organ interactions in AKI between kidney and distant organs, including heart, lung, spleen, brain, liver, and gut. This review serves to update the topic of organ cross talk in AKI and focuses on potential therapeutic targets to improve patient outcomes during AKI-associated multiple organ failure.
27976755	Erratum to: Methods and processes for development of a CONSORT extension for reporting pilot randomized controlled trials.	[This corrects the article DOI: 10.1186/s40814-016-0065-z.].
27679579	Calcium-Sensing Receptor Gene: Regulation of Expression.	The human calcium-sensing receptor gene (CASR) has 8 exons, and localizes to chromosome 3q. Exons 1A and 1B encode alternative 5'-untranslated regions (UTRs) that splice to exon 2 encoding the AUG initiation codon. Exons 2-7 encode the CaSR protein of 1078 amino acids. Promoter P1 has TATA and CCAAT boxes upstream of exon 1A, and promoter P2 has Sp1/3 motifs at the start site of exon 1B. Exon 1A transcripts from the P1 promoter are reduced in parathyroid tumors and colon carcinomas. Studies of colon carcinomas and neuroblastomas have emphasized the importance of epigenetic changes-promoter methylation of the GC-rich P2 promoter, histone acetylation-as well as involvement of microRNAs in bringing about CASR gene silencing and reduced CaSR expression. Functional cis-elements in the CASR promoters responsive to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25(OH)2D], proinflammatory cytokines, and the transcription factor glial cells missing-2 (GCM2) have been characterized. Reduced levels of CaSR and reduced responsiveness to active vitamin D in parathyroid neoplasia and colon carcinoma may blunt the "tumor suppressor" activity of the CaSR. The hypocalcemia of critically ill patients with burn injury or sepsis is associated with CASR gene upregulation by TNF-alpha and IL-1beta via kappaB elements, and by IL-6 via Stat1/3 and Sp1/3 elements in the CASR gene promoters, respectively. The CASR is transactivated by GCM2-the expression of which is essential for parathyroid gland development. Hyperactive forms of GCM2 may contribute to later parathyroid hyperactivity or tumorigenesis. The expression of the CaSR-the calciostat-is regulated physiologically and pathophysiologically at the gene level.
27499753	Cold Shock Proteins: A Minireview with Special Emphasis on Csp-family of Enteropathogenic Yersinia.	Bacteria have evolved a number of mechanisms for coping with stress and adapting to changing environmental conditions. Many bacteria produce small cold shock proteins (Csp) as a response to rapid temperature downshift (cold shock). During cold shock, the cell membrane fluidity and enzyme activity decrease, and the efficiency of transcription and translation is reduced due to stabilization of nucleic acid secondary structures. Moreover, protein folding is inefficient and ribosome function is hampered. Csps are thought to counteract these harmful effects by serving as nucleic acid chaperons that may prevent the formation of secondary structures in mRNA at low temperature and thus facilitate the initiation of translation. However, some Csps are non-cold inducible and they are reported to be involved in various cellular processes to promote normal growth and stress adaptation responses. Csps have been shown to contribute to osmotic, oxidative, starvation, pH and ethanol stress tolerance as well as to host cell invasion. Therefore, Csps seem to have a wider role in stress tolerance of bacteria than previously assumed. Yersinia enterocolitica and Yersinia pseudotuberculosis are enteropathogens that can spread through foodstuffs and cause an enteric infection called yersiniosis. Enteropathogenic Yersinia are psychrotrophs that are able to grow at temperatures close to 0 degrees C and thus they set great challenges for the modern food industry. To be able to efficiently control psychrotrophic Yersinia during food production and storage, it is essential to understand the functions and roles of Csps in stress response of enteropathogenic Yersinia.
27118984	"When you give birth you will not be without your mother" A mixed methods study of advice on breastfeeding for first-time mothers in rural coastal Kenya.	BACKGROUND: Exclusive breastfeeding for the first 6 months of life is currently recommended by the World Health Organization, but mixed feeding earlier than this commonly occurs in rural coastal Kenya. Mothers may receive conflicting advice on breastfeeding from various sources including health workers, relatives and community members. We aimed to find out how first-time mothers learn to breastfeed, who advises them on infant feeding and what advice they obtain in case of any breastfeeding problems. METHODS: To identify advisers, a questionnaire on socio-demographic status, place of delivery, household members, education and help received on breastfeeding, breastfeeding problems, name of advisers and their relationship to the mothers was administered to 50 new first-time mothers in Jaribuni, Kilifi (population approximately 18,000). Summary statistics were obtained using frequencies, medians and interquartile ranges (IQR). Focus group discussions (FGDs) were held amongst 4 groups of mothers who had answered questionnaires; 4 groups of their named advisers; and 1 group of community health workers in order to explore breastfeeding practices, problems and advice given. FGDs were analysed by thematic framework analysis. RESULTS: First-time mothers were young (median age 18, IQR 17-21, range 14-26 years) and 42 % were single. Living in extended families was the norm and married women lived with their husband's family. All had a female family member or neighbour helping with childcare in the perinatal period. The main advisers on breastfeeding were their mother or older female members of their husband's family. Married first-time mothers felt obliged to follow their mother-in-law's advice to maintain good relationships and show respect within the household. Breastfeeding problems were reported by 80 % of respondents. Nipple pain (56 %) was the most reported problem, then breast engorgement (48 %) and insufficient milk supply (38 %). Most problems were treated at home without consultation with health workers. Concerns were raised about co-sleeping, breastfeeding whilst lying down, and insufficient milk supply. Advisers would like more information on breastfeeding in order to help mothers. CONCLUSIONS: Interventions to increase knowledge of, and facilitate optimal breastfeeding practices in first-time mothers should include those family members who advise and assist with childcare around the time of delivery.
26956229	Revascularization vs. Optimal Medical Therapy in Women with NSTE-ACS.	BACKGROUND: There is conflicting evidence regarding the benefit of an early invasive strategy vs. a conservative strategy in women with non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTE-ACS). METHODS: We searched English-language studies on MEDLINE and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews from 2000 to December 2015. Results from major available studies and meta-analysis comparing outcomes of an early invasive strategy vs. a conservative strategy or medical therapy vs. revascularization in women with NSTE-ACS were considered. RESULTS: Available data on the comparative effectiveness and safety of different management strategies in NSTE-ACS women derive from observational registries and pre-specified gender sub-analyses of randomized trials comparing early routine invasive with a selective invasive strategy. While some post-hoc analysis of randomized trials showed that an early invasive strategy did not reduce the risk of future events among women, in contrast to its beneficial effect in men, others showed similar benefits of a routine early invasive vs. a conservative strategy in men and women. Several important differences between these trials may explain the lack of benefits from a routine invasive strategy compared with a conservative strategy. Overall evidence showed better outcomes with a routine invasive strategy, especially for women at higher risk and those with positive biomarkers. Differently, women with negative biomarkers and those at lower risk appeared to benefit most from a conservative approach. CONCLUSION: The benefit of an early invasive strategy is restricted to women at higher risk. Further research is warranted to define the optimal management of women with NSTE-ACS.
26964095	A Comparative Assessment of the Influences of Human Impacts on Soil Cd Concentrations Based on Stepwise Linear Regression, Classification and Regression Tree, and Random Forest Models.	Soil cadmium (Cd) contamination has attracted a great deal of attention because of its detrimental effects on animals and humans. This study aimed to develop and compare the performances of stepwise linear regression (SLR), classification and regression tree (CART) and random forest (RF) models in the prediction and mapping of the spatial distribution of soil Cd and to identify likely sources of Cd accumulation in Fuyang County, eastern China. Soil Cd data from 276 topsoil (0-20 cm) samples were collected and randomly divided into calibration (222 samples) and validation datasets (54 samples). Auxiliary data, including detailed land use information, soil organic matter, soil pH, and topographic data, were incorporated into the models to simulate the soil Cd concentrations and further identify the main factors influencing soil Cd variation. The predictive models for soil Cd concentration exhibited acceptable overall accuracies (72.22% for SLR, 70.37% for CART, and 75.93% for RF). The SLR model exhibited the largest predicted deviation, with a mean error (ME) of 0.074 mg/kg, a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.160 mg/kg, and a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 0.274 mg/kg, and the RF model produced the results closest to the observed values, with an ME of 0.002 mg/kg, an MAE of 0.132 mg/kg, and an RMSE of 0.198 mg/kg. The RF model also exhibited the greatest R2 value (0.772). The CART model predictions closely followed, with ME, MAE, RMSE, and R2 values of 0.013 mg/kg, 0.154 mg/kg, 0.230 mg/kg and 0.644, respectively. The three prediction maps generally exhibited similar and realistic spatial patterns of soil Cd contamination. The heavily Cd-affected areas were primarily located in the alluvial valley plain of the Fuchun River and its tributaries because of the dramatic industrialization and urbanization processes that have occurred there. The most important variable for explaining high levels of soil Cd accumulation was the presence of metal smelting industries. The good performance of the RF model was attributable to its ability to handle the non-linear and hierarchical relationships between soil Cd and environmental variables. These results confirm that the RF approach is promising for the prediction and spatial distribution mapping of soil Cd at the regional scale.
27243024	Detection of Pulpal Blood Flow In Vivo with Pulse Oximetry in Dogs.	OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to investigate the ability of pulse oximetry to detect blood flow within the canine tooth of dogs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Dogs aged 18-138 months presenting for oral treatment and meeting the inclusion criteria underwent pulse oximetry evaluation of at least one canine tooth. Oxygen saturation (SpO2) and pulse rate values were acquired from vital canine teeth of 38 clinical patients (representing 40 total teeth) with a handheld pulse oximeter and compared to a control area. SpO2 values from the tooth and control area were recorded every 5 s for three 60-s intervals. The sensors were repositioned after each 60-s interval. RESULTS: The vital teeth consistently recorded SpO2 values significantly lower than the control area. The mean vital tooth SpO2 was 85.9% (median = 87%; SD = 8.6), and the mean control area SpO2 was 97.7% (median = 98%; SD = 1.8). An age-related significant difference was noted in vital tooth SpO2 values. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, the present data support the possible use of pulse oximetry to detect blood flow in canine teeth. However, there was no significant correlation between SpO2 values in the vital tooth and in the control areas. Additionally, the results were not definitive, and validation of the modality with additional studies of non-vital canine teeth is needed before clinical use can be recommended.
27936013	beta-Asarone Rescues Pb-Induced Impairments of Spatial Memory and Synaptogenesis in Rats.	Chronic lead (Pb) exposure causes cognitive deficits. This study aimed to explore the neuroprotective effect and mechanism of beta-asarone, an active component from Chinese Herbs Acorus tatarinowii Schott, to alleviate impairments of spatial memory and synaptogenesis in Pb-exposed rats. Both Sprague-Dawley developmental rat pups and adult rats were used in the study. Developmental rat pups were exposed to Pb throughout the lactation period and beta-asarone (10, 40mg kg-1, respectively) was given intraperitoneally from postnatal day 14 to 21. Also, the adult rats were exposed to Pb from embryo stage to 11 weeks old and beta-asarone (2.5, 10, 40mg kg-1, respectively) was given from 9 to 11 weeks old. The level of beta-asarone in brain tissue was measured by High Performance Liquid Chromatography. The Morris water maze test and Golgi-Cox staining method were used to assess spatial memory ability and synaptogenesis. The protein expression of NR2B subunit of NMDA receptor, Activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein (Arc/Arg3.1) and Wnt family member 7A (Wnt7a) in hippocampus, as well as mRNA expression of Arc/Arg3.1 and Wnt7a, was also explored. We found that beta-asarone could pass through the blood brain barrier quickly. And beta-asarone effectively attenuated Pb-induced reduction of spine density in hippocampal CA1 and dentate gyrus areas in a dose-dependent manner both in developmental and adult rats, meanwhile the Pb-induced impairments of learning and memory were partially rescued. In addition, beta-asarone effectively up-regulated the protein expression of NR2B, Arc and Wnt7a, as well as the mRNA levels of Arc/Arg3.1 and Wnt7a, which had been suppressed by Pb exposure. The results suggest the neuroprotective properties of beta-asarone against Pb-induced memory impairments, and the effect is possibly through the regulation of synaptogenesis, which is mediated via Arc/Arg3.1 and Wnt pathway.
27070652	Does Poor Quality Schooling and/or Teacher Quality Hurt Black South African Students Enrolling for a Degree at the University of KwaZulu-Natal?	UNLABELLED: Wealthy schools appoint better qualified teachers, less wealthy schools under qualified teachers. Added to this mix is a powerful teacher's union whose policies attempt to entrench the job security of teachers in the less wealthy schools irrespective of whether they can teach their subjects or not. Can one isolate these effects from that of other socio-demographic factors that may also be affecting the performance of students when they enrol for a degree at the University of KwaZulu-Natal (UKZN)? An outcome variable that subtracts the number of courses that have been failed from the number of courses that have been passed, dividing this by the total number of years that they have spent studying for a particular degree will be used as a response variable for this paper. OBJECTIVES: The system of secondary education in South Africa is highly polarized. On the one hand, we have a group of mainly Black African students, forming about 80% of the total student population, that come from a vastly under-resourced rural or township based community. On the other hand, we have a group of predominantly White and Indian students who are able to attend a far better resourced set of private schools. Added to this mix, we have 240,000 of South Africa's total number of 390,000 primary and secondary school teachers who belong to a powerful teacher's union which enjoys a strong political alliance with the ruling party in South Africa. With most of their union members teaching in the less wealthy schools in South Africa, `school background' now includes a politically motivated component that focuses on teacher self-interest rather than the education of the child. What sort of effect does school background have on the performance of students when they enter an institution of higher learning? More importantly, can one isolate the effect of school background from that of other possibly confounding factors such as gender, financial aid and the receipt of some form of residence based accommodation that will also impact on their performance while at university? METHOD: A total of 6,183 students enrolling for a degree at the University of KwaZulu-Natal (UKZN) over the period 2008 to 2012 were used a dataset for this study. Permission to use this dataset was given by the Teaching and Learning Office at UKZN. The database that was used for this study was obtained from the Division of Management Information (DMI) office at UKZN. The percentage based marks that students have managed to record for Mathematics, English, Biology and Accounting in their school leaving exams together with some other important but observable socio-economic factors were included in a regression model to determine how students will perform at UKZN. Socio-economic variables relating to gender, race and whether they have receivd some form of financial aid or residence based accommodation while studying at university were also included as predictor variables in our regression based model structure. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: An interaction effect associated with being a Black African student who has been privileged enough to attend a quintile five school was found to be significant. A main effect associated with being able to attend a more privileged quintile 5 school however was found to be nonsignificant even after an adjustment has been made for gender, race, the receipt of some form of financial aid and residence based accommodation. Given that UKZN already has a number of bridging programs in place that target students who have come from a less privileged background, for university based policymakers, this result may help to justify the targeted selection of Black African students from the less privileged schools that is taking place. Because some of the disparity in matric performance that we are observing may also be associated with teacher competency and the protective influence of a powerful teacher's union, this paper may also help to highlight some of the economic costs related with having under-prepared students.

27473902	A FRET-based method for monitoring septin polymerization and binding of septin-associated proteins.	Much about septin function has been inferred from in vivo studies using mainly genetic methods, and much of what we know about septin organization has been obtained through examination of static structures in vitro primarily by electron microscopy. Deeper mechanistic insight requires real-time analysis of the dynamics of the assembly of septin-based structures and how other proteins associate with them. We describe here a Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based approach for measuring in vitro the rate and extent of filament formation from septin complexes, binding of other proteins to septin structures, and the apparent affinities of these interactions. FRET is particularly well suited for interrogating protein-protein interactions, especially on a rapid timescale; the spectral change provides an unambiguous indication of whether two elements within the system under study are associating and serves as a molecular-level "ruler" because it is very sensitive to the separation between the donor and acceptor fluorophores over biologically relevant distances (</=10nm). The necessary procedures involve generation of appropriate cysteine-less and single cysteine-containing septin variants, expression and purification of the heterooctameric complexes containing them, efficient labeling of the purified complexes with desired fluorophores, fluorimetric measurement of FRET, and appropriate safeguards and controls in data acquisition and analysis. Our methods can be used to interrogate the effects of buffer conditions, small molecules, and septin-binding proteins on septin filament assembly or stability; determine the effect of alternative septin subunits, mutational alterations, or posttranslational modifications on assembly; and, delineate the location of septin-binding proteins.
26886629	Cutaneous and Subcutaneous Metastases From Atypical Laryngeal Carcinoids: Case Report and Review of the Literature.	The incidence of cutaneous and subcutaneous metastases from atypical laryngeal carcinoids is approximately 20%. However, the pathogenesis and natural history of, and prognostic factors for, the condition remain poorly understood. We reported a 54-year-old female presented with cutaneous and subcutaneous metastases from atypical laryngeal carcinoid. Laryngoscopy revealed a 0.5 x 1.5-cm reddish mass on the laryngeal surface of the epiglottis. Under general anesthesia, a biopsy sample was obtained via suspension laryngoscopy. Routine pathology revealed atypical laryngeal carcinoid. Immunohistochemical staining of the sections of primary tumor was positive for cytokeratin, chromogranin A, synaptophysin, hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha, P53, and CD56. GLUT-1, p-Akt, and PI3K were negative. The Ki-67 index was 15%. Supraglottic laryngectomy and selective right-neck dissection were performed. After 6 months, the patient complained of pain in the right wall of the chest; multiple cutaneous and subcutaneous nodules were evident at that site and in the abdomen. An abdominal nodule was biopsied and pathology revealed that the atypical metastatic carcinoid had metastasized to both cutaneous and subcutaneous areas of the abdomen. Chemotherapy was then prescribed. Currently, the intrathecal drug delivery system remains in place. No local recurrence has been detected. Furthermore, we systematically reviewed clinical manifestations of the disease, pathogenesis, prognostic factors, and treatment. The metastasis rate (cutaneous and subcutaneous) was approximately 12.2%. Thirty patients (62.5%) with cutaneous and subcutaneous metastases exhibited contemporaneous lymph node invasion. The 3-, 5-, and 10-year survival rates were 44.0%, 22.0%, and 13.0%, respectively. The prognosis of patients with atypical laryngeal carcinoids was poor. Relevant prognostic factors included the level of p53, human papilloma virus status, certain hypoxic markers, and distant metastasis. No optimal treatment for such metastases has yet been defined.
26870072	Chloroplast DNA Copy Number Changes during Plant Development in Organelle DNA Polymerase Mutants.	Chloroplast genome copy number is very high in leaf tissue, with upwards of 10,000 or more copies of the chloroplast DNA (ctDNA) per leaf cell. This is often promoted as a major advantage for engineering the plastid genome, as it provides high gene copy number and thus is expected to result in high expression of foreign proteins from integrated genes. However, it is also known that ctDNA copy number and ctDNA integrity decrease as cells age. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) allows measurement of organelle DNA levels relative to a nuclear gene target. We have used this approach to determine changes in copy number of ctDNA relative to the nuclear genome at different ages of Arabidopsis plant growth and in organellar DNA polymerase mutants. The mutant plant lines have T-DNA insertions in genes encoding the two organelle localized DNA polymerases (PolIA and PolIB). Each of these mutant lines exhibits some delay in plant growth and development as compared to wild-type plants, with the PolIB plants having a more pronounced delay. Both mutant lines develop to maturity and produce viable seeds. Mutants for both proteins were observed to have a reduction in ctDNA and mtDNA copy number relative to wild type plants at all time points as measured by qPCR. Both DNA polymerase mutants had a fairly similar decrease in ctDNA copy number, while the PolIB mutant had a greater effect of reduction in mtDNA levels. However, despite similar decreases in genome copy number, RT-PCR analysis of PolIA mutants show that PolIB expression remains unchanged, suggesting that PolIA may not be essential to plant survival. Furthermore, genotypic analysis of plants from heterozygous parents display a strong pressure to maintain two functioning copies of PolIB. These results indicate that the two DNA polymerases are both important in ctDNA replication, and they are not fully redundant to each other, suggesting each has a specific function in plant organelles.
27546319	Review of the studies on nutrition in Polish preschool children. Part 1. Preschool menus.	UNLABELLED: The last review of the literature on nutrition in Polish children covered the years 1980-1995. From that time living conditions in Poland have changed due to political and economic changes. Attitudes toward eating and healthy life-style have also changed. Therefore, it is necessary to summarise current knowledge about what Polish preschool children eat. The aim of this article was to present the areas of research on nutrition in Polish preschool children based on the review of the literature, and to present and summarise the results of the studies on the assessment of preschool menus. The review of the literature showed two main areas of research on nutrition in Polish preschool children: the assessment of meals planned and served to children at preschools, and the assessment of food behaviour and daily food and nutrient intake in preschool children. Studies on energy and nutrient content of preschool menus should be carried out regularly in order to improve nutrition of children during their stay at preschool and vegetarian menus should be studied to fill the gap in the literature. The methodology of assessing preschool meals should be the same in order to provide the possibility to compare both the results and the conclusions. Preschool menus should be adjusted to the needs of 3-year-old children and 4-6-year-old children separately. The nation-wide education programme for preschool staff should be worked out and implemented in order to teach the preschool staff about the current nutrition recommendations for children, as well as the nutritional needs of 3-year-old children and 4-6-year-old children. KEY WORDS: preschool children, nutrition, preschool menus, energy content, nutrient content.
26927245	The effectiveness of laparoendoscopic single-site surgery (LESS) compared with conventional laparoscopic surgery for ectopic pregnancy with hemoperitoneum.	OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to compare clinical outcomes of conventional laparoscopic surgery and laparoendoscopic single-site surgery (LESS) in the surgical treatment of tubal ectopic pregnancy. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 156 patients were diagnosed with ectopic pregnancies by ultrasonography and serum beta-human chorionic gonadotrophin (beta-hCG) levels at Pusan National University Yangsan Hospital from January 2009 through December 2013. We excluded 28 patients who only received medical treatment, 15 patients who underwent surgery by laparotomy for severe hypovolemic shock, and 30 patients who presented with less than 1 L of hemoperitoneum. Of the 83 patients with massive hemoperitoneum, 38 patients had LESS performed while the remaining 45 patients underwent conventional laparoscopic surgery. RESULTS: In this study, there were no statistically significant differences in clinical outcomes in either surgical method except for operative time. Operative time of LESS was significantly shorter than conventional surgery for patients with more than 500 mL of hemoperitoneum. CONCLUSION: LESS is a safe and feasible surgical approach in the treatment of tubal ectopic pregnancy. At the same time, LESS has been shown to be more effective than conventional laparoscopic surgery in handling massive hemoperitoneum of more than 1 L, which is a common complication of ectopic pregnancy.
26950809	Age Related Prevalence of Pre-Eruptive Intracoronal Radiolucent Defects in the Permanent Dentition.	OBJECTIVE: The present study aimed to determine if the prevalence of pre-eruptive intracoronal radiolucent defects is higher for young age groups, in which there are more unerupted teeth. STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective study of panoramic and bitewing radiographs was conducted. An inclusion criterion was the presence of un-erupted permanent teeth with a formed and clearly visible crown. Age groups were: young (6-8 years), intermediate (9-12 years) and adults (13-53 years). Significance level was set at p</=0.05. RESULTS: Thirteen (3.9%) pre-eruptive lesions were detected in 335 records. No lesions were found in the young group (7.4%), in the intermediate and adult age groups six and seven lesions were found, respectively. In most cases the pre-eruptive lesion was found in a third molar. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of pre-eruptive intracoronal lesions was not higher for young age groups. The prevalence of pre-eruptive intra coronal radiolucent lesions is 3.9%, irrespective of age.
26873776	Perceived magnitude of visual displays: Area, numerosity, and mean size.	Previous studies have shown that the visual system is able to estimate properties such as area, numerosity, and mean size efficiently and accurately. In the current study, we investigated whether our percepts of each of them could be based on ratios of the other two of these three properties. In each trial, observers viewed a display containing various quantities of filled circles and judged whether the magnitude of a property of the display, such as summed area, numerosity, or average size of the circles, was greater or less than a corresponding probe display. We found that mean size judgments were more accurate and precise compared to the other judgments. We then predicted observers' performances for each task using the measured performance for the other judgments. The results showed that the other properties predicted perceived summed area, but not perceived mean size and numerosity. Together, our results suggest that the visual system does not use ratios to compute mean size and numerosity.
27306866	Child maltreatment and ADHD symptoms in a sample of young adults.	OBJECTIVE: The present study investigated the relationship between different types of childhood maltreatment (emotional, sexual, overall abuse, and no abuse) and the symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in young adulthood. METHOD: Data were collected from a Danish national study conducted by The Danish National Centre for Social Research in 2008 and 2009. A sample of 4,718 young adults (24 years of age) were randomly selected using the total birth cohort of children born in 1984. Structured interviews were conducted with a response rate of 63%, equating to a total sample size of 2,980 participants. RESULTS: Chi-square analyses revealed significant relationships between child maltreatment groups and a probable diagnosis of ADHD using the Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale (ASRS). Binary logistic regression analysis showed that the overall abuse class was more strongly associated with probable ADHD (OR=5.08), followed by emotional abuse (OR=3.09) and sexual abuse (OR=2.07). CONCLUSIONS: The results showed that childhood maltreatment was associated with increased risk of ADHD symptoms in young adulthood. The findings of this study are discussed within the existing literature and suggestions for future research are outlined in order to replicate these findings in other adult populations.
27330558	Correlates of conduct disorder among inmates of a Nigerian Borstal Institution.	BACKGROUND: Juvenile delinquency has become a significant global problem. Conduct disorder (CD), among other psychiatric disorders, has assumed prominence in its association with juvenile offending as well as criminality in adulthood. Despite this knowledge, little attention is given to this problem especially as it affects adjudicated adolescent offenders in developing countries. AIM: To examine the prevalence and correlates of CD among incarcerated adolescents in a Nigerian Borstal Institution and to investigate its independent predictors. METHODS: A cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted among 147 inmates of a Borstal Institution in Abeokuta, South Western Nigeria. A self-administered questionnaire and interviewer administered MINI-KID were used. The associations between conduct disorder and socio demographic as well as forensic variables were investigated using Chi square statistics while logistic regression was used to predict CD. RESULTS: Out of 147 respondents, 83 (56.5 %) met the criteria for CD with a mean age 17.1 +/- 1.1. Of the socio-demographic and forensic variables investigated, number of siblings (OR 4. 630; p = 0.010; 95 % CI 1.433-14.964) and previous history of incarceration (OR 4. 99; p = 0.043; 95 % CI 1.048-23.846) emerged as independent predictors of CD. CONCLUSIONS: This study recorded a high prevalence of conduct disorder among a sample of incarcerated juvenile offenders. The association of conduct disorder with large family size and recidivism highlights the need for comprehensive early interventions focused on improving parental supervision in large families as well as other re-training programs aimed at reducing juvenile re-offending.
27328491	The chemosensitizing effect of aqueous extract of sweet fennel on cisplatin treated HeLa cells.	BACKGROUND: Cisplatin is an important chemotherapeutic agent that is widely used in treatment of several malignancies, but its side effects on normal tissues and organs limit its use. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of aqueous extract of sweet fennel alone and in combination with cisplatin on human cervical cancer adenocarcinoma cell line (HeLa cells) searching for an effective, inexpensive therapy with minimal side effects. MATERIALS AND METHODS: HeLa cell line was used to study the cytotoxic effect of different concentrations of the aqueous extract of sweet fennel alone and in combination with 50 mug/ml cisplatin. Quantitative measure of drug interaction was quantified by the combination index. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) were used to analyze the sweet fennel decoction. MTT assay was used to examine cell viability percentage. Electron microscopy was applied to study the ultrastructure of the cells. RESULTS: The phenyl propanoids (23%) and phenols (12%) constituted the highest percentage of the aqueous extract. Increasing the concentration of sweet fennel from 50 mug/ml to 80 mug/ml, decreased the percentage of the cell viability of HeLa cells from 86.74% to 78.28%, respectively. Further decrease to 11.31% was demonstrated when 50 mug/ml of fennel was combined with 50 mug/ml cisplatin (additive effect). In addition to the signs of apoptosis observed in HeLa cells at 50 mug/ml of fennel, disruption of both nuclear and cytoplasmic membranes and presence of autophagolysosomes were noticed at a dose of 80 mug/ml. Combination of 50 mug/ml of cisplatin with 60, 70, and 80 mug/ml of sweet fennel revealed no significant difference in comparison to cisplatin alone. The combination with 50 mug/ml of sweet fennel revealed marked vacuolization of the cytoplasm, fragmentation of the nucleus, and complete disruption of nuclear membrane. CONCLUSIOn: Combination of cisplatin and the 50 mug/ml of the fennel could enhance cervical cancer growth inhibition. This combination could be effective in lowering the dose of single or repeated cumulative courses of cisplatin and hence decreases its hazardous side effects. In vivo studies and the evaluation of different combination doses of cisplatin and sweet fennel are recommended.
27994631	Evaluation of Beeswax Influence on Physical Properties of Lipstick Using Instrumental and Sensory Methods.	The aim of this study was to optimize the lipsticks formulation according to the physical properties and sensory attributes and investigate the relationship between instrumental and sensory analyses and evaluate the influence of the main ingredients, beeswax and oil, with analysis of lipsticks properties. Central composite design was used to optimize the mixture of oils and beeswax and cocoa butter for formulation of lipsticks. Antioxidant activity was evaluated by DPPH free radical scavenging method spectrophotometrically. Physical properties of lipsticks melting point were determined in a glass tube; the hardness was investigated with texture analyzer. Sensory analysis was performed with untrained volunteers. The optimized mixture of sea buckthorn oil and grapeseed oil mixture ratio 13.96 : 6.18 showed the highest antioxidative activity (70 +/- 0.84%) and was chosen for lipstick formulation. According to the sensory and instrumental analysis results, optimal ingredients amounts for the lipstick were calculated: 57.67% mixture of oils, 19.58% beeswax, and 22.75% cocoa butter. Experimentally designed and optimized lipstick formulation had good physical properties and high scored sensory evaluation. Correlation analysis showed a significant relationship between sensory and instrumental evaluations.
26865988	Immediate Needs and Concerns among Pregnant Women During and after Typhoon Haiyan (Yolanda).	INTRODUCTION: Pregnant and postpartum women are especially vulnerable to natural disasters. These women suffer from increased risk of physical and mental issues including pregnant related problems. Typhoon Haiyan (Yolanda), which hit the Philippines affected a large number of people and caused devastating damages. During and after the typhoon, pregnant women were forced to live in particularly difficult circumstances. The purpose of this study was to determine concerns and problems regarding public health needs and coping mechanisms among pregnant women during and shortly after the typhoon. METHODS: This study employed a cross-sectional design utilizing focus group discussions (FGDs). Participants were 53 women (mean age: 26.6 years old; 42 had children) from four affected communities who were pregnant at the time of the typhoon. FGDs were conducted 4 months after the typhoon, from March 19 to 28, 2014, using semi-structured interviews. Data were analyzed using the qualitative content analysis. RESULT: Three themes were identified regarding problems and concerns during and after the typhoon: 1) having no ideas what is going to happen during the evacuation, 2) lacking essentials to survive, and 3) being unsure of how to deal with health concerns. Two themes were identified as means of solving issues: 1) finding food for survival and 2) avoiding diseases to save my family. As the pregnant women already had several typhoon experiences without any major problems, they underestimated the catastrophic nature of this typhoon. During the typhoon, the women could not ensure their safety and did not have a strong sense of crisis management. They suffered from hunger, food shortage, and poor sanitation. Moreover, though the women had fear and anxiety regarding their pregnancy, they had no way to resolve these concerns. Pregnant women and their families also suffered from common health problems for which they would usually seek medical services. Under such conditions, the pregnant woman cooperated with others for survival and used their knowledge of disease prevention. DISCUSSION: Pregnant women experienced difficulties with evacuation, a lack of minimum survival needs, and attending to their own health issues. Pregnant women were also concerned about needs and health issues of their families, particular, when they had small children. Collecting accurate information regarding the disaster and conducting self-sustainable preparation prior to the disaster among pregnant women will help them to protect their pregnancy status, thereby improving their families' chance of survival during and after disasters.
27448167	Genome-Wide Interaction with Insulin Secretion Loci Reveals Novel Loci for Type 2 Diabetes in African Americans.	Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is the result of metabolic defects in insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity, yet most T2D loci identified to date influence insulin secretion. We hypothesized that T2D loci, particularly those affecting insulin sensitivity, can be identified through interaction with insulin secretion loci. To test this hypothesis, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with acute insulin response to glucose (AIRg), a dynamic measure of first-phase insulin secretion, were identified in African Americans from the Insulin Resistance Atherosclerosis Family Study (IRASFS; n = 492 subjects). These SNPs were tested for interaction, individually and jointly as a genetic risk score (GRS), using genome-wide association study (GWAS) data from five cohorts (ARIC, CARDIA, JHS, MESA, WFSM; n = 2,725 cases, 4,167 controls) with T2D as the outcome. In single variant analyses, suggestively significant (Pinteraction<5x10-6) interactions were observed at several loci including LYPLAL1 (rs10746381), CHN2 (rs7796525), and EXOC1 (rs4289500). Notable AIRg GRS interactions were observed with SAMD4A (rs11627203) and UTRN (rs17074194). These data support the hypothesis that additional genetic factors contributing to T2D risk can be identified by interactions with insulin secretion loci.
26966607	Scrotal Abscess Precipitating Late Infection of a Malleable Penile Prosthesis: The Risk Never Evanesces.	Although infrequent, infections represent the dreadful complication of penile prosthesis implantation. The incidence substantially decreases after a few infection-free postoperative months. We report herein a case of a very late penile prosthesis infection from a fistualizing scrotal abscess in a 67-year-old man. The patient presented with a one-month history of persistent penile-base discharge from a right hemiscrotal swelling. On examination, mild penile tenderness and a discharging penoscrotal-junction sinus were noted. Microbiological wound culture was positive for Staphylococcus epidermidis. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed this multiloculated fluid collection's communication with the right corporal body. Removal of the prosthesis was performed. Pathological evaluation of the dissected fistula was suggestive of acute on top of chronic inflammatory reactions. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a scrotal abscess leading to penile prosthesis infection 15 years after an uneventful implantation.

27124299	Pelvic Organ Support in Animals with Partial Loss of Fibulin-5 in the Vaginal Wall.	Compromise of elastic fiber integrity in connective tissues of the pelvic floor is most likely acquired through aging, childbirth-associated injury, and genetic susceptibility. Mouse models of pelvic organ prolapse demonstrate systemic deficiencies in proteins that affect elastogenesis. Prolapse, however, does not occur until several months after birth and is thereby acquired with age or after parturition. To determine the impact of compromised levels of fibulin-5 (Fbln5) during adulthood on pelvic organ support after parturition and elastase-induced injury, tissue-specific conditional knockout (cKO) mice were generated in which doxycycline (dox) treatment results in deletion of Fbln5 in cells that utilize the smooth muscle alpha actin promoter-driven reverse tetracycline transactivator and tetracycline responsive element-Cre recombinase (i.e., Fbln5f/f/SMA++-rtTA/Cre+, cKO). Fbln5 was decreased significantly in the vagina of cKO mice compared with dox-treated wild type or controls (Fbln5f/f/SMA++-rtTA/Cre-/-). In controls, perineal body length (PBL) and bulge increased significantly after delivery but declined to baseline values within 6-8 weeks. Although overt prolapse did not occur in cKO animals, these transient increases in PBL postpartum were amplified and, unlike controls, parturition-induced increases in PBL (and bulge) did not recover to baseline but remained significantly increased for 12 wks. This lack of recovery from parturition was associated with increased MMP-9 and nondetectable levels of Fbln5 in the postpartum vagina. This predisposition to prolapse was accentuated by injection of elastase into the vaginal wall in which overt prolapse occurred in cKO animals, but rarely in controls. Taken together, our model system in which Fbln5 is conditionally knock-downed in stromal cells of the pelvic floor results in animals that undergo normal elastogenesis during development but lose Fbln5 as adults. The results indicate that vaginal fibulin-5 during development is crucial for baseline pelvic organ support and is also important for protection and recovery from parturition- and elastase-induced prolapse.
27092975	Probiotic approach to prevent antibiotic resistance.	Probiotics are live microorganisms, mainly belonging to the genera Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium, although also strain of other species are commercialized, that have a beneficial effect on the host. From the perspective of antibiotic use, probiotics have been observed to reduce the risk of certain infectious disease such as certain types of diarrhea and respiratory tract infection. This may be accompanied with a reduced need of antibiotics for secondary infections. Antibiotics tend to be effective against most common diseases, but increasingly resistance is being observed among pathogens. Probiotics are specifically selected to not contribute to the spread of antibiotic resistance and not carry transferable antibiotic resistance. Concomitant use of probiotics with antibiotics has been observed to reduce the incidence, duration and/or severity of antibiotic-associated diarrhea. This contributes to better adherence to the antibiotic prescription and thereby reduces the evolution of resistance. To what extent probiotics directly reduce the spread of antibiotic resistance is still much under investigation; but maintaining a balanced microbiota during antibiotic use may certainly provide opportunities for reducing the spread of resistances. Key messages Probiotics may reduce the risk for certain infectious diseases and thereby reduce the need for antibiotics. Probiotics may reduce the risk for antibiotic-associated diarrhea Probiotics do not contribute to the spread of antibiotic resistance and may even reduce it.
26980255	The identification of living persons on images: A literature review.	Personal identification in the forensic context commonly concerns unknown decedents. However, recently there has been an increase in cases which require identification of living persons, especially from surveillance systems. These cases bring about a relatively new challenge for forensic anthropologists and pathologists concerning the selection of the most suitable methodological approaches with regard to the limitations of the photographic representation of a given person for individualization and identity. Facial features are instinctively the primary focus for identification approaches. However, other body parts (e.g. hands), and body height and gait (on videos) have been considered in cases of personal identification. This review aims at summarizing the state-of-the-art concerning the identification of the living on images and videos, including a critical evaluation of the advantages and limitations of different methods. Recommendations are given in order to aid forensic practitioners who face cases of identification of living persons.
27242819	Heterologous Overexpression of Poplar SnRK2 Genes Enhanced Salt Stress Tolerance in Arabidopsis thaliana.	Subfamily 2 of SNF1-related protein kinase (SnRK2) plays important roles in plant abiotic stress responses as a global positive regulator of abscisic acid signaling. In the genome of the model tree Populus trichocarpa, 12 SnRK2 genes have been identified, and some are upregulated by abiotic stresses. In this study, we heterologously overexpressed the PtSnRK2 genes in Arabidopsis thaliana and found that overexpression of PtSnRK2.5 and PtSnRK2.7 genes enhanced stress tolerance. In the PtSnRK2.5 and PtSnRK2.7 overexpressors, chlorophyll content, and root elongation were maintained under salt stress conditions, leading to higher survival rates under salt stress compared with those in the wild type. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that PtSnRK2.7 overexpression affected stress-related metabolic genes, including lipid metabolism and flavonoid metabolism, even under normal growth conditions. However, the stress response genes reported to be upregulated in Arabidopsis SRK2C/SnRK2.6 and wheat SnRK2.8 overexpressors were not changed by PtSnRK2.7 overexpression. Furthermore, PtSnRK2.7 overexpression widely and largely influenced the transcriptome in response to salt stress; genes related to transport activity, including anion transport-related genes, were characteristically upregulated, and a variety of metabolic genes were specifically downregulated. We also found that the salt stress response genes were greatly upregulated in the PtSnRK2.7 overexpressor. Taken together, poplar subclass 2 PtSnRK2 genes can modulate salt stress tolerance in Arabidopsis, through the activation of cellular signaling pathways in a different manner from that by herbal subclass 2 SnRK2 genes.
26992508	Enhanced chemiluminescence of carminic acid-permanganate by CdS quantum dots and its application for sensitive quenchometric flow injection assays of cloxacillin.	A novel chemiluminescence (CL) system is introduced based on the oxidation of carminic acid by KMnO4 in acidic conditions. CdS quantum dots (QDs) were synthesized using a facile hydrothermal method which efficiently enhanced the intensity of the CL system. A possible mechanism for the proposed system is presented using the kinetic curves, CL spectra, photoluminescence (PL), and ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) analysis. The emission intensity of the KMnO4-carminic acid-CdS QDs system was quenched in the presence of a trace level of cloxacillin. Based on this quenching effect, a novel and sensitive flow injection CL method was developed for determining cloxacillin concentrations. At optimal experimental conditions, the decreased CL intensity had a good linear relation with the cloxacillin concentration in the range of 0.008 to 22.0 mg L(-1). The detection limit (3sigma) was 5.8 microg L(-1). The precision of the method was calculated by analyzing samples containing 4.0 mg L(-1) of cloxacillin (n=11), and the relative standard deviations (RSD%) were 2.08%. The feasibility of the method is also demonstrated for determining cloxacillin concentrations in environmental water samples and a pharmaceutical formulation.
27733831	Hepatoprotective Effect and Chemical Assessment of a Selected Egyptian Chickpea Cultivar.	Chickpea (Cicer arietinum) is a legume of the family Fabaceae, subfamily Faboideae. In Egypt, chickpea seeds are usually consumed at raw green and tender stage, or in the form of mature dry seeds. In our previous study, 'Giza 1' seeds exhibited stronger antioxidant activity and higher total phenol content than those from other Egyptian cultivars. In order to assess the biological potential of 'Giza 1' seeds in vivo, the extraction procedure was reproduced here. The extract was standardized using liquid chromatography coupled to diode array detector and tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) to evaluate their hepatoprotective effect on carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-induced hepatotoxicity in rats and acute toxicity. Administration of the extract to rats in doses up to 2 g/Kg) did not cause any mortalities or observable signs of toxicity. Further, the plant extract showed a strong hepatoprotective activity based on assessing serum alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and alkaline phosphatase and levels of albumen, globulin, total protein, total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein, triglycerides, and low density lipoprotein. The antioxidative activity was evaluated by assessing hepatic catalase and superoxide dismutase activity as well as reduced glutathione, and malondialdehyde levels. Additionally, anti-inflammatory activity was observed as the extract significantly lowered the hepatic tumor necrosis factor alpha content. Histopathological examination of liver tissues indicated that the extract-treated animals showed almost normal hepatic architecture with fewer pathological changes. In conclusion, the current results suggest that the chickpea extract possesses an excellent safety profile with very low acute toxicity. Also, it exhibits a significant hepatoprotective effect against CCl4-induced liver injury in rats. This can be attributed, at least partly, to the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity of the isoflavones and phenolic acids content of the extract.
27103841	Personalized medicine and treatment approaches in hypertension: current perspectives.	In the US, hypertension affects one in three adults. Current guideline-based treatment of hypertension involves little diagnostic testing. A more personalized approach to the treatment of hypertension might be of use. Several methods of personalized treatment have been proposed and vetted to varying degrees. The purpose of this narrative review is to discuss the rationale for personalized therapy in hypertension, barriers to its development and implementation, some influential examples of proposed personalization measures, and a view of future efforts.
27572460	Roles of microRNAs in HIV-1 Replication and Latency.	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are non-coding RNA molecules, with sequence length of 19-24 nucleotides, which can induce mRNA degradation and regulate protein translation repression. Recently plenty of reports showed that miRNAs increase or decrease in the serum (circulating miRNAs) and in PBMC of Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infected individuals to affect the replication of HIV-1 through regulating HIV-1 proteins or HIV-1 replication related host factors. Many of miRNAs can suppress HIV-1 replication, but do not affect the integrated viral DNA. Low or no viral protein expression could result in a block of virus and its replication to induce HIV-1 latency, which is the great obstacle of the cure of HIV-1 infection. In the HIV-1 latency reservoir, the integrated provirus can reactivate under appropriate stimulus, which results in HIV-1 reproduction. Factors imply that cellular miRNAs may promote the establishment of HIV-1 latency. Further studies on the mechanisms of miRNAs affecting viral protein expression will provide new approaches to clear the viral reservoir.
27936196	Resilience and Associated Factors among Mainland Chinese Women Newly Diagnosed with Breast Cancer.	PURPOSE: Resilience is the individual's ability to bounce back from trauma. It has been studied for some time in the U.S., but few studies in China have addressed this important construct. In mainland China, relatively little is known about the resilience of patients in clinical settings, especially among patients with breast cancer. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the level of resilience and identify predictors of resilience among mainland Chinese women newly diagnosed with breast cancer. METHODS: A cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted with 213 mainland Chinese women newly diagnosed with breast cancer between November 2014 and June 2015. Participants were assessed with the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC), Social Support Rating Scale (SSRS), Medical Coping Modes Questionnaire (MCMQ, including 3 subscales: confrontation, avoidance, and acceptance-resignation), Herth Hope Index (HHI), and demographic and disease-related information. Descriptive statistics, bivariate analyses and multiple stepwise regression were conducted to explore predictors for resilience. RESULTS: The average score for CD-RISC was 60.97, ranging from 37 to 69. Resilience was positively associated with educational level, family income, time span after diagnosis, social support, confrontation, avoidance, and hope. However, resilience was negatively associated with age, body mass index (BMI), and acceptance-resignation. Multiple stepwise regression analysis indicated that hope (beta = 0.343, P<0.001), educational level of junior college or above (beta = 0.272, P<0.001), educational level of high school (beta = 0.235, P<0.001), avoidance (beta = 0.220, P<0.001), confrontation (beta = 0.187, P = 0.001), and age (beta = -0.108, P = 0.037) significantly affected resilience and explained 50.1% of the total variance in resilience. CONCLUSIONS: Women with newly diagnosed breast cancer from mainland China demonstrated particularly low resilience level, which was predicted by hope educational level, avoidance, confrontation, and age.
27128674	The Brain of the Domestic Bos taurus: Weight, Encephalization and Cerebellar Quotients, and Comparison with Other Domestic and Wild Cetartiodactyla.	The domestic bovine Bos taurus is raised worldwide for meat and milk production, or even for field work. However the functional anatomy of its central nervous system has received limited attention and most of the reported data in textbooks and reviews are derived from single specimens or relatively old literature. Here we report information on the brain of Bos taurus obtained by sampling 158 individuals, 150 of which at local abattoirs and 8 in the dissecting room, these latter subsequently formalin-fixed. Using body weight and fresh brain weight we calculated the Encephalization Quotient (EQ), and Cerebellar Quotient (CQ). Formalin-fixed brains sampled in the necropsy room were used to calculate the absolute and relative weight of the major components of the brain. The data that we obtained indicate that the domestic bovine Bos taurus possesses a large, convoluted brain, with a slightly lower weight than expected for an animal of its mass. Comparisons with other terrestrial and marine members of the order Cetartiodactyla suggested close similarity with other species with the same feeding adaptations, and with representative baleen whales. On the other hand differences with fish-hunting toothed whales suggest separate evolutionary pathways in brain evolution. Comparison with the other large domestic herbivore Equus caballus (belonging to the order Perissodactyla) indicates that Bos taurus underwent heavier selection of bodily traits, which is also possibly reflected in a comparatively lower EQ than in the horse. The data analyzed suggest that the brain of domestic bovine is potentially interesting for comparative neuroscience studies and may represents an alternative model to investigate neurodegeneration processes.
27196389	Domestic violence survivors' empowerment and mental health: Exploring the role of the alliance with advocates.	Over the last 4 decades, domestic violence (DV) programs-both residential and nonresidential-have sprung up in communities across the country with the aim of helping survivors become safe. These programs place strong emphasis on the relationship between the advocate and survivor as critical to becoming safer and healing from the trauma of abuse. Yet little research has demonstrated the extent to which specific aspects of the advocate-survivor alliance are related to specific indicators of survivor well-being, nor shown what factors might mediate that relationship. This study explored in a sample of help-seeking survivors (N = 370) whether the strength of the alliance between survivors and their advocates is related to lower symptoms of depression and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and whether this association is mediated by survivors' sense of empowerment in the domain of safety. The structural equation model we tested also controlled for variables that might influence these relationships, including race/ethnicity, financial strain, and length of stay in the program. As expected, stronger alliance was associated with reduced symptoms of both depression and PTSD, through the mechanism of empowerment in the domain safety. These findings provide direction to programs seeking to establish a theory of change and point the way toward longitudinal research on the nature and function of the alliance as a potential contributor to healing.

27058958	Inhibitory Effect of Chrysin (5,7-Dihydroxyflavone) on Experimental Choroidal Neovascularization in Rats.	PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of chrysin on laser-induced experimental choroidal neovascularization (CNV) in a rat model. METHODS: Male brown Norway rats were anesthetized, and a diode laser was used to break Bruch's membrane. One week later, each rat was intravitreally injected with 5 microl of 15 mg/ml chrysin, and CNV development was determined by fluorescein angiography at 2 weeks. The effect of chrysin on experimental CNV was assessed by fluorescein angiography and histology. RESULTS: Two weeks after laser treatment, the intensity of fluorescein leakage from the photocoagulated lesions decreased significantly compared with the control group (p = 0.044). When the lesions were categorized into low- and high-leakage groups, there was a significant correlation between chrysin treatment and degree of leakage (p = 0.028). Compared with the chrysin-treated group, the relative risk of developing high-leakage lesions in the control group was 3.18. The mean CNV thickness was significantly thinner in chrysin-treated eyes than in control eyes (34.13 +/-.0.88 vs. 37.76 +/- 0.90 mum, p = 0.005). CONCLUSION: Chrysin has an inhibitory effect on CNV in an experimental rat model, indicating that chrysin should be further evaluated for its potential as a therapy for CNV in age-related macular degeneration and in other vision-threatening conditions associated with CNV.
27466813	Competitive Fitness of Influenza B Viruses Possessing E119A and H274Y Neuraminidase Inhibitor Resistance-Associated Substitutions in Ferrets.	Neuraminidase (NA) inhibitors (NAIs) are the only antiviral drugs recommended for influenza treatment and prophylaxis. Although NAI-resistant influenza B viruses that could pose a threat to public health have been reported in the field, their fitness is poorly understood. We evaluated in ferrets the pathogenicity and relative fitness of reverse genetics (rg)-generated influenza B/Yamanashi/166/1998-like viruses containing E119A or H274Y NA substitutions (N2 numbering). Ferrets inoculated with NAI-susceptible rg-wild-type (rg-WT) or NAI-resistant (rg-E119A or rg-H274Y) viruses developed mild infections. Growth of rg-E119A virus in the nasal cavities was delayed, but the high titers at 3 days post-inoculation (dpi) were comparable to those of the rg-WT and rg-H274Y viruses (3.6-4.1 log10TCID50/mL). No virus persisted beyond 5 dpi and replication did not extend to the trachea or lungs. Positive virus antigen-staining of the nasal turbinate epithelium was intermittent with the rg-WT and rg-H274Y viruses; whereas antigen-staining for the rg-E119A virus was more diffuse. Virus populations in ferrets coinoculated with NAI-susceptible and -resistant viruses (1:1 mixture) remained heterogeneous at 5 dpi but were predominantly rg-WT (>70%). Although the E119A substitution was associated with delayed replication in ferrets, the H274Y substitution did not measurably affect viral growth properties. These data suggest that rg-H274Y has undiminished fitness in single virus inoculations, but neither rg-E119A nor rg-H274Y gained a fitness advantage over rg-WT in direct competition experiments without antiviral drug pressure. Taken together, our data suggest the following order of relative fitness in a ferret animal model: rg-WT > rg-H274Y > rg-E119A.
26912731	A Randomized Controlled Trial of a Therapeutic Intervention for Nursing Home Residents With Dementia and Depressive Symptoms.	OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to conduct a randomized controlled trial of a nursing home intervention to reduce depressive symptoms in residents with dementia. METHOD: The multicomponent intervention included group activity sessions, which used question-asking-reading (QAR), reminiscence, and cognitive-behavioral therapy techniques, as well as environmental supports and individualized behavioral activity programs. Fifty-one residents from five nursing homes participated in the study. RESULTS: A significant difference in depressive symptoms was found, with residents in the QAR-Depression condition showing improvement compared with those in the treatment as usual condition. Residents in the treatment group also exhibited significantly higher levels of expressive verbalizations, engagement with materials, and laughter. Few differences in resident behavior occurring outside of the group activities were noted. DISCUSSION: Findings suggest that structured group activities can positively impact a resident's psychological well-being. In addition, the QAR structure may be suitable for older adults with cognitive impairment by distributing group tasks and providing external cognitive supports.
27698903	Prognostic Value of Plasma D-dimer in Patients with Resectable Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma in China.	Background: Plasma D-dimer is closely related to prognosis in several cancers. The aim of the current study was to determine the prognostic value of plasma D-dimer in patients with resectable esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Methods: A total of 337 patients with resectable ESCC were enrolled in this retrospective study. The 5-year cancer-specific survival (CSS) was calculated by Kaplan-Meier method. Cox regression analyses were performed to evaluate the prognostic factors. A nomogram model was also performed to predict the cancer prognosis. Results: In our study, there were 242 patients (71.8%) with plasma D-dimer </= 0.5 mug/ml and 95 patients (28.2%) with plasma D-dimer > 0.5 mug/ml. There was a significantly better 5-year CSS in patients with plasma D-dimer </= 0.5 mug/ml than patients with plasma D-dimer > 0.5 mug/ml (35.5% vs. 21.1%, P < 0.001). Multivariate analyses reported that plasma D-dimer was an independent prognostic factor in patients with resectable ESCC (P < 0.001). In addition, a nomogram was also performed to predict the CSS. The Harrell's c-index was 0.68. Conclusion: We conclude that plasma D-dimer was an independent prognostic biomarker in patients with resectable ESCC.
26996404	Long-Term Neurocognitive, Psychosocial, and Magnetic Resonance Imaging Outcomes in Pediatric-Onset Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis.	BACKGROUND: Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) is a demyelinating disorder that is usually self-limited. Recent studies have suggested ongoing neurological deficits and neurocognitive impairment in these patients. Little information on the correlation of clinical and neuroimaging markers in ADEM is available. We examined potential clinical factors (e.g., age of onset, acute symptom duration, magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] lesions) and their relation to neurocognitive and psychosocial outcomes. METHODS: This is a retrospective chart review of consecutive pediatric patients diagnosed with ADEM between 2006 and 2012. Patients were evaluated with standard neurological assessment, MRI of the brain, and neuropsychological evaluation. RESULTS: Twenty-three patients with ADEM with average age at neuropsychological assessment of 10.1 years (+/-3.50) were included. Five (22.7%) patients were impaired on three or more neurocognitive measures. Psychosocial problems were reported in 20%-40% of patients. Earlier age of onset was correlated with poorer sustained attention and psychosocial problems, whereas acute symptom duration and Expanded Disability Status Scale were not. MRI outcomes were correlated with psychosocial outcomes but not neuropsychological findings. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest lingering cognitive and psychosocial deficits in children with a history of ADEM. Clinical features and MRI findings correlated more strongly with psychosocial outcomes than cognitive functioning. Further studies are needed to confirm relationships and other possible contributing factors to lingering deficits.
27876965	Histopathological study of gill, kidney and liver of Persian Sturgeon (Acipenser persicus Borodin, 1897) and Stellate (Acipenser stellatus Pallas, 1811) exposed to sublethal concentration of un-ionised ammonia UAN.	This study was carried out to investigate the histopathological changes of gill, kidney and liver of Persian Sturgeon and Stellate in response to various sublethal concentration of ammonia. The sublethal doses were determined after a lethal pre-test and then the experiment was done in six treatments with three replicates for both species. In Persian sturgeon, the treatments were including 5, 7, 9.7, 13.2, 18 and 25 mg/l ammonia. In stellate, the concentrations of 5, 6.23, 7.76, 9.66, 12.04 and 15 mg/l ammonia were considered as treatments. Also, one group without ammonia was considered as control for each experiment. The histopathological investigations were done after 96 h exposure. According to our observations, a range of histopathological alternations were found in gill, liver and kidney of both examined fish. The alternations of gill tissue were lamellar necrosis, hyperplasia, lamellar adhesion, haemorrhage, swelling of gill lamellae. Severity of these alternations was dose-dependent and was significantly higher in Persian sturgeon than in stellate. The degree of histopathological alternations of liver did not show a regular pattern between treatments in both species. These alternations were hyperemia, bile record, cell necrosis, cell atrophy, fatty degeneration and cloudy swelling. The signs of kidney alternations intensified with increasing of ammonia concentration in both species. The signs such as hyperemia, vision tissue degeneration, cell necrosis, dilatation of Bowman's space. In conclusion, our results showed that ammonia in concentration of more than 5 mg/l have more adverse impacts on gill, liver and kidney tissues.
28348744	Urinary infection due to Balantioides coli: a rare accidental zoonotic disease in an addicted and diabetic young female in Iran.	BACKGROUND: Balantiosis, a rare zoonotic infection resulting in dysentery, is caused by the large ciliated protozoan parasite Balantioides coli. Humans acquire this organism via the faecal-oral route. Very rarely, extraintestinal infections can occur in the urinary tract system. There are very few case reports of urinary balantiosis in humans. CASE PRESENTATION: Here, an interesting case of urinary balantiosis in a 35-year-old addicted woman with multiple health problems including spontaneous abortion and diabetes is reported. Her midstream urine sample, collected while all sterile precautions were being taken, demonstrated B. coli along with Trichomonas vaginalis and bacteria. B. coli was identified by its characteristic morphology and rapid rotary motility in the urinary tract, which is an abnormal site for invasion by this parasite. CONCLUSION: To the best of our knowledge, this is only the eighth case described in literature in which B. coli was detected in urine sediment; it is reported for its rarity and for future reference.
27160070	Cell-free Xenopus egg extracts for studying DNA damage response pathways.	In response to a variety of DNA replication stress or DNA damaging agents, the DNA damage response (DDR) pathways are triggered for cells to coordinate DNA repair, cell cycle checkpoints, apoptosis, and senescence. Cell-free Xenopus egg extracts, derived from the eggs of African clawed frogs (Xenopus laevis), have been widely used for studies concerning DDR pathways. In this review, we focus on how different experimental systems have been established using Xenopus egg extracts to investigate the DDR pathways that are activated in response to DNA replication stress, double-strand breaks (DSBs), inter-strand crosslinks (ICLs), and oxidative stress. We summarize how molecular details of DDR pathways are dissected by the mechanistic studies with Xenopus egg extracts. We also provide an update on the regulation of translesion DNA synthesis (TLS) polymerases (Pol k and REV1) in the DDR pathways. A better understanding of DDR pathways using Xenopus egg extracts has opened new avenues for future cancer therapeutics. Finally, we offer our perspectives of future directions for studies of DDR pathways with Xenopus egg extracts.
27445596	Physicians' Attitudes to Clinical Pain Management and Education: Survey from a Middle Eastern Country.	Despite promising initiatives to advance the practice of pain management in Middle Eastern countries, their pain care lags behind developed countries. The objectives of this study are to evaluate physicians' assessment of their own competency in pain management, to assess physicians' practice related to pain management, and to identify physician-related barriers to effective pain control. A cross-sectional survey was conducted in 3 teaching medical centers in Lebanon targeting the above-mentioned outcomes and assessing the impact of physicians' years in practice on the studied end-points. A total of 69 physicians were surveyed. Fifty-seven percent reported "very good to excellent" pain management skills; only 25% of them described the need for continuing professional development. When treating patients with pain, 52% of physicians refer to updated international guidelines, whereas 43% rely on their own judgment. Physicians were more likely to consult with another physician (65%) rather than a pharmacist (12%) when treating patients with pain. Fear of adverse effects of analgesics was the most commonly reported barrier (45%) to pain control among physicians from different career stages. Based on these survey findings, national pain management and practice policies are needed to optimize this area of deficiency in patient care.
26981759	Antimicrobial action of calcium hydroxide-based endodontic sealers after setting, against E. faecalis biofilm.	Enterococcus faecalis are gram positive bacteria that can mostly resist endodontic therapy, inducing persistent infection in the root canal system. Endodontic sealers with antimicrobial activity may help eliminate residual microorganisms that survive endodontic treatment. The present study aimed at comparing the antimicrobial activity of Acroseal, Sealapex and AH Plus endodontic sealers in an in vitro biofilm model. Bovine dentin specimens (144) were prepared, and twelve blocks for each sealer and each experimental time point (2, 7 and 14 days) were placed and left in contact with plates containing inoculum of E. faecalis (ATCC 51299), to induce biofilm formation. After 14 days, the samples were transferred to another plate with test sealers and kept at 37 degrees C and 5% CO2 for 2, 7 and 14 days. The specimens without sealers were used as a control for each period. The samples were agitated in a sonicator after each experiment. The suspensions were agitated in a vortex mixer, serially diluted in saline, and triple plated onto m-Enterococcus agar. Colonyforming units were counted, and the data were statistically analyzed using ANOVA, Shapiro-Wilk and Kruskal-Wallis one-way tests (p < 0.05) to determine antimicrobial potential. Sealapex showed significant differences at all the experimental time points, in comparison with all the other groups. AH Plus and Acroseal showed antimicrobial activity only on the 14th experimental day. Neither of the sealers tested were able to completely eliminate the biofilm. Sealapex showed the highest antimicrobial activity in all the experimental periods. The antimicrobial activity of all the sealers analyzed increased over time.
27110124	Profile of ramucirumab in the treatment of metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer.	The interaction between vascular endothelial growth factor and its receptor is an important therapeutic target due to the importance of this pathway in carcinogenesis. In particular, this pathway promotes and regulates angiogenesis as well as increases endothelial cell proliferation, permeability, and survival. Ramucirumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that specifically targets the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2, the key receptor implicated in angiogenesis. Currently, ramucirumab is approved for the second-line treatment of metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in combination with docetaxel. In a Phase III clinical trial, ramucirumab was shown to improve the overall survival in patients with disease progression, despite platinum-based chemotherapy for advanced NSCLC. This review describes the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and dynamics, adverse event profile, and the clinical activity of ramucirumab observed in Phase II and III trials in NSCLC.
26944125	Atorvastatin enhances angiogenesis to reduce subdural hematoma in a rat model.	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Statins are active in reducing plasma lipids, suppressing inflammation and promoting angiogenesis. Because angiogenesis is critical for the absorbance of subdural hematoma (SDH), we hypothesize that atorvastatin promotes angiogenesis to enhance hematoma absorption. METHODS: SDH was induced in adult Wistar rats and treated with 3mg/kg, 8mg/kg of atorvastatin, or vehicle saline daily for 7days. The treated rats were examined for the level of CD34+/CD133+ endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) in the circulation by flow cytometry, hematoma volumes by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and changes in cognitive functions. We also examined angiogenesis in the hematoma wall by transmission electronic microscopy and immunohistochemistry for the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), matrix metalloprotease 9 (MMP 9) and angiopoietin. RESULTS: SDH volume was significantly reduced and neurological deficits improved in rats receiving the low dose atorvastatin compared to those receiving either the high dose of atorvastatin or saline. Consistent with these outcome measures, the low dose atorvastatin increased the expression of angiopoient-1 and VEGF and reduced MMP9 expression in the connective tissue of the SDH wall, resulting in an increased vascular density and enhanced vascular maturation. CONCLUSIONS: The low-dose atorvastatin is effective in reducing SDH and improving neurological deficits in a rat model, primarily by promoting angiogenesis and vascular maturation.
27594895	Development of Health Parameter Model for Risk Prediction of CVD Using SVM.	Current methods of cardiovascular risk assessment are performed using health factors which are often based on the Framingham study. However, these methods have significant limitations due to their poor sensitivity and specificity. We have compared the parameters from the Framingham equation with linear regression analysis to establish the effect of training of the model for the local database. Support vector machine was used to determine the effectiveness of machine learning approach with the Framingham health parameters for risk assessment of cardiovascular disease (CVD). The result shows that while linear model trained using local database was an improvement on Framingham model, SVM based risk assessment model had high sensitivity and specificity of prediction of CVD. This indicates that using the health parameters identified using Framingham study, machine learning approach overcomes the low sensitivity and specificity of Framingham model.
27441172	Analysis of Postoperative Thoracolumbar Spine Infections in a Prospective Randomized Controlled Trial Using the Centers for Disease Control Surgical Site Infection Criteria.	INTRODUCTION: Wound infections following spinal surgery place a high toll on both the patient and the healthcare system. Although several large series studies have examined the incidence and distribution of spinal wound infection, the applicability of these studies varies greatly since nearly every study is either retrospective and/or lacks standard inclusion criteria for defining surgical site infection. To address this void, we present results from prospectively gathered thoracolumbar spine surgery data for which the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) criteria were stringently applied to define a surgical site infection (SSI). METHODS: A prospective randomized trial of 314 patients who underwent multilevel thoracolumbar spinal surgery with instrumentation followed by postoperative drain placement was completed (Takemoto et al., 2015). The trial consisted of two antibiotic arms: one for 24-hours, and the other for the duration of the drain; no differences were found between the arms. All infections meeting CDC criteria for SSI were included. RESULTS: A total of 40 infections met CDC criteria for SSI, for an overall incidence of 12.7%. Of these, 20 (50%) were culture-positive. The most common organism was Staphylococcus aureus (4 total: methicillin-sensitive=2; methicillin-resistant=2), followed by coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (3 cases), Propionibacterium acnes and Escherichia coli (2 cases each). Six infections grew multiple organisms, most commonly involving coagulase-negative staphylococcus and enterococcus. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that thoracolumbar SSI occurs at the higher end of the range cited in the literature (2-13%), which is largely based on retrospective data not subjected to the inclusivity of SSI as defined by the CDC. The three most common organisms in our analysis (S. aureus, P. acnes, E. coli) are consistent with previous reports. Staphylococcus aureus continues to be the most common causative organism and continued vigilance and searching for preventive measures need to be a high priority. This study provides Level I evidence.
27701161	Bioelectric Medicine and Devices for the Treatment of Spinal Cord Injury.	Recovery of motor control is paramount for patients living with paralysis following spinal cord injury (SCI). While a cure or regenerative intervention remains on the horizon for the treatment of SCI, a number of neuroprosthetic devices have been employed to treat and mitigate the symptoms of paralysis associated with injuries to the spinal column and associated comorbidities. The recent success of epidural stimulation to restore voluntary motor function in the lower limbs of a small cohort of patients has breathed new life into the promise of electric-based medicine. Recently, a number of new organic and inorganic electronic devices have been developed for brain-computer interfaces to bypass the injury, for neurorehabilitation, bladder and bowel control, and the restoration of motor or sensory control. Herein, we discuss the recent advances in neuroprosthetic devices for treating SCI and highlight future design needs for closed-loop device systems.
28003810	Succinate/NLRP3 Inflammasome Induces Synovial Fibroblast Activation: Therapeutical Effects of Clematichinenoside AR on Arthritis.	Clematichinenoside AR (C-AR) is a triterpene saponin isolated from the root of Clematis manshurica Rupr., which is a herbal medicine used in traditional Chinese medicine for the treatment of arthritis. C-AR exerts anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive properties, but little is known about its action in the suppression of fibroblast activation. Low oxygen tension and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta1) induction in the synovium contribute to fibrosis in arthritis. This study was designed to investigate the effect of C-AR on synovial fibrosis from the aspects of hypoxic TGF-beta1 and hypoxia-inducible transcription factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) induction. In the synovium of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) rats, hypoxic TGF-beta1 induction increased succinate accumulation due to the reversal of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) activation and induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation in a manner dependent on HIF-1alpha induction. In response to NLRP3 inflammasome activation, the released IL-1beta further increased TGF-beta1 induction, suggesting the forward cycle between inflammation and fibrosis in myofibroblast activation. In the synovium of RA rats, C-AR inhibited hypoxic TGF-beta1 induction and suppressed succinate-associated NLRP3 inflammasome activation by inhibiting SDH activity, and thereby prevented myofibroblast activation by blocking the cross-talk between inflammation and fibrosis. Taken together, these results showed that succinate worked as a metabolic signaling, linking inflammation with fibrosis through NLRP3 inflammasome activation. These findings suggested that synovial succinate accumulation and HIF-1alpha induction might be therapeutical targets for the prevention of fibrosis in arthritis.
27051199	Loktanella spp. Gb03 as an algicidal bacterium, isolated from the culture of Dinoflagellate Gambierdiscus belizeanus.	AIM: Bacteria associated with harmful algal blooms can play a crucial role in regulating algal blooms in the environment. This study aimed at isolating and identifying algicidal bacteria in Dinoflagellate culture and to determine the optimum growth requirement of the algicidal bacteria, Loktanella sp. Gb-03. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Dinoflagellate culture used in this study was supplied by Professor Gires Usup's Laboratory, School of Environmental and Natural Resources Sciences, Faculty of Science and Technology, University Kebangsaan Malaysia, Malaysia. The culture was used for the isolation of Loktanella sp., using biochemical tests, API 20 ONE kits. The fatty acid content of the isolates and the algicidal activity were further evaluated, and the phenotype was determined through the phylogenetic tree. RESULTS: Gram-negative, non-motile, non-spore-forming, short rod-shaped, aerobic bacteria (Gb01, Gb02, Gb03, Gb04, Gb05, and Gb06) were isolated from the Dinoflagellate culture. The colonies were pink in color, convex with a smooth surface and entire edge. The optimum growth temperature for the Loktanella sp. Gb03 isolate was determined to be 30 degrees C, in 1% of NaCl and pH7. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that the bacterium belonged to the genus Loktanella of the class Alphaproteobacteria and formed a tight cluster with the type strain of Loktanella pyoseonensis (97.0% sequence similarity). CONCLUSION: On the basis of phenotypic, phylogenetic data and genetic distinctiveness, strain Gb-03, were placed in the genus Loktanella as the type strain of species. Moreover, it has algicidal activity against seven toxic Dinoflagellate. The algicidal property of the isolated Loktanella is vital, especially where biological control is needed to mitigate algal bloom or targeted Dinoflagellates.
27200202	Osseointegrated Implants: An Alternative Approach in Patients with Bilateral Auricular Defects due to Chemical Assault.	Acid attacks committed as crimes of passion are unfortunately becoming far from infrequent occurrence. The injuries sustained in such attacks mainly involve the face and trunk, with the acid causing cutaneous and subcutaneous tissue burns that can result in permanent scarring, loss of the nose or external ear, and severe visual impairment. Different surgical solutions have been proposed for reconstruction of the auricle following loss of the ear through traumatic injury or cancer or in patients with congenital defects: surgical reconstruction may involve the insertion of an autogenous rib cartilage framework or the use of a porous polymer material inserted into an expanded postauricular flap. Reconstruction with rib cartilage has given good results but requires more than one surgical step and may be associated with adverse events involving both the donor site and the recipient site, while rejections of polymeric prostheses have been reported following their insertion into expanded postauricular flaps. The use of a titanium dowel-retained silicone prosthesis, in which the dowel is anchored to the temporal bone, is a surgical possibility, indicated particularly in cases of pinna resection due to tumour or auricular scarring following traumatic injury.
26843161	Stimulant Paste Preparation and Bark Streak Tapping Technique for Pine Oleoresin Extraction.	Tapping technique comprises the extraction of pine oleoresin, a non-wood forest product consisting of a complex mixture of mono, sesqui, and diterpenes biosynthesized and exuded as a defense response to wounding. Oleoresin is used to produce gum rosin, turpentine, and their multiple derivatives. Oleoresin yield and quality are objects of interest in pine tree biotechnology, both in terms of environmental and genetic control. Monitoring these parameters in individual trees grown in the field provides a means to examine the control of terpene production in resin canals, as well as the identification of genetic-based differences in resinosis. A typical method of tapping involves the removal of bark and application of a chemical stimulant on the wounded area. Here we describe the methods for preparing the resin-stimulant paste with different adjuvants, as well as the bark streaking process in adult pine trees.
27729908	The Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinase VdPbs2 of Verticillium dahliae Regulates Microsclerotia Formation, Stress Response, and Plant Infection.	Verticillium dahliae, a ubiquitous phytopathogenic fungus, forms resting structures, known as microsclerotia that play crucial roles in Verticillium wilt diseases. VdHog1, a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), controls microsclerotia formation, virulence, and stress response in V. dahliae. In this study, we present detailed evidence that the conserved upstream component of VdHog1, VdPbs2, is a key regulator of microsclerotia formation, oxidative stress and fungicide response and plant virulence in V. dahliae. We identified VdPbs2, homologous to the yeast MAPK kinase Pbs2. Similar to the VdHog1 deletion mutant, VdPbs2 deletion strains exhibited delayed melanin synthesis and reduced formation of microsclerotia. When exposed to stresses, VdPbs2 mutants were more sensitive than the wild type to osmotic agents and peroxide, but more resistant to inhibitors of cell wall synthesis and some fungicides. Finally, VdPbs2 deletion mutants exhibited reduced virulence on smoke tree and tobacco seedlings. When taken together, we implicate that VdPbs2 and VdHog1 function in a cascade that regulates microsclerotia formation and virulence, but not all VdHog1 dependent functions are VdPbs2 regulated. This study thus provides novel insights into the signal transduction mechanisms that regulate microsclerotia formation and pathogenesis in this fungus.
27466808	High Throughput Method for Analysis of Repeat Number for 28 Phase Variable Loci of Campylobacter jejuni Strain NCTC11168.	Mutations in simple sequence repeat tracts are a major mechanism of phase variation in several bacterial species including Campylobacter jejuni. Changes in repeat number of tracts located within the reading frame can produce a high frequency of reversible switches in gene expression between ON and OFF states. The genome of C. jejuni strain NCTC11168 contains 29 loci with polyG/polyC tracts of seven or more repeats. This protocol outlines a method-the 28-locus-CJ11168 PV-analysis assay-for rapidly determining ON/OFF states of 28 of these phase-variable loci in a large number of individual colonies from C. jejuni strain NCTC11168. The method combines a series of multiplex PCR assays with a fragment analysis assay and automated extraction of fragment length, repeat number and expression state. This high throughput, multiplex assay has utility for detecting shifts in phase variation states within and between populations over time and for exploring the effects of phase variation on adaptation to differing selective pressures. Application of this method to analysis of the 28 polyG/polyC tracts in 90 C. jejuni colonies detected a 2.5-fold increase in slippage products as tracts lengthened from G8 to G11 but no difference between tracts of similar length indicating that flanking sequence does not influence slippage rates. Comparison of this observed slippage to previously measured mutation rates for G8 and G11 tracts in C. jejuni indicates that PCR amplification of a DNA sample will over-estimate phase variation frequencies by 20-35-fold. An important output of the 28-locus-CJ11168 PV-analysis assay is combinatorial expression states that cannot be determined by other methods. This method can be adapted to analysis of phase variation in other C. jejuni strains and in a diverse range of bacterial species.
28149197	Global scientific research commons under the Nagoya Protocol: Towards a collaborative economy model for the sharing of basic research assets.	This paper aims to get a better understanding of the motivational and transaction cost features of building global scientific research commons, with a view to contributing to the debate on the design of appropriate policy measures under the recently adopted Nagoya Protocol. For this purpose, the paper analyses the results of a world-wide survey of managers and users of microbial culture collections, which focused on the role of social and internalized motivations, organizational networks and external incentives in promoting the public availability of upstream research assets. Overall, the study confirms the hypotheses of the social production model of information and shareable goods, but it also shows the need to complete this model. For the sharing of materials, the underlying collaborative economy in excess capacity plays a key role in addition to the social production, while for data, competitive pressures amongst scientists tend to play a bigger role.
27127504	Bone Mineral Density in the Noninstitutionalized Elderly: Influence of Sociodemographic and Anthropometric Factors.	Objective. Analysis of bone mineral density (BMD) in the elderly and its associated factors according to sex. Methods. A cross-sectional study is presented herein, with a random sample of 132 noninstitutionalized elderly people. Individuals who did not use diuretics were excluded. BMD was obtained from examination of total body densitometry and its association with sociodemographic variables, lifestyle, anthropometric, and body composition was verified. Results. Mean BMD for men was 1.17 +/- 0.12 g/cm(2) and for women was 1.04 +/- 0.11 g/cm(2). Higher education was associated with higher BMD values in men (p < 0.05). There was a reduction in BMD in the age group 75-79 years of age in women and over 80 years of age in men (p < 0.05). Underweight was associated with significantly low BMD for both sexes (p < 0.01), while normal weight was associated with low BMD in women (p < 0.001). Discussion. The elderly with low schooling and in older age groups are more probable to also present low BMD. Lower levels of body mass index also indicated towards low BMD.
27458473	Comparison between Arabidopsis and Rice for Main Pathways of K(+) and Na(+) Uptake by Roots.	K(+) is an essential macronutrient for plants. It is acquired by specific uptake systems located in roots. Although the concentrations of K(+) in the soil solution are widely variable, K(+) nutrition is secured by uptake systems that exhibit different affinities for K(+). Two main systems have been described for root K(+) uptake in several species: the high-affinity HAK5-like transporter and the inward-rectifier AKT1-like channel. Other unidentified systems may be also involved in root K(+) uptake, although they only seem to operate when K(+) is not limiting. The use of knock-out lines has allowed demonstrating their role in root K(+) uptake in Arabidopsis and rice. Plant adaptation to the different K(+) supplies relies on the finely tuned regulation of these systems. Low K(+)-induced transcriptional up-regulation of the genes encoding HAK5-like transporters occurs through a signal cascade that includes changes in the membrane potential of root cells and increases in ethylene and reactive oxygen species concentrations. Activation of AKT1 channels occurs through phosphorylation by the CIPK23/CBL1 complex. Recently, activation of the Arabidopsis HAK5 by the same complex has been reported, pointing to CIPK23/CBL as a central regulator of the plant's adaptation to low K(+). Na(+) is not an essential plant nutrient but it may be beneficial for some plants. At low concentrations, Na(+) improves growth, especially under K(+) deficiency. Thus, high-affinity Na(+) uptake systems have been described that belong to the HKT and HAK families of transporters. At high concentrations, typical of saline environments, Na(+) accumulates in plant tissues at high concentrations, producing alterations that include toxicity, water deficit and K(+) deficiency. Data concerning pathways for Na(+) uptake into roots under saline conditions are still scarce, although several possibilities have been proposed. The apoplast is a significant pathway for Na(+) uptake in rice grown under salinity conditions, but in other plant species different mechanisms involving non-selective cation channels or transporters are under discussion.
27380172	Methamphetamine Consumption Inhibits Pair Bonding and Hypothalamic Oxytocin in Prairie Voles.	Methamphetamine (MA) abuse has been linked to violence, risk-taking behaviors, decreased sexual inhibition, and criminal activity. It is important to understand mechanisms underlying these drug effects for prevention and treatment of MA-associated social problems. Previous studies have demonstrated that experimenter-administered amphetamine inhibits pair bonding and increases aggression in monogamous prairie voles. It is not currently known whether similar effects on social behaviors would be obtained under conditions during which the drug is voluntarily (actively) administered. The current study investigated whether MA drinking affects pair bonding and what neurocircuits are engaged. In Experiment 1, we exposed male and female voles to 4 days each of 20 and 40 mg/L MA under a continuous 2-bottle choice (2BC) procedure. Animals were housed either singly or in mesh-divided cages with a social partner. Voles consumed MA in a drinking solution, but MA drinking was not affected by either sex or housing condition. In Experiment 2, we investigated whether MA drinking disrupts social bonding by measuring aggression and partner preference formation following three consecutive days of 18-hour/day access to 100 mg/L MA in a 2BC procedure. Although aggression toward a novel opposite-sex animal was not affected by MA exposure, partner preference was inhibited in MA drinking animals. Experiment 3 examined whether alterations in hypothalamic neuropeptides provide a potential explanation for the inhibition of partner preference observed in Experiment 2. MA drinking led to significant decreases in oxytocin, but not vasopressin, in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus. These experiments are the first investigation into how voluntary pre-exposure to MA affects the development of social attachment in a socially monogamous species and identify potential neural circuits involved in these effects.
27428362	Radiation Therapy and Cardiac Death in Long-Term Survivors of Esophageal Cancer: An Analysis of the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Result Database.	OBJECTIVE: Radiation therapy (RT) for esophageal cancer often results in unintended radiation doses delivered to the heart owing to anatomic proximity. Using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database, we examined late cardiac death in survivors of esophageal cancer that had or had not received RT. METHODS: 5,630 patients were identified that were diagnosed with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) or adenocarcinoma (AC) from 1973-2012, who were followed for at least 5 years after therapy. Examined risk factors for cardiac death included age (</=55/56-65/66-75/>75), gender, race (white/non-white), stage (local/regional/distant), histology (SCC/AC), esophageal location (<18cm/18-24cm/25-32cm/33-40cm from incisors), diagnosis year (1973-1992/1993-2002/2003-2012), and receipt of surgery and/or RT. Time to cardiac death was evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier method. A Cox model was used to evaluate risk factors for cardiac death in propensity score matched data. RESULTS: Patients who received RT were younger, diagnosed more recently, had more advanced disease, SCC histology, and no surgery. The RT group had higher risk of cardiac death than the no-RT group (log-rank p<0.0001). The median time to cardiac death in the RT group was 289 months (95% CI, 255-367) and was not reached in the no-RT group. The probability of cardiac death increased with age and decreased with diagnosis year, and this trend was more pronounced in the RT group. Multivariate analysis found RT to be associated with higher probability of cardiac death (OR 1.23, 95% CI 1.03-1.47, HR 1.961, 95% CI 1.466-2.624). Lower esophageal subsite (33-40 cm) was also associated with a higher risk of cardiac death. Other variables were not associated with cardiac death. CONCLUSIONS: Recognizing the limitations of a SEER analysis including lack of comorbidity accountability, these data should prompt more definitive study as to whether a possible associative effect of RT on cardiac death could potentially be a causative effect.
26865924	Genome-wide association study for the interaction between BMR and BMI in obese Korean women including overweight.	BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: This is the first study to identify common genetic factors associated with the basal metabolic rate (BMR) and body mass index (BMI) in obese Korean women including overweight. This will be a basic study for future research of obese gene-BMR interaction. SUBJECTS/METHODS: The experimental design was 2 by 2 with variables of BMR and BMI. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) was conducted in the overweight and obesity (BMI > 23 kg/m(2)) compared to the normality, and in women with low BMR (< 1426.3 kcal/day) compared to high BMR. A total of 140 SNPs reached formal genome-wide statistical significance in this study (P < 1 x 10(-4)). Surveys to estimate energy intake using 24-h recall method for three days and questionnaires for family history, a medical examination, and physical activities were conducted. RESULTS: We found that two NRG3 gene SNPs in the 10q23.1 chromosomal region were highly associated with BMR (rs10786764; P = 8.0 x 10(-7), rs1040675; 2.3 x 10(-6)) and BMI (rs10786764; P = 2.5 x 10(-5), rs10786764; 6.57 x 10(-5)). The other genes related to BMI (HSD52, TMA16, MARCH1, NRG1, NRXN3, and STK4) yielded P <10 x 10(-4). Five new loci associated with BMR and BMI, including NRG3, OR8U8, BCL2L2-PABPN1, PABPN1, and SLC22A17 were identified in obese Korean women (P < 1 x 10(-4)). In the questionnaire investigation, significant differences were found in the number of starvation periods per week, family history of stomach cancer, coffee intake, and trial of weight control in each group. CONCLUSION: We discovered several common BMR- and BMI-related genes using GWAS. Although most of these newly established loci were not previously associated with obesity, they may provide new insights into body weight regulation. Our findings of five common genes associated with BMR and BMI in Koreans will serve as a reference for replication and validation of future studies on the metabolic rate.
27350741	Stability of tramadol with three 5-HT3 receptor antagonists in polyolefin bags for patient-controlled delivery systems.	BACKGROUND: Mixing 5-hydroxytryptamine-3 (5-HT3) receptor antagonists with patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) solutions of tramadol has been shown to decrease the incidence of nausea and vomiting associated with the use of tramadol PCA for postoperative pain. However, such mixtures are not commercially available, and the stability of the drug combinations has not been duly studied. The study aimed to evaluate the stability of tramadol with three 5-HT3 receptor antagonists in 0.9% sodium chloride injection for PCA administration. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Test samples were prepared by adding 1,000 mg tramadol hydrochloride, 8 mg ondansetron hydrochloride, and 6 mg granisetron hydrochloride or 5 mg tropisetron hydrochloride to 100 mL of 0.9% sodium chloride injection in polyolefin bags. The samples were prepared in triplicates, stored at either 25 degrees C or 4 degrees C for 14 days, and assessed using the following compatibility parameters: precipitation, cloudiness, discoloration, and pH. Chemical stability was also determined using a validated high-pressure liquid chromatography method. RESULTS: All of the mixtures were clear and colorless throughout the initial observation period. No change in the concentration of tramadol hydrochloride occurred with any of the 5-HT3 receptor antagonists during the 14 days. Similarly, little or no loss of the 5-HT3 receptor antagonists occurred over the 14-day period. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that mixtures of tramadol hydrochloride, ondansetron hydrochloride, granisetron hydrochloride, or tropisetron hydrochloride in 0.9% sodium chloride injection were physically and chemically stable for 14 days when stored in polyolefin bags at both 4 degrees C and 25 degrees C.
27420727	Missense Mutation of POU Domain Class 3 Transcription Factor 3 in Pou3f3L423P Mice Causes Reduced Nephron Number and Impaired Development of the Thick Ascending Limb of the Loop of Henle.	During nephrogenesis, POU domain class 3 transcription factor 3 (POU3F3 aka BRN1) is critically involved in development of distinct nephron segments, including the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle (TAL). Deficiency of POU3F3 in knock-out mice leads to underdevelopment of the TAL, lack of differentiation of TAL cells, and perinatal death due to renal failure. Pou3f3L423P mutant mice, which were established in the Munich ENU Mouse Mutagenesis Project, carry a recessive point mutation in the homeobox domain of POU3F3. Homozygous Pou3f3L423P mutants are viable and fertile. The present study used functional, as well as qualitative and quantitative morphological analyses to characterize the renal phenotype of juvenile (12 days) and aged (60 weeks) homo- and heterozygous Pou3f3L423P mutant mice and age-matched wild-type controls. In both age groups, homozygous mutants vs. control mice displayed significantly smaller kidney volumes, decreased nephron numbers and mean glomerular volumes, smaller TAL volumes, as well as lower volume densities of the TAL in the kidney. No histological or ultrastructural lesions of TAL cells or glomerular cells were observed in homozygous mutant mice. Aged homozygous mutants displayed increased serum urea concentrations and reduced specific urine gravity, but no evidence of glomerular dysfunction. These results confirm the role of POU3F3 in development and function of the TAL and provide new evidence for its involvement in regulation of the nephron number in the kidney. Therefore, Pou3f3L423P mutant mice represent a valuable research model for further analyses of POU3F3 functions, or for nephrological studies examining the role of congenital low nephron numbers.
27602293	A resource-based game theoretical approach for the paradox of the plankton.	The maintenance of species diversity is a central focus in ecology. It is not rare to observe more species than the number of limiting resources, especially in plankton communities. However, such high species diversity is hard to achieve in theory under the competitive exclusion principles, known as the plankton paradox. Previous studies often focus on the coexistence of predefined species and ignore the fact that species can evolve. We model multi-resource competitions using evolutionary games, where the number of species fluctuates under extinction and the appearance of new species. The interspecific and intraspecific competitions are captured by a dynamical payoff matrix, which has a size of the number of species. The competition strength (payoff entries) is obtained from comparing the capability of species in consuming resources, which can change over time. This allows for the robust coexistence of a large number of species, providing a possible solution to the plankton paradox.
27493839	Pathophysiological Function of ADAMTS Enzymes on Molecular Mechanism of Alzheimer's Disease.	The extracellular matrix (ECM) is an environment that has various enzymes attended in regeneration and restoration processes which is very important to sustain physiological and biological functions of central nervous system (CNS). One of the participating enzyme systems in ECM turnover is matrix metalloproteinases. A disintegrin-like and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin type 1 motifs (ADAMTS) is a unique family of ECM proteases found in mammals. Components of this family may be distinguished from the ADAM (A Disintegrin and Metalloproteinase) family based on the multiple copies of thrombospondin 1-like repeats. The considerable role of the ADAMTS in the CNS continues to develop. Evidences indicate that ADAMTS play an important role in neuroplasticity as well as nervous system pathologies such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). It is hopeful and possible that ADAMTS family members may be utilized to develop therapies for CNS pathologies, ischemic injuries, neurodegenerative and neurological diseases. To understand and provide definitive data on ADAMTS to improve structural and functional recovery in CNS injury and diseases, this review aimed to enlighten the subject extensively to reach certain information on metalloproteinases and related molecules/enzymes. It will be interesting to examine how ADAMTS expression and action would affect the initiation/progression of above-mentioned clinical situations, especially AD.
27128029	Pre-Hypertension among Young Adults (20-30 Years) in Coastal Villages of Udupi District in Southern India: An Alarming Scenario.	INTRODUCTION: According to Joint National Committee-7 (JNC-7) guidelines, a systolic blood pressure (SBP) of 120 to 139 mm Hg and/or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of 80 to 89 mm Hg is considered as pre-hypertension. Existing evidence suggest that the cardiovascular morbidities are increasing among pre-hypertensive individuals compared to normal. OBJECTIVE: To assess the magnitude and factors associated with pre-hypertension among young adults (20-30 years) in coastal villages of Udupi Taluk (an area of land with a city or town that serves as its administrative centre and usually a number of villages), Udupi District, Karnataka state, India. DESIGN: Community based cross sectional study. SETTING: 6 (out of total 14) coastal villages of Udupi Taluk, Karnataka state, India. SAMPLE: 1,152 young adults (age group: 20-30 years) selected by stratified random sampling in 6 coastal villages of Udupi Taluk, Karnataka state, India. METHOD: A semi structured pre-tested questionnaire was used to elicit the details on socio-demographic variables, dietary habits, tobacco use, alcohol consumption, physical activity, family history of hypertension and stress levels. Anthropometric measurements and blood pressure were recorded according to standard protocols. Serum cholesterol was measured in a sub sample of the study population. Multivariate logistic regression was applied to identify the independent correlates of pre-hypertension among young adults (20-30 years). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Prevalence, Odds ratio (OR) and adjusted (adj) OR for pre-hypertension among young adults (20-30 years). RESULTS: The prevalence of pre-hypertension in the study population was 45.2% (95%CI: 42.4-48). Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that age group of 25-30 years (adj OR: 4.25, 95% CI: 2.99-6.05), white collared (adj OR: 2.29, 95% CI: 1.08-4.85) and skilled occupation (adj OR: 3.24, 95% CI: 1.64-6.42), students (adj OR: 2.46, 95% CI: 1.22-4.95), using refined cooking oil (adj OR: 0.53, 95% CI: 0.29-0.95), extra salt in meals (adj OR: 2.46, 95% CI: 1.52-3.99), salty food items (adj OR: 6.99, 95% CI: 3.63-13.48), pre-obese (adj OR: 1.66, 95% CI: 1.03-2.67) and obese (adj OR: 9.16, 95% CI: 2.54, 36.4) were the significant correlates of pre-hypertension. CONCLUSION: In the study population, prevalence of pre-hypertension among young adults (20-30 years) was high (45.2%). Biological (age 25-30 years, pre-obesity and obesity) and behavioral (sedentary occupation, intake of extra salt in meals/salty food and not using refined cooking oil) factors were associated with pre-hypertension. Study emphasizes the need of community based screening of pre-hypertension under National Rural Health Mission. It also provides apt information for the evidence based designing of interventions for lifestyle modifications among high risk young adults in the study area.

We present the functional and structural effects of seven novel (p.Leu12Met, p.Arg16Cys, p.Ser101Asn, p.Ser202Gly, p.Pro267Leu, p.Gln389_Ala391del, and p.Thr450Met) and two previously reported but not studied (p.Ser113Phe and p.Thr450Pro) CYP21A2 mutations. Functional analyses were complemented with in silico prediction of mutation pathogenicity based on the recently crystallized human CYP21A2 structure. Mutated proteins were transiently expressed in COS-1 cells and enzyme activities towards 17-hydroxyprogesterone and progesterone were determined. Residual enzyme activities between 43% and 97% were obtained for p.Arg16Cys, p.Ser101Asn, p.Ser202Gly, p.Pro267Leu, and p.Thr450Met, similar to the activities of the well-known nonclassic mutations p.Pro453Ser and p.Pro482Ser, whereas the p.Leu12Met variant showed an activity of 100%. Conversely, the novel p.Ser113Phe, p.Gln389_Ala391del, and p.Thr450Pro mutations drastically reduced the enzyme function below 4%. The Km values for all novel variants were in the same order of magnitude as for the wild-type protein except for p.The450Met. The maximum velocity was decreased for all mutants except for p.Leu12Met. We conclude that p.Leu12Met is a normal variant; the mutations p.Arg16Cys, p.Ser101Asn, p.Ser202Gly, p.Pro267Leu, and p.Thr450Met could be associated with very mild nonclassic CAH, and the mutations p.Ser113Phe, p.Gln389_Ala391del, and p.Thr450Pro are associated with classic CAH. The obtained residual activities indicated a good genotype-phenotype correlation.
27445687	A Recombinant Human Pluripotent Stem Cell Line Stably Expressing Halide-Sensitive YFP-I152L for GABAAR and GlyR-Targeted High-Throughput Drug Screening and Toxicity Testing.	GABAARs and GlyRs are considered attractive drug targets for therapeutic intervention and are also increasingly recognized in the context of in vitro neurotoxicity (NT) and developmental neurotoxicity (DNT) testing. However, systematic human-specific GABAAR and GlyR-targeted drug screening and toxicity testing is hampered due to lack of appropriate in vitro models that express native GABAARs and GlyRs. We have established a human pluripotent stem cell line (NT2) stably expressing YFP-I152L, a halide-sensitive variant of yellow fluorescent protein (YFP), allowing for fluorescence-based functional analysis of chloride channels. Upon stimulation with retinoic acid, NT2 cells undergo neuronal differentiation and allow pharmacological and toxicological evaluation of native GABAARs and GlyRs at different stages of brain maturation. We applied the cell line in concentration-response experiments with the neurotransmitters GABA and glycine as well as with the drugs strychnine, picrotoxin, fipronil, lindane, bicuculline, and zinc and demonstrate that the established in vitro model is applicable to GABAAR and GlyR-targeted pharmacological and toxicological profiling. We quantified the proportion of GABAAR and GlyR-sensitive cells, respectively, and identified percentages of approximately 20% each within the overall populations, rendering the cells a suitable model for systematic in vitro GABAAR and GlyR-targeted screening in the context of drug development and NT/DNT testing.
28119800	Ulna Rotation Osteotomy in Complete Dislocation of the Distal Radioulnar Joint.	Background Complete dislocation of the distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ) is a rare injury. Dislocation can present as uni- or multidirectional, acute or chronic, reducible or irreducible. It can occur due to isolated loss of ligamentous restraints or more frequent in Galeazzi - or Essex-Lopresti-type fractures. Case Description A 28-year-old man sustained a distal radius fracture and presented after conservative treatment with blocked supination. Examination revealed a malunion of the distal radius in combination with an irreducible dorsal dislocation of the DRUJ. Corrective osteotomy of the distal radius was performed, the DRUJ was reduced, and the ulnar avulsed triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) refixed with transosseous sutures. Redislocation occurred 8 weeks later. Revision surgery showed a palmar dislocated TFC fixed in a palmar scar formation along the distal interosseous membrane (DIOM). The scar was released and a rotation osteotomy of the distal ulna was performed. At follow-up, the patient was pain-free, had good range of motion, and returned to work and sport activities. Literature Review For reconstruction of chronic complete dislocations of the DRUJ, ligament plasty procedures are described. In case of additional cartilage damage, salvage procedures are recommended. Clinical Relevance We report a procedure in which the rotation of the distal ulna is corrected to restore DRUJ congruity in chronic dislocations. The rotation osteotomy described is useful in gross ligamentous instability following loss of constraint by the TFCC and the DIOM.
26850797	Immediate effect of basic body awareness therapy on heart rate variability.	OBJECTIVE: To determine the immediate effect of a Basic Body Awareness Therapy (BAT) session on measures of heart rate variability (HRV) in healthy young people. METHODS: 13 healthy young subjects of both genders, who showed no illnesses related to the autonomic nervous system (ANS) underwent an ANS evaluation before and after conducting a session of BAT. The assessment of ANS activity was conducted through the HR with the aid of Nerve-Express((R)) software. The BAT session lasted for 50 min and was performed by one investigator (blinded to the assessment procedures). RESULTS: After BAT session significant improvement was found in the sympathetic and parasympathetic modulation (p < 0.05), and the general estimate of heart rate variability (p < 0.04). CONCLUSION: BAT was found to be an effective, easy to apply and inexpensive therapeutic technique, able to change ANS in order to improve HR which may suggest better health conditions for participating individuals.
27065941	Influence of Formal Education on Cognitive Reserve in Patients with Multiple Sclerosis.	The concept of cognitive reserve (CR) and its influence on cognitive impairment has attracted increasing interest. One hundred twenty-eight patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) from Southern Germany were evaluated during the years 2000 to 2012. Twenty-seven neuropsychological (NP) tests were applied regarding basic cognitive functions, attention, executive functions, visual perception and construction, memory and learning, problem solving, and language. By this retrospective approach, a comprehensive NP profile of the investigated individuals was established. An effect of timespan of formal education on CR was observed. Enrichment by reading, physical activities, and challenging vocational practices had more profound effects in patients who had undergone a shorter educational period compared to a longer educational period. In summary, our study demonstrates that the advantage of longer formal education periods, compared to shorter formal education periods, can be counterbalanced by high frequencies of reading, physical activities, and challenging vocational practices in patients with MS.
26869221	A clinical comparison of extraoral panoramic and intraoral radiographic modalities for detecting proximal caries and visualizing open posterior interproximal contacts.	OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to compare extraoral panoramic bitewings (BWs) to intraoral photostimulable phosphor (PSP) plate BWs for the detection of proximal surface caries and to establish if there was any difference between extraoral BWs, intraoral BWs and panoramic radiographs in visualizing open posterior interproximal contacts. METHODS: Extraoral panoramic and intraoral BW images were acquired on each of 20 patients, resulting in 489 total non-restored, readable surfaces that were evaluated by 4 observers. The ANOVA analysis to determine diagnostic variability between and within each subject was utilized. The surfaces included in the study extended from the distal of each canine to the last posterior contact in each arch with non-readable proximal surfaces excluded (i.e.surfaces where over half the enamel layer was overlapped or where those surfaces were not visible in one or both modalities). RESULTS: The statistical analysis indicated that the overall mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curves across all observers for the intraoral BWs and extraoral panoramic BWs were 0.832 and 0.827, respectively, and the difference of 0.005 was not significant at p = 0.7781. The percentage of non-readable proximal surfaces across the three modalities was 4.1% for intraoral BWs, 18.3% for extraoral panoramic BWs and 51.5% for the standard panoramic images. CONCLUSIONS: The investigators concluded there was no significant difference in posterior proximal surface caries detection between the modalities. Extraoral panoramic BWs were much better than panoramic radiographs in visualizing open posterior interproximal contacts, 81.7% vs 48.5%, but below the 95.9% value for intraoral BWs.
27279949	[An original revealing mode of sarcoidosis: Sweet's syndrome].	Sweet's syndrome is a neutrophilic dermatosis which usually presents as an idiopathic disorder. The combination of Sweet's syndrome and sarcoidosis is rare. We report the clinical case of a Sweet's syndrome revealing sarcoidosis.
27907097	Levels of Selected Persistent Organic Pollutants (PCB, PBDE) and Pesticides in Honey Bee Pollen Sampled in Poland.	Chemical plant protection is a commonly discussed factor potentially responsible for decline in pollinators and other beneficial insect populations. Various groups of chemicals including persistent organic pollutants could impact a bee colony's welfare and are reported to be present in bee tissue and apiary products. The aim of this work was to evaluate the presence of selected persistent organic pollutant and pesticide residues in bee pollen originating from different geographical regions of Poland. Pesticide residues were identified in 60% of tested bee pollen samples. The compounds identified were mainly active ingredients of fungicide preparations. Insecticide active ingredients were up to 30% of the identified residues. The triazole fungicide tebuconazole and the neonicotinoid insecticide thiacloprid were the most frequently found pesticides in pollen. The highest pesticide concentration was determined for prothioconazole (356 mug kg-1). Mean concentrations of chlorinated biphenyls-EC6 and EC12 were 194 pg g-1 and 74 pg g-1, respectively. CB # 28 has the greatest share in the EC6 profile (mean 61 pg g-1, 31% contribution). Relatively high contributions were also observed for CBs # 101 (35 pg g-1, 18%), # 138 (36 pg g-1, 19%) and # 153 (33 pg g-1, 17%). CB # 114 and 118 have the highest share in the dioxin-like biphenyls fraction with mean concentrations of 17.6 and 37.6 pg g-1 (respectively 23 and 50%). Mean calculated concentrations of 39 polybrominated diphenyl ether congeners (Sigma39 BDE) were 20 +/- 27.7 pg g-1. High variability was observed between maximal and minimal determined concentration values. Individual BDEs were found at different frequencies and varying concentration levels. BDEs # 47, 75 and 99 dominated the profile with average concentrations of 3 pg g-1, 3.1 pg g-1, and 2.9 pg g-1, respectively.
27224872	Associations between body fat distribution, insulin resistance and dyslipidaemia in black and white South African women.	AIM: The aim was to examine differences in body fat distribution between premenopausal black and white South African (SA) women and explore the ethnic-specific associations with cardiometabolic risk. METHODS: Body composition, using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and computerised tomography, insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and lipid levels were assessed in 288 black and 197 white premenopausal SA women. RESULTS: Compared to the white women, black women had less central and more peripheral (lower-body) fat, and lower serum lipid and glucose concentrations, but similar homeostasis models for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) values. The associations between body fat distribution and HOMA-IR, triglyceride and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations were similar, while the associations with fasting glucose, total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels differed between black and white women. CONCLUSION: Ethnic differences in body fat distribution are associated, in part, with differences in cardiometabolic risk between black and white SA women.
26941448	ABC3 Consensus Commented from the Perspective of the German Guidelines: Third International Consensus Conference for Advanced Breast Cancer (ABC3), Lisbon, 07. 11. 2015.	The Third International Consensus Conference for Advanced Breast Cancer ABC3 on the diagnosis and treatment of advanced breast cancer was held in Lisbon from 5 to 7 November 2015. This year the focus was the treatment of metastatic breast cancer (stage IV) - including the patient perspectives. Important topics were questions relating to quality of life, the care for long-term survivors as well as the management of disease-related symptoms and treatment-based side effects. The use of standardised tools to assess individual treatment success and the benefits of new substances were important points for discussion. The diagnosis and treatment of inoperable locally advanced breast cancer were discussed two years ago during the ABC2 consensus 1. A working group of German breast cancer experts commented on the results of the ABC panellists, paying particular attention to the German guidelines (AGO, S3, DGHO) on the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer 2, 3, 4, 5 in Germany.
27529349	Changes in Body Mass Index in Girls with Idiopathic Central Precocious Puberty under Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone Analogue Therapy: The Spanish Registry.	BACKGROUND: The influence of gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogue (GnRHa) treatment on body mass index (BMI) evolution in girls with idiopathic central precocious puberty (CPP) is unclear. Hence, we aimed to evaluate the effect of GnRHa treatment on BMI-standard deviation score (SDS) from diagnosis of idiopathic CPP until adult height. METHODS: An observational study of girls diagnosed with CPP in Spain was carried out between January 2008 and December 2014. A computer program was designed to process clinical and biological data from patients treated in 55 departments of pediatric endocrinology throughout the country. The inclusion criteria were (1) girls diagnosed with CPP before 8 years of age; (2) born after 1992; (3) with a difference between bone and chronological age of at least 1 year, and (4) with a luteinizing hormone peak >7 U/l during luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone testing. The influence of GnRHa treatment on BMI-SDS evolution was analyzed. RESULTS: Data from 333 girls (22.2% adopted) were evaluated. We report follow-up data at 6, 12, 24, 36, 48 and 60 months and adult height from 269, 232, 198, 153, 105, 56 and 49 girls, respectively. During treatment, there was an increase in BMI-SDS of 0.43 +/- 1.17 (95% CI: 0.20-0.64). At adult height (n = 49), BMI-SDS was 1.51 +/- 1.38, which was 0.60 +/- 1.09 higher than at diagnosis (95% CI: 0.43-0.75). CONCLUSIONS: During treatment with GnRHa, girls experience a significant increase in BMI-SDS that persists after therapy is stopped and adult height has been reached. (c) 2016 S. Karger AG, Basel.
27524922	A case of optic-nerve hypoplasia and anterior segment abnormality associated with facial cleft.	INTRODUCTION: The incidence of facial cleft is rare and ranges between 1.43 and 4.85 per 100,000 births. To date, there have been few reports of detailed ophthalmologic examinations performed in cases of facial cleft. Here, we report a case of optic-nerve hypoplasia and anterior segment abnormality associated with facial cleft. CASE REPORT: A 9-day-old female infant was delivered by cesarian section at 34 weeks of gestational age (the second baby of twins) and weighed 2,276 g upon presentation. She had a facial cleft and ectrodactyly at birth. Right eye-dominant blepharophimosis was obvious. Examination of the right eye revealed inferior corneal opacity with vascularization, downward corectopia, and optic-nerve hypoplasia. The corneal diameter was 8 mm in both eyes, and tonometry by use of a Tono-Pen((R)) XL (Reichert Technologies, Depew, NY, USA) handheld applanation tonometer revealed that her intraocular pressure was 11-22 mmHg (Oculus Dexter) and 8 mmHg (Oculus Sinister). B-mode echo revealed no differences in axial length between her right and left eyes. When she was 15-16 months old, we attempted to examine her eyes before she underwent plastic surgery under general anesthesia. She had a small optic disc in both eyes and the right-eye disc was tilted. After undergoing canthotomy, gonioscopy and ultrasound biomicroscopy revealed that almost all directions were open except for the peripheral anterior synechia. Since magnetic resonance imaging revealed ventriculomegaly associated with an interhemispheric cyst at birth, a ventriculoperitoneal shunt was inserted at 12 days of age. At 25 months of age, her condition suddenly deteriorated due to occlusion of the ventricular shunt catheter, and she died 5 days later. In this patient, amniotic band syndrome was presumed to be the primary cause due to the clinical findings. CONCLUSION: We experienced a case of optic-nerve hypoplasia and anterior segment abnormality that occurred with facial cleft. The cause of these abnormalities is unclear, yet amniotic band syndrome is a possible candidate.
26863917	Multimodality Imaging Strategies for the Assessment of Aortic Stenosis: Viewpoint of the Heart Valve Clinic International Database (HAVEC) Group.	Aortic stenosis is the most frequent valvular heart disease. In aortic stenosis, therapeutic decision essentially depends on symptomatic status, stenosis severity, and status of left ventricular systolic function. Surgical aortic valve replacement or transcatheter aortic valve implantation is the sole effective therapy in symptomatic patients with severe aortic stenosis, whereas the management of asymptomatic patients remains controversial and is mainly based on individual risk stratification. Imaging is fundamental for the initial diagnostic work-up, follow-up, and selection of the optimal timing and type of intervention. The present review provides specific recommendations for utilization of multimodality imaging to optimize risk stratification and therapeutic decision-making processes in aortic stenosis.
27200137	[Scooter accidents in children at Aristide Le Dantec, Unversity Hospital of Dakar: a study of 74 cases].	INTRODUCTION: Scooter accidents are becoming more frequent in Dakar. The purpose of this study is to report the epidemiological and lesional aspects of these accidents on children in Dakar. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective and descriptive study was conducted in Pediatric Surgery Unit of the Aristide Le Dantec Hospital in Dakar from January 1st, 2009 to December 31, 2011. Various parameters were studied. These parameters include: frequency, sociodemographic and lesional aspects. RESULTS: Scooter accidents represent 12% of highway accidents. They were more frequent in the day, from 12 am to 2 pm (27%) and in the night, from 6 pm to 8 pm (28.4%). They might occur every day but were more frequent during April (17.6%) and June (13.5%). They occurred mainly in the suburban district of Dakar (78%). The age group most affected was the one from 3 to 8 years (60.8%). Male gender was predominant (sex ratio 1.5). Pedestrians are the most vulnerable (93.2%). The fall was the dominant mechanism (98.7%). Lesions affected mainly the lower limb (51.1%) and were essentially constituted by fracture. CONCLUSION: The frequency of scooter accidents in children is related to the galloping urbanization and to the increase of the number of cars on the roads in the peninsula. Victims are essentially pedestrians and present most of the time fractures.
27313885	Redo Surgery after Failed Open VBG: Laparoscopic Minigastric Bypass versus Laparoscopic Roux en Y Gastric Bypass-Which Is Better?	Background. Long-term studies have reported that the rate of conversion surgeries after open VBG ranged from 49.7 to 56%. This study is aiming to compare between LMGB and LRYGB as conversion surgeries after failed open VBG with respect to indications and operative and postoperative outcomes. Methods. Sixty patients (48 females and 12 males) presenting with failed VBG, with an average BMI of 39.7 kg/m(2) ranging between 26.5 kg/m(2) and 53 kg/m(2), and a mean age of 38.7 ranging between 24 and 51 years were enrolled in this study. Operative and postoperative data was recorded up to one year after the operation. Results. MGB is a simple procedure that is associated with short operative time and low rate of complications. However, MGB may not be applicable in all cases with failed VBG and therefore RYGB may be needed in such cases. Conclusion. LMGB is a safe and feasible revisional bariatric surgery after failed VBG and can achieve early good weight loss results similar to that of LRYGP. However, the decision to convert to lap RYGB or MGB should be taken intraoperatively depending mainly on the actual intraoperative pouch length.
27092279	Salvage Brachytherapy for Biochemically Recurrent Prostate Cancer following Primary Brachytherapy.	Purpose. In this study, we evaluated our experience with salvage brachytherapy after discovery of biochemical recurrence after a prior brachytherapy procedure. Methods and Materials. From 2001 through 2012 twenty-one patients treated by brachytherapy within University of Kentucky or from outside centers developed biochemical failure and had no evidence of metastases. Computed tomography (CT) scans were evaluated; patients who had an underseeded portion of their prostate were considered for reimplantation. Results. The majority of the patients in this study (61.9%) were low risk and median presalvage PSA was 3.49 (range 17.41-1.68). Mean follow-up was 61 months. At last follow-up after reseeding, 11/21 (52.4%) were free of biochemical recurrence. There was a trend towards decreased freedom from biochemical recurrence in low risk patients (p = 0.12). International Prostate Symptom Scores (IPSS) increased at 3-month follow-up visits but decreased and were equivalent to baseline scores at 18 months. Conclusions. Salvage brachytherapy after primary brachytherapy is possible; however, in our experience the side-effect profile after the second brachytherapy procedure was higher than after the first brachytherapy procedure. In this cohort of patients we demonstrate that approximately 50% oncologic control, low risk patients appear to have better outcomes than others.
27096799	Effects of the platelet-activating factor (PAF) on selected quality parameters of cryopreserved bull semen (AI) with reduced sperm motility.	The aim of the study was to determine the effects of platelet-activating factor (PAF) on selected quality parameters of cryopreserved bull semen with reduced sperm motility used for artificial insemination. The aim of experiment 1 was to identify the optimal concentration of the phospholipid able to preserve sperm viability. Cryopreserved semen was treated with different PAF concentrations: 1x10(-5) M, 1x10(-6) M, 1x10(-7) M, 1x10(-8) M and 1x10(-9) M. The experiment demonstrated that PAF at concentration 1x10(-9) M increased most the sperm viability parameters (motility parameters, plasma membrane integrity and mitochondrial function) after 120 min of incubation of thawed semen at 37 degrees C. Cryopreserved bull semen with reduced sperm motility (below 70%) was supplemented with PAF in a concentration of 1x10(-9) M. A statistically significant increase in sperm motility, percentage of linear motile spermatozoa and VSL value was observed after 120 min incubation of sperm with 1x10(-9) M PAF. Sperm supplementation with PAF also had positive effects on plasma membrane integrity and percentage of spermatozoa with preserved mitochondrial transmembrane potential, but the differences were not statistically significant. The results indicated positive effects of PAF supplementation at a concentration of 1x10(-9) M on the selected sperm quality parameters in cryopreserved bull semen with reduced motility.

On the 8th week of the experiment observed the progression of degenerative, necroinflammatory processes expressed hydropic dystrophy, atomizing steatosis and the appearance of periportal fibrosis.
26893268	Simultaneous quantitative analysis of nine vitamin D compounds in human blood using LC-MS/MS.	AIM: It has been suggested that each member of the family of vitamin D compounds may have different function(s). Therefore, selective quantification of each compound is important in clinical research. MATERIALS & METHODS: Development and validation attempts of a simultaneous determination method of 12 vitamin D compounds in human blood using precolumn derivatization followed by LC-MS/MS is described. Internal standard calibration with 12 stable isotope labeled analogs was used to correct for matrix effects in MS detector. RESULTS & CONCLUSION: Nine vitamin D compounds were quantifiable in blood samples with detection limits within femtomole levels. Serum (compared with plasma) was found to be a more suitable sample type, and protein precipitation (compared with saponification) a more effective extraction method for vitamin D assay.
27150364	Heterocyclic Naphthalimides as New Skeleton Structure of Compounds with Increasingly Expanding Relational Medicinal Applications.	Naphthalimide compounds are an important type of nitrogen-containing aromatic heterocycles with cyclic double imides and the naphthalene framework. This pi-deficient large conjugated planar structure enables naphthalimide derivatives to readily interact with various biological cations, anions, small molecules and macromolecules such as DNAs, enzymes and recetors in living organism via noncovalent bonds, therefore exhibiting extensive potentiality in relatively medicinal applications. Currently, some naphthalimides as anticancer agents have entered into clinical trials and other naphthalimide-based medicinal developments as potential drugs for treatment of various diseases are actively and unprecedentedly expanding. Naphthalimide-derived artificial ion receptors, fluorescent probes and cell imaging agents are being overwhelmingly investigated and have a diversity of potential applications in real-time detecting ions and biomolecules, understanding biological processes and determining pharmacological and pharmacokinetic properties. All the above mentions have strongly implied that naphthalimide-based derivatives as new skeleton structure of compounds possess increasingly expanding relational medicinal applications, and the related research is becoming a quite attractive active topic and newly rising highlight. Combining with our research and referring other works from literature, this work systematically reviews the current research and development of heterocyclic naphthalimides as anticancer, antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral, anti-inflammatory, antidepressant agents as well as artificial cation and anion receptors, diagnostic agents and pathologic probes, and cell imaging agents for biologically important species. Some rational design strategies, structure-activity relationships and action mechanisms are discussed. The perspectives of the future development of naphthalimide-based medicinal chemistry are also presented.
27110716	Nox4 and Duox1/2 Mediate Redox Activation of Mesenchymal Cell Migration by PDGF.	Platelet derived growth factor (PDGF) orchestrates wound healing and tissue regeneration by regulating recruitment of the precursor mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) and fibroblasts. PDGF stimulates generation of hydrogen peroxide that is required for cell migration, but the sources and intracellular targets of H2O2 remain obscure. Here we demonstrate sustained live responses of H2O2 to PDGF and identify PKB/Akt, but not Erk1/2, as the target for redox regulation in cultured 3T3 fibroblasts and MSC. Apocynin, cell-permeable catalase and LY294002 inhibited PDGF-induced migration and mitotic activity of these cells indicating involvement of PI3-kinase pathway and H2O2. Real-time PCR revealed Nox4 and Duox1/2 as the potential sources of H2O2. Silencing of Duox1/2 in fibroblasts or Nox4 in MSC reduced PDGF-stimulated intracellular H2O2, PKB/Akt phosphorylation and migration, but had no such effect on Erk1/2. In contrast to PDGF, EGF failed to increase cytoplasmic H2O2, phosphorylation of PKB/Akt and migration of fibroblasts and MSC, confirming the critical impact of redox signaling. We conclude that PDGF-induced migration of mesenchymal cells requires Nox4 and Duox1/2 enzymes, which mediate redox-sensitive activation of PI3-kinase pathway and PKB/Akt.
27977818	Response of Dental Pulp Stem Cells to Synthetic, Allograft, and Xenograft Bone Scaffolds.	Different degrees of clinical success have been reported for synthetic, allograft, and xenograft bone substitutes in human trials. Although these substitutes have been clinically investigated, their in vitro effects on cell differentiation remain unclear. Proliferation, differentiation, and attachment of dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs) to beta-tricalcium phosphate (beta-TCP), freeze-dried bone allograft (FDBA), and deproteinized bovine bone mineral (DBBM) were compared in this study. MTT assay, measurement of total DNA, and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction were performed. beta-TCP had the highest potential for DPSC attachment and proliferation, while FDBA induced osteoblastic differentiation of DPSCs. Further in vivo investigations are necessary to select a clinically appropriate scaffold.
26981756	Antiseptics and microcosm biofilm formation on titanium surfaces.	Oral rehabilitation with osseointegrated implants is a way to restore esthetics and masticatory function in edentulous patients, but bacterial colonization around the implants may lead to mucositis or peri-implantitis and consequent implant loss. Peri-implantitis is the main complication of oral rehabilitation with dental implants and, therefore, it is necessary to take into account the potential effects of antiseptics such as chlorhexidine (CHX), chloramine T (CHT), triclosan (TRI), and essential oils (EO) on bacterial adhesion and on biofilm formation. To assess the action of these substances, we used the microcosm technique, in which the oral environment and periodontal conditions are simulated in vitro on titanium discs with different surface treatments (smooth surface - SS, acid-etched smooth surface - AESS, sand-blasted surface - SBS, and sand-blasted and acid-etched surface - SBAES). Roughness measurements yielded the following results: SS: 0.47 microm, AESS: 0.43 microm, SB: 0.79 microm, and SBAES: 0.72 microm. There was statistical difference only between SBS and AESS. There was no statistical difference among antiseptic treatments. However, EO and CHT showed lower bacterial counts compared with the saline solution treatment (control group). Thus, the current gold standard (CHX) did not outperform CHT and EO, which were efficient in reducing the biofilm biomass compared with saline solution.
26926718	[Pregnancy-related anxiety and subthreshold autism trait in preschool children based a birth cohort study].	OBJECTIVE: To analyze the associations between pregnancy-related anxiety and the prevalence of subthreshold autism trait (SAT) in preschool children. METHODS: Baseline data came from the Ma'anshan Birth Cohort Study, a part of the China-Anhui Birth Cohort Study (C-ABCS). All the participants were enrolled among pregnant women who received prenatal health care in 4 municipal medical centers during Oct. 2008 to Oct. 2010. A total of 5 084 pregnant women were recruited at the beginning and 4 669 singleton live births were included until childbirth. The situation about pregnancy-specific anxiety during trimester and third trimester of women were evaluated by Pregnancy-specific Anxiety Questionnaire (PAQ). Between April 2014 and April 2015, the cohort was followed up again, and the Clancy Autism Behavior Scale (CABRS) filled out by parents was used for telling the SAT children from the healthy children among 3 663 preschool children. Univariate and binary regression model was used to estimate associations between the pregnancy-related anxiety during trimester and third trimester and the subthreshold autism trait in children. RESULTS: During the pregnancy, the detected rates of women with pregnancy-specific anxiety in trimester and the third trimester were 25.5%(935/3 663), 13.9%(501/3 592) respectively, and the detected rate of maternal pregnancy-specific anxiety in both periods was 7.7%(278/3 592). There were 290 positive children with SAT and the detection rate was 7.9%. After controlling possible confounding factors including children's genders, place of residence, supplement folic acid during pregnancy, preterm birth, exposure to second-hand smoke during pregnancy, the father (mother) cultural levels, the father (mother) nature of work and family income, the results of multinomial logistic regression analysis showed that maternal pregnancy-specific anxiety in trimester was the risk factor for SAT in preschool children (OR=1.51, 95% CI: 1.11-2.04), and there was no association between maternal pregnancy-specific anxiety in the third trimester and SAT in preschool children (OR=1.36, 95% CI: 0.82-2.22). Compared with the single function of maternal pregnancy-specific anxiety in trimester or the third trimester for SAT in preschool children, maternal pregnancy-specific anxiety in both periods presented a joint action that increasing the risk for SAT (OR=2.02, 95% CI: 1.36-2.98). CONCLUSION: Maternal pregnancy-related anxiety was a risk factor for subthreshold autism trait in preschooler children. Pregnant women should try to keep a good mental state to create a good environment for fetal growth.
27314055	NKG2C(+)CD57(+) Natural Killer Cell Expansion Parallels Cytomegalovirus-Specific CD8(+) T Cell Evolution towards Senescence.	Objective. Measuring NKG2C(+)CD57(+) natural killer (NK) cell expansion to investigate NK responses against human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) and assessing relationships with adaptive immunity against HCMV. Methods. Expansion of NKG2C(+)CD57(+) NK was measured in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from groups distinguished by HCMV and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection status. Anti-HCMV antibody levels against HCMV-infected MRC-5 cell lysate were assessed by ELISA and HCMV-specific CD8(+) T cell responses characterized by intracellular flow cytometry following PBMC stimulation with immunodominant HCMV peptides. Results. Median NK, antibody, and CD8(+) T cell responses against HCMV were significantly greater in the HCMV/HIV coinfected group than the group infected with CMV alone. The fraction of CMV-specific CD8(+) T cells expressing CD28 correlated inversely with NKG2C(+)CD57(+) NK expansion in HIV infection. Conclusion. Our data reveal no significant direct relationships between NK and adaptive immunity against HCMV. However, stronger NK and adaptive immune responses against HCMV and an inverse correlation between NKG2C(+)CD57(+) NK expansion and proliferative reserve of HCMV-specific CD8(+) T cells, as signified by CD28 expression, indicate parallel evolution of NK and T cell responses against HCMV in HIV infection. Similar aspects of chronic HCMV infection may drive both NK and CD8(+) T cell memory inflation.
26884406	Collagenoma in an African Clawed Frog (Xenopus laevis).	A 3-y-old female Xenopus laevis was reported for a gray mass on the abdomen. The frog was used for egg collection and was otherwise experimentally naive. On physical exam, the frog was bright and active and had a firm, gray, lobulated mass (1.5 cm x 0.5 cm x 0.5 cm) in the cutaneous tissue of the left lateral abdomen. An excisional biopsy was performed under anesthesia, and the entire mass was removed and processed for histopathology. Microscopically, the dermis was greatly expanded by connective tissue with a marked decrease in the number of glands, and occasional degenerative glands were present. When stained with Masson trichrome, the excessive connective tissue stained blue, indicating that it was composed of collagen. With Verhoeff-van Gieson staining, the connective tissue stained bright red with an absence of black-staining material, demonstrating the presence of collagen and ruling out elastic fibers. In light of the morphology of the mass and the results of the special stains, the mass was diagnosed as a collagenoma. To our knowledge, this report is the first description of a collagenoma in X. laevis.
27375666	Crossing Methods and Cultivation Conditions for Rapid Production of Segregating Populations in Three Grain Amaranth Species.	Grain amaranths (Amaranthus spp.) have been cultivated for thousands of years in Central and South America. Their grains are of high nutritional value, but the low yield needs to be increased by selection of superior genotypes from genetically diverse breeding populations. Amaranths are adapted to harsh conditions and can be cultivated on marginal lands although little is known about their physiology. The development of controlled growing conditions and efficient crossing methods is important for research on and improvement of this ancient crop. Grain amaranth was domesticated in the Americas and is highly self-fertilizing with a large inflorescence consisting of thousands of very small flowers. We evaluated three different crossing methods (open pollination, hot water emasculation and hand emasculation) for their efficiency in amaranth and validated them with genetic markers. We identified cultivation conditions that allow an easy control of flowering time by day length manipulation and achieved flowering times of 4 weeks and generation times of 2 months. All three different crossing methods successfully produced hybrid F1 offspring, but with different success rates. Open pollination had the lowest (10%) and hand emasculation the highest success rate (74%). Hot water emasculation showed an intermediate success rate (26%) with a maximum of 94% success. It is simple to perform and suitable for a more large-scale production of hybrids. We further evaluated 11 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers and found that they were sufficient to validate all crosses of the genotypes used in this study for intra- and interspecific hybridizations. Despite its very small flowers, crosses in amaranth can be carried out efficiently and evaluated with inexpensive SNP markers. Suitable growth conditions strongly reduce the generation time and allow the control of plant height, flowering time, and seed production. In combination, this enables the rapid production of segregating populations which makes amaranth an attractive model for basic plant research but also facilitates further the improvement of this ancient crop by plant breeding.
26862216	Inositol polyphosphate multikinase (IPMK) in transcriptional regulation and nuclear inositide metabolism.	Inositol polyphosphate multikinase (IPMK, ipk2, Arg(82), ArgRIII) is an inositide kinase with unusually flexible substrate specificity and the capacity to partake in many functional protein-protein interactions (PPIs). By merging these two activities, IPMK is able to execute gene regulatory functions that are very unique and only now beginning to be recognized. In this short review, we present a brief history of IPMK, describe the structural biology of the enzyme and highlight a few recent discoveries that have shed more light on the role IPMK plays in inositide metabolism, nuclear signalling and transcriptional regulation.
27006839	Unilateral Absence of Mental Foramen with Surgical Exploration in a Living Human Subject.	The mental foramen (MF) is an important anatomic landmark of the mandible, in which the somatic afferent sensory nerve of the mandibular nerve emerges as mental nerve and blood vessels. The identification and actual location of MF are important in order to avoid sensory dysfunction or paresthesia due to mental nerve injury. In the literature there are some rare reports on the anatomical variations of the MF such as its location or presence of accessory foramina. The present report describes the absence of mental foramina on the left side of the mandible, as detected by cone-beam computed tomography before impacted tooth removal and observed directly during surgery.
27512373	Gabor frame sets of invariance: a Hamiltonian approach to Gabor frame deformations.	In this work we study families of pairs of window functions and lattices which lead to Gabor frames which all possess the same frame bounds. To be more precise, for every generalized Gaussian g, we will construct an uncountable family of lattices [Formula: see text] such that each pairing of g with some [Formula: see text] yields a Gabor frame, and all pairings yield the same frame bounds. On the other hand, for each lattice we will find a countable family of generalized Gaussians [Formula: see text] such that each pairing leaves the frame bounds invariant. Therefore, we are tempted to speak about Gabor Frame Sets of Invariance.
27999705	Urethral Leiomyoma: A Rare Clinical Entity.	Extrauterine leiomyomas are encountered occasionally, which can pose a diagnostic dilemma and challenge to the gynaecologist. We report a rare case of urethral leiomyoma. A 31-year-old woman with history of primary subfertility presented with mass at her urethral meatus and lower urinary tract symptoms. She underwent examination under anaesthesia and excision of the urethral mass. Histopathological examination confirmed leiomyoma. Diagnosis and management of this common growth situated at a rare location were reviewed and discussed.
27918576	RESPECT-ED: Rates of Pulmonary Emboli (PE) and Sub-Segmental PE with Modern Computed Tomographic Pulmonary Angiograms in Emergency Departments: A Multi-Center Observational Study Finds Significant Yield Variation, Uncorrelated with Use or Small PE Rates.	INTRODUCTION: Overuse of CT Pulmonary Angiograms (CTPA) for diagnosing pulmonary embolism (PE), particularly in Emergency Departments (ED), is considered problematic. Marked variations in positive CTPA rates are reported, with American 4-10% yields driving most concerns. Higher resolution CTPA may increase sub-segmental PE (SSPE) diagnoses, which may be up to 40% false positive. Excessive use and false positives could increase harm vs. benefit. These issues have not been systematically examined outside America. AIMS: To describe current yield variation and CTPA utilisation in Australasian ED, exploring potential factors correlated with variation. METHODS: A retrospective multi-centre review of consecutive ED-ordered CTPA using standard radiology reports. ED CTPA report data were inputted onto preformatted data-sheets. The primary outcome was site level yield, analysed both intra-site and against a nominated 15.3% yield. Factors potentially associated with yield were assessed for correlation. RESULTS: Fourteen radiology departments (15 ED) provided 7077 CTPA data (94% >/=64-slice CT); PE were reported in 1028 (yield 14.6% (95%CI 13.8-15.4%; range 9.3-25.3%; site variation p <0.0001) with four sites significantly below and one above the 15.3% target. Admissions, CTPA usage, PE diagnosis rates and size of PE were uncorrelated with yield. Large PE (>/=lobar) were 55% (CI: 52.1-58.2%) and SSPE 8.8% (CI: 7.1-10.5%) of positive scans. CTPA usage (0.2-1.5% adult attendances) was correlated (p<0.006) with PE diagnosis but not SSPE: large PE proportions. DISCUSSION/ CONCLUSIONS: We found significant intra-site CTPA yield variation within Australasia. Yield was not clearly correlated with CTPA usage or increased small PE rates. Both SSPE and large PE rates were similar to higher yield historical cohorts. CTPA use was considerably below USA 2.5-3% rates. Higher CTPA utilisation was positively correlated with PE diagnoses, but without evidence of increased proportions of small PE. This suggests that increased diagnoses seem to be of clinically relevant sized PE.
26850419	New anti-resorptives and antibody mediated anti-resorptive therapy.	UNLABELLED: The ageing population and an increase in both the incidence and prevalence of cancer pose a healthcare challenge, some of which is borne by the orthopaedic community in the form of osteoporotic fractures and metastatic bone disease. In recent years there has been an increasing understanding of the pathways involved in bone metabolism relevant to osteoporosis and metastases in bone. Newer therapies may aid the management of these problems. One group of drugs, the antibody mediated anti-resorptive therapies (AMARTs) use antibodies to block bone resorption pathways. This review seeks to present a synopsis of the guidelines, pharmacology and potential pathophysiology of AMARTs and other new anti-resorptive drugs. We evaluate the literature relating to AMARTs and new anti-resorptives with special attention on those approved for use in clinical practice. Denosumab, a monoclonal antibody against Receptor Activator for Nuclear Factor Kappa-B Ligand. It is the first AMART approved by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence and the US Food and Drug Administration. Other novel anti-resorptives awaiting approval for clinical use include Odanacatib. Denosumab is indicated for the treatment of osteoporosis and prevention of the complications of bone metastases. Recent evidence suggests, however, that denosumab may have an adverse event profile similar to bisphosphonates, including atypical femoral fractures. It is, therefore, essential that orthopaedic surgeons are conversant with these medications and their safe usage. TAKE HOME MESSAGE: Denosumab has important orthopaedic indications and has been shown to significantly reduce patient morbidity in osteoporosis and metastatic bone disease.
27006554	Airway fires during surgery: Management and prevention.	Airway fires pose a serious risk to surgical patients. Fires during surgery have been reported for many years with flammable anesthetic agents being the main culprits in the past. Association of airway fires with laser surgery is well-recognized, but there are reports of endotracheal tube fires ignited by electrocautery during pharyngeal surgery or tracheostomy or both. This uncommon complication has potentially grave consequences. While airway fires are relatively uncommon occurrences, they are very serious and can often be fatal. Success in preventing such events requires a thorough understanding of the components leading to a fire (fuel, oxidizer, and ignition source), as well as good communication between all members present to appropriately manage the fire and ensure patient safety. We present a case of fire in the airway during routine adenotonsillectomy. We will review the causes, preventive measures, and brief management for airway fires.
27303707	New Monoclonal Antibodies against a Novel Subtype of Shiga Toxin 1 Produced by Enterobacter cloacae and Their Use in Analysis of Human Serum.	Shiga toxin (Stx) is a major virulence factor of several bacterial pathogens that cause potentially fatal illness, including Escherichia coli and Shigella spp. The continual emergence of new subtypes of Stxs presents challenges for the clinical diagnosis of infections caused by Stx-producing organisms. Here, we report the development of four new monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against Stx1e, a novel subtype of Stx1 that was produced by an Enterobacter cloacae strain and had limited reactivity with existing anti-Stx1 antibodies. Western blot analysis indicates that these MAbs were Stx1 specific, bound to the A subunit, and had distinct preferences for subtypes of Stx1. Of the four MAbs, Stx1e-2 was capable of partially neutralizing cytotoxicities derived from Stx1e in Vero cells. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays assembled with these high-affinity MAbs detected Stx1e at concentrations as low as 4.8 pg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline and 53.6 pg/ml in spiked human serum samples and were also capable of distinguishing Stx1e-producing strains in enriched cultures. These assays may therefore have clinical value in diagnosing Stx1e-producing bacterial infection. Additionally, characteristics of Stx1e, such as the origin of stx1e genes, conditions for toxin expression, receptor binding, and cytotoxicity, were investigated with the new antibodies developed in this study. This information should be useful for further understanding the clinical significance and prevalence of Stx1e-harboring E. cloacae and other organisms. IMPORTANCE Stxs are among the most clinically important virulence factors of Shigella and enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli. There are many varieties of Stx, and although Stx1a and Stx2a are the most common and widely distributed types of Stx, new variants of Stx are continually emerging. These new variants of Stx can be challenging to detect, since most Stx detection kits are optimized for the detection of Stx1a and Stx2a. Stx1e, recently discovered in an atypical host (Enterobacter cloacae), is undetectable by many Stx assays. To formulate new assays for the detection of Stx1e, we generated four new MAbs that recognize this Stx subtype. Using these antibodies, we generated an assay capable of detecting Stx1e at low picogram-per-milliliter concentrations. This assay is also compatible with a human serum matrix, suggesting that it may have utility for the clinical detection and diagnosis of Stx1e-associated infections.
26892452	Meta-Analysis of Radial Versus Femoral Artery Approach for Coronary Procedures in Patients With Previous Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting.	Cardiac catheterization through the radial artery approach (RA) has been shown to significantly reduce access-site complications compared with the femoral artery approach (FA) in many clinical settings. However, in the subset of patients with previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), optimal vascular access site for coronary angiography and intervention is still a matter of debate. We aimed to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of available studies comparing RA with FA in patients with previous CABG. Data were extracted by two independent reviewers; weighted mean differences and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated for continuous outcomes, whereas odds ratio (OR) and 95% CI were calculated for dichotomous outcomes. Summary statistics were calculated by random-effects model using Review Manager 5.3 software. The meta-analysis included 1 randomized and 8 nonrandomized studies, with a total of 2,763 patients. Compared with FA, RA required similar procedural time (mean difference 3.24 minutes, 95% CI -1.76 to 8.25, p = 0.20), fluoroscopy time (mean difference 0.62 minutes, 95% CI -0.83 to 2.07, p = 0.40), and contrast volume (mean difference -2.58 ml, 95% CI -18.36 to 13.20, p = 0.75) and was associated with similar rate of procedural failure (OR 1.32, 95% CI 0.63 to 2.80, p = 0.46), higher rate of crossover to another vascular access (OR 7.0, 95% CI 2.74 to 17.87, p <0.0001), and lower risk of access-site complications (OR 0.46, 95%CI 0.26 to 0.80, p = 0.006). In conclusion, the present meta-analysis suggests that in patients with previous CABG undergoing coronary procedures, RA, compared with FA, is associated with increased crossover rate but may reduce access-site complications.
28232762	Novel fungi from an ancient niche: cercosporoid and related sexual morphs on ferns.	The fern flora of the world (Pteridophyta) has direct evolutionary links with the earliest vascular plants that appeared in the late Devonian. Knowing the mycobiota associated to this group of plants is critical for a full understanding of the Fungi. Nevertheless, perhaps because of the minor economic significance of ferns, this niche remains relatively neglected by mycologists. Cercosporoid fungi represent a large assemblage of fungi belonging to the Mycosphaerellaceae and Teratosphaeriaceae (Ascomycota) having cercospora-like asexual morphs. They are well-known pathogens of many important crops, occurring on a wide host range. Here, the results of a taxonomic study of cercosporoid fungi collected on ferns in Brazil are presented. Specimens were obtained from most Brazilian regions and collected over a 7-yr period (2009-2015). Forty-three isolates of cercosporoid and mycosphaerella-like species, collected from 18 host species, representing 201 localities, were studied. This resulted in a total of 21 frond-spotting taxa, which were identified based on morphology, ecology and sequence data of five genomic loci (actin, calmodulin, ITS, LSU and partial translation elongation factor 1-alpha). One novel genus (Clypeosphaerella) and 15 novel species (Cercospora samambaiae, Clypeosphaerella sticheri, Neoceratosperma alsophilae, N. cyatheae, Paramycosphaerella blechni, Pa. cyatheae, Pa. dicranopteridis-flexuosae, Pa. sticheri, Phaeophleospora pteridivora, Pseudocercospora brackenicola, Ps. paranaensis, Ps. serpocaulonicola, Ps. trichogena, Xenomycosphaerella diplazii and Zasmidium cyatheae) are introduced. Furthermore, 11 new combinations (Clypeosphaerella quasiparkii, Neoceratosperma yunnanensis, Paramycosphaerella aerohyalinosporum, Pa. dicranopteridis, Pa. gleicheniae, Pa. irregularis, Pa. madeirensis, Pa. nabiacense, Pa. parkii, Pa. pseudomarksii and Pa. vietnamensis) are proposed. Finally, nine new host associations are recorded for the following known fungal species: Cercospora coniogrammes, Cercospora sp. Q, Ps. abacopteridicola, Ps. lygodiicola and Ps. thelypteridis.
27076652	Restricting Access to Health Care to Immigrants in Barcelona: A Mixed-Methods Study With Immigrants Who Have Experienced an Infectious Disease.	Austerity policies implemented in Spain in response to the ongoing economic crisis may have detrimental consequences for the health of immigrant populations and for public health in general. A mixed-methods study by the Public Health Agency of Barcelona and the University of Michigan indicates that the Real Decreto-ley 16/2012 (RDL) threatens the health of individuals and the population, especially in the case of infectious diseases. The study sought to determine the percentage of foreign-born persons with an infectious disease who had an Individual Health Card (IHC) prior to the RDL and to determine whether foreign-born persons with an infectious disease in Barcelona encountered problems accessing health care after the RDL. Results indicate that immigrants used the IHC to seek medical attention for infectious diseases and chronic conditions. Results also show that 66% of respondents, including 54% of unemployed respondents, 3% of respondents working without contracts, and those in informal employment (9%), may be at risk of losing at least part of their health coverage. Universal health care access in Spain has been crucial for the control of communicable diseases among immigrant populations. Reducing access to a significant percentage of the total population may have deleterious effects on public health.
27298716	Nanopit-induced osteoprogenitor cell differentiation: The effect of nanopit depth.	We aimed to assess osteogenesis in osteoprogenitor cells by nanopits and to assess optimal feature depth. Topographies of depth 80, 220 and 333 nm were embossed onto polycaprolactone discs. Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells were seeded onto polycaprolactone discs, suspended in media and incubated. Samples were fixed after 3 and 28 days. Cells were stained for the adhesion molecule vinculin and the osteogenic transcription factor RUNX2 after 3 days. Adhesion was lowest on planar controls and it was the shallowest, and 80-nm-deep pits supported optimal adhesion formation. Deep pits (80 and 220 nm) induced most RUNX2 accumulation. After 28 days, osteocalcin and osteopontin expression were used as markers of osteoblastic differentiation. Deep pits (220 nm) produced cells with the highest concentrations of osteopontin and osteocalcin. All topographies induced higher expression levels than controls. We demonstrated stimulation of osteogenesis in a heterogeneous population of mesenchymal stromal cells. All nanopit depths gave promising results with an optimum depth of 220 nm after 28 days. Nanoscale modification of implant surfaces could optimise fracture union or osteointegration.
27348931	[Application of placebo acupuncture in randomized controlled trials in the past 10 years in foreign countries].	The application of placebo acupuncture in randomized controlled trials in the past 10 years (2004-2014) in foreign countries was systematically reviewed to summarize the design of placebo acupuncture; according to category of diseases, advantages and disadvantages were analyzed to explore an ideal placebo acupuncture set. By retrieval in PubMed, EMBASE and OVID databases, the clinical study literature which met the inclusion criteria was searched, and the category of diseases, design of placebo acupuncture and clinical efficacy were analyzed. Totally 29 articles were included. The pain was the leading disease in category of diseases; the most commonly used application of placebo acupuncture design was telescopiform sliding blunt needle, accounting for 45. 16%; the treatment locations were non-acupoints mostly; in the needling depth, approximately 60. 00% selected non-penetrating needling and 26. 67% selected superficial needling; 28 articles indicated that acupuncture and placebo acupuncture had clinical effects, accounting for 96. 55%; 37. 93% of articles indicated acupuncture was superior to placebo acupuncture and 37. 93% of articles indicated acupuncture was not superior to placebo acupuncture. It is concluded that the design of placebo acupuncture should consider multiple factors, including main symptoms, operability, security, blinding and specific effects, and the objective indices should be selected for outcome evaluation.
27281191	Characteristics and Distribution of Phosphorus in Surface Sediments of Limnetic Ecosystem in Eastern China.	Phosphorus (P) is an essential nutrient for aquatic organisms; however, excessive P inflow to limnetic ecosystems can induce eutrophication. P concentrations in the rivers, wetlands and lakes of Eastern China have been amplified by fertilizer and sewage inputs associated with the development of industry and agriculture. Yet, knowledge of the distribution and speciation of P is lacking at the regional scale. We determined the distribution and speciation of P in limnetic ecosystems in Eastern China using Standards, Measurements and Testing (SMT) and phosphorus nuclear magnetic resonance (31P-NMR). The results indicate that P pollution in surface sediments was serious. Inorganic P (Pi) was the primary drive of variation in total P (TP) among different river systems, and Pi accounted for 71% to 90% of TP in surface sediment in Eastern China. Also, the concentrations of TP and Pi varied among watersheds and Pi primarily drove the variation in TP in different watersheds. Sediments less than 10-cm deep served as the main P reservoir. Environmental factors affect the speciation and origin of P. NaOH-Pi, HCl-Pi and organic P (Po) were related to pH accordingly at the regional scale. The physicochemical properties of sediments from different limnetic ecosystems affect the P speciation. HCl-Pi was higher in wetland sediments than in riverine and lake sediments in Eastern China. Conversely, NaOH-Pi was lowest in wetland sediments. Total Po concentration was lower in riverine sediments than in other sediments, but Mono-P was higher, with an average concentration of 48 mg kg-1. Diesters-P was highest in lake sediments. By revealing the regional distribution of TP, Pi and Po, this study will support eutrophication management in Eastern China.
26836175	Increased Intrinsic Activity of Medial-Temporal Lobe Subregions is Associated with Decreased Cortical Thickness of Medial-Parietal Areas in Patients with Alzheimer's Disease Dementia.	In Alzheimer's disease (AD), disrupted connectivity between medial-parietal cortices and medial-temporal lobes (MTL) is linked with increased MTL local functional connectivity, and parietal atrophy is associated with increased MTL memory activation. We hypothesized that intrinsic activity in MTL subregions is increased and associated with medial-parietal degeneration and impaired memory in AD. To test this hypothesis, resting-state-functional and structural-MRI was assessed in 22 healthy controls, 22 mild cognitive impairment patients, and 21 AD-dementia patients. Intrinsic activity was measured by power-spectrum density of blood-oxygenation-level-dependent signal, medial-parietal degeneration by cortical thinning. In AD-dementia patients, intrinsic activity was increased for several right MTL subregions. Raised intrinsic activity in dentate gyrus and cornu ammonis 1 was associated with cortical thinning in posterior cingulate cortices, and at-trend with impaired delayed recall. Critically, increased intrinsic activity in the right entorhinal cortex was associated with ipsilateral posterior cingulate degeneration. Our results provide evidence that in AD, intrinsic activity in MTL subregions is increased and associated with medial-parietal atrophy. Results fit a model in which medial-parietal degeneration contributes to MTL dysconnectivity from medial-parietal cortices, potentially underpinning disinhibition-like changes in MTL activity.
26891872	In Vitro CYP2D Inhibitory Effect and Influence on Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamic Parameters of Metoprolol Succinate by Terminalia arjuna in Rats.	BACKGROUND: Terminalia arjuna Wight & Arn. (Combretaceae) is a tree having an extensive medicinal potential in cardiovascular disorders. T. arjuna bark extract has been reported to play a significant role as a cardiac stimulant for its beneficial effects in angina. Herb - drug interactions (HDI) are one of the most important clinical concerns in the concomitant consumption of herbs and prescription drugs. Our study was to investigate the in vitro CYP2D inhibition potential of Terminalia arjuna (T. arjuna) extracts in rat liver microsomes and to study the influence of aqueous bark extract of T. arjuna on the oral pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of metoprolol succinate in rats. METHODS: The CYP2D inhibition potential of herbal extracts of T. arjuna was investigated in rat liver microsomes. Pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic interaction of aqueous extract of T. arjuna with metoprolol succinate was investigated in rats. RESULTS: The ethyl acetate, alcoholic &amp; aqueous bark extracts of T. arjuna showed potent reversible non-competitive inhibition CYP2D enzyme in rat liver microsomes with IC50 values less than 40 mug/mL. Arjunic acid, arjunetin and arjungenin did not show significant inhibition of CYP2D enzyme in rat liver microsomes. Pharmacokinetic studies showed that aqueous bark extract of T. arjuna led to a significant reduction (P < 0.05) in AUC0-24h and Cmax of metoprolol succinate in rats, when co-administered. Pharmacodynamic studies reveal a significant reduction in therapeutic activity of metoprolol succinate on co-administration with aqueous bark extract of T. arjuna. CONCLUSION: Based on our in vitro and in vivo findings and until further clinical drug interaction experiments are conducted, the co-administration of drugs, especially those primarily cleared via CYP2D catalyzed metabolism, with T. arjuna extracts should be done with caution.
27008787	Seasonality in marine ecosystems: Peruvian seabirds, anchovy, and oceanographic conditions.	In fluctuating environments, matching breeding timing to periods of high resource availability is crucial for the fitness of many vertebrate species, and may have major consequences on population health. Yet, our understanding of the proximate environmental cues driving seasonal breeding is limited. This is particularly the case in marine ecosystems, where key environmental factors and prey abundance and availability are seldom quantified. The Northern Humboldt Current System (NHCS) is a highly productive, low-latitude ecosystem of moderate seasonality. In this ecosystem, three tropical seabird species (the Guanay Cormorant Phalacrocorax bougainvillii, the Peruvian Booby Sula variegata, and the Peruvian Pelican Pelecanus thagus) live in sympatry and prey almost exclusively on anchovy, Engraulis ringens. From January 2003 to December 2012, we monitored 31 breeding sites along the Peruvian coast to investigate the breeding cycle of these species. We tested for relationships between breeding timing, oceanographic conditions, and prey availability using occupancy models. We found that all three seabird species exhibited seasonal breeding patterns, with marked interspecific differences. Whereas breeding mainly started during the austral winter/early spring and ended in summer/early fall, this pattern was stronger in boobies and pelicans than in cormorants. Breeding onset mainly occurred when upwelling was intense but ecosystem productivity was below its annual maxima, and when anchovy were less available and in poor physiological condition. Conversely, the abundance and availability of anchovy improved during chick rearing and peaked around the time of fledging. These results suggest that breeding timing is adjusted so that fledging may occur under optimal environmental conditions, rather than being constrained by nutritional requirements during egg laying. Adjusting breeding time so that fledglings meet optimal conditions at independence is unique compared with other upwelling ecosystems and could be explained by the relatively high abundances of anchovy occurring throughout the year in the NHCS.
27108323	In Vitro Shoot Cultures and Analysis of Steroidal Lactones in Withania coagulans (Stocks) Dunal.	Withania coagulans (Stocks) Dunal (Solanaceae), also known as 'Panir Bandh' is an important medicinal plant that is extensively used as a home remedy for several diseases in the Indian subcontinent. The plant possesses specific steroidal lactones known as withanolides which show high level of pharmaceutical activity against a broad spectrum of microorganisms. Natural propagation of the plant occurs through Seed but due to unisexual nature of the flowers; chances of Seed setting are very limited and the plant is on the verge of extinction because of overexploitation and reproductive failure. Plant tissue culture techniques offer opportunities for ex situ conservation and mass multiplication of endangered plant species through micropropagation and also enhancement of in vitro biosynthesis of bioactive compounds. In this chapter we present protocols for the mass multiplication of W. coagulans, assessment of clonal fidelity by RAPD, and estimation of bioactive compounds (withanolides) by thin layer chromatography (TLC) and reverse phase HPLC developed in our laboratory.
27002982	Cholinesterase Inhibitor Donepezil Increases Mitochondrial Biogenesis through AMP-Activated Protein Kinase in the Hippocampus.	OBJECTIVE: Donepezil, a widely prescribed drug for Alzheimer's disease (AD), is now considered to have multimodal actions beyond cholinesterase inhibition. We aimed to see whether donepezil enhances mitochondrial biogenesis and relevant signaling pathways since mitochondrial dysfunction is a key feature of the hypometabolic AD brain. METHODS: As a metabolic gauge, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) was investigated as a tentative mediator of neurometabolic action of donepezil. Changes in phospho-AMPK levels, mitochondrial biogenesis, and ATP levels were measured upon donepezil treatment using neuroblastoma cells, primary cultured neurons and ex vivo hippocampal tissue of adult mice. RESULTS: Donepezil dose-dependently increased mitochondrial biogenesis and ATP levels as well as expression of PGC-1alpha and NRF-1 in neuroblastoma cells. Donepezil dose-dependently activated AMPK; however, inhibition of AMPK abolished the observed effects of donepezil, indicating that AMPK is a key mediator of donepezil's action. Notably, mitochondrial biogenesis upon donepezil treatment was mainly observed within dendritic regions of primary cultured hippocampal neurons. Levels of synaptic markers were also increased by donepezil. Finally, AMPK- dependent mitochondrial biogenesis by donepezil was confirmed in organotypic hippocampal tissue. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that AMPK/PGC-1alpha signaling is involved in beneficial actions of donepezil on neurometabolism. Pharmacological activation of AMPK might be a promising approach to counteract AD pathogenesis associated with brain hypometabolism.
27781098	Recurrent pyriform sinus fistula successfully treated by endoscopic Glubran 2 sealing: A rare case and literature review.	OBJECTIVES: The authors present the case of a 3-year-old girl with a history of complicated surgery for removing a third branchial cleft fistula. METHODS: An endoscopic approach using N-butyl-2-acrylate and metacrilosisolfolane glue (GLUBRAN 2) to seal the fistula was performed. RESULTS: The clinical and radiological 6-year follow-up confirmed the absence of the fistulous orifice and the persistence of scar due to previous open-neck surgical procedures. CONCLUSION: endoscopic Glubran 2 sealing has been an effective treatment procedure for branchial fistula.
26913197	Implications of circadian rhythm and stress in addiction vulnerability.	In the face of chronic stress, some individuals can maintain normal function while others go on to develop mental illness. Addiction, affecting one in every twelve people in America, is a substance use disorder long associated with stressful life events and disruptions in the sleep/wake cycle. The circadian and stress response systems have evolved to afford adaptability to environmental changes and allow for maintenance of functional stability, or homeostasis. This mini-review will discuss how circadian rhythms and stress individually affect drug response, affect each other, and how their interactions may regulate reward-related behavior. In particular, we will focus on the interactions between the circadian clock and the regulation of glucocorticoids by the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Determining how these two systems act on dopaminergic reward circuitry may not only reveal the basis for vulnerability to addiction, but may also illuminate potential therapeutic targets for future investigation.
27652034	Intensity-modulated radiotherapy controls nasopharyngeal carcinoma distant metastasis and improves survival of patients.	BACKGROUND: This study evaluated the distant metastatic outcomes in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients treated with intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) plus chemotherapy. METHODS: 530 Non-metastatic NPC patients were retrospectively collected and reviewed after receiving IMRT with or without chemotherapy between June 2006 and December 2011. Patients were treated with one fraction of IMRT daily for 5 days a week for 69.96-74.09 Gy, while 473 (89.2 %) of patients also received chemotherapy. RESULTS: Patients were followed up for a median follow-up duration of 49 months (range from 5 to 98 months). After treatment, 91 (17.3 %) patients developed distant metastasis. Distant metastasis after treatment was significantly associated with advanced 2010 Union for International Cancer Control (UICC)/American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) T staging (p = 0.034), N stage (p < 0.001), 2010 UICC/AJCC stage (p < 0.001), and tumor recurrence (p = 0.029). However, chemotherapy failed to reduce cancer distant metastasis in early stage patients, the distant metastasis rate was 17.5 % in stage III and 24.2 % in stage IVA-B diseases, after IMRT and chemotherapy. The multivariate analysis showed that cancer remission duration, treatment modality, and metastatic site (p < 0.001, p = 0.027 and p = 0.022, respectively) were all independent predictors for overall survival of NPC patients after IMRT and chemotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: This study provided insight into the effects of IMRT plus chemotherapy in the treatment of NPC. Future studies will explore the efficacy of more aggressive systemic therapies for high-risk patients with distant metastasis.
27852477	Transcatheter Mitral Valve Replacement.	Mitral valve disease prevalence is on the rise worldwide, affecting an estimated 2% of the general population. Novel transcatheter mitral valve replacement technologies are being developed and may provide a viable and safe option in patients who are deemed otherwise not suitable candidates for conventional mitral valve surgery. This article reviews these devices and describes trials of first in-human use.
27708813	Developing an instrument to self-evaluate the Discharge Planning of Ward Nurses.	AIMS: To develop the Discharge Planning of Ward Nurses (DPWN), a Japanese self-evaluation instrument for ward nurses' discharge planning practices. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey. METHODS: Participants were 624 ward nurses from six hospitals in Japan with a discharge planning department. Items about discharge planning practices were collected from literature and interviews with nurses and researchers. Construct validity, concurrent validity, internal consistency and test-retest reliability were tested. RESULTS: Initially, 55 items were collected. Examination of the floor effect, item-total, good-poor analyses and exploratory factor analysis yielded a four-factor model with 24 items ('teaching home-care skills with community/hospital professionals,' 'identifying clients' potential needs early in the discharge process,' 'introducing social resources' and 'identifying client/family wishes and building consensus for discharge'). The four-factor structure was supported by confirmatory factor analysis. The DPWN correlated with scales ascertaining similar concepts, supporting concurrent validity. Internal consistency and test-retest reliability were generally satisfactory.
27600584	Differential Expression of O-Glycans in CD4(+) T Lymphocytes from Patients with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus.	T cells from patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) show a decreased activation threshold and increased apoptosis. These processes seem to be regulated by glycosylated molecules on the T cell surface. Here, we determined through flow cytometry the expression of mucin-type O-glycans on T helper cells in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from 23 SLE patients and its relation with disease activity. We used lectins specific for the disaccharide Gal-GalNAc, such as Amaranthus leucocarpus lectin (ALL), Artocarpus integrifolia lectin (jacalin) and Arachis hypogaea lectin (peanut agglutinin, PNA), as well as lectins for sialic acid such as Sambucus nigra agglutinin (SNA) and Maakia amurensis agglutinin (MAA). The results showed that ALL, but not jacalin or PNA, identified significant differences in O-glycan expression on T helper cells from active SLE patients (n = 10). Moreover, an inverse correlation was found between the frequency of T helper cells recognized by ALL and SLE Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI) score in SLE patients. In contrast, SNA and MAA lectins did not identify any differences between CD4(+) T cells from SLE patients. There was no difference in the recognition by ALL on activated T helper cells and T regulatory (Treg) cells. Our findings point out that activation of SLE disease diminishes the expression of O-glycans in T helper cells; ALL could be considered as a marker to determine activity of the disease.
27375789	Colorimetric TMPRSS2-ERG Gene Fusion Detection in Prostate Cancer Urinary Samples via Recombinase Polymerase Amplification.	TMPRSS2 (Exon 1)-ERG (Exon 4) is the most frequent gene fusion event in prostate cancer (PC), and is highly PC-specific unlike the current serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) biomarker. However, TMPRSS2-ERG levels are currently measured with quantitative reverse-transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) which is time-consuming and requires costly equipment, thus limiting its use in clinical diagnostics. Herein, we report a novel rapid, cost-efficient and minimal-equipment assay named "FusBLU" for detecting TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusions from urine. TMPRSS2-ERG mRNA was amplified by isothermal reverse transcription-recombinase polymerase amplification (RT-RPA), magnetically-isolated, and detected through horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-catalyzed colorimetric reaction. FusBLU was specific for TMPRSS2-ERG mRNA with a low visual detection limit of 10(5) copies. We also demonstrated assay readout versatility on 3 potentially useful platforms. The colorimetric readout was detectable by naked eye for a quick yes/no evaluation of gene fusion presence. On the other hand, a more quantitative TMPRSS2-ERG detection was achievable by absorbance/electrochemical measurements. FusBLU was successfully applied to 12 urinary samples and results were validated by gold-standard RT-qPCR. We also showed that sediment RNA was likely the main source of TMPRSS2-ERG mRNA in urinary samples. We believe that our assay is a potential clinical screening tool for PC and could also have wide applications for other disease-related fusion genes.
27530151	PROMISE AND PLAUSIBILITY: HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ADOPTION DECISIONS WITH LIMITED EVIDENCE.	BACKGROUND: The adoption of new medical devices and diagnostics is often hampered by lack of published evidence which makes conventional health technology assessment (HTA) difficult. We now have 5 years' experience of the Medical Technologies Advisory Committee of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in the United Kingdom, addressing this problem. This committee assesses devices and diagnostics against claims of advantage, to produce guidance on adoption for the health service. METHODS: We have reflected on the practical, technical, and intellectual processes we have used in developing guidance for the health service. RESULTS: When scientific and clinical evidence is sparse, promise and plausibility play an increased part in decision-making. Drivers of promise include a clear design and mechanism of action, the possibility of radical improvement in care and/or resource use, and improving health outcomes for large numbers of patients. Plausibility relates to judgements about the whether the promise is likely to be delivered in a "real world" setting. Promise and plausibility need to be balanced against the amount of evidence available. We examine the influence they may have on decision-making compared with other factors such as risk and cost. CONCLUSIONS: Decisions about adoption of new devices and diagnostics with little evidence are influenced by judgements of their promise and the plausibility of claims that they will provide benefits in a real-world setting. This kind of decision making needs to be transparent and this article explains how these influences can be balanced against the use of more familiar criteria.
27349033	Conrad Gessner's Paratexts.	Throughout his prolific publishing career Conrad Gessner composed abundant paratexts which offer valuable insight into his methods of working. Gessner wrote many dedications, only a minority of which were addressed to major patrons of his day. Instead he used them to thank dozens of physicians and scholars for sending him information, images, and manuscripts for his ongoing projects. Gessner acknowledged new arrivals in successive publications and invited further contributions explicitly. In "to the readers" and other passages Gessner called attention to his future publication plans and his skill in working with printers and in editing manuscripts of recently deceased scholars, thereby also encouraging new commissions. Gessner was also a master indexer and innovated especially in drawing up the first index of authors cited for his edition of Stobaeus in 1543 and a new all-purpose index in his Stobaeus of 1549. Many other aspects of Gessner's paratexts warrant further study.
27635351	Genome-wide identification and characterization of GRAS transcription factors in sacred lotus (Nelumbo nucifera).	The GRAS gene family is one of the most important plant-specific gene families, which encodes transcriptional regulators and plays an essential role in plant development and physiological processes. The GRAS gene family has been well characterized in many higher plants such as Arabidopsis, rice, Chinese cabbage, tomato and tobacco. In this study, we identified 38 GRAS genes in sacred lotus (Nelumbo nucifera), analyzed their physical and chemical characteristics and performed phylogenetic analysis using the GRAS genes from eight representative plant species to show the evolution of GRAS genes in Planta. In addition, the gene structures and motifs of the sacred lotus GRAS proteins were characterized in detail. Comparative analysis identified 42 orthologous and 9 co-orthologous gene pairs between sacred lotus and Arabidopsis, and 35 orthologous and 22 co-orthologous gene pairs between sacred lotus and rice. Based on publically available RNA-seq data generated from leaf, petiole, rhizome and root, we found that most of the sacred lotus GRAS genes exhibited a tissue-specific expression pattern. Eight of the ten PAT1-clade GRAS genes, particularly NnuGRAS-05, NnuGRAS-10 and NnuGRAS-25, were preferentially expressed in rhizome and root. In summary, this is the first in silico analysis of the GRAS gene family in sacred lotus, which will provide valuable information for further molecular and biological analyses of this important gene family.
26985237	Microalgal TAG production strategies: why batch beats repeated-batch.	BACKGROUND: For a commercially feasible microalgal triglyceride (TAG) production, high TAG productivities are required. The operational strategy affects TAG productivity but a systematic comparison between different strategies is lacking. For this, physiological responses of Nannochloropsis sp. to nitrogen (N) starvation and N-rich medium replenishment were studied in lab-scale batch and repeated-batch (part of the culture is periodically harvested and N-rich medium is re-supplied) cultivations under continuous light, and condensed into a mechanistic model. RESULTS: The model, which successfully described both strategies, was used to identify potential improvements for both batch and repeated-batch and compare the two strategies on optimized TAG yields on light (amount of TAGs produced per mol of supplied PAR photons). TAG yields on light, for batch, from 0.12 (base case at high light) to 0.49 g molph (-1) (at low light and with improved strain) and, for repeated-batch, from 0.07 (base case at high light) to 0.39 g molph (-1) (at low light with improved strain and optimized repeated-batch settings). The base case yields are in line with the yields observed in current state-of-the-art outdoor TAG production. CONCLUSIONS: For continuous light, an optimized batch process will always result in higher TAG yield on light compared to an optimized repeated-batch process. This is mainly because repeated-batch cycles start with N-starved cells. Their reduced photosynthetic capacity leads to inefficient light use during the regrowth phase which results in lower overall TAG yields compared to a batch process.
27713639	Spotlight on pembrolizumab in non-small cell lung cancer: the evidence to date.	Immunotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors has opened a new arena in cancer therapeutics. Pembrolizumab is a highly selective anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) antibody that has shown efficacy, leading to survival benefit and durable responses, in some patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). It has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of patients with metastatic NSCLC, whose tumors express PD-1 ligand 1 (PD-L1), with disease progression on or after platinum-containing chemotherapy. Here, we briefly discuss the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway and pembrolizumab before delving into the clinical trials that have led to its just-mentioned approval in NSCLC and ongoing clinical trials. Finally, we discuss the use of biomarkers, primarily PD-L1, in the context of pembrolizumab and NSCLC.
26942608	Environmental Drivers of Benthic Flux Variation and Ecosystem Functioning in Salish Sea and Northeast Pacific Sediments.	The upwelling of deep waters from the oxygen minimum zone in the Northeast Pacific from the continental slope to the shelf and into the Salish Sea during spring and summer offers a unique opportunity to study ecosystem functioning in the form of benthic fluxes along natural gradients. Using the ROV ROPOS we collected sediment cores from 10 sites in May and July 2011, and September 2013 to perform shipboard incubations and flux measurements. Specifically, we measured benthic fluxes of oxygen and nutrients to evaluate potential environmental drivers of benthic flux variation and ecosystem functioning along natural gradients of temperature and bottom water dissolved oxygen concentrations. The range of temperature and dissolved oxygen encountered across our study sites allowed us to apply a suite of multivariate analyses rarely used in flux studies to identify bottom water temperature as the primary environmental driver of benthic flux variation and organic matter remineralization. Redundancy analysis revealed that bottom water characteristics (temperature and dissolved oxygen), quality of organic matter (chl a:phaeo and C:N ratios) and sediment characteristics (mean grain size and porosity) explained 51.5% of benthic flux variation. Multivariate analyses identified significant spatial and temporal variation in benthic fluxes, demonstrating key differences between the Northeast Pacific and Salish Sea. Moreover, Northeast Pacific slope fluxes were generally lower than shelf fluxes. Spatial and temporal variation in benthic fluxes in the Salish Sea were driven primarily by differences in temperature and quality of organic matter on the seafloor following phytoplankton blooms. These results demonstrate the utility of multivariate approaches in differentiating among potential drivers of seafloor ecosystem functioning, and indicate that current and future predictive models of organic matter remineralization and ecosystem functioning of soft-muddy shelf and slope seafloor habitats should consider bottom water temperature variation. Bottom temperature has important implications for estimates of seasonal and spatial benthic flux variation, benthic-pelagic coupling, and impacts of predicted ocean warming at high latitudes.
26836093	Evaluation of a linear birefringence measurement method with increased sensitivity.	The evaluation of a measurement method of linear birefringence with increased sensitivity is presented. The examined method is based on a substantial change of the geometrical phase caused by a small change of an examined medium's birefringence. The measuring setup consists of a linear polarizer, Wollaston compensator, and circular analyzer. The measurement is performed by tracking the phase shift of a fringe pattern. Specific orientation of the elements modifies the setup's response-the sensitivity of the setup can be controlled in a limited measuring range. The present paper concentrates on the factors affecting the setup's sensitivity as well as the accuracy of obtained results. The validity of the proposed approach has been demonstrated by measuring a phase retardance introduced by the liquid crystal retarder. A thousandfold increase in sensitivity has been obtained in the presented experiments, which allows the measurement of retardance introduced by the linear birefringent medium with an accuracy of 0.003 degrees within the limited measuring range.
27022476	Exotropia Is the Main Pattern of Childhood Strabismus Surgery in the South of China: A Six-Year Clinical Review.	Purpose. To evaluate the distribution pattern and changes of strabismus surgery in children based on the data collected from a local eye hospital in the south of China between 2006 and 2011. Methods. A retrospective analysis of all strabismus surgeries in children (<18 years) performed in the Eye Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University between 2006 and 2011 using the integrated information system. Result. A total of 2,219 strabismus surgeries were performed during the study period, with concomitant exotropia (44% of all surgeries) more than esotropia (27%, chi (2) = 42.7, p < 0.001). Total number of surgeries increased from 250 in 2006 to 508 in 2011, with a significant increase in concomitant exotropia: 38% of all surgeries in 2006 increased to 47% in 2011 (chi (2) = 29.4, p < 0.001). The increase of intermittent exotropia was approximately 26% of all increments of strabismus surgery between 2006 and 2011. Conclusion. Surgery for childhood exotropia was more frequent than esotropia in China. The proportion of exotropia progressively increased, while the proportion of esotropia decreased during these years. Intermittent exotropia was the main increment of strabismus surgery. Further population-based studies are needed to confirm the proportion of surgery and whether the incidence of strabismus surgery increased in China.
28005099	A New Technique for Obtaining Bone Graft in Cases of Distal Femur Nonunion: Passing a Reamer/Irrigator/Aspirator Retrograde Through the Nonunion Site.	Bone grafting is one of the most common orthopedic procedures. We conducted a study to assess the possibility of passing a Reamer/Irrigator/Aspirator (RIA; DePuy Synthes) retrograde through the nonunion site in distal femur cases. This technique would avoid the complications and discomfort associated with a separate entry site for RIA. All patients with a distal femur nonunion treated with RIA bone grafting between 2009 and 2013 were included in the study. Nonunions were mobilized with excision of fibrous tissues. The distal part was angulated into varus, and then the guide wire was passed from the nonunion site laterally. Five patients had a RIA passed retrograde through the nonunion site. Mean age of these patients was 40.4 years (range, 22-66 years). Mean reamer size was 13.4 mm (mode, 14 mm), producing an average bone graft volume of 33 mL. There were no intraoperative or postoperative fractures. In 1 case, the reamer shaft broke. Passing a RIA retrograde through the nonunion site in distal femur cases is reproducible, and the technique avoids the discomfort and pain associated with a separate entry point as well as the complication of eccentric reaming of the proximal and distal part of the femoral canal.
27876901	Nematodes ultrastructure: complex systems and processes.	Nematode worms are among the most ubiquitous organisms on earth. They include free-living forms as well as parasites of plants, insects, humans and other animals. Recently, there has been an explosion of interest in nematode biology, including the area of nematode ultrastructure. Nematodes are round with a body cavity. They have one way guts with a mouth at one end and an anus at the other. They have a pseudocoelom that is lined on one side with mesoderm and on the other side with endoderm. It appears that the cuticle is a very complex and evolutionarily plastic feature with important functions involving protection, body movement and maintaining shape. They only have longitudinal muscles so; they seem to thrash back and forth. While nematodes have digestive, reproductive, nervous and excretory systems, they do not have discrete circulatory or respiratory systems. Nematodes use chemosensory and mechanosensory neurons embedded in the cuticle to orient and respond to a wide range of environmental stimuli. Adults are made up of roughly 1000 somatic cells and hundreds of those cells are typically associated with the reproductive systems. Nematodes ultrastructure seeks to provide studies which enable their use as models for diverse biological processes including; human diseases, immunity, host-parasitic interactions and the expression of phylogenomics. The latter has, however, not been brought into a single inclusive entity. Consequently, in the current review we tried to provide a comprehensive approach to the current knowledge available for nematodes ultrastructures.
27509937	Spiritual Needs of Patients with Cancer Referred to Alinasab and Shahid Ghazi Tabatabaie Hospitals of Tabriz, Iran.	BACKGROUND: Patients' spiritual needs increase drastically after a diagnosis of cancer because of its threatening nature. It is very important to recognize any spiritual crisis. This study aimed to determine needs among Iranian patients with cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This crosssectional study was undertaken among 200 patients with cancer referred to Alinasab and Shahid Ghazi Tabatabaie hospitals of Tabriz, Iran. The Spiritual Needs Scale was used for data collection. RESULTS: The mean age of participants was 45.9+/-16.4 years. The majority expressed their main spiritual wishes as "think to God", "trust to God", "see others happy", "try for life beside the disease", "to be prayed for by others', and "need for kindness and help others". Regarding the relationship between demographic characteristics, factors related to disease and the total score of spiritual needs, the results of chisquare tests showed a significant statistical correlations with occupation (p=0.01) and number of children (p=0.03). Also the results of Pearson correlation showed that there is a significant statistical correlation between hospitalization frequency and patients' spiritual needs (p<0.01, r=0.24). CONCLUSIONS: Determination of spiritual needs of patients with cancer in this study can help health carers and especially nurses to design appropriate spiritual care programs based on individual preferences.
26842824	How well will you FIT? Use of a modified MMI to assess applicants' compatibility with an emergency medicine residency program.	PURPOSE: Emergency medicine residency programs have evaluated the use of Multiple Mini Interviews (MMIs) for applicants. The authors developed an MMI-style method called the Fast Interview Track (FIT) to predict an applicant's 'fit' within an individual residency program. METHODS: Applicants meet with up to five residents and are asked one question by each. Residents score the applicant using a Likert scale from 1 to 5 on two questions: 'How well does the applicant think on his/her feet?' and 'How well do you think the applicant will fit in here?'. To assess how well these questions predicted a resident's 'fit', current residents scored fellow residents on these same questions. These scores were compared with the residents' interview FIT scores. A postmatch survey of applicants who did not match at this program solicited applicants' attitudes toward the FIT sessions. RESULTS: Among the junior class, the correlation between interview and current scores was significant for question 1 (rho=0.5192 [p=0.03]) and question 2 (rho=0.5753 [p=0.01]). Among seniors, Spearman's rho was statistically significant for question 2, though not statistically significant for question 1. The chi-square measure of high scores (4-5) versus low scores (1-3) found a statistically significant association between interview and current scores for interns and juniors. Of the 29 responses to the postmatch survey, 16 (55%) felt FIT sessions provided a good sense of the program's personality and only 6 (21%) disagreed. Nine (31%) felt FIT sessions positively impacted our program's ranking and 11 (38%) were 'Neutral'. Only two (7%) reported that FIT sessions negatively impacted their ranking of our program. CONCLUSIONS: FIT provided program leadership with a sense of an applicant's 'fit' within this program. Interview day scores correlated with scores received during residency. Most applicants report a positive experience with FIT sessions. FIT provides a useful tool to recruit applicants who fit with the residency program.
27014796	Phonetic and phonological perspectives on the acquisition of voice onset time by French-speaking children.	The goal of the present article is to describe the acquisition of the phonetic details and phonological categories of stop consonants in French. To this end, the stop consonants produced by children aged 2-4 years were transcribed and acoustically analysed. Stop consonants provide an interesting window in phonetic and phonological development since they are among the first phonemes to be acquired in French (MacLeod, Sutton, Thordardottir & Trudeau, 2011), yet the mastery of the phonetic detail of these phonemes can be more drawn out (Allen, 1985). The results of the study indicate that these children are producing significant voicing contrasts between homorganic stops using voice onset time, but at the phonetic level their productions are not yet within adult ranges.
27900858	Rapid identification of triphenylmethane dyes by ion mobility time-of-flight mass spectrometry.	An ion mobility time-of-flight mass spectrometry (IM-TOFMS)-based method has been preliminarily investigated for the identification of triphenylmethane ballpoint pen dyes on paper. The dyes were sampled from one-year-old ballpoint pen ink entries. The entries were written on paper documents stored in the dark in a bookcase. Sample solutions were prepared by extraction of dyes in a vial. Basic violet 2, Methyl violet 6B, Methyl violet 2B and Crystal violet were characterized by IM-TOFMS. Since the ballpoint ink dyes contain ionic compounds, the studied compounds were expected to form stable peaks in the atmospheric pressure drift tube ion mobility spectrometry, and this was experimentally verified. The studied dyes produce [M-Cl]+ ions in electrospray and form stable individual mass-selective reduced mobility peaks. The values of the characteristic reduced mobility are: 1.187 cm2/(V.s) for Basic violet 2 (m/z 330.20), 1.165 cm2/(V.s) for Methyl violet 6B (m/z 344.21), 1.156 cm2/(V.s) for Methyl violet 2B (m/z 358.23), 1.123 cm2/(V.s) for Crystal violet (m/z 372.24). IM-TOFMS is expected to be a promising tool for fast and reliable analysis of dyes in complex matrixes.
27471855	Granular Formation during Apoptosis in Blastocystis sp. Exposed to Metronidazole (MTZ).	The role and function of the granular life cycle stage in Blastocystis sp, remains uncertain despite suggestions being made that the granules are metabolic, reproductive and lipid in nature. This present study aims to understand granular formation by triggering apoptosis in Blastocystis sp. by treating them with metronidazole (MTZ). Blastocystis sp.cultures of 4 sub-types namely 1, 2, 3 and 5 when treated with 0.01 and 0.0001 mg/ml of metronidazole (MTZ) respectively showed many of the parasites to be both viable and apoptotic (VA). Treated subtype 3 isolates exhibited the highest number of granular forms i.e. 88% (p<0.001) (0.0001 mg/ml) and 69% (p<0.01) (0.01 mg/ml) respectively at the 72 h in in vitro culture compared to other subtypes. These VA forms showed distinct granules using acridine orange (AO) and 4',6-diamino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining with a mean per cell ranging from 5 in ST 5 to as high as 16 in ST 3. These forms showed intact mitochondria in both viable apoptotic (VA) and viable non-apoptotic (VNA) cells with a pattern of accumulation of lipid droplets corresponding to viable cells. Granular VA forms looked ultra-structurally different with prominent presence of mitochondria-like organelle (MLO) and a changed mitochondrial trans-membrane potential with thicker membrane and a highly convoluted inner membrane than the less dense non-viable apoptotic (NVA) cells. This suggests that granular formation during apoptosis is a self-regulatory mechanism to produce higher number of viable cells in response to treatment. This study directs the need to search novel chemotherapeutic approaches by incorporating these findings when developing drugs against the emerging Blastocystis sp. infections.
27226275	Compounds Containing Azole Scaffolds as Cyclooxygenase Inhibitors: A Review.	There has been considerable interest in azole-containing compounds as promising antiinflammatory agents. Designed compounds with five-membered nitrogen-containing nuclei have demonstrated good anti-inflammatory activity, indicating their potential for the treatment of this highly irritating condition. Pyrazoles, have attracted much more attention than other azoles, however, reports on other azoles demonstrated that they were as effective as pyrazoles. This review describes the different classes of azoles designed as cyclooxygenase inhibitors and the effect of different structural modifications on their activity.
27433635	Metal-Enhanced Fluorescence: Ultrafast Energy Transfer from Dyes in a Polymer Film to Metal Nanoparticles.	Fluorescence from dye molecules dispersed in thin polymer layers increases by 20-25 times when a silver island film exists beneath the layer. Polymer layers of <100 nm thick cover the silver island film to minimize emission quenching from direct contact and also keep the dye molecules in close proximity to the metal nanosurface for possible fluorescence enhancements by silver island film. We report an ultrafast radiation process of ~400 ps lifetime from the surface plasmons of silver nanoparticles observed in time-resolved fluorescence of rhodamine 6G and DCM in thin polymer films coated on silver island surface. The ultrafast energy transfer and fluorescence from metal nanoparticles might be strongly related to the efficiency of metal-enhanced fluorescence.
26897901	UCSF Protocol for Caries Arrest Using Silver Diamine Fluoride: Rationale, Indications and Consent.	The Food and Drug Administration recently cleared silver diamine fluoride for reducing tooth sensitivity. Clinical trials document arrest and prevention of dental caries by silver diamine fluoride. This off-label use is now permissible and appropriate under U.S. law. A CDT code was approved for caries arresting medicaments for 2016 to facilitate documentation and billing. We present a systematic review, clinical indications, clinical protocol and consent procedure to guide application for caries arrest treatment.
27725813	Active Shiga-Like Toxin Produced by Some Aeromonas spp., Isolated in Mexico City.	Shiga-like toxins (Stx) represent a group of bacterial toxins involved in human and animal diseases. Stx is produced by enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli, Shigella dysenteriae type 1, Citrobacter freundii, and Aeromonas spp.; Stx is an important cause of bloody diarrhea and hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). The aim of this study was to identify the stx1/stx2 genes in clinical strains and outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) of Aeromonas spp., 66 strains were isolated from children who live in Mexico City, and Stx effects were evaluated in Vero cell cultures. The capacity to express active Stx1 and Stx2 toxins was determined in Vero cell cultures and the concentration of Stx was evaluated by 50% lethal dose (LD50) assays, observing inhibition of damaged cells by specific monoclonal antibodies. The results obtained in this study support the hypothesis that the stx gene is another putative virulence factor of Aeromonas, and since this gene can be transferred horizontally through OMVs this genus should be included as a possible causal agents of gastroenteritis and it should be reported as part of standard health surveillance procedures. Furthermore, these results indicate that the Aeromonas genus might be a potential causative agent of HUS.
27249752	Next-Generation Sequencing Informing Therapeutic Decisions and Personalized Approaches.	Multiple myeloma is a heterogeneous disease featured by different molecular subtypes. In the last decade, new therapeutics including second- and third-generation proteasome inhibitors and immunomodulatory agents, monoclonal antibodies, and other novel targeted agents have completely transformed the outcome of the disease. The task ahead is to develop strategies to identify effective combinations and sequences of agents that can exploit the genetic make-up of myeloma cells to improve efficacy. Moreover, a subgroup of high-risk patients who experience early disease relapse and shorter survival also requires early identification and specific intervention. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies now allow us to accomplish some of these goals. As described here, besides improving our understanding of the disease, it is beginning to influence our clinical decisions and therapeutic choices. In this article, we describe the current state-of-the-art role of NGS in myeloma from identifying high-risk disease, to drug selection, and, ultimately, to guide personalized therapy.
27442503	Prevalence of Circadian Rhythm Sleep-Wake Disorders and Associated Factors in Euthymic Patients with Bipolar Disorder.	Recent studies have suggested that there are certain pathophysiological relationships between bipolar disorder (BD) and circadian rhythm dysfunction. However, apparently no studies have clarified the prevalence of circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders (CRSWD) in patients with BD. This study was set out to investigate the prevalence of CRSWD and associated factors in patients with BD. One hundred four euthymic BD outpatients participated in this study. The subjects were asked to answer questionnaires including demographic variables, clinical course of BD, and family history of psychiatric disorders and suicide. Severity of BD was assessed by the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale and Young Mania Rating Scale. CRSWD was diagnosed by clinical interview, together with sleep logs, according to the International Classification of Sleep Disorders, third edition (ICSD-3). Thirty-five subjects (32.4%) met the criteria for CRSWD. The age at the time of investigation and that at the onset of BD were both lower in the CRSWD group than in the non-CRSWD group. The rates of family history of psychiatric disorders and suicide in the CRSWD group were higher than those in the non-CRSWD group. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that the presence of CRSWD was significantly associated with younger onset age of BD and family history of suicide. The prevalence of CRSWD could be quite high in BD patients. Younger onset age of BD and family history of suicide were associated with presence of CRSWD in BD patients.
26883453	Oxaliplatin administration increases expression of the voltage-dependent calcium channel alpha2delta-1 subunit in the rat spinal cord.	Oxaliplatin is a chemotherapeutic agent that is effective against various types of cancer including colorectal cancer. Acute cold hyperalgesia is a serious side effect of oxaliplatin treatment. Although the therapeutic drug pregabalin is beneficial for preventing peripheral neuropathic pain by targeting the voltage-dependent calcium channel alpha2delta-1 (Cavalpha2delta-1) subunit, the effect of oxaliplatin-induced acute cold hypersensitivity is uncertain. To analyze the contribution of the Cavalpha2delta-1 subunit to the development of oxaliplatin-induced acute cold hypersensitivity, Cavalpha2delta-1 subunit expression in the rat spinal cord was analyzed after oxaliplatin treatment. Behavioral assessment using the acetone spray test showed that 6 mg/kg oxaliplatin-induced cold hypersensitivity 2 and 4 days later. Oxaliplatin-induced acute cold hypersensitivity 4 days after treatment was significantly inhibited by pregabalin (50 mg/kg, p.o.). Oxaliplatin (6 mg/kg, i.p.) treatment increased the expression level of Cavalpha2delta-1 subunit mRNA and protein in the spinal cord 2 and 4 days after treatment. Immunohistochemistry showed that oxaliplatin increased Cavalpha2delta-1 subunit protein expression in superficial layers of the spinal dorsal horn 2 and 4 days after treatment. These results suggest that oxaliplatin treatment increases Cavalpha2delta-1 subunit expression in the superficial layers of the spinal cord and may contribute to functional peripheral acute cold hypersensitivity.
27555799	Myoelectric control of prosthetic hands: state-of-the-art review.	Myoelectric signals (MES) have been used in various applications, in particular, for identification of user intention to potentially control assistive devices for amputees, orthotic devices, and exoskeleton in order to augment capability of the user. MES are also used to estimate force and, hence, torque to actuate the assistive device. The application of MES is not limited to assistive devices, and they also find potential applications in teleoperation of robots, haptic devices, virtual reality, and so on. The myoelectric control-based prosthetic hand aids to restore activities of daily living of amputees in order to improve the self-esteem of the user. All myoelectric control-based prosthetic hands may not have similar operations and exhibit variation in sensing input, deciphering the signals, and actuating prosthetic hand. Researchers are focusing on improving the functionality of prosthetic hand in order to suit the user requirement with the different operating features. The myoelectric control differs in operation to accommodate various external factors. This article reviews the state of the art of myoelectric prosthetic hand, giving description of each control strategy.
27433366	Triple Valvulopathy and Jaccoud's Arthropathy: A Case Report and Literature Review.	Cardiac involvement is fairly common in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). It may involve all layers of the heart and coronary arteries as well as the heart valves. We report an extremely rare presentation of valvulitis and valvular dysfunction associated with systemic lupus erythematosus. This is the first case of lupus valvulitis which required three mechanical prosthetic valve replacements with disease recurrence leading to a fatal outcome. This is, in our point of view, the consequence of aggressive natural history of the disease and perhaps late diagnosis and treatment of underlying SLE which was unsuccessful.
26917378	The size and shape of three water-soluble, non-ionic polysaccharides produced by lactic acid bacteria: A comparative study.	Three water-soluble, non-ionic extracellular polysaccharides (EPS) obtained from lactic acid bacteria (S. thermophilus THS, L. helveticus K16 and S. thermophilus ST1) were subjected to a comparative study by means of multidetector size-exclusion chromatography, providing distributions and averages of molar masses, radii of gyration and intrinsic viscosities. All polysaccharides displayed random coil character. Further analysis of the data reveals differences in chain stiffness and extension that could be well correlated to structural features. The calculated persistence lengths ranged from 5 to 10nm and fall within the range typical for many single-stranded bacterial or plant polysaccharides. The ST1 polysaccharide had the highest molar mass but the lowest persistence length, which is attributed to the presence of the flexible (1-->6)-linkage in the main chain.
27672387	Nematode Peptides with Host-Directed Anti-inflammatory Activity Rescue Caenorhabditis elegans from a Burkholderia pseudomallei Infection.	Burkholderia pseudomallei, the causative agent of melioidosis, is among a growing number of bacterial pathogens that are increasingly antibiotic resistant. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have been investigated as an alternative approach to treat microbial infections, as generally, there is a lower likelihood that a pathogen will develop resistance to AMPs. In this study, 36 candidate Caenorhabditis elegans genes that encode secreted peptides of <150 amino acids and previously shown to be overexpressed during infection by B. pseudomallei were identified from the expression profile of infected nematodes. RNA interference (RNAi)-based knockdown of 12/34 peptide-encoding genes resulted in enhanced nematode susceptibility to B. pseudomallei without affecting worm fitness. A microdilution test demonstrated that two peptides, NLP-31 and Y43C5A.3, exhibited anti-B. pseudomallei activity in a dose dependent manner on different pathogens. Time kill analysis proposed that these peptides were bacteriostatic against B. pseudomallei at concentrations up to 8x MIC90. The SYTOX green assay demonstrated that NLP-31 and Y43C5A.3 did not disrupt the B. pseudomallei membrane. Instead, gel retardation assays revealed that both peptides were able to bind to DNA and interfere with bacterial viability. In parallel, microscopic examination showed induction of cellular filamentation, a hallmark of DNA synthesis inhibition, of NLP-31 and Y43C5A.3 treated cells. In addition, the peptides also regulated the expression of inflammatory cytokines in B. pseudomallei infected macrophage cells. Collectively, these findings demonstrate the potential of NLP-31 and Y43C5A.3 as anti-B. pseudomallei peptides based on their function as immune modulators.
27215086	The Value of Preoperative Neutrophil to Lymphocyte Ratio in Indicating Lymph Node Metastasis in Patients with Resectable T2 Stage Gastric Adenocarcinoma.	BACKGROUND: Lymph node metastasis (LNM) is closely associated with poor prognosis in patients with resectable T2 stage gastric adenocarcinoma (RT2-GA). Preoperative blood neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) has been identified to be a very valuable predictor for prognosis in patients with diverse cancers. The aim of this investigation was to assess the relationship between NLR and LNM in RT2-GA. METHODS: This retrospective study reviewed 230 patients who underwent surgery for removal of primary T2-GA from August 2002 to December 2013 in a single hospital. Preoperative routine blood test data were collected and the relationship between NLR and LNM in RT2-GA was evaluated by X2 test and multivariate logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: The median value of NLR was 2.18 among 230 patients. Based on the median NLR value, the patients were categorized into two groups: low NLR group (NLR </= 2.18) and high NLR group (NLR > 2.18). chi2 test results exhibited that the preoperative NLR was significantly associated with the numbers of metastatic lymph nodes (</= 6 and > 6) (p = 0.003) and status of lymph node involvement (N0, N1, and N2 stage) (p = 0.032). Multivariate analyses further confirmed that NLR > 2.18 was significantly associated with increased risk of appearing more numbers of metastatic lymph node or higher N stage which exhibited a 4.15- or 7.09-fold elevated risk compared to that of NLR </= 2.18. CONCLUSIONS: The preoperative NLR is closely associated with LNM in patients with RT2-GA, which may be used as a predictor indicating more serious LNM in this type of cancer.
27588020	Antimicrobial Proteins and Peptides in Early Life: Ontogeny and Translational Opportunities.	While developing adaptive immune responses, young infants are especially vulnerable to serious infections, including sepsis, meningitis, and pneumonia. Antimicrobial proteins and peptides (APPs) are key effectors that function as broad-spectrum anti-infectives. This review seeks to summarize the clinically relevant functional qualities of APPs and the increasing clinical trial evidence for their use to combat serious infections in infancy. Levels of APPs are relatively low in early life, especially in infants born preterm or with low birth weight (LBW). There are several rationales for the potential clinical utility of APPs in the prevention and treatment of infections in infants: (a) APPs may be most helpful in those with reduced levels; (b) during sepsis microbial products signal via pattern recognition receptors causing potentially harmful inflammation that APPs may counteract; and (c) in the era of antibiotic resistance, development of new anti-infective strategies is essential. Evidence supports the potential clinical utility of exogenous APPs to reduce infection-related morbidity in infancy. Further studies should characterize the ontogeny of antimicrobial activity in mucosal and systemic compartments, and examine the efficacy of exogenous-APP formulations to inform translational development of APPs for infant groups.
26960612	Inhibition of Rhodamine B-Ferricyanide Chemiluminescence by Gold Nanoparticles and Sensitive Determination of Hazardous Cyanide.	We describe a new turn off-on chemiluminescence (CL) method for the sensitive and selective determination of cyanide based on the inhibiting effect of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) on rhodamine B (RohB)-ferricyanide (Fe(CN)6(3-)) reaction. Free RohB can generate strong chemiluminescence emission when oxidized with Fe(CN)6(3-), but undergoes an intense extinction in the presence of AuNPs. Energy transfer and collisions between RohB molecules and AuNPs are probably the reason for this decreasing effect. Furthermore, it was found that CL intensity gradually recovered in the presence of cyanide due to its interaction with the AuNPs. The relation between the decreased CL intensity and cyanide concentration was exploited to develop a method for the determination of cyanide in the 16.7 - 1333 nmol L(-1) concentration range, with a detection limit of 13.6 nmol L(-1). In comparison with other nanoparticle-based methods, the presented assay shows good sensitivity and reliability for the determination of cyanide. The method was satisfactorily applied to the determination of cyanide in environmental and biological samples.
27468401	Screening of tropical isolates of Metarhizium anisopliae for virulence to the red palm weevil Rhynchophorus ferrugineus Olivier (Coleoptera: Curculionidae).	The red palm weevil, Rhynchophorus ferrugineus Olivier (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) is a serious pest of the palm tree in tropical regions of the world. One strain of Metarhizium sp. ZJ-1, isolated from Chinese soils, was evaluated for growth characteristics, and screened for its virulence to R. ferrugineus larvae in laboratory conditions. An approximately 685-bp fragment was amplified by ITS (ITS1-5.8S-ITS2) PCR from strain ZJ-1, further phylogenetic analysis revealed that 93 % similarity to Metarhizium anisopliae. Inoculation of 1 x 10(8) conidia/mL caused 100 % mortality of R. ferrugineus, LT50 levels of ZJ-1 were 1.66 days (1 x 10(8) conidia/mL), indicating that the conidia of strain ZJ-1 were highly virulent. These results suggest that M. anisopliae ZJ-1 has potential as an effective and persistent biological control agent for R. ferrugineus.
27803489	The Relationship between Occurrence Timing of Dispensing Errors and Subsequent Danger to Patients under the Situation According to the Classification of Drugs by Efficacy.	There are many reports regarding various medical institutions' attempts at the prevention of dispensing errors. However, the relationship between occurrence timing of dispensing errors and subsequent danger to patients has not been studied under the situation according to the classification of drugs by efficacy. Therefore, we analyzed the relationship between position and time regarding the occurrence of dispensing errors. Furthermore, we investigated the relationship between occurrence timing of them and danger to patients. In this study, dispensing errors and incidents in three categories (drug name errors, drug strength errors, drug count errors) were classified into two groups in terms of its drug efficacy (efficacy similarity (-) group, efficacy similarity (+) group), into three classes in terms of the occurrence timing of dispensing errors (initial phase errors, middle phase errors, final phase errors). Then, the rates of damage shifting from "dispensing errors" to "damage to patients" were compared as an index of danger between two groups and among three classes. Consequently, the rate of damage in "efficacy similarity (-) group" was significantly higher than that in "efficacy similarity (+) group". Furthermore, the rate of damage is the highest in "initial phase errors", the lowest in "final phase errors" among three classes. From the results of this study, it became clear that the earlier the timing of dispensing errors occurs, the more severe the damage to patients becomes.
27350500	Improving Health Care Accessibility: Strategies and Recommendations.	Access time refers to the interval between requesting and actual outpatient appointment. It reflects healthcare accessibility and has a great influence on patient treatment and satisfaction. King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia studied the accessibility to outpatient services in order to develop useful strategies and recommendations for improvement. Utilized, unutilized and no-show appointments were analyzed. It is crucial to manage no-shows and short notice appointment cancellations by preparing a waiting list for those patients who can be called in to an appointment on the same day using an open access policy. An overlapping appointment scheduling model can be useful to minimize patient waiting time and doctor idle time in addition to the sensible use of appointment overbooking that can significantly improve productivity.
26851311	Can Superselective Intra-Arterial Chemoradiotherapy Replace Surgery Followed by Radiation for Advanced Cancer of the Tongue and Floor of the Mouth?	PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to compare quality of life (QoL) and the survival rate after surgery with and without radiotherapy versus superselective intra-arterial chemoradiotherapy (SSIACRT) for advanced cancer of the tongue and floor of the mouth. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with stage III and IV squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue and floor of the mouth treated between 2000 and 2013 were included in this study. The predictor variables were surgery without radiotherapy, surgery followed by radiotherapy, and SSIACRT. The outcome variables were QoL and the survival rate. The University of Washington QoL questionnaire (UW-QOL) was used for evaluation of QoL. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate the overall survival rate. The UW-QOL was analyzed by analysis of covariance, and the survival rate was analyzed statistically by the log-rank test. RESULTS: Sixty-two patients were eligible for this study. Of these, 13 were treated by surgery without radiotherapy, 29 were treated by surgery plus radiotherapy, and 20 were treated by SSIACRT. The SSIACRT group had the best UW-QOL scores among the 3 groups. The 5-year Kaplan-Meier disease-specific survival rates for these groups were 92.9%, 62.9%, and 83.2%, respectively, with no significant difference (P = .20) shown. CONCLUSIONS: The QoL scores of the SSIACRT group were the best among the 3 groups in most domains. The superiority of QoL and the survival rate in the SSIACRT group showed that SSIACRT should be preferred in managing advanced cancer of the tongue and floor of the mouth.
27868090	Extraction and Analysis of Terpenes/Terpenoids.	Terpenes/terpenoids constitute one of the largest classes of natural products, this is due to the incredible chemical diversity that can arise from the biochemical transformations of the relatively simple prenyl diphosphate starter units. All terpenes/terpenoids comprise a hydrocarbon backbone that is generated from the various length prenyl diphosphates (a polymer chain of prenyl units). Upon ionization (removal) of the diphosphate group, the remaining allylic carbocation intermediates can be coaxed down complex chemical cascades leading to diverse linear and cyclized hydrocarbon backbones, which can then be further modified with a wide range of functional groups (e.g. alcohol, ketones, etc.) and substituent additions (e.g. sugars, fatty acids). Because of this chemical diversity, terpenes/terpenoids have great industrial uses as flavors, fragrances, high grade lubricants, biofuels, agricultural chemicals and medicines. The protocols presented here focus on the extraction of terpenes/terpenoids from various plant sources and have been divided into extraction methods for terpenes/terpenoids with various levels of chemical decoration, from the relative small, nonpolar, volatile hydrocarbons to substantially large molecules with greater physical complexity due to their chemical modifications.
28133386	Application of the Teager-Kaiser Energy Operator in an autonomous burst detector to create onset and offset profiles of forearm muscles during reach-to-grasp movements.	PURPOSE: The primary aim of this study is to investigate the potential benefit of the Teager-Kaiser Energy Operator (TKEO) as data pre-processor, in an autonomous burst detection method to classify electromyographic signals of the (fore)arm and hand. For this purpose, optimal settings of the burst detector, leading to minimal detection errors, need to be known. Additionally, the burst detector is applied to real muscle activity recorded in healthy adults performing reach-to-grasp movements. METHODS: The burst detector was based on the Approximated Generalized Likelihood Ratio (AGLR). Simulations with synthesized electromyographic (EMG) traces with known onset and offset times, yielded optimal settings for AGLR parameters "window width" and "threshold value" that minimized detection errors. Next, comparative simulations were done with and without TKEO data pre-processing. Correct working of the burst detector was verified by applying it to real surface EMG signals obtained from arm and hand muscles involved in a submaximal reach-to-grasp task, performed by healthy adults. RESULTS: Minimal detection errors were found with a window width of 100 ms and a detection threshold of 15. Inclusion of the TKEO contributed significantly to a reduction of detection errors. Application of the autonomous burst detector to real data was feasible. CONCLUSIONS: The burst detector was able to classify muscle activation and create Muscle Onset Offset Profiles (MOOPs) autonomously from real EMG data, which allows objective comparison of MOOPs obtained from movement tasks performed in different conditions or from different populations. The TKEO contributed to improved performance and robustness of the burst detector.
26929618	COPD characteristics and socioeconomic burden in Hellenic correctional institutions.	BACKGROUND: The high prevalence of smoking (80%) in Greek correctional institutions is anticipated to result in high prevalence of COPD in such settings. AIM: The aim of the Greek obstructive luNg disease epidemiOlogy and health economics Study In corrective institutionS (GNOSIS) is to determine the prevalence of smoking and COPD among inmates and to assess the health-related quality of life. METHODS: GNOSIS, a cross-sectional epidemiological study, was conducted between March 2011 and December 2011 in seven correctional institutions in Greece. RESULTS: A total of 552 participants, 91.3% male, median age of 43.0 years (interquartile range: 35-53), were enrolled. COPD prevalence was 6.0% and was found to increase with age (18.6% among those >/=60 years), length of prison stay, and length of sentence. Of the participants diagnosed with COPD, 36.4% were diagnosed with Global initiative for chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) stage I and 51.5% were diagnosed with stage II. Dyspnea severity was assessed as grades 0-1 on the medical research council dyspnea scale for 88.3%, while 31% reported >/=2 COPD exacerbations in the past year. Seventy-nine percent of the total number of the participants were smokers, with a median smoking of 20.0 cigarettes per day, while 42.9% were assessed as having a strong addiction to nicotine. The median EuroQol visual analog scale score was 70.0 (interquartile range: 60.0-90.0). Problems in the dimension of anxiety/depression were reported by 82.8%. CONCLUSION: The results of the study support the notion that the prevalence of COPD among inmates of Greek correctional institutions may increase in the following years. The findings underscore the importance of taking actions to limit COPD prevalence and its risk factors in the Greek correctional system.
27534533	CB2 receptor activation prevents glial-derived neurotoxic mediator production, BBB leakage and peripheral immune cell infiltration and rescues dopamine neurons in the MPTP model of Parkinson's disease.	The cannabinoid (CB2) receptor type 2 has been proposed to prevent the degeneration of dopamine neurons in 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-treated mice. However, the mechanisms underlying CB2 receptor-mediated neuroprotection in MPTP mice have not been elucidated. The mechanisms underlying CB2 receptor-mediated neuroprotection of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra (SN) were evaluated in the MPTP mouse model of Parkinson's disease (PD) by immunohistochemical staining (tyrosine hydroxylase, macrophage Ag complex-1, glial fibrillary acidic protein, myeloperoxidase (MPO), and CD3 and CD68), real-time PCR and a fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled albumin assay. Treatment with the selective CB2 receptor agonist JWH-133 (10 mug kg(-1), intraperitoneal (i.p.)) prevented MPTP-induced degeneration of dopamine neurons in the SN and of their fibers in the striatum. This JWH-133-mediated neuroprotection was associated with the suppression of blood-brain barrier (BBB) damage, astroglial MPO expression, infiltration of peripheral immune cells and production of inducible nitric oxide synthase, proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines by activated microglia. The effects of JWH-133 were mimicked by the non-selective cannabinoid receptor WIN55,212 (10 mug kg(-1), i.p.). The observed neuroprotection and inhibition of glial-mediated neurotoxic events were reversed upon treatment with the selective CB2 receptor antagonist AM630, confirming the involvement of the CB2 receptor. Our results suggest that targeting the cannabinoid system may be beneficial for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, such as PD, that are associated with glial activation, BBB disruption and peripheral immune cell infiltration.
26986275	Spiral wave chimeras in locally coupled oscillator systems.	The recently discovered chimera state involves the coexistence of synchronized and desynchronized states for a group of identical oscillators. In this work, we show the existence of (inwardly) rotating spiral wave chimeras in the three-component reaction-diffusion systems where each element is locally coupled by diffusion. A transition from spiral waves with the smooth core to spiral wave chimeras is found as we change the local dynamics of the system or as we gradually increase the diffusion coefficient of the activator. Our findings on the spiral wave chimera in the reaction-diffusion systems suggest that spiral chimera states may be found in chemical and biological systems that can be modeled by a large population of oscillators indirectly coupled via a diffusive environment.
26973645	Heterozygous Mutation in IkappaBNS Leads to Reduced Levels of Natural IgM Antibodies and Impaired Responses to T-Independent Type 2 Antigens.	Mice deficient in central components of classical NF-kappaB signaling have low levels of circulating natural IgM antibodies and fail to respond to immunization with T-independent type 2 (TI-2) antigens. A plausible explanation for these defects is the severely reduced numbers of B-1 and marginal zone B (MZB) cells in such mice. By using an ethyl-N-nitrosourea mutagenesis screen, we identified a role for the atypical IkappaB protein IkappaBNS in humoral immunity. IkappaBNS-deficient mice lack B-1 cells and have severely reduced numbers of MZB cells, and thus resemble several other strains with defects in classical NF-kappaB signaling. We analyzed mice heterozygous for the identified IkappaBNS mutation and demonstrate that these mice have an intermediary phenotype in terms of levels of circulating IgM antibodies and responses to TI-2 antigens. However, in contrast to mice that are homozygous for the IkappaBNS mutation, the heterozygous mice had normal frequencies of B-1 and MZB cells. These results suggest that there is a requirement for IkappaBNS expression from two functional alleles for maintaining normal levels of circulating natural IgM antibodies and responses to TI-2 antigens.
27736966	Exercise Lowers Plasma Angiopoietin-Like 2 in Men with Post-Acute Coronary Syndrome.	Pro-inflammatory angiopoietin-like 2 (angptl2) promotes endothelial dysfunction in mice and circulating angptl2 is higher in patients with cardiovascular diseases. We previously reported that a single bout of physical exercise was able to reduce angptl2 levels in coronary patients. We hypothesized that chronic exercise would reduce angptl2 in patients with post-acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and endothelial dysfunction. Post-ACS patients (n = 40, 10 women) were enrolled in a 3-month exercise-based prevention program. Plasma angptl2, hs-CRP, and endothelial function assessed by scintigraphic forearm blood flow, were measured before and at the end of the study. Exercise increased VO2peak by 10% (p<0.05), but did not significantly affect endothelial function, in both men and women. In contrast, exercise reduced angptl2 levels only in men (-26+/-7%, p<0.05), but unexpectedly not in women (+30+/-16%), despite similar initial levels in both groups. Exercise reduced hs-CRP levels in men but not in women. In men, levels of angptl2, but not of hs-CRP, reached at the end of the training program were negatively correlated with VO2peak (r = -0.462, p = 0.012) and with endothelial function (r = -0.419, p = 0.033) measured at baseline: better initial cardiopulmonary fitness and endothelial function correlated with lower angptl2 levels after exercise. Pre-exercise angptl2 levels were lower if left ventricular ejection time was long (p<0.05) and the drop in angptl2 induced by exercise was greater if the cardiac output was high (p<0.05). In conclusion, in post-ACS men, angptl2 levels are sensitive to chronic exercise training. Low circulating angptl2 reached after training may reflect good endothelial and cardiopulmonary functions.
27445765	Functional Connectivity of the Precuneus in Female University Students with Long-Term Musical Training.	Conceiving concrete mental imagery is critical for skillful musical expression and performance. The precuneus, a core component of the default mode network (DMN), is a hub of mental image processing that participates in functions such as episodic memory retrieval and imagining future events. The precuneus connects with many brain regions in the frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital cortices. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of long-term musical training on the resting-state functional connectivity of the precuneus. Our hypothesis was that the functional connectivity of the precuneus is altered in musicians. We analyzed the functional connectivity of the precuneus using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data recorded in female university students majoring in music and nonmusic disciplines. The results show that the music students had higher functional connectivity of the precuneus with opercular/insular regions, which are associated with interoceptive and emotional processing; Heschl's gyrus (HG) and the planum temporale (PT), which process complex tonal information; and the lateral occipital cortex (LOC), which processes visual information. Connectivity of the precuneus within the DMN did not differ between the two groups. Our finding suggests that functional connections between the precuneus and the regions outside of the DMN play an important role in musical performance. We propose that a neural network linking the precuneus with these regions contributes to translate mental imagery into information relevant to musical performance.
27110309	The importance of G2677T/A and C3435T polymorphisms of the MDR1 gene in the aetiology of colorectal cancer.	INTRODUCTION: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the most common cancer among patients, and its aetiology is still not precisely known. It is believed that 15-30% of colorectal cancers are genetically determined. P-glycoprotein (P-gp) encoded by the MDR1 gene in normal conditions plays an important role in the action of colon epithelial cells. However, the MDR1 polymorphism influences the P-gp expression and can weaken its effect against xenobiotics (procarcinogens) and increase the frequency of CRC. AIM: To evaluate the correlation between the MDR1 C3435T and G2677T/A polymorphisms and the risk of colorectal cancer. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study group with colorectal cancer included 47 women and 60 men while the control group consisted of 110 healthy patients. The diagnosis in patients suffering from CRC was confirmed by histopathological report. Genetic analysis was performed using PCR-RFLP method. RESULTS: We showed only a correlation between the frequency of CT and TT genotypes of C3435T polymorphism and the risk of colorectal cancer in younger age. There was no correlation between the C3435T and G2677T/A polymorphisms of the MDR1 gene and other clinical parameters. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that T allele carriers of C3435T polymorphism have an increased risk of CRC. However, further studies are needed on a much larger number of patients and genes associated with metabolism and transport of xenobiotics including procarcinogens.
27110389	Model-based iterative reconstruction and adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction: dose-reduced CT for detecting pancreatic calcification.	BACKGROUND: Iterative reconstruction methods have attracted attention for reducing radiation doses in computed tomography (CT). PURPOSE: To investigate the detectability of pancreatic calcification using dose-reduced CT reconstructed with model-based iterative construction (MBIR) and adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction (ASIR). MATERIAL AND METHODS: This prospective study approved by Institutional Review Board included 85 patients (57 men, 28 women; mean age, 69.9 years; mean body weight, 61.2 kg). Unenhanced CT was performed three times with different radiation doses (reference-dose CT [RDCT], low-dose CT [LDCT], ultralow-dose CT [ULDCT]). From RDCT, LDCT, and ULDCT, images were reconstructed with filtered-back projection (R-FBP, used for establishing reference standard), ASIR (L-ASIR), and MBIR and ASIR (UL-MBIR and UL-ASIR), respectively. A lesion (pancreatic calcification) detection test was performed by two blinded radiologists with a five-point certainty level scale. RESULTS: Dose-length products of RDCT, LDCT, and ULDCT were 410, 97, and 36 mGy-cm, respectively. Nine patients had pancreatic calcification. The sensitivity for detecting pancreatic calcification with UL-MBIR was high (0.67-0.89) compared to L-ASIR or UL-ASIR (0.11-0.44), and a significant difference was seen between UL-MBIR and UL-ASIR for one reader (P = 0.014). The area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve for UL-MBIR (0.818-0.860) was comparable to that for L-ASIR (0.696-0.844). The specificity was lower with UL-MBIR (0.79-0.92) than with L-ASIR or UL-ASIR (0.96-0.99), and a significant difference was seen for one reader (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: In UL-MBIR, pancreatic calcification can be detected with high sensitivity, however, we should pay attention to the slightly lower specificity.
27580558	Penicillium marneffei Infection with beta-D-glucan Elevation: A Case Report and Literature Review.	We herein report a case of Penicillium marneffei infection (PMI) in a Japanese man who was infected with human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1), who was diagnosed on the basis of a bone marrow culture and who was effectively treated with itraconazole. Our review of the PMI cases reported in Japan suggests that increased serum (1-->3)-beta-D-glucan levels are a useful diagnostic tool in cases of suspected PMI.
27249754	Local Therapy for Limited Metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: What Are the Options and Is There a Benefit?	Distant metastasis is common in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and typically associated with poor prognosis. Aggressive local therapy including surgery and/or radiation for limited metastatic disease from colorectal cancer and sarcoma is associated with survival benefit and has become part of the standard of care. In this article, we review the literature and ongoing studies concerning surgery, radiation, and radiofrequency ablation for oligometastatic NSCLC.
27247562	Regularized Embedded Multiple Kernel Dimensionality Reduction for Mine Signal Processing.	Traditional multiple kernel dimensionality reduction models are generally based on graph embedding and manifold assumption. But such assumption might be invalid for some high-dimensional or sparse data due to the curse of dimensionality, which has a negative influence on the performance of multiple kernel learning. In addition, some models might be ill-posed if the rank of matrices in their objective functions was not high enough. To address these issues, we extend the traditional graph embedding framework and propose a novel regularized embedded multiple kernel dimensionality reduction method. Different from the conventional convex relaxation technique, the proposed algorithm directly takes advantage of a binary search and an alternative optimization scheme to obtain optimal solutions efficiently. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for supervised, unsupervised, and semisupervised scenarios.
27980701	Closure of a Tracheocutaneous Fistula With a Local Turnover Flap Combined With Pregrafted Palatal Mucosa: A Case Report.	Objectives: A method of closing a large tracheocutaneous fistula by a combination of a palatal mucosal graft with a turnover adiposal flap is presented. Methods: Mucosa of the same size as the tracheal defect was harvested from the hard palate and grafted just caudal to the fistula. After the mucosal graft had taken, a local flap containing the mucosal graft was turned over the tracheal defect facing the mucosa inward of the tracheal lumen. The defect caused by harvesting the flap was closed horizontally. Results: The fistula was closed successfully, and 1 year after the operation, the patient had no airway compromise and the operative scar was inconspicuous. Conclusions: Although the described method is a 2-stage procedure, it can be used to simply and reliably reconstruct the mucosal layer of the tracheal lumen and overlying skin.
27372759	Preparation and Analysis of Native Chromatin-Modifying Complexes.	Nucleosomes, the basic units of chromatin, are decorated with a myriad of posttranslational modifications (PTMs) by the action of chromatin modifiers. These enzymes function almost exclusively as part of stable protein complexes that assist their recruitment to specific genomic loci, specify their substrate, and provide allosteric control. By altering the interactions within nucleosomes or with neighboring nucleosomes and serving as a platform to engage effector proteins, PTMs deposited by histone-modifying complexes influence virtually every nuclear process and are at the heart of the epigenetic mechanisms. Hence, it is critical to identify their components, define their structures, and characterize their biochemical activities. Here we describe protocols for tandem affinity purification (TAP) of native histone acetyltransferase (HAT) and methyltransferase (HMT) complexes from human cells engineered to express bait proteins from a genomic safe harbor or their endogenous chromosomal genes, using zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs), TAL effector nucleases (TALENs), and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 systems. The approaches presented aim to preserve natural transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulation and minimize biochemical artifacts due to ectopic expression. Near homogenous preparations of native complexes are obtained in sufficient amounts to perform biochemical assays and characterize their components.
28018376	Polychromatic Supplemental Lighting from underneath Canopy Is More Effective to Enhance Tomato Plant Development by Improving Leaf Photosynthesis and Stomatal Regulation.	Light insufficient stress caused by canopy interception and mutual shading is a major factor limiting plant growth and development in intensive crop cultivation. Supplemental lighting can be used to give light to the lower canopy leaves and is considered to be an effective method to cope with low irradiation stress. Leaf photosynthesis, stomatal regulation, and plant growth and development of young tomato plants were examined to estimate the effects of supplemental lighting with various composite spectra and different light orientations. Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) of polychromatic light quality, red + blue (R/B), white + red + blue (W/R/B), white + red + far-red (W/R/FR), and white + blue (W/B) were assembled from the underneath canopy or from the inner canopy as supplemental lighting resources. The results showed that the use of supplemental lighting significantly increased the photosynthetic efficiency, and reduced stomatal closure while promoting plant growth. Among all supplemental lighting treatments, the W/R/B and W/B from the underneath canopy had best performance. The different photosynthetic performances among the supplemental lighting treatments are resulted from variations in CO2 utilization. The enhanced blue light fraction in the W/R/B and W/B could better stimulate stomatal opening and promote photosynthetic electron transport activity, thus better improving photosynthetic rate. Compared with the inner canopy treatment, the supplemental lighting from the underneath canopy could better enhance the carbon dioxide assimilation efficiency and excessive energy dissipation, leading to an improved photosynthetic performance. Stomatal morphology was highly correlated to leaf photosynthesis and plant development, and should thus be an important determinant for the photosynthesis and the growth of greenhouse tomatoes.
27895931	Erratum: Publisher's Erratum: Spinal-generated movement disorders: a clinical review.	[This corrects the article DOI: 10.1186/s40734-015-0028-1.].
27119543	Working towards widening participation in nurse education.	The widening participation agenda has particular significance for worldwide nursing since it is a profession which is under increasing scrutiny in its recruitment and retention practices. Debate about this agenda within nurse education is strengthened by careful scrutiny of the research within the wider context of higher education, some of which challenges commonly held assumptions. This paper examines four areas of relevance to the UK widening participation agenda: disability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status and family responsibilities. Taken together, they indicate that nurse education operates within a particularly complex context with some important implications for the future design of pre-registration programmes. These complexities should be debated in depth by educational commissioners and providers, in tandem with regulatory bodies.
27668593	Identifying and understanding Indigenous ways of evaluating physical activity programs.	Indigenous evaluation frameworks have not been investigated in the context of American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) physical activity programs, an important area given the relationship between effective physical activity programs and quality of life among these populations. To address this gap, staff members of AI/AN physical activity programs were interviewed to explore their understanding of and experiences with evaluation. Findings suggest that Indigenous evaluation is perceived as narrative and holistic, Indigenous knowledge is used in program decision making, though it is not always acknowledged as evaluation, and there is not a universally desired way to evaluate AI/AN physical activity programs.
26857503	Role of orexin-A in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis.	The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of orexin-A (OX-A) on behavioral and pathological parameters and on gene expression of some multiple sclerosis-related peptides in a model of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). EAE was induced by subcutaneous administration of MOG 35-55. Following immunization, the treatment was initiated by using SB.334867 (orexin-1 receptor antagonist) and/or OX-A. Locomotor activity and exploratory behaviors were monitored using open field and T-maze continuous alternation task (T-CAT) respectively. Pain sensitivity was assessed by hot-plate test. Histopathological assessments were performed by H&E staining. The expression of TGF-beta, MBP, MMP-9, IL-12, iNOS and MCP-1 were measured using real-time PCR method in lumbar spinal cord. OX-A administration in EAE mice remarkably attenuated the clinical symptoms, increased latency response in hot plate test, inhibited infiltration of inflammatory cells, up-regulated mRNA expression of TGF-beta as well as MBP and down-regulated mRNA expression of iNOS, MMP-9 and IL-12. In contrast SB.334867 administration in EAE mice deteriorated the clinical symptoms, decreased the alternation in T-CAT, increased infiltration of inflammatory cells, down-regulated mRNA expression of TGF-beta and MBP and up-regulated mRNA expression of iNOS. Results of this study suggest that the orexinergic system might be involved in pathological development of EAE. These findings suggest orexinergic system as a potential target for treatment of multiple sclerosis.
27807544	Qualitative Parameters of the Colonic Flora in Patients with HNF1A-MODY Are Different from Those Observed in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.	Background. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is determined by genetic and environmental factors. There have been many studies on the relationship between the composition of the gastrointestinal bacterial flora, T2DM, and obesity. There are no data, however, on the gut microbiome structure in monogenic forms of the disease including Maturity Onset Diabetes of the Young (MODY). Methods. The aim of the investigation was to compare the qualitative parameters of the colonic flora in patients with HNF1A-MODY and T2DM and healthy individuals. 16S sequencing of bacterial DNA isolated from the collected fecal samples using the MiSeq platform was performed. Results. There were significant between-group differences in the bacterial profile. At the phylum level, the amount of Proteobacteria was higher (p = 0.0006) and the amount of Bacteroidetes was lower (p = 0.0005) in T2DM group in comparison to the control group. In HNF1A-MODY group, the frequency of Bacteroidetes was lower than in the control group (p = 0.0143). At the order level, Turicibacterales was more abundant in HNF1A-MODY group than in T2DM group. Conclusions. It appears that there are differences in the gut microbiome composition between patients with HNF1A-MODY and type 2 diabetes. Further investigation on this matter should be conducted.
26912713	Introduction to Insights Gained from Wildlife Research in the Context of Global Anthropogenic Change.	The language and subject matter offered in this issue of the ILAR Journal represent a departure from standard discourse on research animal welfare. Although the overall character of such a departure will become evident, the contributions herein reinforce and expand upon the shared, established tenets of research animal welfare. Through the work and experience of contributing wildlife research professionals, this issue of the ILAR Journal offers a diverse consortium of wildlife topics ranging from policy to conservation to disease investigation, all against the backdrop of the complexities of effective compliance and oversight when the research subjects are wild. The articles provide insights into the complex dynamic that is animal welfare in the framework of wildlife research from diverse perspectives. Material presented in this issue contributes to our existing philosophies on research animal welfare while simultaneously introducing the research animal professional to new perspectives, hopefully allowing us all to walk a familiar, well-trodden path with new eyes. The express aim of the issue is to introduce traditional oversight personnel to a deeper understanding of the topics covered herein.
26835633	Depth map sensor based on optical doped lens with multi-walled carbon nanotubes of liquid crystal.	In this paper, we present a novel design concept for determining the depth map of three-dimensional (3D) scenes based on an electrically controlled liquid crystal (LC) lens. The advantages of the proposed method are that it does not need any mechanical movements and a large amount of computations to acquire a depth map of a 3D scene in a relatively short amount of time. The tunable-focus LC lens doped with multi-walled carbon nanotubes is to become a key optical component for determining a depth map system. Sequenced two-dimensional images of slightly different perspectives are recorded in a short time, and the depth map of the 3D scene, according to a proposed depth estimation method and a focusing evaluation function, can be acquired in a simple way. This new method to acquire a depth map based on a doped LC lens maximizes the use of the proposed LC lens. The proposed system is novel in its compact, simple, and fast features, so we believe the proposed method can open a new creative dimension in image analysis and imaging systems and can also overcome the limitations of the conventional imaging mode.
27761111	Sexual Dimorphism and Aging in the Human Hyppocampus: Identification, Validation, and Impact of Differentially Expressed Genes by Factorial Microarray and Network Analysis.	Motivation: In the brain of elderly-healthy individuals, the effects of sexual dimorphism and those due to normal aging appear overlapped. Discrimination of these two dimensions would powerfully contribute to a better understanding of the etiology of some neurodegenerative diseases, such as "sporadic" Alzheimer. Methods: Following a system biology approach, top-down and bottom-up strategies were combined. First, public transcriptome data corresponding to the transition from adulthood to the aging stage in normal, human hippocampus were analyzed through an optimized microarray post-processing (Q-GDEMAR method) together with a proper experimental design (full factorial analysis). Second, the identified genes were placed in context by building compatible networks. The subsequent ontology analyses carried out on these networks clarify the main functionalities involved. Results: Noticeably we could identify large sets of genes according to three groups: those that exclusively depend on the sex, those that exclusively depend on the age, and those that depend on the particular combinations of sex and age (interaction). The genes identified were validated against three independent sources (a proteomic study of aging, a senescence database, and a mitochondrial genetic database). We arrived to several new inferences about the biological functions compromised during aging in two ways: by taking into account the sex-independent effects of aging, and considering the interaction between age and sex where pertinent. In particular, we discuss the impact of our findings on the functions of mitochondria, autophagy, mitophagia, and microRNAs. Conclusions: The evidence obtained herein supports the occurrence of significant neurobiological differences in the hippocampus, not only between adult and elderly individuals, but between old-healthy women and old-healthy men. Hence, to obtain realistic results in further analysis of the transition from the normal aging to incipient Alzheimer, the features derived from the sexual dimorphism in hippocampus should be explicitly considered.
27611332	Contemporary Pharyngeal and Invasive emm1 and Invasive emm12 Group A Streptococcus Isolates Exhibit Similar In Vivo Selection for CovRS Mutants in Mice.	Group A Streptococcus (GAS) causes diverse infections ranging from common pharyngitis to rare severe invasive infections. Invasive GAS isolates can have natural mutations in the virulence regulator CovRS, which result in enhanced expression of multiple virulence genes, suppressed the expression of the protease SpeB, and increased virulence. It is believed that CovRS mutations arise during human infections with GAS carrying wild-type CovRS and are not transmissible. CovRS mutants of invasive GAS of the emm1 genotype arise readily during experimental infection in mice. It is possible that invasive GAS arises from pharyngeal GAS through rare genetic mutations that confer the capacity of mutated GAS to acquire covRS mutations during infection. The objective of this study was to determine whether contemporary pharyngeal emm1 GAS isolates have a reduced propensity to acquire CovRS mutations in vivo compared with invasive emm1 GAS and whether emm3, emm12, and emm28 GAS acquire CovRS mutants in mouse infection. The propensity of invasive and pharyngeal emm1 and invasive emm3, emm12, and emm28 SpeBA+ isolates to acquire variants with the SpeBA- phenotype was determined during subcutaneous infection of mice. The majority of both invasive and pharyngeal emm1 SpeBA+ isolates and two of three emm12 isolates, but not emm3 and emm28 isolates, were found to acquire SpeBA- variants during skin infection in mice. All analyzed SpeBA- variants of emm1 and emm12 GAS from the mouse infection acquired covRS mutations and produced more platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase SsE. Thus, contemporary invasive and pharyngeal emm1 GAS isolates and emm12 GAS have a similar capacity to acquire covRS mutations in vivo. The rarity of severe invasive infections caused by GAS does not appear to be attributable to a reduced ability of pharyngeal isolates to acquire CovRS mutations.
28082944	Verbal Synchrony and Action Dynamics in Large Groups.	While synchronized movement has been shown to increase liking and feelings of togetherness between people, we investigated whether collective speaking in time would change the way that larger groups played a video game together. Anthropologists have speculated that the function of interpersonal coordination in dance, chants, and singing is not just to produce warm, affiliative feelings, but also to improve group action. The group that chants and dances together hunts well together. Direct evidence for this is sparse, as research so far has mainly studied pairs, the effects of coordinated physical movement, and measured cooperation and affiliative decisions. In our experiment, large groups of people were given response handsets to play a computer game together, in which only joint coordinative efforts lead to success. Before playing, the synchrony of their verbal behavior was manipulated. After the game, we measured group members' affiliation toward their group, their performance on a memory task, and the way in which they played the group action task. We found that verbal synchrony in large groups produced affiliation, enhanced memory performance, and increased group members' coordinative efforts. Our evidence suggests that the effects of synchrony are stable across modalities, can be generalized to larger groups and have consequences for action coordination.
26893540	Comparison between the EX-PRESS P-50 implant and trabeculectomy in patients with open-angle glaucoma.	PURPOSE: To evaluate the EX-PRESS P-50 implant compared to standard trabeculectomy (TBC). METHODS: Single-center prospective randomized study; 20 eyes of 20 patients were treated with the EX-PRESS P-50 implant, and 20 eyes of 20 patients with TBC, over a 19-month period. Records of all patients were reviewed and compared. Success was defined as intraocular pressure (IOP) <21 and >5 mmHg or a decrease of 30% of IOP. Failure was defined as >21 mmHg or decline in visual acuity. Statistical analysis was made with Student's t-test and chi (2) test analyzed with SPSS version 13.0. RESULTS: The average follow-up was 8.6 months (+/-4.9 months) for the EX-PRESS P-50 group and 9.6 months (+/-5.3 months) for the TBC group. The postoperative visual acuity and IOP were not significantly different. We report more complications in the EX-PRESS P-50 group. At 3, 6, and 12 months follow-up, the control group was found to be free of complications, whereas multiple complications were observed in the EX-PRESS P-50 group at 3 and 6 months follow-up. We found no differences in either group with respect to success. CONCLUSION: Both procedures are equally effective for the treatment of glaucoma, with 80% success in the EX-PRESS P-50 group and 72.7% in the control group.
27402617	An examination of the nutritional intake and anthropometric status of individuals with intellectual disabilities.	The prevalence of obesity appears greater in people with intellectual disabilities than those in the general population. This study aimed to examine the nutritional intake and anthropometric status of individuals with intellectual disabilities. Participants aged 16-64 years were recruited from intellectual disability service provider organizations ( n = 131). Data were collected using questionnaires; 4-day food dairies and weight, height and waist circumference measurements. Participants' mean body mass index (BMI) was 29.4 kg/m2 +/- 6.1, 2.4% were underweight, 22.6% were normal weight, 28.2% were overweight and 46.8% were obese. Having a diagnosis of Down syndrome ( p = 0.03) was associated with increasing BMI. Increasing waist circumference was associated with increasing severity of ID ( p = 0.04). The mean-reported energy intake was 1890 kcal/day. Mean energy intakes from sugar, fat and saturated fat were above recommendations and few participants met micronutrient recommended daily amounts. This study highlights the alarming prevalence of overweight and obesity and poor diet quality of individuals with intellectual disabilities.
27160533	Development of Anticancer Agents from Plant-Derived Sesquiterpene Lactones.	Sesquiterpene lactones are of considerable interest due to their potent bioactivities, including cancer cell cytotoxicity and antineoplastic efficacy in in vivo studies. Among these compounds, artesunate, dimethylaminoparthenolide, and L12ADT peptide prodrug, a derivative of thapsigargin, are being evaluated in the current cancer clinical or preclinical trials. Based on the structures of several antitumor sesquiterpene lactones, a number of analogues showing greater potency have been either isolated as natural products or partially synthesized, and some potential anticancer agents that have emerged from this group of lead compounds have been investigated extensively. The present review focuses on artemisinin, parthenolide, thapsigargin, and their naturally occurring or synthetic analogues showing potential anticancer activity. This provides an overview of the advances in the development of these types of sesquiterpene lactones as potential anticancer agents, including their structural characterization, synthesis and synthetic modification, and antitumor potential, with the mechanism of action and structure-activity relationships also discussed. It is hoped that this will be helpful in stimulating the further interest in developing sesquiterpene lactones and their derivatives as new anticancer agents.
26970618	Cycling in the Cell Fate Landscape.	The causal relationship between the cell cycle and cell fate has recently been reconsidered in several developmental systems, now including sex determination. Direct links between cell cycle machinery and developmental factors demonstrate how modulating the cell cycle can have a profound influence on cellular decisions, through phenomena largely divided into phase-specific interactions seen as "priming" and "competence," or global changes in transcription or histone modifications during transitions. This integration challenges the common view of cell fate landscapes.
27116697	Global income and production impacts of using GM crop technology 1996-2014.	This paper provides an economic assessment of the value of using genetically modified (GM) crop technology in agriculture at the farm level. It follows and updates earlier annual studies which examined economic impacts on yields, key costs of production, direct farm income and effects, and impacts on the production base of the 4 main crops of soybeans, corn, cotton and canola. The commercialisation of GM crops has continued to occur at a rapid rate since the mid 1990s, with important changes in both the overall level of adoption and impact occurring in 2014. This annual updated analysis shows that there continues to be very significant net economic benefits at the farm level amounting to $17.7 billion in 2014 and $150.3 billion for the 19-year period 1996-2014 (in nominal terms). These economic gains have been divided roughly 50% each to farmers in developed and developing countries. About 65% of the gains have derived from yield and production gains with the remaining 35% coming from cost savings. The technology has also made important contributions to increasing global production levels of the 4 main crops, having, for example, added 158 million tonnes and 322 million tonnes respectively, to the global production of soybeans and maize since the introduction of the technology in the mid 1990s.
27317579	Estrogen-dependent visceral hypersensitivity following stress in rats: An fMRI study.	We used functional MRI and a longitudinal design to investigate the brain mechanisms in a previously reported estrogen-dependent visceral hypersensitivity model. We hypothesized that noxious visceral stimulation would be associated with activation of the insula, anterior cingulate cortex, and amygdala, and that estrogen-dependent, stress-induced visceral hypersensitivity would both enhance activation of these regions and recruit activation of other brain areas mediating affect and reward processing. Ovariectomized rats were treated with estrogen (17 beta-estradiol, E2) or vehicle (n = 5 per group) and scanned in a 7T MRI at three different time points: pre-stress (baseline), 2 days post-stress, and 18 days post-stress. Stress was induced via a forced-swim paradigm. In a separate group of ovariectomized rats, E2 treatment induced visceral hypersensitivity at the 2 days post-stress time point, and this hypersensitivity returned to baseline at the 18 days post-stress time point. Vehicle-treated rats show no hypersensitivity following stress. During the MRI scans, rats were exposed to noxious colorectal distention. Across groups and time points, noxious visceral stimulation led to activations in the insula, anterior cingulate, and left amygdala, parabrachial nuclei, and cerebellum. A group-by-time interaction was seen in the right amygdala, ventral striatum-pallidum, cerebellum, hippocampus, mediodorsal thalamus, and pontine nuclei. Closer inspection of the data revealed that vehicle-treated rats showed consistent activations and deactivations across time, whereas estrogen-treated animals showed minimal deactivation with noxious visceral stimulation. This unexpected finding suggests that E2 may dramatically alter visceral nociceptive processing in the brain following an acute stressor. This study is the first to examine estrogen-stress dependent interactions in response to noxious visceral stimulation using functional MRI. Future studies that include other control groups and larger sample sizes are needed to fully understand the interactions between sex hormones, stress, and noxious stimulation on brain activity.
27127799	Effect of Opioid on Adult Hippocampal Neurogenesis.	During the past decade, the study of the mechanisms and functional implications of adult neurogenesis has significantly progressed. Many studies focus on the factors that regulate proliferation and fate determination of adult neural stem/progenitor cells, including addictive drugs such as opioid. Here, we review the most recent works on opiate drugs' effect on different developmental stages of adult hippocampal neurogenesis, as well as the possible underlying mechanisms. We conclude that opiate drugs in general cause a loss of newly born neural progenitors in the subgranular zone of dentate gyrus, by either modulating proliferation or interfering with differentiation and maturation. We also discuss the consequent impact of regulation of adult neurogenesis in animal's opioid addiction behavior. We further look into the future directions in studying the convergence between the adult neurogenesis field and opioid addiction field, since the adult-born granular cells were shown to play a role in neuroplasticity and may help to reduce the vulnerability to drug craving and relapse.
28269952	Adoption of Secure Messaging in a Patient Portal across Pediatric Specialties.	Few studies have explored adoption of patient portals for pediatric patients outside primary care or disease-specific applications. We examined use of patient-provider messaging in a patient portal across pediatric specialties during the three years after implementation of pediatric portal accounts at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. We determined the number of patient-initiated message threads and clinic visits for pediatric specialties and percentage of these outpatient interactions (i.e., message threads + clinic visits) done through messaging. Generalized estimating equations measured the likelihood of message-based interaction. During the study period, pediatric families initiated 33,503 messages and participated in 318,386 clinic visits. The number of messages sent (and messaging percentage of outpatient interaction) increased each year from 2,860 (2.7%) to 18,772 (17%). Primary care received 4,368 messages (3.4% of outpatient interactions); pediatric subspecialties, 29,135 (13.0%). Rapid growth in messaging volume over time was seen in primary care and most pediatric specialties (OR>1.0; p<0.05).
27790408	The MRI-Linear Accelerator Consortium: Evidence-Based Clinical Introduction of an Innovation in Radiation Oncology Connecting Researchers, Methodology, Data Collection, Quality Assurance, and Technical Development.	An international research consortium has been formed to facilitate evidence-based introduction of MR-guided radiotherapy (MR-linac) and to address how the MR-linac could be used to achieve an optimized radiation treatment approach to improve patients' survival, local, and regional tumor control and quality of life. The present paper describes the organizational structure of the clinical part of the MR-linac consortium. Furthermore, it elucidates why collaboration on this large project is necessary, and how a central data registry program will be implemented.
27186464	On meeting capital requirements with a chance-constrained optimization model.	This paper deals with a capital to risk asset ratio chance-constrained optimization model in the presence of loans, treasury bill, fixed assets and non-interest earning assets. To model the dynamics of loans, we introduce a modified CreditMetrics approach. This leads to development of a deterministic convex counterpart of capital to risk asset ratio chance constraint. We pursue the scope of analyzing our model under the worst-case scenario i.e. loan default. The theoretical model is analyzed by applying numerical procedures, in order to administer valuable insights from a financial outlook. Our results suggest that, our capital to risk asset ratio chance-constrained optimization model guarantees banks of meeting capital requirements of Basel III with a likelihood of 95 % irrespective of changes in future market value of assets.
26836184	Naphthoquinone-Tryptophan Hybrid Inhibits Aggregation of the Tau-Derived Peptide PHF6 and Reduces Neurotoxicity.	Tauopathies, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), are a group of disorders characterized neuropathologically by intracellular toxic accumulations of abnormal protein aggregates formed by misfolding of the microtubule-associated protein tau. Since protein self-assembly appears to be an initial key step in the pathology of this group of diseases, intervening in this process can be both a prophylactic measure and a means for modifying the course of the disease for therapeutic purposes. We and others have shown that aromatic small molecules can be effective inhibitors of aggregation of various protein assemblies, by binding to the aromatic core in aggregation-prone motifs and preventing their self-assembly. Specifically, we have designed a series of small aromatic naphthoquinone-tryptophan hybrid molecules as candidate aggregation inhibitors of beta -sheet based assembly and demonstrated their efficacy toward inhibiting aggregation of the amyloid-beta peptide, another culprit of AD, as well as of various other aggregative proteins involved in other protein misfolding diseases. Here we tested whether a leading naphthoquinone-tryptophan hybrid molecule, namely NQTrp, can be repurposed as an inhibitor of the aggregation of the tau protein in vitro and in vivo. We show that the molecule inhibits the in vitro assembly of PHF6, the aggregation-prone fragment of tau protein, reduces hyperphosphorylated tau deposits and ameliorates tauopathy-related behavioral defect in an established transgenic Drosophila model expressing human tau. We suggest that NQTrp, or optimized versions of it, could act as novel disease modifying drugs for AD and other tauopathies.
27833990	Pro Memoria. Professor Boleslaw Jalowy (1906-1943): Mortui viventes obligant - the livings are obligated to the dead.	Professor Boleslaw Jalowy (1906-1943) was a chairman of Department of Histology and Embryology at Faculty of Medicine of King John Casimir University (Polish: Universytet Jana Kazimierza: UJK) in Lvov. He succeeded Professor Wladyslaw Szymonowicz (1869-1939) who held this position for decades. As the most skillful followers of his tutor, Boleslaw Jalowy was a great investigator of physiology of human tissue, embryogenesis, histological consequences of female sex hormones on blood clotting action as well as regeneration of nerves in addition to description of silver staining technique for reticulin fibers of skin. He was a hard working person with gentle attitude to such a subtle matter as microscopic structure of human body. However, he happened to live in brutal conditions of nationalistic struggles. His example shows how much a dedicated scientist could do in a very short time as his life was tragically ended with murdering him during World War Two. His story is a great lesson for generations of academic workers how to meet high moral standards with efficient and creative scientific work in evil and destructive, nationalistic climate that occurs usually in wartime.
28025640	The Potential Role of Graphene in Developing the Next Generation of Endomaterials.	Graphene is the first 2-dimensional material and possesses a plethora of original properties. Graphene and its derivatives have exhibited a great potential in a number of fields, both medical and nonmedical. The aim of this review is to set the theoretical basis for further research in developing graphene-based endovascular materials. An extensive search was performed in medical and bioengineering literature. Published data on other carbon materials, as well as limited data from medical use of graphene, are promising. Graphene is a promising future material for developing novel endovascular materials. Certain issues as biocompatibility, biotoxicity, and biostability should be explored further.
27186470	Timing of carbohydrate ingestion did not affect inflammatory response and exercise performance during prolonged intermittent running.	BACKGROUND: Carbohydrate ingestion during exercise is known to attenuate exercise-induced elevation of plasma IL-6 concentration. However, the influence of timing of carbohydrate ingestion remains unclear. PURPOSE: The present study investigated the influence of different timing of carbohydrate ingestion during a simulated soccer game on exercise performance, metabolic and inflammatory responses. METHODS: Seven active males performed 3 exercise trials in a randomized order. The exercise consisted of two consecutive bouts of 45 min running (4-16 km/h), separated with 15 min rest period between bouts. The subjects ingested carbohydrate gel (1.0 g/kg) immediately before the first bout of exercise (ONE), immediately before first and second bouts of exercise (0.5 g/kg for each ingestion) (TWO) or placebo immediately before exercise (PLA) Time course changes of maximal jump height, peak power output during 6-s maximal pedaling, perceived fatigue and heart rate (HR) were monitored. Blood samples were also drawn to determine blood glucose, serum insulin, free fatty acid (FFA), myoglobin (Mb), creatine kinase (CK) and plasma IL-6 concentrations. RESULTS: Blood glucose and serum insulin concentrations were significantly higher in the ONE trial after first bout of 45 min exercise compared with PLA trial (P < 0.05), while serum FFA concentration was significantly elevated in PLA compared with ONE and TWO trials after second bout of exercise (P < 0.05). However, changes of jump height, peak power output during 6-s maximal pedaling, perceived fatigue, HR, or indirect muscle damage (Mb, CK) and inflammatory (IL-6) markers were not significantly different among three trials (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The timing of carbohydrate ingestion did not affect exercise performance, exercise-induced muscle damage or inflammatory response during a simulated soccer game.
27878789	Regional sociocultural differences as important correlate of physical activity and sedentary behaviour in Swiss preschool children.	QUESTION: Regional differences in physical activity in school-aged children and adults even within one country with the same political and health care system have been observed and could not be explained by sociodemographic or individual variables. We analysed whether such differences were already present in preschool children. METHODS: Swiss children from 84 childcare centres in five cantons (Aargau, Bern, Fribourg, Vaud, Zurich) comprising about 50% of the population of the country participated. Physical activity was quantified with accelerometers (ActiGraph, wGT3X-BT) and potential correlates were assessed with measurements at the childcare centre or questionnaires. Mixed regression models were used to test associations between potential correlates of total physical activity (TPA), moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), light physical activity (LPA) or sedentary behaviour with a special focus on regional differences. RESULTS: 394 of 476 children (83%) provided valid physical activity data (at least 2 weekdays and 1 weekend day with 10 h recording; mean age 3.9 +/- 0.7 years, 54% boys) with 26% and 74% living in the French- and German-speaking parts of Switzerland, respectively. Days consisted of (mean +/- standard deviation) 1.5 +/- 0.5 h MVPA, 5.0 +/- 0.6 h LPA, and 6.3 +/- 0.8 h sedentary behaviour with an average of 624 +/- 150 counts/min TPA. TPA and MVPA (but not sedentary behaviour or LPA) increased with age, were higher in boys and children with better motor skills. Despite controlling for individual characteristics, familial factors and childcare exposure, children from the French-speaking part of Switzerland showed 13% less TPA, 14% less MVPA, 6% less LPA and 8% more sedentary behaviour than German-speaking children. CONCLUSION: Beside motor skills and non-modifiable individual factors, the regional sociocultural difference was the most important correlate of phyical activity and sedentary behaviour. Therefore, regionally adapted public health strategies may be needed.
27008107	Social Support Indirectly Predicts Problem Drinking Through Reduced Psychological Distress.	BACKGROUND: The experience of psychological distress can contribute to problem drinking in young adults. Social support can protect against the development of distress and thus may indirectly minimize problem drinking. OBJECTIVE: To test a model of problem drinking in young adults based on the concepts of social support and psychological distress. METHODS: A two-wave panel study was conducted over the course of one year, during 2014-15, with 211 university students (M age = 21.06 years, SD = 1.60 years) who completed online survey measures of problem drinking, various indicators of social support, and various indicators of psychological distress. RESULTS: The data were analyzed with structural equation modeling. After controlling for concurrent problem drinking and psychological distress, there was no direct prospective effect of social support on problem drinking. However, social support predicted reductions in psychological distress over time, and this reduced psychological distress predicted reductions in problem drinking over time. Therefore, social support exhibited a significant indirect effect on problem drinking. CONCLUSION: Social support from friends, emotional support, and informational support combine to form a protective factor that mitigates the risk of problem drinking in young adults through reduced psychological distress.
26967213	Anti-Correlated Cerebrospinal Fluid Biomarker Trajectories in Preclinical Alzheimer's Disease.	BACKGROUND: The earliest stage of preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD) is defined by low levels of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amyloid-beta (Abeta42). However, covariance in longitudinal dynamic change of Abeta42 and tau in incipient preclinical AD is poorly understood. OBJECTIVE: To examine dynamic interrelationships between Abeta42 and tau in preclinical AD. METHODS: We followed 47 cognitively intact participants (CI) with available CSF data over four years in ADNI. Based on longitudinal Abeta42 levels in CSF, CI were classified into three groups: 1) Abeta42 stable with normal levels of Abeta42 over time (n = 15); 2) Abeta42 declining with normal Abeta42 levels at baseline but showing decline over time (n = 14); and 3) Abeta42 levels consistently abnormal (n = 18). RESULTS: In the Abeta42 declining group, suggestive of incipient preclinical AD, CSF phosphorylated tau (p-tau) showed a similar longitudinal pattern of increasing abnormality over time (p = 0.0001). Correlation between longitudinal slopes of Abeta42 and p-tau confirmed that both trajectories were anti-correlated (rho = -0.60; p = 0.02). Regression analysis showed that Abeta42 slope (decreasing Abeta42) predicted p-tau slope (increasing p-tau) (R2 = 0.47, p = 0.03). Atrophy in the hippocampus was predicted by the interaction of Abeta42 and p-tau slopes (p < 0.0001) only in this incipient preclinical AD group. In all groups combined, memory decline was predicted by p-tau. CONCLUSIONS: The evolution of Abeta42 and p-tau CSF biomarkers in CI subjects follows an anti-correlated trajectory, i.e., as Abeta42 declined, p-tau increased, and thus was suggestive of strong temporal coincidence. Rapid pathogenic cross-talk between Abeta42 and p-tau thus may be evident in very early stages of preclinical AD.
27458378	Deliberate Practice as a Theoretical Framework for Interprofessional Experiential Education.	OBJECTIVE: The theory of deliberate practice has been applied to many skill-based performance activities. The primary aim of this project was to integrate synergistic principles from deliberate practice and consensus-derived competencies for interprofessional education into a framework upon which educational models to advance interprofessional experiential education (IEE) might be built. METHODS: CINAHL, ERIC, and MEDLINE databases were searched using the keywords "deliberate practice" and "interprofessional education," both individually and in combination. Relevant articles were selected from the catalog based on support for the premise of the project. Defining characteristics of deliberate practice were distilled with particular emphasis on their application to the Interprofessional Education Collaborative's (IPEC) core competencies. Recommendations for IEE development were identified through the synthesis of deliberate practice principles and IPEC competencies. RESULTS: There is a high degree of synergy between deliberate practice principles and IPEC competencies. Our synthesis of the literature yielded a cyclical four-step process to advance IEE: (1) implement an IEE plan guided by the student's strengths/weaknesses and in consideration of the collaborative practice skills they wish to develop, (2) engage in IPE experiences that will challenge targeted skills according to the IEE plan, (3) embed frequent opportunities for student reflection and preceptor/team feedback within IEE plan, and (4) revise the IEE plan and the IPE experience based on insights gained during step 3. CONCLUSION: The cyclical four-step process synthesized through this literature review may be used to guide the development of new IEE models. The purposeful development of IEE models grounded in a theory that has already been operationalized in other skill-based performance areas is an important step to address expanding accreditation standards throughout the health professions mandating interprofessional education for pre-licensure health professional students.
26925672	Preliminary Study of the GSTM1 Null Polymorphism and History of Tobacco Smoking among Oral Cancer Patients in Northeastern Thailand.	Risks with GSTM1 genotypes and potential roles of smoking in the susceptibility to oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) were studied in Northeastern Thailand. Study subjects were 79 histologically-confirmed OSCC cases (31 men, 48 women) and 79 age- and sex-matched healthy controls ranging in age from 25 to 84 years. GSTM1 genotyping was achieved by two independent PCR assays. The GSTM1 null allele and the homozygous genotype did not increase risk of OSCC vs the wild type allele and the remaining genotypes. When the focus was on the smoking habit, male subjects who smoked >/=10 or >/=35 years were at significantly increased risk for OSCC with adjusted ORs of 4.88 [95%CI, 1.41-16.87, p=0.012] or 4.94 [95%CI, 1.62-15.12, p=0.005], respectively. A higher risk for OSCC was found for smoking amount; those who smoked >5 or >10 pack-years were at a higher risk with adjusted OR of 4.46 [95%CI; 1.45-13.74, p=0.009] or 3.89 [95%CI; 1.34-11.28, p=0.012], respectively. There are certain smoking patterns that give greater risks and thus both smoking duration and pack-years should be taken into consideration in tobacco related cancer prevention.
26996115	Quantitative Evaluation of BAFF, HMGB1, TLR 4 AND TLR 7 Expression in Patients with Relapsing Remitting Multiple Sclerosis.	Multiple sclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease of the central nervous system characterized by a complex immune response. Because of the complex nature of MS pathogenesis, a panel of biomarkers derived from different platforms will be required to reflect disease-related alterations. Monitoring and evaluation of molecules associated with the pathogenesis of the disease would provide useful information on disease progression and therapeutic assessment. In view of this, we evaluated the mRNA expression levels of B-cell activating factor (BAFF), high mobility group box 1 (HMGB-1), Toll like receptor (TLR) 4 and TLR7 in MS. These molecules are implicated in the pathogenesis of MS; however, they havereceived little attention. PBMCs were isolated from whole blood of 84 Relapsing Remitting Multiple Sclerosis patients and 70 healthy controls. Relative quantitative RT-PCR was applied to quantify the transcriptional levels of the immune markers. The mRNA expression levels of TLR7 were significantly elevated in RRMS patients than healthy controls. Whereas, TLR4 expression was found to be significantly lower in the patients than control group. We found no difference analyzing the mRNA levels of BAFF and HMGB1. Our data highlights the immune marker correlates in RRMS patients. However, further in-depth studies are warranted to check for their reliability of biomarkers in autoimmune diseases such as MS.
27790410	SpyB, a Small Heme-Binding Protein, Affects the Composition of the Cell Wall in Streptococcus pyogenes.	Streptococcus pyogenes (Group A Streptococcus or GAS) is a hemolytic human pathogen associated with a wide variety of infections ranging from minor skin and throat infections to life-threatening invasive diseases. The cell wall of GAS consists of peptidoglycan sacculus decorated with a carbohydrate comprising a polyrhamnose backbone with immunodominant N-acetylglucosamine side-chains. All GAS genomes contain the spyBA operon, which encodes a 35-amino-acid membrane protein SpyB, and a membrane-bound C3-like ADP-ribosyltransferase SpyA. In this study, we addressed the function of SpyB in GAS. Phenotypic analysis of a spyB deletion mutant revealed increased bacterial aggregation, and reduced sensitivity to beta-lactams of the cephalosporin class and peptidoglycan hydrolase PlyC. Glycosyl composition analysis of cell wall isolated from the spyB mutant suggested an altered carbohydrate structure compared with the wild-type strain. Furthermore, we found that SpyB associates with heme and protoporphyrin IX. Heme binding induces SpyB dimerization, which involves disulfide bond formation between the subunits. Thus, our data suggest the possibility that SpyB activity is regulated by heme.
26859655	Beyond the Protein-Coding Sequence: Noncoding RNAs in the Pathogenesis of Type 2 Diabetes.	Diabetes mellitus results from a deficiency or failure to maintain normal glucose homeostasis. The most common form of the disease is type 2 diabetes (T2D), a progressive metabolic disorder characterized by elevated glucose levels that develops in response to either multi-organ insulin resistance or insufficient insulin secretion from pancreatic beta-cells. Although the etiology of T2D is complex, many factors are known to contribute to defects of glucose homeostasis, including obesity, unhealthy lifestyle choices, genetic susceptibility, and environmental exposures. In addition to these factors, noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) have been recently implicated in the pathogenesis of T2D, playing roles in several of the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the disease, particularly in insulin-sensitive tissues such as pancreatic beta-cells, liver, muscle, and adipose tissue. A growing number of publications demonstrate that polymorphisms in ncRNAs or their target genes may represent a new class of genetic variation contributing to the development of T2D. This review summarizes both the current state of knowledge of ncRNAs, specifically microRNAs (miRNAs), involved in the regulation of beta-cell function, insulin sensitivity, and insulin action in peripheral organs. The role of genetic variation in miRNAs or miRNA binding sites in the pathogenesis of T2D is also discussed. While far less is known about the impact of long ncRNAs (lncRNAs) in the development of T2D, emerging evidence suggests that these molecules may be able to contribute to beta-cell dysfunction in response to hyperglycemia. This article provides an overview of the studies conducted to date in this field, focusing on lncRNAs that are dysregulated in human pancreatic islets.
27635282	Solid oxide fuel cell interconnect design optimization considering the thermal stresses.	The mechanical failure of solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) components may cause cracks with consequences such as gas leakage, structure instability and reduction of cell lifetime. A comprehensive 3D model of the thermal stresses of an anode-supported planar SOFC is presented in this work. The main objective of this paper is to get an interconnect optimized design by evaluating the thermal stresses of an anode-supported SOFC for different designs, which would be a new criterion for interconnect design. The model incorporates the momentum, mass, heat, ion and electron transport, as well as steady-state mechanics. Heat from methane steam reforming and water-gas shift reaction were considered in our model. The results examine the relationship between the interconnect structures and thermal stresses in SOFC at certain mechanical properties. A wider interconnect of the anode side lowers the stress obviously. The simulation results also indicate that thermal stress of coflow design is smaller than that of counterflow, corresponding to the temperature distribution. This study shows that it is possible to design interconnects for an optimum thermal stress performance of the cell.
28003608	The Effects of Misalignment between PET and CT Scans on Brain PET Study Using CT-based Attenuation Correction: A Phantom Study.	PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of inaccurate attenuation correction due to the misalignment between the computed tomography (CT)-based mu-map and the positron emission tomography (PET) data on a brain PET. METHODS: CT and PET scans were performed on a 3-dimension (3D) brain phantom, in which the grey matter region was filled with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG), and the skull region was filled with/without the bone-equivalent solution. The shifted PET images relative to the CT image were generated by the software-based translation of PET data in the cephalad/caudal and right directions, with a magnitude of the shift up to 30 mm and a step size of 5 mm. The regions of interest (ROIs) were drawn on the areas of the temporal lobes, parietal lobes, thalami, and cerebellums in the no-shifted image (reference). For each ROI, the radioactivity concentrations in the shifted images were compared with those of the reference. RESULTS: The errors in the radioactivity concentrations were increased with the increasing magnitude of the shift in all brain regions except for thalamus. For a 5 mm shift in the right direction, +/- 10% errors were observed in the left/right temporal lobes. The accuracy of the radioactivity concentration in the temporal lobe was very sensitive to misalignment in the right directions. CONCLUSION: The misalignment between CT-based mu-map and PET data had larger effects on the surface regions of the brain rather than on deep brain structures.
26957690	A retrospective cohort study of perioperative prognostic factors associated with intra-abdominal sepsis.	CONTEXT: Intra-abdominal sepsis following laparotomy for acute abdomen remains still a challenging condition. The understanding of various perioperative risk factors by anesthesiologists are crucial in optimum management these patients. AIMS: The objective of this study is to assess the perioperative risk factors, which predicts the outcome of treatment. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: This retrospective observational study of 603 patients who underwent Laparotomies between March 2012 and March 2015 at our University Medical College. Of 603 patients, 52 consecutive patients with intra-abdomen sepsis who underwent surgical procedures and admitted in Intensive Care Unit (ICU) were selected and analyzed for prognostic risk factors in relation to severity of the disease. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: 52 consecutive patients who developed intra-abdominal sepsis following laparotomy was allocated one of two groups; Group Sepsis, patients with peritonitis without systemic hypotension (mean arterial pressure [MAP] >60 mm of Hg); and Group septic shock, patients with peritonitis with systemic hypotension (mean arterial pressure [MAP] <60 mm of Hg) and patients were analyzed for prognostic risk factors. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: Categorical variables were analyzed by using Fisher's exact (two-tail) test and continuous variable were analyzed by using Mann-Whitney (two-tail) U-test. RESULTS: Out of 603 patients who underwent laparotomy 52 patients developed an intra-abdominal septic complication. Of these 52 cases studied 28 patients developed septic shock and required a longer duration of admission in ICU and more inotropic support. Preoperative albumin and hematocrit level were significantly low in septic shock patients as compared to the patients with sepsis without systemic hypotension. PaCO2: FiO2 was also significantly low in these patients. CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative low hematocrit, low albumin level, and delay in laparotomy more than 72 h were also associated with adverse outcome in the patients with intra-abdominal sepsis. Clinicians should maintain equipoise on this topic pending prospective randomized clinical trials.
27826274	Learning Climate and Job Performance among Health Workers. A Pilot Study.	This paper will explore if and how psychological strain plays a mediator role between the learning climate and job performance in a group of health workers. Although the relationship between learning climate and job performance has already been explored in the international literature, the role of psychological strain, which may hamper or deepen this relationship, has yet to be investigated. The research hypothesis is that psychological strain mediates the relationship between the climate toward learning (including also the error avoidance climate) and job performance. Data were gathered in a Public hospital in Italy. Participants (N = 61) were health professionals (nurses and obstetricians). Considering the relatively small sample size, a mediation analysis with the aid of the SPSS macro PROCESS was performed. The results show that the relationship between the learning climate (specifically its dimension of organizational appreciation toward learning) and job performance is mediated by psychological strain. The future research agenda and practical implications are discussed in the paper.
27140594	Unusual association of turner syndrome and hypopituitarism in a Tunisian family.	PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: Familial occurrence of either Turner syndrome or hypopituitarism is very rare. Particularly, their association is an uncommon finding. In this context, we describe for the first time 4 sisters with Turner syndrome, hypopituitarism was reported in three among them. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Our cohort consists of four Tunisian adult sisters belonging to a consanguineous family. Biochemical analysis, resonance magnetic imaging and cytogenetic analyses were performed. RESULTS: Turner syndrome was diagnosed at the ages of 14, 17, 31 and 43 years in cases 1, 2, 3 and 4 respectively. They suffered from short stature, dysmorphic syndrome and/or delayed puberty. Interestingly, 3 among them showed also hypopituitarism, hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism and central hypothyroidism. Somatotropic insufficiency was proven in one case. Pituitary MRI has shown an empty sella turcica with hypoplastic pituitary gland in three cases. Their karyotypes were compatible with 45X in one case, 45X/46XX in the second and 45X/46XX/47XXY with x label in two cases. CONCLUSION: Hence, the presence of these familial cases of TS must evoke new etiopathogenetic arguments. Coincidence of hypopituitarism in this family, might suggest common genetic background for the two diseases. This particular family would be a precious tool for an extensive molecular analysis. More attention should be given to other family's members mainly in the presence of delayed puberty and sterility in other members.
27924162	A Pretargeted Approach for the Multimodal PET/NIRF Imaging of Colorectal Cancer.	The complementary nature of positron emission tomography (PET) and near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF) imaging makes the development of strategies for the multimodal PET/NIRF imaging of cancer a very enticing prospect. Indeed, in the context of colorectal cancer, a single multimodal PET/NIRF imaging agent could be used to stage the disease, identify candidates for surgical intervention, and facilitate the image-guided resection of the disease. While antibodies have proven to be highly effective vectors for the delivery of radioisotopes and fluorophores to malignant tissues, the use of radioimmunoconjugates labeled with long-lived nuclides such as 89Zr poses two important clinical complications: high radiation doses to the patient and the need for significant lag time between imaging and surgery. In vivo pretargeting strategies that decouple the targeting vector from the radioactivity at the time of injection have the potential to circumvent these issues by facilitating the use of positron-emitting radioisotopes with far shorter half-lives. Here, we report the synthesis, characterization, and in vivo validation of a pretargeted strategy for the multimodal PET and NIRF imaging of colorectal carcinoma. This approach is based on the rapid and bioorthogonal ligation between a trans-cyclooctene- and fluorophore-bearing immunoconjugate of the huA33 antibody (huA33-Dye800-TCO) and a 64Cu-labeled tetrazine radioligand (64Cu-Tz-SarAr). In vivo imaging experiments in mice bearing A33 antigen-expressing SW1222 colorectal cancer xenografts clearly demonstrate that this approach enables the non-invasive visualization of tumors and the image-guided resection of malignant tissue, all at only a fraction of the radiation dose created by a directly labeled radioimmunoconjugate. Additional in vivo experiments in peritoneal and patient-derived xenograft models of colorectal carcinoma reinforce the efficacy of this methodology and underscore its potential as an innovative and useful clinical tool.
26937378	Delay of cognitive gamma responses in Alzheimer's disease.	Event-related oscillations (EROs) reflect cognitive brain dynamics, while sensory-evoked oscillations (SEOs) reflect sensory activities. Previous reports from our lab have shown that those with Alzheimer's disease (AD) or mild cognitive impairment (MCI) have decreased activity and/or coherence in delta, theta, alpha and beta cognitive responses. In the current study, we investigated gamma responses in visual SEO and ERO in 15 patients with AD and in 15 age-, gender- and education-matched healthy controls. The following parameters were analyzed over the parietal-occipital regions in both groups: (i) latency of the maximum gamma response over a 0-800 ms time window; (ii) the maximum peak-to-peak amplitudes for each participant's averaged SEO and ERO gamma responses in 3 frequency ranges (25-30, 30-35, 40-48 Hz); and (iii) the maximum peak-to-peak amplitudes for each participant's averaged SEO and ERO gamma responses over a 0-800 ms time block containing four divided time windows (0-200, 200-400, 400-600, and 600-800 ms). There were main group effects in terms of both latency and peak-to-peak amplitudes of gamma ERO. However, peak-to-peak gamma ERO amplitude differences became noticeable only when the time block was divided into four time windows. SEO amplitudes in the 25-30 Hz frequency range of the 0-200 ms time window over the left hemisphere were greater in the healthy controls than in those with AD. Gamma target ERO latency was delayed up to 138 ms in AD patients when compared to healthy controls. This finding may be an effect of lagged neural signaling in cognitive circuits, which is reflected by the delayed gamma responses in those with AD. Based on the results of this study, we propose that gamma responses should be examined in a more detailed fashion using multiple frequency and time windows.
27382284	A stabilizer-free and organic solvent-free method to prepare 10-hydroxycamptothecin nanocrystals: in vitro and in vivo evaluation.	10-Hydroxycamptothecin (10-HCPT) is a promising anticancer drug with a wide spectrum of antitumor activities. Due to its poor solubility, the carboxylate form that shows high water solubility but minimal anticancer activity and pharmacokinetic defects is used in the marketed 10-HCPT injections, resulting in its limited clinical application. To develop a simple, safe, and highly effective drug delivery system, a modified acid-base microprecipitation combined with a high-pressure homogenization technique was adopted to prepare 10-HCPT nanocrystals. Neither organic solvents nor stabilizers were employed throughout the preparation process. The in vitro and in vivo performances of the resulting10-HCPT nanocrystals were investigated systematically. The nanocrystals were spherical with a small size of ~130 nm, and the actual drug-loading content was as high as 75%. The nanocrystals displayed a sustained release pattern and were proven to have a higher cell uptake and antiproliferative activity than the 10-HCPT injections. The 10-HCPT nanocrystals also showed enhanced drug accumulation in tumors and better anticancer efficacy in 4T1-bearing mice. In summary, the 10-HCPT nanocrystals prepared in this study seem to be a promising delivery system for a new form of 10-HCPT dosages.
27445976	Cooperation between HMGA1 and HIF-1 Contributes to Hypoxia-Induced VEGF and Visfatin Gene Expression in 3T3-L1 Adipocytes.	The architectural transcription factor high-mobility group AT-hook 1 (HMGA1) is a chromatin regulator with implications in several biological processes, including tumorigenesis, inflammation, and metabolism. Previous studies have indicated a role for this factor in promoting the early stages of adipogenesis, while inhibiting adipocyte terminal differentiation, and decreasing fat mass. It has been demonstrated that hypoxia - through the hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) - plays a major role in triggering changes in the adipose tissue of the obese, leading to inhibition of adipocyte differentiation, adipose cell dysfunction, inflammation, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes. To examine the possible cooperation between HMGA1 and HIF-1, herein, we investigated the role of HMGA1 in the regulation of Visfatin and VEGF, two genes normally expressed in adipose cells, which are both responsive to hypoxia. We demonstrated that HMGA1 enhanced Visfatin and VEGF gene expression in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells in hypoxic conditions, whereas HMGA1 knockdown in differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes reduced these effects. Reporter gene analysis showed that Visfatin and VEGF transcriptional activity was increased by the addition of either HMGA1 or HIF-1 and even further by the combination of both factors. As demonstrated by chromatin immunoprecipitation in intact cells, HMGA1 directly interacted with the VEGF gene, and this interaction was enhanced in hypoxic conditions. Furthermore, as indicated by co-immunoprecipitation studies, HMGA1 and HIF-1 physically interacted with each other, supporting the notion that this association may corroborate a functional link between these factors. Therefore, our findings provide evidence for molecular cross-talk between HMGA1 and HIF-1, and this may be important for elucidating protein and gene networks relevant to obesity.
27891118	Colistin in Pig Production: Chemistry, Mechanism of Antibacterial Action, Microbial Resistance Emergence, and One Health Perspectives.	Colistin (Polymyxin E) is one of the few cationic antimicrobial peptides commercialized in both human and veterinary medicine. For several years now, colistin has been considered the last line of defense against infections caused by multidrug-resistant Gram-negative such as Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Colistin has been extensively used orally since the 1960s in food animals and particularly in swine for the control of Enterobacteriaceae infections. However, with the recent discovery of plasmid-mediated colistin resistance encoded by the mcr-1 gene and the higher prevalence of samples harboring this gene in animal isolates compared to other origins, livestock has been singled out as the principal reservoir for colistin resistance amplification and spread. Co-localization of the mcr-1 gene and Extended-Spectrum-beta-Lactamase genes on a unique plasmid has been also identified in many isolates from animal origin. The use of colistin in pigs as a growth promoter and for prophylaxis purposes should be banned, and the implantation of sustainable measures in pig farms for microbial infection prevention should be actively encouraged and financed. The scientific research should be encouraged in swine medicine to generate data helping to reduce the exacerbation of colistin resistance in pigs and in manure. The establishment of guidelines ensuring a judicious therapeutic use of colistin in pigs, in countries where this drug is approved, is of crucial importance. The implementation of a microbiological withdrawal period that could reduce the potential contamination of consumers with colistin resistant bacteria of porcine origin should be encouraged. Moreover, the management of colistin resistance at the human-pig-environment interface requires the urgent use of the One Health approach for effective control and prevention. This approach needs the collaborative effort of multiple disciplines and close cooperation between physicians, veterinarians, and other scientific health and environmental professionals. This review is an update on the chemistry of colistin, its applications and antibacterial mechanism of action, and on Enterobacteriaceae resistance to colistin in pigs. We also detail and discuss the One Health approach and propose guidelines for colistin resistance management.
27766146	Review on colonization of residents and staff in Italian long-term care facilities by multidrug-resistant bacteria compared with other European countries.	BACKGROUND: Rates of colonization and infection with multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria are increasing worldwide, in both acute care hospitals and long-term care facilities (LTCFs). Italy has one of the highest prevalence of MDR bacteria in European countries, especially with regard to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) or carbapenemase producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE). METHOD: Review of studies on colonization by MDR bacteria from Italian LTCFs, risk factors for colonization and molecular characteristics of surveillance and clinical isolates, compared with other European countries. RESULTS: High variability of MDR colonization has been reported within and especially between European countries. Only a few surveillance studies have been performed in Italian LTCFs; these show MRSA colonization prevalence of 7.8-38.7 % for residents and 5.2-7.0 % for staff members, ESBL prevalence of 49.0-64.0 % for residents and 5.2-14.5 % for staff and prevalence of CPE of 1.0-6.3 % for residents and 0.0-1.5 % for staff. In Italian LTCFs, as well as in other European countries, the most prevalent ESBLs from surveillance or clinical Escherichia coli isolates were found to be CTX-M-type enzymes, particularly CTX-M-15, expressed by the pandemic ST131 clonal group; this lineage also expresses carbapenemase genes of the blaVIM and blaKPC types. Various risk factors for colonization of residents by MDR bacteria were identified. CONCLUSIONS: The limited data from Italian LTCFs confirms these settings as important reservoirs for MDR organisms, allowing important considerations regarding the infection risk by these organisms. Nevertheless, more extended and countrywide screening studies for MDR colonization in Italian LTCFs are required. To promote further studies of various microbiological aspects related to LTCFs, the Association of Italian Clinical Microbiologists (Associazione Microbiologi Clinici Italiani; AMCLI) in 2016 has set up a new Working Group for the Study of Infections in LTCFs (Gruppo di Lavoro per lo Studio delle Infezioni nelle Residenze Sanitarie Assistite e Strutture Territoriali assimilabili; GLISTer), consisting of Clinical Microbiologists represented by the authors of this review article.
27877224	The role of copper transporter ATP7A in platinum-resistance of esophageal squamous cell cancer (ESCC).	Purpose: Platinum derivatives, such as cisplatin (DDP), carboplatin and oxaliplatin, are widely used components of modern cancer chemotherapy including esophageal squamous cell cancer (ESCC). However, their roles are limited by the impact of intrinsic/acquired resistance mechanisms on tumor responses. Recent studies have shown that the mammalian copper transporters CTR1, ATP7A and ATP7B are involved in cisplatin-resistance to some cancers. Methods: The cytotoxicities of DDP in different cell lines were determined using the MTT assay. To determine whether knockdown the expression of ATP7A could reverse the platinum-resistance of EC109/DDP cells or not, we used RNA interference system to explore the role of ATP7A in platinum resistance. Results: We found that DDP-resistant cell sublines EC109/DDP (8.490 folds) showed cross-resistance to carboplatin (5.27 folds) and oxaliplatin (4.12 folds). ATP7A expressions in DDP-resistant cell sublines (EC109/DDP) were much higher than DDP-sensitive cell lines (EC109) at both mRNA and protein levels. ATP7A targeted small interfering RNA duplex at 100nM final concentration added into DDP-resistant cancer cells (EC109/DDP) markedly inhibited the expression of ATP7A as determined by Western blot (83.0%) and partially reversed DDP-resistance (37.09%), moreover, it also increased cell apoptosis at different DDP concentrations. Conclusions: These findings indicate that ATP7A high expression plays an important role in platinum-resistance of ESCC. This study sheds light on platinum resistance in ESCC patients and may have implications for therapeutic reversal of drug resistance.
26942084	Enhancing tumor-targeting monoclonal antibodies therapy by PARP inhibitors.	Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have become a successful therapeutic approach in cancer. However, some patients do not achieve long-term clinical benefit and most mAbs only exert modest effects as monotherapies. Therefore, combinations with chemotherapy are currently being investigated. Emerging studies have shown a synergistic therapeutic effect of PARP inhibitors and mAbs in cancer. PARP enzymes catalytically cleave beta-NAD+ and transfer the ADP-ribose moiety to acceptor proteins, modifying their function. In here, we update recent data about the therapeutic effect of the combination of PARP inhibitors with mAbs in cancer treatment and discuss the molecular mechanisms involved in this synergy.
27049744	[A brief history of Beijing Shijitan(Century Altar) Hospital].	Founded in 1914, the Jing-Han Railway Hospital has undergone through four different stages during its 100 years' transition, viz., from 1914 to 1949, from 1949 to 1979, from 1980 to 2003 and from 2004 to the present, with its title changing from Peking-Hankou Railway Hospital, Beijing Health Care Station, Peiping Railway Hospital, Beijing Railway General Hospital and today's Beijing Shijitan Hospital. As a railway hospital, in addition to offering services to Chinese railway health, it has also participated in many public welfare activities, such as major disaster rescues, important domestic medical services, the international medical assistance, hospitals' counterpart support, Lifeline Express and so on.In a sense, the establishment and development of the hospital are connected with Beijing Railway Health Services and is not only closely related with China's railway healthcare, but also to modern social transformation and changes.
27999600	Mesenchymal Stem Cells as Therapeutics Agents: Quality and Environmental Regulatory Aspects.	Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are one of the main stem cells that have been used for advanced therapies and regenerative medicine. To carry out the translational clinical application of MSCs, their manufacturing and administration in human must be controlled; therefore they should be considered as medicine: stem cell-based medicinal products (SCMPs). The development of MSCs as SCMPs represents complicated therapeutics due to their extreme complex nature and rigorous regulatory oversights. The manufacturing process of MSCs needs to be addressed in clean environments in compliance with requirements of Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP). Facilities should maintain these GMP conditions according to international and national medicinal regulatory frameworks that introduce a number of specifications in order to produce MSCs as safe SCMPs. One of these important and complex requirements is the environmental monitoring. Although a number of environmental requirements are clearly defined, some others are provided as recommendations. In this review we aim to outline the current issues with regard to international guidelines which impact environmental monitoring in cleanrooms and clean areas for the manufacturing of MSCs.
26856502	The Chinese family-centered care survey for adult intensive care unit: A psychometric study.	AIMS: This study aimed to develop a family-centered care survey for Chinese adult intensive care units and to establish the survey's psychometric properties. BACKGROUND: Family-centered care (FCC) is widely recognized as an ideal model of care. Few studies have explored FCC perceptions among family members of adult critical care patients in Asian countries, and no Chinese FCC measurement has been developed. METHODS: An English version of the 3-factor family-centered care survey for adult intensive care units (FCCS-AICU) was translated into Chinese using a modified back translation procedure. Based on the literature review, two additional concepts, information and empowerment, were added to the Chinese FCCS-AICU. The psychometric properties of the Chinese FCCS-AICU were determined with 249 family members from a medical center in Taiwan and were tested for construct and convergent validity, and internal consistency. RESULTS: Both the monolingual and bilingual equivalence tests of the English and Chinese versions of the 3-factor FCCS-AICU were supported. Exploratory factor analysis supported the 5-factor structure of the Chinese FCCS-AICU with a total explained variance of 58.34%. The Chinese FCCS-AICU was correlated with the Chinese Critical Care Family Needs Inventory. Internal consistency, determined by Cronbach's alpha, for the overall scale was .94. CONCLUSIONS: The Chinese FCCS-AICU is a valid and reliable tool for measuring perceptions of FCC by family members of adult intensive care patients within Chinese-speaking communities.
27065549	Relationship between spinal range of motion and trunk muscle activity during trunk rotation.	[Purpose] The aim of this study was to clarify the relationship between spinal range of motion and trunk muscle activity during trunk rotation using a three-dimensional motion analysis system and surface electromyography. [Subjects and Methods] The subjects comprised 11 healthy men. A three-dimensional motion analysis system measured the trunk rotational angle of 4 segments of the thoracic vertebrae and 2 segments of the lumbar vertebrae. Surface electromyography measured the activities of the unilateral latissimus dorsi, lumbar multifidus, rectus abdominis, external oblique, internal oblique, and transversus abdominis muscles. [Results] During ipsilateral rotation at thoracic vertebral levels, the muscle activity of the latissimus dorsi and external oblique was significantly increased compared with the activity in the 0-10% range of trunk rotation. During early ipsilateral rotation at lumbar vertebral levels, the muscle activity of the internal oblique and transversus abdominis was significantly increased compared with that in the 0-10% range of trunk rotation. During contralateral rotation at both thoracic and lumbar vertebral levels, the muscle activity of the external oblique was significantly increased compared with that in the 0-10% range of trunk rotation. [Conclusion] This study indicates that it is important to consider vertebral segments and spinal range of motion during trunk rotation.
27430457	Brain CT and MRI: differential diagnosis of imaging findings.	Following a traditional approach, in Chapters 5 and 14-29 in the previous volume, diverse brain diseases are listed and their imaging findings described in detail. In this chapter the approach is from the imaging finding to the disease: for instance, what list of diseases can give rise to a contrast-enhancing mass in the cerebellopontine angle? Imaging findings that are reviewed in succession include the location of the lesion, its multiplicity and symmetry, its volume, ranging from atrophy to mass effect, its homogeneity, its density, measurable by computed tomography (CT), its appearance on T1, T2, and diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and, finally, its characteristics after the infusion of intravenous contrast. A differential diagnosis for each finding is provided. While the approach adopted in this chapter is unconventional, we hope that it will be most helpful to anyone reading images. Furthermore, it could serve as the basis to create or complete image databases to guide in the interpretation of brain CT and MRI.
27880835	Built Environment, Selected Risk Factors and Major Cardiovascular Disease Outcomes: A Systematic Review.	INTRODUCTION: Built environment attributes have been linked to cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. Therefore, identifying built environment attributes that are associated with CVD risk is relevant for facilitating effective public health interventions. OBJECTIVE: To conduct a systematic review of literature to examine the influence of built environmental attributes on CVD risks. DATA SOURCE: Multiple database searches including Science direct, CINAHL, Masterfile Premier, EBSCO and manual scan of reference lists were conducted. INCLUSION CRITERIA: Studies published in English between 2005 and April 2015 were included if they assessed one or more of the neighborhood environmental attributes in relation with any major CVD outcomes and selected risk factors among adults. DATA EXTRACTION: Author(s), country/city, sex, age, sample size, study design, tool used to measure neighborhood environment, exposure and outcome assessments and associations were extracted from eligible studies. RESULTS: Eighteen studies met the inclusion criteria. Most studies used both cross-sectional design and Geographic Information System (GIS) to assess the neighborhood environmental attributes. Neighborhood environmental attributes were significantly associated with CVD risk and CVD outcomes in the expected direction. Residential density, safety from traffic, recreation facilities, street connectivity and high walkable environment were associated with physical activity. High walkable environment, fast food restaurants, supermarket/grocery stores were associated with blood pressure, body mass index, diabetes mellitus and metabolic syndrome. High density traffic, road proximity and fast food restaurants were associated with CVDs outcomes. CONCLUSION: This study confirms the relationship between neighborhood environment attributes and CVDs and risk factors. Prevention programs should account for neighborhood environmental attributes in the communities where people live.
26906566	Constraining OCT with Knowledge of Device Design Enables High Accuracy Hemodynamic Assessment of Endovascular Implants.	BACKGROUND: Stacking cross-sectional intravascular images permits three-dimensional rendering of endovascular implants, yet introduces between-frame uncertainties that limit characterization of device placement and the hemodynamic microenvironment. In a porcine coronary stent model, we demonstrate enhanced OCT reconstruction with preservation of between-frame features through fusion with angiography and a priori knowledge of stent design. METHODS AND RESULTS: Strut positions were extracted from sequential OCT frames. Reconstruction with standard interpolation generated discontinuous stent structures. By computationally constraining interpolation to known stent skeletons fitted to 3D 'clouds' of OCT-Angio-derived struts, implant anatomy was resolved, accurately rendering features from implant diameter and curvature (n = 1 vessels, r2 = 0.91, 0.90, respectively) to individual strut-wall configurations (average displacement error ~15 mum). This framework facilitated hemodynamic simulation (n = 1 vessel), showing the critical importance of accurate anatomic rendering in characterizing both quantitative and basic qualitative flow patterns. Discontinuities with standard approaches systematically introduced noise and bias, poorly capturing regional flow effects. In contrast, the enhanced method preserved multi-scale (local strut to regional stent) flow interactions, demonstrating the impact of regional contexts in defining the hemodynamic consequence of local deployment errors. CONCLUSION: Fusion of planar angiography and knowledge of device design permits enhanced OCT image analysis of in situ tissue-device interactions. Given emerging interests in simulation-derived hemodynamic assessment as surrogate measures of biological risk, such fused modalities offer a new window into patient-specific implant environments.
27793286	Probing the Conformational Landscape of DNA Polymerases Using Diffusion-Based Single-Molecule FRET.	Monitoring conformational changes in DNA polymerases using single-molecule Forster resonance energy transfer (smFRET) has provided new tools for studying fidelity-related mechanisms that promote the rejection of incorrect nucleotides before DNA synthesis. In addition to the previously known open and closed conformations of DNA polymerases, our smFRET assays utilizing doubly labeled variants of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I were pivotal in identifying and characterizing a partially closed conformation as a primary checkpoint for nucleotide selection. Here, we provide a comprehensive overview of the methods we used for the conformational analysis of wild-type DNA polymerase and some of its low-fidelity derivatives; these methods include strategies for protein labeling and our procedures for solution-based single-molecule fluorescence data acquisition and data analysis. We also discuss alternative single-molecule fluorescence strategies for analyzing the conformations of DNA polymerases in vitro and in vivo.
27265826	Insecticidal potential of an endophytic Cladosporium velox against Spodoptera litura mediated through inhibition of alpha glycosidases.	Alpha glucosidase inhibitory activity was exhibited by partially purified fractions obtained from an endophytic Cladosporium velox, isolated from Tinospora cordifolia. Taking into account the increasing importance of digestive enzyme inhibitors as insecticidal agents, the entomopathogenic potential of the fractions obtained was evaluated against Spodoptera litura (Fab.), a polyphagous pest. Considerable mortality was obtained when the larvae were fed on diet supplemented with the partially purified extract. All the concentrations of the extract significantly prolonged the overall developmental period of S. litura. At higher concentrations, the extract influenced the longevity of females as well as their reproductive potential. Phytochemical analysis revealed the presence of phenolic compounds in the active fraction. The phenolic compound responsible for the bioactivities was purified and identified to be chlorogenic acid using HPLC and MS analysis. The content of chlorogenic acid in the extract was quantified to be 250mug/ml. The purified compound also demonstrated inhibition of alpha glycosidases in vivo. The present study indicates that the endophyte imparted resistance to the insects in the plants could be mediated through chlorogenic acid targeting the alpha glycosidases present in the gut of the insect. The isolate obtained can be exploited for the production of chlorogenic acid, which has the potential to be exploited as a biocontrol agent against S. litura.
27538691	Inflammation: A Multidimensional Insight on Natural Anti-Inflammatory Therapeutic Compounds.	Derailed inflammation causes severe damage to the normal tissues resulting in various pathological conditions such as auto-inflammatory disorders, neurodegenerative diseases and cancer. Cure of inflammatory diseases is a big challenge. Medicinal herbs used traditionally represent the best option for obtaining effective anti-inflammatory therapeutics. Present review provides a thorough insight about various pathways, consequences and therapeutic strategies of inflammation with prime focus to expose indigenous anti-inflammatory herbal compounds along with their structures and diverse range of mechanisms of action. Over hundred medicinal plants with scientifically reported anti-inflammatory properties were reviewed. Different parts of the plants like roots, stem, bark, leaves, flowers and seeds contain active compounds with potential anti-inflammatory properties. Such compounds act at multiple targets in the inflammatory response pathways and regulate multitude of chemical mediators, enzymes, genes or cellular functions to alleviate inflammation. Although a large number of antiinflammatory herbal compounds have been isolated but the mechanism of action of bulk of compounds has not been elucidated comprehensively. Besides there is need for conducting well designed clinical trials so that the promising compounds could be used as effective antiinflammatory therapeutic agents in future.
28078004	Adipose-specific ablation of Nrf2 transiently delayed high-fat diet-induced obesity by altering glucose, lipid and energy metabolism of male mice.	Nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (NRF2) is a well-known master controller of the cellular adaptive antioxidant and detoxification response. Recent studies demonstrated altered glucose, lipid and energy metabolism in mice with a global Nrf2 knockout. In the present study, we aim to determine the effects of an adipose-specific ablation of Nrf2 (ASAN) on diet-induced obesity (DIO) in male mice. The 6-week-old adipose-specific Nrf2 knockout (NK) and its Nrf2 control (NC) mice were fed with either control diet (CD) or high-fat diet (HFD) for 14 weeks. NK mice exhibited transiently delayed body weight (BW) growth from week 5 to week 11 of HFD feeding, higher daily physical activity levels and preferential use of fat over carbohydrates as a source of energy at week 8 of the CD-feeding period. After 14 weeks of feeding, NK mice showed comparable results with NC mice with respect to the overall BW and body fat content, but exhibited reduced blood glucose, reduced number but increased size of adipocytes, accompanied with elevated expression of many genes and proteins in the visceral fat related to glucose, lipid and energy metabolism (e.g. Fgf21, Pgc1a). These results indicated that NRF2 is an important mediator for glucose, lipid and energy metabolism in adipose tissue, and ASAN could have beneficial effect for prevention of DIO during the early development of mice.
27572985	Transition-Metal-Catalyzed Bioorthogonal Cycloaddition Reactions.	In recent years, bioorthogonal reactions have emerged as a powerful toolbox for specific labeling and visualization of biomolecules, even within the highly complex and fragile living systems. Among them, copper(I)-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) reaction is one of the most widely studied and used biocompatible reactions. The cytotoxicity of Cu(I) ions has been greatly reduced due to the use of Cu(I) ligands, which enabled the CuAAC reaction to proceed on the cell surface, as well as within an intracellular environment. Meanwhile, other transition metals such as ruthenium, rhodium and silver are now under development as alternative sources for catalyzing bioorthogonal cycloadditions. In this review, we summarize the development of CuAAC reaction as a prominent bioorthogonal reaction, discuss various ligands used in reducing Cu(I) toxicity while promoting the reaction rate, and illustrate some of its important biological applications. The development of additional transition metals in catalyzing cycloaddition reactions will also be briefly introduced.
27050435	Distribution and Function of PACAP and Its Receptors in the Healthy and Nephrotic Kidney.	BACKGROUND/AIMS: Plasma deficiency of pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) was recently demonstrated in children with nephrotic syndrome (NS). Previous studies have reported an important protective effect of PACAP on kidney proximal tubules. The aim of this study was to explore the expression of PACAP and its receptors PAC1, VPAC1 and VPAC2 in the healthy and nephrotic kidney and to determine if PACAP has an effect on renal proximal tubular cells exposed to albumin. METHODS: Expression of PACAP and its receptors was studied using kidney tissue from healthy and nephrotic children, and in 3 human renal cell lines (glomerular microvascular endothelial cells, podocytes and proximal tubular epithelial HK-2 cells). The functionality of the VPAC1 receptor was tested in HK-2 cells, measuring cyclic adenosine monophosphate levels after PACAP exposure. The influence of PACAP on cell viability and transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) expression was measured in HK-2 cells exposed to albumin, mimicking proteinuria related damage. RESULTS: VPAC1 expression was detected in the tubular proximal epithelial cells and in the glomerular podocytes of renal tissue from healthy and nephrotic children. Increased staining for PACAP was found in the proximal tubules of renal sections from children with NS compared to healthy renal sections. Expression and functionality of VPAC1 were demonstrated in HK-2 cells. Finally, PACAP did not alter cell viability or TGF-beta1 expression of HK-2 cells exposed to albumin. CONCLUSION: VPAC1 is the predominant receptor in the human kidney. The enhanced presence of PACAP in proximal tubular epithelial cells in nephrotic kidneys points to the reabsorption of filtered PACAP. On short term, PACAP has no in vitro effect on cell viability and TGF-beta1 expression of proximal tubular epithelial cells exposed to high concentrations of albumin.
28352770	Development of epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors against EGFR T790M. Mutation in non small-cell lung carcinoma.	Individualized therapies targeting epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations show promises for the treatment of non small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). However, disease progression almost invariably occurs 1 year after tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) treatment. The most prominent mechanism of acquired resistance involves the secondary EGFR mutation, namely EGFR T790M, which accounts for 50%-60% of resistant tumors. A large amount of studies have focused on the development of effective strategies to treat TKI-resistant EGFR T790M mutation in lung tumors. Novel generations of EGFR inhibitors are producing encouraging results in patients with acquired resistance against EGFR T790M mutation. This review will summarize the novel inhibitors, which might overcome resistance against EGFR T790M mutation.
26862864	Protocol for the Synthesis of Ortho-trifluoromethoxylated Aniline Derivatives.	Molecules bearing trifluoromethoxy (OCF3) group often show desired pharmacological and biological properties. However, facile synthesis of trifluoromethoxylated aromatic compounds remains a formidable challenge in organic synthesis. Conventional approaches often suffer from poor substrate scope, or require use of highly toxic, difficult-to-handle, and/or thermally labile reagents. Herein, we report a user-friendly protocol for the synthesis of methyl 4-acetamido-3-(trifluoromethoxy)benzoate using 1-trifluoromethyl-1,2-benziodoxol-3(1H)-one (Togni reagent II). Treating methyl 4-(N-hydroxyacetamido)benzoate (1a) with Togni reagent II in the presence of a catalytic amount of cesium carbonate (Cs2CO3) in chloroform at RT afforded methyl 4-(N-(trifluoromethoxy)acetamido)benzoate (2a). This intermediate was then converted to the final product methyl 4-acetamido-3-(trifluoromethoxy)benzoate (3a) in nitromethane at 120 degrees C. This procedure is general and can be applied to the synthesis of a broad spectrum of ortho-trifluoromethoxylated aniline derivatives, which could serve as useful synthetic building blocks for the discovery and development of new pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and functional materials.
26902903	Angiogenesis in refractory depression: A possible phenotypic target to avoid the blood brain barrier.	Major depressive syndrome (so-called depression) is a common but serious mental disease that causes low mood. Most patients are treatable, mainly because of high response rates for medicines such as selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). However, there are still a considerable number of patients with refractory or drug-resistant depression. On the other hand, recent findings suggest that angiogenesis, i.e., making new blood vessels, could have an important role in the recovery from depressive disorders, at least in part. It has been reported that the brain capillaries are physiologically capable of undergoing angiogenesis upon stimuli such as exercise and SSRIs seem to accelerate brain angiogenesis. Drugs targeting angiogenesis may possibly be another good concept. In addition, the blood brain barrier (BBB), which is a major obstacle for drug development for the central nervous system, would be circumvented. Here I summarize the reports that relate angiogenesis to a cure for major depression and discuss some of the potential molecular targets.
26869854	Characterisation of bioenergetic pathways and related regulators by multiple assays in human tumour cells.	BACKGROUND: Alterations in cellular metabolism are considered as hallmarks of cancers, however, to recognize these alterations and understand their mechanisms appropriate techniques are required. Our hypothesis was to determine whether dominant bioenergetic mechanism may be estimated by comparing the substrate utilisation with different methods to detect the labelled carbon incorporation and their application in tumour cells. METHODS: To define the bioenergetic pathways different metabolic tests were applied: (a) measuring CO2 production from [1-(14)C]-glucose and [1-(14)C]-acetate; (b) studying the effect of glucose and acetate on adenylate energy charge; (c) analysing glycolytic and TCA cycle metabolites and the number of incorporated (13)C atoms after [U-(13)C]-glucose/[2-(13)C]-acetate labelling. Based on [1-(14)C]-substrate oxidation two selected cell lines out of seven were analysed in details, in which the highest difference was detected at their substrate utilization. To elucidate the relevance of metabolic characterisation the expression of certain regulatory factors, bioenergetic enzymes, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) complexes (C1/C2) and related targets as important elements at the crossroad of cellular signalling network were also investigated. RESULTS: Both [U-(13)C]-glucose and [1-(14)C]-substrate labelling indicated high glycolytic capacity of tumour cells. However, the ratio of certain (13)C-labelled metabolites showed detailed metabolic differences in the two selected cell lines in further characterisation. The detected differences of GAPDH, beta-F1-ATP-ase expression and adenylate energy charge in HT-1080 and ZR-75.1 tumour cells also confirmed the altered metabolism. Moreover, the highly limited labelling of citrate by [2-(13)C]-acetate-representing a novel functional test in malignant cells-confirmed the defect of TCA cycle of HT-1080 in contrast to ZR-75.1 cells. Noteworthy, the impaired TCA cycle in HT-1080 cells were associated with high mTORC1 activity, negligible protein level and activity of mTORC2, high expression of interleukin-1beta, interleukin-6 and heme oxygenase-1 which may contribute to the compensatory mechanism of TCA deficiency. CONCLUSIONS: The applied methods of energy substrate utilisation and other measurements represent simple assay system using (13)C-acetate and glucose to recognize dominant bioenergetic pathways in tumour cells. These may offer a possibility to characterise metabolic subtypes of human tumours and provide guidelines to find biomarkers for prediction and development of new metabolism related targets in personalized therapy.
27438794	Quantitative Modelling of Trace Elements in Hard Coal.	The significance of coal in the world economy remains unquestionable for decades. It is also expected to be the dominant fossil fuel in the foreseeable future. The increased awareness of sustainable development reflected in the relevant regulations implies, however, the need for the development and implementation of clean coal technologies on the one hand, and adequate analytical tools on the other. The paper presents the application of the quantitative Partial Least Squares method in modeling the concentrations of trace elements (As, Ba, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb, Rb, Sr, V and Zn) in hard coal based on the physical and chemical parameters of coal, and coal ash components. The study was focused on trace elements potentially hazardous to the environment when emitted from coal processing systems. The studied data included 24 parameters determined for 132 coal samples provided by 17 coal mines of the Upper Silesian Coal Basin, Poland. Since the data set contained outliers, the construction of robust Partial Least Squares models for contaminated data set and the correct identification of outlying objects based on the robust scales were required. These enabled the development of the correct Partial Least Squares models, characterized by good fit and prediction abilities. The root mean square error was below 10% for all except for one the final Partial Least Squares models constructed, and the prediction error (root mean square error of cross-validation) exceeded 10% only for three models constructed. The study is of both cognitive and applicative importance. It presents the unique application of the chemometric methods of data exploration in modeling the content of trace elements in coal. In this way it contributes to the development of useful tools of coal quality assessment.
26873193	Novel Approaches Towards Designing of Isoform-Selective Inhibitors Against Class II Histone Deacetylases: The Acute Requirement for Targetted Anticancer Therapy.	Histone deacetylases (HDACs) regulate gene expression by modulating chromatin architecture via histone hypoacetylation. They play a key role in regulating cellular processes including cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Hyperactivity of HDACs plays a key role in tumour onset and progression making these enzymes as striking targets for anticancer drugs and therapy. Certain cancers are associated with upregulation of specific class II HDAC isoform rather than multiple ones. Therapeutic intervention using small-molecules namely histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi), often targets many isoforms unselectively (pan-HDACi) due to structural identity culminating in debilitating off-target effects and reduced in vivo potency. This emphasizes the escalating need for developing isoform-selective inhibitors against the defined class of HDACs. Despite the safe and elevated therapeutic benefit, the design of such inhibitors has been challenging. The present article provides intricate details about the role of class II HDAC isoforms in fuelling distinct cancers and the current challenges with the use of pan-HDAC inhibitors in anticancer therapy. The article also highlights the diverse synthetic and in silico approaches taken by scientific community towards the designing of isoform-selective inhibitors against class II HDAC isoforms. The strategies discussed in this review will provide further impetus to the ongoing research regarding the designing of isoform-selective inhibitors for safe and effective anticancer therapy which is today's need.
27169096	A Systematic Literature Review: Workplace Violence Against Emergency Medical Services Personnel.	CONTEXT: In spite of the high prevalence and consequences of much workplace violence against emergency medical services personnel, this phenomenon has been given insufficient attention. A systematic review can aid the development of guidelines to reduce violence. OBJECTIVES: The research question addressed by this paper is, "What are the characteristics and findings of studies on workplace violence against emergency medical services personnel"? DATA SOURCES: A systematic literature review was conducted using online databases (PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar, and Magiran) with the help of experienced librarians. STUDY SELECTION: Inclusion criteria comprised studies in the English or Persian language and researcher's access to the full text. There was no limit to the entry of the study design. Exclusion criteria included lack of access to the full text of the article, studies published in unreliable journals or conferences, and studies in which the results were shared with other medical or relief groups and there was no possibility of breaking down the results. DATA EXTRACTION: A "Data extraction form" was designed by the researchers based on the goals of the study that included the title and author(s), study method (type, place of study, sample size, sampling method, and data collection/analysis tool), printing location, information related to the frequency of types of violence, characteristics of victims /perpetrators, and related factors. RESULTS: The papers reviewed utilized a variety of locations and environments, methods, and instrument samplings. The majority of the studies were performed using the quantitative method. No intervention study was found. Most studies focused on the prevalence of violence, and their results indicated that exposure to violence was high. The results are presented in six major themes. CONCLUSIONS: Workplace violence and injuries incurred from it are extensive throughout the world. The important causes of violence include the shortage of training programs dealing with violence, lack of violence management protocols, and delays in response times. Therefore, afterthought and resolve are more crucial than ever. Workplace violence reduction strategies and suggestions for future studies are also discussed.
28078146	Solitary Plasmacytoma in the Mandible Resembling an Odontogenic Cyst/Tumor.	A 46-year-old male patient referred to Department of Oral Medicine, with the primary chief complaint of a painless swelling in the right side of mandibular. A panoramic radiograph revealed a well-defined, multilocular radiolucent bony lesion with thin and straight septa in the right side of mandible extending from distal of canine to mesial of third molar. Histological examination showed a solid proliferation of atypical plasmacytoid cells, which was indicative of plasmacytoma. A systemic workup for the final diagnosis was performed to rule out multiple myeloma.
28009030	Long term outcome of cystic fibrosis patients with multisystem evaluation.	INTRODUCTION: Cystic fibrosis is a chronic disease with multiple organ involvement and chiefly results in chronic respiratory infections, pancreatic insufficiency and associated complications. The age at diagnosis, clinical presentation, rate of disease progression and prognosis is variable among patients. This study is designed to evaluate the behavior of disease to provide epidemiologic data for early recognition and proper management. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study was designed as an active surveillance of 192 patients diagnosed with cystic fibrosis in a tertiary lung disease centre between 2008 and 2015. The diagnosis of cystic fibrosis was established in all patients accordingly to conventional criteria, including two positive sweat chloride tests and clinical signs and symptoms. Demographic, clinical and laboratory data were obtained from these patients in each hospitalization and also every follow-up visit and carefully evaluated for complications of this chronic disease. RESULTS: The majority of patients showed positive culture for Pseudomonas aeroginosa. Bronchiectasis was the most prevalent finding in chest CT scan. 44.3% of patients had been treated for allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and all had sinus disease. Increased pulmonary artery pressure was observed in 40% of patients with cystic fibrosis. 33 patients died which consisted 17.1% of all the patients.The mean age of mortaliy was 18.15 year. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical outcome of cystic fibrosis is variable in different countries which may reflect environmental influences and the role of early diagnosis on long term outcomes. However, the role of early diagnosis in long-term outcomes of the disease can not be ignored.
27617055	Physician and Patient Barriers to Breast Cancer Preventive Therapy.	The uptake of selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) and aromatase inhibitors (AIs) for the primary prevention of breast cancer is low, despite their proven efficacy in several randomized clinical trials. This review summarizes the latest data on physicians' and women's barriers to breast cancer preventive therapy. Physicians' challenges include: identifying suitable candidates for preventive therapy, inadequate training and confidence in risk assessment and counselling, insufficient knowledge of risk-reducing medications, and lack of time. High-risk women fear medication side effects, and they often weigh experiences of others more heavily than statistical probabilities to guide their decision-making. Despite decision aid interventions to help women make an informed decision, acceptance of preventive therapy will remain low until: risk/benefit profiles are more favorable, physicians are better educated and skilled in having these discussions, and suitable biomarkers to monitor drug efficacy and better clinical risk prediction models to assess true individual risk are available.
27990504	The clinical value of membranes in bone augmentation procedures in oral implantology: A systematic review of randomised controlled trials.	PURPOSE: To determine the clinical value of membranes in bone augmentation procedures such as ridge augmentation with simultaneous (one-stage) and delayed (two-stage) implant placement, sinus augmentation surgery, ridge preservation and immediate implant placement. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In April 2016, Embase, Medline (Ovid-SP), Cochrane Central, Web of Science and PubMed (as supplied by the publisher) were searched. There were no restrictions regarding language or publication date. Randomised controlled trials that reported membranes in bone augmentation procedures with a minimum follow-up period of 6 months after implant loading or that described geometrical changes of the bone graft at re-entry were included. Membrane placement had to be the only variable in the procedure. Outcomes were implant failure, complications, horizontal bone gain and resorption, graft resorption, defect height reduction, marginal bone loss around implants, aesthetic results and patient satisfaction. The results were pooled using fixed-effect models with mean differences (MDs) for continuous outcomes and odds ratios (ORs) for dichotomous outcomes. RESULTS: After screening the titles and abstracts of 1843 papers, 32 potentially eligible articles were selected. Seventeen articles involving 10 trials were included in this review. These studies presented outcome data for 355 patients. Seven trials were considered to be at a high risk of bias, two at a low risk of bias and one at an unclear risk of bias. Insufficient evidence was found to determine whether there were differences in implant failure rates, marginal bone level changes, aesthetic results or patient satisfaction. For one-stage ridge augmentation (two trials; n = 52), there was evidence of more horizontal bone gain (MD: 0.84 mm, 95% CI: 0.46 to 1.21, P < 0.00001; two trials), defect height reduction (MD: 18.36%, 95% CI: 10.23 to 26.50, P < 0.00001; two trials), and prevention of graft resorption (P = 0.004; one trial) in favour of the membrane-covered group, although substantial heterogeneity was found for horizontal bone gain (Chi2; P = 0.05, I2=74%). There was insufficient evidence to determine whether any differences exist in two-stage ridge augmentation (three trials; n = 81), sinus augmentation (one trial; n = 104) and ridge preservation (one trial; n = 20). For immediate implant placement (three trials; n = 98), there was evidence of an increased defect height reduction in favour of the membrane-covered groups (MD: 6.25%, 95% CI: 1.67 to 10.82, P = 0.007; two trials), although with substantial heterogeneity (Chi2; P = 0.03, I2 = 79%). More complications were observed when a membrane was used (OR: 2.52, 95% CI: 1.07 to 5.93, P = 0.03; three trials). CONCLUSIONS: There is insufficient evidence regarding the effects of membranes on bone augmentation procedures to support any definitive conclusions. Only 10 studies were included; they had limited sample sizes and short follow-up periods, and the majority were at a high risk of bias. However, no difference in implant failure was found, and the possible clinical value is still unknown, as long-term clinical parameters such as marginal bone loss, aesthetic results and patient satisfaction have been insufficiently studied.

27472571	Radiographic Assessment of Dental Maturation in Children With Dental Agenesis.	BACKGROUND: Dental agenesis is the most common developmental anomaly in humans, frequently associated with disorders in dental development and maturation. AIM: The purpose of this study is to determine radiographic variations in dental maturation in a group of Venezuelan children with dental agenesis. STUDY DESIGN: 1,188 panoramic radiographs, from healthy patients ages 5 to 12 years old were studied for agenesis of permanent teeth. Dental maturation was assessed by relative eruption and dental age according to Nolla, comparing children affected with dental agenesis to a stratified control group selected from the same population, excluding children with premature loss of primary teeth in the left quadrants and unclear radiographs. Descriptive analysis, and differences between means and medians (Student t test, Kruskall-Wallis p=0.05) were performed. RESULTS: Medians for Nolla stages were similar between groups, with delay in tooth formation in the agenesis group for second molars (p<0.05) and maxillary lateral incisors and second premolars. Dental age was significantly underestimated for both groups, -0.89 (+/-0.78) for the control group and -1.20 (+/-0.95) for the study group. Tooth eruption was similar between groups. CONCLUSION: Dental age was significantly delayed in Venezuelan children with dental agenesis, with variable significance for tooth formation of studied teeth.
26939266	In Vitro Antioxidant Assays.	Various chemical in vitro assays have been developed to measure antioxidant capacities of plant products. Despite the recent popularity in the antioxidant research, the lack of standardized assays to compare research results from different research groups has been a major challenge. The examination of various antioxidant assays is required for the development of standard methods that are broadly applicable by researchers and industry. However, due to the complex nature of biological systems, there is no single universal method for measuring antioxidant capacity. Antioxidant methods such as DPPH*, ABTS+, nitric oxide, super oxide, metal chelating confirming the free radical scavenging property of the plants with widely used methods are simplified in this chapter.
27223118	Genetic and Environmental Control of Neurodevelopmental Robustness in Drosophila.	Interindividual differences in neuronal wiring may contribute to behavioral individuality and affect susceptibility to neurological disorders. To investigate the causes and potential consequences of wiring variation in Drosophila melanogaster, we focused on a hemilineage of ventral nerve cord interneurons that exhibits morphological variability. We find that late-born subclasses of the 12A hemilineage are highly sensitive to genetic and environmental variation. Neurons in the second thoracic segment are particularly variable with regard to two developmental decisions, whereas its segmental homologs are more robust. This variability "hotspot" depends on Ultrabithorax expression in the 12A neurons, indicating variability is cell-intrinsic and under genetic control. 12A development is more variable and sensitive to temperature in long-established laboratory strains than in strains recently derived from the wild. Strains with a high frequency of one of the 12A variants also showed a high frequency of animals with delayed spontaneous flight initiation, whereas other wing-related behaviors did not show such a correlation and were thus not overtly affected by 12A variation. These results show that neurodevelopmental robustness is variable and under genetic control in Drosophila and suggest that the fly may serve as a model for identifying conserved gene pathways that stabilize wiring in stressful developmental environments. Moreover, some neuronal lineages are variation hotspots and thus may be more amenable to evolutionary change.
27093610	Weight and Glucose Reduction Observed with a Combination of Nutritional Agents in Rodent Models Does Not Translate to Humans in a Randomized Clinical Trial with Healthy Volunteers and Subjects with Type 2 Diabetes.	BACKGROUND: Nutritional agents have modest efficacy in reducing weight and blood glucose in animal models and humans, but combinations are less well characterized. GSK2890457 (GSK457) is a combination of 4 nutritional agents, discovered by the systematic assessment of 16 potential components using the diet-induced obese mouse model, which was subsequently evaluated in a human study. NONCLINICAL RESULTS: In the diet-induced obese mouse model, GSK457 (15% w/w in chow) given with a long-acting glucagon-like peptide -1 receptor agonist, exendin-4 AlbudAb, produced weight loss of 30.8% after 28 days of treatment. In db/db mice, a model of diabetes, GSK457 (10% w/w) combined with the exendin-4 AlbudAb reduced glucose by 217 mg/dL and HbA1c by 1.2% after 14 days. CLINICAL RESULTS: GSK457 was evaluated in a 6 week randomized, placebo-controlled study that enrolled healthy subjects and subjects with type 2 diabetes to investigate changes in weight and glucose. In healthy subjects, GSK457 well tolerated when titrated up to 40 g/day, and it reduced systemic exposure of metformin by ~ 30%. In subjects with diabetes taking liraglutide 1.8 mg/day, GSK457 did not reduce weight, but it slightly decreased mean glucose by 0.356 mmol/L (95% CI: -1.409, 0.698) and HbAlc by 0.065% (95% CI: -0.495, 0.365), compared to placebo. In subjects with diabetes taking metformin, weight increased in the GSK457-treated group [adjusted mean % increase from baseline: 1.26% (95% CI: -0.24, 2.75)], and mean glucose and HbA1c were decreased slightly compared to placebo [adjusted mean glucose change from baseline: -1.22 mmol/L (95% CI: -2.45, 0.01); adjusted mean HbA1c change from baseline: -0.219% (95% CI: -0.910, 0.472)]. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate remarkable effects of GSK457 in rodent models of obesity and diabetes, but a marked lack of translation to humans. Caution should be exercised with nutritional agents when predicting human efficacy from rodent models of obesity and diabetes. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01725126.
27276862	Iris melanocytoma.	INTRODUCTION: Iris melanocytoma (IM) is a rare benign tumor, but unavoidable in differential diagnosis of pigmented iris lesions. According to the best knowledge of the authors it is for the first time in Serbia that a well-documented case of IM is presented and that the problem of this tumor is discussed. CASE OUTLINE: In the left eye of a 47-year-old white female at the iris in a six o'clock position, a highly pigmented, dome shaped lesion with a crater-like cavity in the center and with feathery margins was noticed. There were no signs of infiltration of surrounding tissue or intrinsic vessels and the lens was clear. Visual acuity and intraocular pressure were normal. An ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM) revealed a well-defined lesion with high internal reflectivity, with a base diameter of 1.25 mm and a thickness of 0.80 mm in the periphery, and 0.53 mm in the central part.The diagnosis of IM of the left eye was established and regular checkups were performed for ten years. No changes in clinical or UBM presentation were established. CONCLUSION: Awareness of clinical presentation of IM is most important for correct diagnosis. Ultrasound biomicroscopy is a useful diagnostic procedure in the following up of IM.
27942241	Once-weekly prophylactic dosing of recombinant factor IX improves adherence in hemophilia B.	Regular prophylactic treatment in severe hemophilia should be considered an optimal treatment. There is no general agreement on the optimal prophylaxis regimen, and adherence to prophylaxis is a main challenge due to medical, psychosocial, and cost controversies. Improved approaches in prophylaxis regimen of hemophilia B are needed to make patients' lives easier. There is some evidence to support the efficacy of once-weekly prophylaxis. Longer sampling schedules are required for the determination of pharmacokinetic (PK) properties of factor IX (FIX). The half-life of FIX seems to be longer than previously described and is expected to be 34 hours. The clinical significance of maintaining a 1% trough level is widely debated in hemophilia B. The overall relationship between factor concentrate levels and incidence of joint bleeding was found to be very weak. Data also indicate that the distribution of FIX into an extravascular FIX compartment may contribute to hemostasis independently of circulating plasma FIX levels. Clinical assessment of the frequency and severity of bleeds remain an important measure of the efficacy of treatment. Role of PK-guided therapy remains to be established. Two prospective randomized studies had evaluated the efficacy and safety of 100 IU/kg once-weekly prophylaxis with nonacog alfa, and this prophylaxis regimen was found to be associated with lower annual bleeding rate compared with on-demand treatment in adolescents and adults with moderately severe-to-severe hemophilia B. Secondary prophylaxis therapy with 100 IU/kg nonacog alfa once weekly reduced annual bleeding rate by 89.4% relative to on-demand treatment. Residual FIX may be supportive of effectiveness. Once-weekly prophylaxis was well tolerated in the two studies, with a safety profile similar to that reported during the on-demand treatment period. To individually tailor treatment to clinical response and to minimize costs of factor concentrate, it would be of interest to investigate the efficacy of lower doses of the drug administered once a week.
26831846	Birch allergy and oral allergy syndrome: The practical relevance of serum immunoglobulin E to Bet v 1.	BACKGROUND: Birch allergy (BA) may frequently be associated with fruit-vegetables oral allergy syndrome (OAS). Bet v 1 is the major birch allergen. Previously, it was reported that serum-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) level could differentiate allergy from sensitization. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the practical role of Bet v 1 IgE. METHODS: A total of 245 subjects (128 women, 117 men; mean age, 41 years) with suspected allergic rhinitis and sensitization to Bet v 1 were evaluated. Serum IgE to Bet v 1 was assessed by using immuno-enzymatic. BA and OAS were diagnosed according to validated criteria. Symptom severity perception was measured by the visual analog scale. RESULTS: A total of 158 patients (64.5%) had BA. Patients with BA had higher serum Bet v 1 IgE levels than subjects who were sensitized (p < 0.0001). A cutoff value of 8.94 kUA/L predicted BA (area under the curve, 0.76; odds ratio, 6.18). Fifty-three patients with BA (33.5%) had OAS. Patients positive for OAS had higher Bet v 1 levels (p < 0.0001) and more-severe symptoms (p < 0.0001) than patients with BA and negative for OAS. A cutoff value of 17.4 kUA/L predicted OAS (area under the curve, 0.59; odds ratio, 3.19). CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrated that serum IgE levels to Bet v 1 could be a useful marker for differentiating between different birch pollen sensitization phenotypes.
27042079	Dimethyl fumarate in the management of multiple sclerosis: appropriate patient selection and special considerations.	Delayed-release dimethyl fumarate (DMF), also known as gastroresistant DMF, is the most recently approved oral disease-modifying treatment (DMT) for relapsing multiple sclerosis. Two randomized clinical trials (Determination of the Efficacy and Safety of Oral Fumarate in Relapsing-Remitting MS [DEFINE] and Comparator and an Oral Fumarate in Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis [CONFIRM]) demonstrated significant efficacy in reducing relapse rate and radiological signs of disease activity, as seen on magnetic resonance imaging. The DEFINE study also indicated a significant effect of DMF on disability worsening, while the low incidence of confirmed disability worsening in the CONFIRM trial rendered an insignificant reduction among the DMF-treated groups when compared to placebo. DMF also demonstrated a good safety profile and acceptable tolerability, since the most common side effects (gastrointestinal events and flushing reactions) are usually transient and mild to moderate in severity. Here, we discuss the place in therapy of DMF for individuals with relapsing multiple sclerosis, providing a tentative therapeutic algorithm to manage newly diagnosed patients and those who do not adequately respond to self-injectable DMTs. Literature data supporting the potential role of DMF as a first-line therapy are presented. The possibility of using DMF as switching treatment or even as an add-on strategy in patients with breakthrough disease despite self-injectable DMTs will also be discussed. Lastly, we argue about the role of DMF as an exit strategy from natalizumab-treated patients who are considered at risk for developing multifocal progressive leukoencephalopathy.
26834535	Resonant Cholinergic Dynamics in Cognitive and Motor Decision-Making: Attention, Category Learning, and Choice in Neocortex, Superior Colliculus, and Optic Tectum.	Freely behaving organisms need to rapidly calibrate their perceptual, cognitive, and motor decisions based on continuously changing environmental conditions. These plastic changes include sharpening or broadening of cognitive and motor attention and learning to match the behavioral demands that are imposed by changing environmental statistics. This article proposes that a shared circuit design for such flexible decision-making is used in specific cognitive and motor circuits, and that both types of circuits use acetylcholine to modulate choice selectivity. Such task-sensitive control is proposed to control thalamocortical choice of the critical features that are cognitively attended and that are incorporated through learning into prototypes of visual recognition categories. A cholinergically-modulated process of vigilance control determines if a recognition category and its attended features are abstract (low vigilance) or concrete (high vigilance). Homologous neural mechanisms of cholinergic modulation are proposed to focus attention and learn a multimodal map within the deeper layers of superior colliculus. This map enables visual, auditory, and planned movement commands to compete for attention, leading to selection of a winning position that controls where the next saccadic eye movement will go. Such map learning may be viewed as a kind of attentive motor category learning. The article hereby explicates a link between attention, learning, and cholinergic modulation during decision making within both cognitive and motor systems. Homologs between the mammalian superior colliculus and the avian optic tectum lead to predictions about how multimodal map learning may occur in the mammalian and avian brain and how such learning may be modulated by acetycholine.
27217992	Optimization of DNA extraction and PCR protocols for phylogenetic analysis in Schinopsis spp. and related Anacardiaceae.	The Anacardiaceae is an important and worldwide distributed family of ecological and socio-economic relevance. Notwithstanding that, molecular studies in this family are scarce and problematic because of the particularly high concentration of secondary metabolites-i.e. tannins and oleoresins-that are present in almost all tissues of the many members of the group, which complicate the purification and amplification of the DNA. The objective of this work was to improve an available DNA isolation method for Schinopsis spp. and other related Anacardiaceae, as well as the PCR protocols for DNA amplification of the chloroplast trnL-F, rps16 and ndhF and nuclear ITS-ETS fragments. The modifications proposed allowed the extraction of 70-120 microg of non-degraded genomic DNA per gram of dry tissue that resulted useful for PCR amplification. PCR reactions produced the expected fragments that could be directly sequenced. Sequence analyses of amplicons showed similarity with the corresponding Schinopsis accessions available at GenBank. The methodology presented here can be routinely applied for molecular studies of the group aimed to clarify not only aspects on the molecular biology but also the taxonomy and phylogeny of this fascinating group of vascular plants.
27099559	First record of the thread-legged assassin bug Myiophanes greeni Distant, 1903 (Heteroptera: Reduviidae: Emesinae) from India.	BACKGROUND: While surveying bugs and spiders in the caves of Satara District, Maharashtra, one of us (SK) collected a thread-legged bug associated with a spider web. NEW INFORMATION: A Sri Lankan Emesinae bug, Myiophanes greeni Distant (Heteroptera: Reduviidae: Emesinae) is reported for the first time from India. The species is redescribed with several illustrations including male genitalia.
26930524	Evidence for an internet addiction disorder: internet exposure reinforces color preference in withdrawn problem users.	OBJECTIVE: This study examined whether exposure to the Internet could create a preference for colors associated with visited Web sites and explored the possible relationship with self-reported problematic Internet use and Internet deprivation. METHOD: 100 adult participants were divided into 2 groups; one was deprived access to the Internet for 4 hours, and the other was not. After this period, they were asked to choose a color and complete a series of psychometric questionnaires concerning mood (Positive and Negative Affect Schedule), anxiety (Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory), and depression (Beck Depression Inventory). They were then given a 15-minute exposure to the Internet, and the Web sites they visited were recorded. They were then asked to again choose a color, complete the same psychometric questionnaires, and complete the Internet Addiction Test. The study was conducted between November 2013 and April 2014. RESULTS: For Internet-deprived, but not nondeprived, subjects, a reduction of mood and increased anxiety was noted in the higher problematic Internet users following Web cessation. There was also a shift toward choosing the color most prominent on the visited Web sites in these participants. No shift in mood, or toward choosing the dominant Web site color, was seen in the lower problem users. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the Internet can serve as a negative reinforcer for behavior in higher problem users and that the reinforcement obtained from the alleviation of withdrawal symptoms becomes conditioned, with the color and appearance of the visited Web sites giving them a more positive value.
26914109	Metabolic signaling of insulin secretion by pancreatic beta-cell and its derangement in type 2 diabetes.	The article "Metabolic signaling of insulin secretion by pancreatic beta-cell and its derangement in type 2 diabetes" by C.-Y. Zou, Y. Gong, J. Liang, published in Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci 2014; 18 (15): 2215-2227 has been withdrawn.
27933323	Assessing Collagen and Micro-permeability at the Proanthocyanidin-treated Resin-Dentin Interface.	PURPOSE: To establish a fluorescence-based method to simultaneously assess micro-permeability and collagen cross-linking induced by chemical agents at the resin-dentin interface. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three chemical agents were investigated (proanthocyanidin-rich grape seed extract: GSE; carbodiimide hydrochloride/N-hydroxysuccinimide: EDC/NHS; glutaraldehyde: GD) along with a control (distilled water) as primers applied on flat occlusal dentin surfaces of 48 teeth and restored with two commercially available etch-and-rinse adhesives. Resin-dentin interfaces were polished and infiltrated with rhodamine-B solution for confocal laser scanning microscopy analysis. Parameters were chosen that would allow acquisition of a simultaneous appearance of collagen and interfacial micro-permeability (rhodamine-B). Fluorescence emission intensity (FEI) was converted into numerals and values were calculated for each group. Data were statistically analyzed using one-way ANOVA and post-hoc Scheffe's and multiple comparisons tests (alpha = 0.05). T-tests with Pearson correlations were used to investigate correlations between collagen cross-linking and micro-permeability. RESULTS: The FEI of collagen was the highest for GD, followed by GSE, with no significant differences between EDC/ NHS and the control group (p > 0.05). Micro-permeability was significantly affected by the adhesives (p < 0.05). Micro- permeability was the lowest for GSE groups, regardless of the adhesives (p < 0.001). Weak correlations were found between micro-permeability and collagen auto-fluorescence. CONCLUSIONS: Non-enzymatic collagen cross-linking induced by GSE and GD can be detected by increased collagen auto-fluorescence, and results in reduced interfacial micro-permeability. Increased collagen auto-fluorescence was correlated with fluorescent collagen cross-links and decreased micro-permeability at the resin-dentin interface. Collagen auto-fluorescence is a useful tool to detect auto-fluorescent exogenous cross links and their potential impact on the quality of the resin-dentin interface.
26932218	[Study on the risk of HIV transmission by heterosexual contact and the correlation factors].	OBJECTIVE: To understand the associated factors on human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmission via heterosexual contact and to provide evidence for decision-maker for prevention of HIV. METHODS: Questionnaire survey was conducted in 250 HIV-positive persons to understand their socio-demographic characteristics and sexual behavior. Meanwhile, 431 persons who had heterosexual contact with the HIV carriers were traced to their HIV infection status. The factors associated with continued HIV transmission were reviewed by case-control analysis. RESULTS: Among the 432 persons, 59 were HIV-positive because of heterosexual contact. The secondary attack rate and the growth rate was 13.7% (59/431) and 0.236 (59/250), respectively. The factors associated with the spread of HIV included: the degree of knowledge on HIV/AIDS, psychological reflection after infection, the condition for condom usage among spouses, and regular sexual partners or non regular sexual partners. CONCLUSION: The secondary attack rate and the growth rate of HIV transmission by heterosexual contact are high. Improvement of the knowledge about HIV/AIDS prevention and control, enhancement of psychological education and promotion of condom usage can reduce the risk for continued HIV transmission.
28105075	Cancer of the gallbladder-Chilean statistics.	Chile has the world's highest rate of incidence as well as death from cancer of the gallbladder and biliary ducts. The problem is most acute in the southern provinces. These areas constitute the low average income associated with low educational attainment and a high rate of obesity compared with the rest of Chile. We could also include genetic factors related to processes of lithogenesis to these elements which are more common among the Mapuche. This population sub-group could benefit from special government programmes for early diagnosis and treatment of lithiasic disease and for the management of risk factors such as obesity. In this way, we could reduce the mortality rate of gallbladder cancer.
28352799	Correlation analysis of VHL and Jade-1 gene expression in human renal cell carcinoma.	OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the correlation of von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor (VHL) mRNA expression and jade family PHD finger 1 (Jade-1) gene expression in patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Another aim of this study was to analyze the relationship of these two genes with clinicalpathological features of the RCC patients. METHODS: A total of 75 RCC patients who received surgically therapy in our hospital were included. All patients had complete pathological data. The expression of VHL/Jade-1 was determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). RESULTS: VHL and Jade-1 were both obviously downregulated in RCC tissues than that of the matched normal tissues, and both negatively correlated with tumor size as well as tumor grade. And we found a fine association of VHL gene expression with Jade-1. CONCLUSION: VHL/Jade-1 exhibited significantly decreased expression in RCC tissues and was closely related to the clinical prognosis of patients. The finding of VHL expression positively correlated with Jade-1 expression shed light and provided crucial evidence on the connection of VHL protein with Wnt/b-catenin pathway.
26864842	Experiences of Older Men Living Alone: A Qualitative Study.	More and more old people live alone, and living alone is reported to be a key risk factor for experiencing loneliness and developing poor health. The purpose of this qualitative study was to explore the experiences of living alone for older men. Systematic text condensation and hermeneutic interpretation were used in analysis of the data. Four themes emerged: lonely at times, missing and longing for a shared life, keeping active, and some kind of freedom. The findings revealed that inner and outer resources come into play and have influence on the processes of managing and solving the situation of living alone. The findings are in accordance with theoretical perspectives on loneliness, aloneness, and solitude. The findings offer nurses in any clinical context valuable information to allow them to address the core emotional and potential mental health issues old men face in coping with the situation of living alone.
27099461	Risk factors for tube exposure as a late complication of glaucoma drainage implant surgery.	PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the risk factors for tube exposure after glaucoma drainage implant surgery. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective case-controlled observational study of 64 eyes from 64 patients. Thirty-two eyes of 32 patients with tube erosion requiring surgical revision were compared with 32 matched control eyes of 32 patients. Univariate and multivariate risk factor analyses were performed. RESULTS: Mean age was significantly younger in the tube exposure group compared with the control group (48.2+/-28.1 years versus 67.3+/-18.0 years, respectively; P=0.003). The proportion of diabetic patients (12.5%) in the tube exposure group was significantly less (P=0.041) compared with the control group (37.5%). Comparisons of the type and position of the drainage implant were not significantly different between the two groups. The average time to tube exposure was 17.2+/-18.0 months after implantation of the drainage device. In both univariate and multivariate analyses, younger age (P=0.005 and P=0.027) and inflammation prior to tube exposure (P</=0.001 and P=0.004) were significant risk factors. Diabetes was a significant risk factor only in the univariate analysis (P=0.027). CONCLUSION: Younger age and inflammation were significant risk factors for tube exposure after drainage implant surgery.
27078027	Hypoxia Induces Autophagy through Translational Up-Regulation of Lysosomal Proteins in Human Colon Cancer Cells.	Hypoxia occurs in a wide variety of physiological and pathological conditions, including tumorigenesis. Tumor cells have to adapt to hypoxia by altering their gene expression and protein synthesis. Here, we showed that hypoxia inhibits translation through activation of PERK and inactivation of mTOR in human colon cancer HCT116 cells. Prolonged hypoxia (1% O2, 16 h) dramatically inhibits general translation in HCT116 cells, yet selected mRNAs remain efficiently translated under such a condition. Using microarray analysis of polysome- associated mRNAs, we identified a large number of hypoxia-regulated genes at the translational level. Efficiently translated mRNAs during hypoxia were validated by polysome profiling and quantitative real-time RT-PCR. Pathway enrichment analysis showed that many of the up-regulated genes are involved in lysosome, glycan and lipid metabolism, antigen presentation, cell adhesion, and remodeling of the extracellular matrix and cytoskeleton. The majority of down-regulated genes are involved in apoptosis, ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, and oxidative phosphorylation. Further investigation showed that hypoxia induces lysosomal autophagy and mitochondrial dysfunction through translational regulation in HCT116 cells. The abundance of several translation factors and the mTOR kinase activity are involved in hypoxia-induced mitochondrial autophagy in HCT116 cells. Our studies highlight the importance of translational regulation for tumor cell adaptation to hypoxia.
27327617	Evaluation of a Fast Protocol for Staging Lymphoma Patients with Integrated PET/MRI.	BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to assess the applicability of a fast MR-protocol for whole-body staging of lymphoma patients using an integrated PET/MR system. METHODS: A total of 48 consecutive lymphoma patients underwent 52 clinically indicated PET/CT and subsequent PET/MRI examinations with the use of 18F-FDG. For PET/MR imaging, a fast whole-body MR-protocol was implemented. A radiologist and a nuclear medicine physician interpreted MRI and PET/MRI datasets in consensus and were instructed to identify manifestations of lymphoma on a site-specific analysis. The accuracy for the identification of active lymphoma disease was calculated and the tumor stage for each examination was determined. Furthermore, radiation doses derived from administered tracer activities and CT protocol parameters were estimated and the mean scan duration of PET/CT and PET/MR imaging was determined. Statistical analysis was performed to compare the diagnostic performance of PET/MRI and MRI alone. The results of PET/CT imaging, all available histopathological samples as well as results of prior examinations and follow-up imaging were used for the determination of the reference standard. RESULTS: Active lymphoma disease was present in 28/52 examinations. PET/MRI revealed higher values of diagnostic accuracy for the identification of active lymphoma disease in those 52 examinations in comparison to MRI, however, results of the two ratings did not differ significantly. On a site specific analysis, PET/MRI showed a significantly higher accuracy for the identification of nodal manifestation of lymphoma (p<0.05) if compared to MRI, whereas ratings for extranodal regions did not reveal a significant difference. In addition, PET/MRI enabled correct identification of lymphoma stage in a higher percentage of patients than MRI (94% vs. 83%). Furthermore, SUVs derived from PET/MRI were significantly higher than in PET/CT, however, there was a strong positive correlation between SUVmax and SUVmean of the two imaging modalities (R = 0.91 p<0.001 and R = 0.87, p<0.001). Average scan duration of whole-body PET/CT and PET/MRI examinations amounted to 17.3+/-1.9 min and 27.8+/-3.7 min, respectively. Estimated mean effective-dose for whole-body PET/CT scans were 64.4% higher than for PET/MRI. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate the usefulness of 18F-FDG PET data as a valuable additive to MRI for a more accurate evaluation of patients with lymphomas. With regard to patient comfort related to scan duration and a markedly reduced radiation exposure, fast PET/MRI may serve as a powerful alternative to PET/CT for a diagnostic workup of lymphoma patients.
27274875	Early Social Enrichment Improves Social Motivation and Skills in a Monogenic Mouse Model of Autism, the Oprm1 (-/-) Mouse.	Environmental enrichment has been proven to have positive effects on both behavioral and physiological phenotypes in rodent models of mental and neurodevelopmental disorders. In this study, we used mice lacking the micro-opioid receptor gene (Oprm1 (-/-)), which has been shown to have deficits in social competence and communication, to assess the hypothesis that early enrichment can ameliorate sociability during development and adulthood. Due to the immaturity of sensory-motor capabilities of young pups, we chose as environmental stimulation a second lactating female, who provided extra maternal care and stimulation from birth. The results show that double mothering normalized the abnormal response to maternal separation in Oprm1 (-/-) pups and increased social motivation in juveniles and adult knockout mice. Additionally, we observed that Oprm1 (-/-) mice act as less attractive social partners than wild types, which suggests that social motivation can be modulated by the stimulus employed. This experiment supports previous findings suggesting that early social environmental stimulation has profound and long-term beneficial effects, encouraging the use of nonpharmacological interventions for the treatment of social defects in neurodevelopmental diseases.
26958528	Delayed migration of a bullet from loin to scrotum.	Here, we report a rare case of migration of a foreign body has occurred from loin to scrotum. A 35-year-old male patient presented with right sided scrotal mass, on exploration it was found to be a metallic bullet. The patient had a history of gunshot injury in his loin 8 years back and was treated conservatively that time. The probable explanation to this mysterious incident may be that, the bullet might have entered the peritoneal cavity through the loin, but did not cause any extensive damage, so the patient well responded to the initial conservative management. With time, due to changes in abdominal pressure or may be due to gravitational force, it had migrated to the dependent scrotum through the patent processus vaginalis. So, this case signifies that a foreign body can migrate through the body planes and get settled far from the primary place.
27313597	Conservation and Expression Patterns Divergence of Ascorbic Acid d-mannose/l-galactose Pathway Genes in Brassica rapa.	Ascorbic acid (AsA) participates in diverse biological processes, is regulated by multiple factors and is a potent antioxidant and cellular reductant. The D-Mannose/L-Galactose pathway is a major plant AsA biosynthetic pathway that is highly connected within biosynthetic networks, and generally conserved across plants. Previous work has shown that, although most genes of this pathway are expressed under standard growth conditions in Brassica rapa, some paralogs of these genes are not. We hypothesize that regulatory evolution in duplicate AsA pathway genes has occurred as an adaptation to environmental stressors, and that gene retention has been influenced by polyploidation events in Brassicas. To test these hypotheses, we explored the conservation of these genes in Brassicas and their expression patterns divergence in B. rapa. Similar retention and a high degree of gene sequence similarity were identified in B. rapa (A genome), B. oleracea (C genome) and B. napus (AC genome). However, the number of genes that encode the same type of enzymes varied among the three plant species. With the exception of GMP, which has nine genes, there were one to four genes that encoded the other enzymes. Moreover, we found that expression patterns divergence widely exists among these genes. (i) VTC2 and VTC5 are paralogous genes, but only VTC5 is influenced by FLC. (ii) Under light treatment, PMI1 co-regulates the AsA pool size with other D-Man/L-Gal pathway genes, whereas PMI2 is regulated only by darkness. (iii) Under NaCl, Cu(2+), MeJA and wounding stresses, most of the paralogs exhibit different expression patterns. Additionally, GME and GPP are the key regulatory enzymes that limit AsA biosynthesis in response to these treatments. In conclusion, our data support that the conservative and divergent expression patterns of D-Man/L-Gal pathway genes not only avoid AsA biosynthesis network instability but also allow B. rapa to better adapt to complex environments.
26834775	Molecular Characterization of FT and FD Homologs from Eriobotrya deflexa Nakai forma koshunensis.	In angiosperms, regulation of flowering is a vital process for successful reproduction. To date, the molecular mechanism of flowering is well-studied in the model plant, Arabidopsis, in which key genes such as FLOWERING LOCUST (FT) or FD have been identified to regulate flowering. However, the flowering mechanisms are still largely unknown in fruit trees like loquat. To this end, we first cloned one FT- and two FD-like genes from the loquat (Eriobotrya deflexa Nakai f. koshunensis) and referred to as EdFT, EdFD1, and EdFD2, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis has shown that EdFT, EdFD1, and EdFD2 are conserved during the evolution process. EdFT is mainly expressed in reproductive tissues (e.g., flower buds, flowers, and fruits), while EdFD1 and EdFD2 are mainly expressed in apical buds including leaf buds and flower buds. EdFT is localized in the whole cell, while EdFD1 or EdFD2 is localized in the nucleus. Ectopic expression of EdFT, EdFD1, and EdFD2 in Arabidopsis results in early flowering. In addition, we have also revealed that the EdFT interacts with both EdFD1 and EdFD2. Overall, these data suggest that the EdFT, EdFD1, and EdFD2 are the functional homologs of FT and FD, respectively, which might act together to regulate loquat flowering through a similar mechanism found in Arabidopsis.
27493721	Different risk factor patterns for adult asthma, rhinitis and eczema: results from West Sweden Asthma Study.	BACKGROUND: Atopic diseases including asthma, rhinitis and eczema have increased in the second half of the past century. This has been well studied among children and adolescents but with the exception of asthma to a much lesser extent in adults. The adult risk factor pattern of atopic diseases, in particular of eczema, and their relation to allergic sensitization are yet to be fully elucidated. Studies among adults that have compared the risk factor pattern for these conditions in the same material are very few. The objective of this study was to compare the risk factor patterns for asthma, rhinitis and eczema in a randomly selected adult population. METHODS: A questionnaire survey on atopic diseases was dispatched by mail to 30,000 randomly selected individuals in West Sweden aged 16-75 years and 62 % participated. A subgroup of 2000 individuals was selected for clinical examinations including blood sampling for specific serum Immunoglobulin E to common airborne allergens and 1172 attended. RESULTS: The prevalence of current asthma was 11.8 %, current rhinitis 42.8 %, current eczema 13.5 and 2.3 % had all three conditions while 13.9 % had at least two conditions. No mutual risk factor was identified for all three conditions. Allergic sensitization was a strong risk factor for current asthma (OR 4.1 CI 2.7-6.3) and current rhinitis (OR 5.1 CI 3.8-6.9) but not so for current eczema. Obesity was a risk factor for current asthma and current rhinitis, while farm childhood decreased the risk for current asthma and current rhinitis. Occupational exposure to gas dust or fumes and female sex was associated with an increased risk of current asthma and current eczema. CONCLUSIONS: There are different risk factor patterns for asthma, rhinitis and eczema in adults but some risk factors are overlapping between some of the conditions. The effect of mutable risk factors should be assessed further in longitudinal studies.
26931873	Design and characterization of a novel toroidal split-ring resonator.	The design and characterization of a novel toroidal split-ring resonator (SRR) are described in detail. In conventional cylindrical SRRs, there is a large magnetic flux within the bore of the resonator. However, there also exists a non-negligible magnetic flux in the free space surrounding the resonator. The energy losses associated with this radiated power diminish the resonator's quality factor. In the toroidal SRR, on the other hand, the magnetic field lines are strongly confined within the bore of the resonator resulting in high intrinsic quality factors and stable resonance frequencies without requiring additional electromagnetic shielding. This paper describes the design and construction of a toroidal SRR as well as an experimental investigation of its cw response in the frequency-domain and its time-domain response to a rf pulse. Additionally, the dependence of the toroidal SRR's resonant frequency and quality factor on the strength of inductive coupling to external circuits is investigated both theoretically and experimentally.
27073661	Primary intraosseous squamous cell carcinoma derived from a maxillary cyst: A case report and literature review.	Primary intraosseous squamous cell carcinoma (PIOSCC) is a rare malignant central jaw tumor derived from odontogenic epithelial remnants. PIOSCC predominantly affects the mandible, although both jawbones may be involved. This case report describes a PIOSCC type 2 of the maxilla in a 37-year-old man, treated by partial maxillectomy. Histopathologically, the tumor was diagnosed as PIOSCC derived from an odontogenic cyst. Postoperatively, the patient has been followed up for 53 months, with no recurrence of the disease. We herein describe the clinical details, treatment results and histopathological characteristics of a rare case of PIOSCC derived from a maxillary odontogenic cyst with reference to the relevant literature.
27651838	Epigenetic modulators as therapeutic targets in prostate cancer.	Prostate cancer is one of the most common non-cutaneous malignancies among men worldwide. Epigenetic aberrations, including changes in DNA methylation patterns and/or histone modifications, are key drivers of prostate carcinogenesis. These epigenetic defects might be due to deregulated function and/or expression of the epigenetic machinery, affecting the expression of several important genes. Remarkably, epigenetic modifications are reversible and numerous compounds that target the epigenetic enzymes and regulatory proteins were reported to be effective in cancer growth control. In fact, some of these drugs are already being tested in clinical trials. This review discusses the most important epigenetic alterations in prostate cancer, highlighting the role of epigenetic modulating compounds in pre-clinical and clinical trials as potential therapeutic agents for prostate cancer management.
27271897	Dissecting Spatial and Temporal Sensing in Dictyostelium Chemotaxis Using a Wave Gradient Generator.	External cues that dictate the direction of cell migration are likely dynamic during many biological processes such as embryonic development and wound healing. Until recently, how cells integrate spatial and temporal information to determine the direction of migration has remained elusive. In Dictyostelium discoideum, the chemoattractant cAMP that directs cell aggregation propagates as periodic waves. In light of the fact that any temporally evolving complex signals, in principle, can be expressed as a sum of sinusoidal functions with various frequencies, the Dictyostelium system serves as a minimal example, where the dynamic signal is in the simplest form of near sinusoidal wave with one dominant frequency. Here, we describe a method to emulate the traveling waves in a fluidics device. The text provides step-by-step instructions on the device setup and describes ways to analyze the acquired data. These include quantification of membrane translocation of fluorescently labeled proteins in individual Dictyostelium cells and estimation of exogenous cAMP profiles. The described approach has already helped decipher spatial and temporal aspects of chemotactic sensing in Dictyostelium. More specifically, it allowed one to discriminate the temporal and the spatial sensing aspects of directional sensing. With some modifications, one should be able to implement similar analysis in other cell types.
27119012	Studies using IPS cells support a possible link between ZIKA and microcephaly.	There is a suspected link between Brazilian babies born with microcephaly and Zika virus (ZIKV) infection. However, little is know about the brain cell targets and the mechanisms that Zika virus may cause microcephaly. A recent report demonstrated that Zika virus infection increases cell death and dysregulates cell-cycle, resulting in attenuated human neural progenitor cells growth. This study fills a major gap and serves as an entry point to establish a mechanistic link between Zika infection and microcephaly.
27757109	Infection of Goose with Genotype VIId Newcastle Disease Virus of Goose Origin Elicits Strong Immune Responses at Early Stage.	Newcastle disease (ND), caused by virulent strains of Newcastle disease virus (NDV), is a highly contagious disease of birds that is responsible for heavy economic losses for the poultry industry worldwide. However, little is known about host-virus interactions in waterfowl, goose. In this study, we aim to characterize the host immune response in goose, based on the previous reports on the host response to NDV in chickens. Here, we evaluated viral replication and mRNA expression of 27 immune-related genes in 10 tissues of geese challenged with a genotype VIId NDV strain of goose origin (go/CH/LHLJ/1/06). The virus showed early replication, especially in digestive and immune tissues. The expression profiles showed up-regulation of Toll-like receptor (TLR)1-3, 5, 7, and 15, avian beta-defensin (AvBD) 5-7, 10, 12, and 16, cytokines [interleukin (IL)-8, IL-18, IL-1beta, and interferon-gamma], inducible NO synthase (iNOS), and MHC class I in some tissues of geese in response to NDV. In contrast, NDV infection suppressed expression of AvBD1 in cecal tonsil of geese. Moreover, we observed a highly positive correlation between viral replication and host mRNA expressions of TLR1-5 and 7, AvBD4-6, 10, and 12, all the cytokines measured, MHC class I, FAS ligand, and iNOS, mainly at 72 h post-infection. Taken together, these results demonstrated that NDV infection induces strong innate immune responses and intense inflammatory responses at early stage in goose which may associate with the viral pathogenesis.
27384523	Social Complexification and Pig (Sus scrofa) Husbandry in Ancient China: A Combined Geometric Morphometric and Isotopic Approach.	Pigs have played a major role in the economic, social and symbolic systems of China since the Early Neolithic more than 8,000 years ago. However, the interaction between the history of pig domestication and transformations in Chinese society since then, have not been fully explored. In this paper, we investigated the co-evolution from the earliest farming communities through to the new political and economic models of state-like societies, up to the Chinese Empire, using 5,000 years of archaeological records from the Xiawanggang (XWG) and Xinzhai (XZ) sites (Henan Province). To trace the changes of pig populations against husbandry practices, we combined the geometric morphometric analysis of dental traits with a study of the stable carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios from bone collagen. The domestication process intensified during the Neolithic Yangshao, prompted by greater selective pressure and/or better herd control against wild introgression. After that, pig farming, in XWG, relied on local livestock and a gradual change of husbandry practices overtime. This was characterized by a gentle increase in millet foddering and animal protein intake, until a complete change over to household management during the Han dynasty. The only rupture in this steady trend of husbandry occurred during the Longshan period, with the appearance of small sized and idiosyncratic pigs with specific feeding practices (relying on millet and household scraps). From three exploratory hypothesis, we explored the possibility of anti-elite pig production in XWG during the Longshan period, as a means to resist incorporation into a new economic model promoting intensified domestic production. This exploratory hypothesis is the most suitable to our dataset; however, numerous areas need to be explored further in order to adequately document the role of pigs in the rise of China's complex societies.
26853440	Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of acute non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding (2015, Nanchang, China).	Acute non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding (ANVUGIB) is one of the most common medical emergencies in China and worldwide. In 2009, we published the "Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of acute non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding" for the patients in China; however, during the past years numerous studies on the diagnosis and treatment of ANVUGIB have been conducted, and the management of ANVUGIB needs to be updated. The guidelines were updated after the databases including PubMed, Embase and CNKI were searched to retrieve the clinical trials on the management of ANVUGIB. The clinical trials were evaluated for high-quality evidence, and the advances in definitions, diagnosis, etiology, severity evaluation, treatment and prognosis of ANVUGIB were carefully reviewed, the recommendations were then proposed. After several rounds of discussions and revisions among the national experts of digestive endoscopy, gastroenterology, radiology and intensive care, the 2015 version of "Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of acute non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding" was successfully developed by the Chinese Journal of Internal Medicine, National Medical Journal of China, Chinese Journal of Digestion and Chinese Journal of Digestive Endoscopy. It shall be noted that although much progress has been made, the clinical management of ANVUGIB still needs further improvement and refinement, and high-quality randomized trials are required in the future.
27630668	What Is the Impact of mRNA 5' TL Heterogeneity on Translational Start Site Selection and the Mammalian Cellular Phenotype?	A major determinant in the efficiency of ribosome loading onto mRNAs is the 5' TL (transcript leader or 5' UTR). In addition, elements within this region also impact on start site selection demonstrating that it can modulate the protein readout at both quantitative and qualitative levels. With the increasing wealth of data generated by the mining of the mammalian transcriptome, it has become evident that a genes 5' TL is not homogeneous but actually exhibits significant heterogeneity. This arises due to the utilization of alternative promoters, and is further compounded by significant variability with regards to the precise transcriptional start sites of each (not to mention alternative splicing). Consequently, the transcript for a protein coding gene is not a unique mRNA, but in-fact a complexed quasi-species of variants whose composition may respond to the changing physiological environment of the cell. Here we examine the potential impact of these events with regards to the protein readout.
26957860	A Rare Case of Puberty Onset Congenital Erythropoietic Porphyria with Ophthalmological Manifestations.	A 27-year-old male patient was presented with foreign body sensation in both the eyes for 2 years duration and blisters followed by scarring and pigmentation in the photo-exposed areas of the body over the previous 12 years. His urine was reddish colored for the previous year. On examination, there was scarring, hyper-pigmentation of photo-exposed parts of the body along with resorption of the distal phalanges of fingers in both hands except the smallest digit which had onycholysis. Ocular examination indicated scleral necrosis in the interpalpebral areas in both eyes and bilateral dry eye. Hematological examination indicated a picture suggestive of hemolytic anemia. Abdominal ultrasonography indicated an enlarged spleen. These clinical features are suggestive of puberty onset congenital erythropoietic porphyria with ophthalmological manifestations.
27746793	A Developmental Transcriptome Map for Allotetraploid Arachis hypogaea.	The advent of the genome sequences of Arachis duranensis and Arachis ipaensis has ushered in a new era for peanut genomics. With the goal of producing a gene atlas for cultivated peanut (Arachis hypogaea), 22 different tissue types and ontogenies that represent the full development of peanut were sequenced, including a complete reproductive series from flower to peg elongation and peg tip immersion in the soil to fully mature seed. Using a genome-guided assembly pipeline, a homeolog-specific transcriptome assembly for Arachis hypogaea was assembled and its accuracy was validated. The assembly was used to annotate 21 developmental co-expression networks as tools for gene discovery. Using a set of 8816 putative homeologous gene pairs, homeolog expression bias was documented, and although bias was mostly balanced, there were striking differences in expression bias in a tissue-specific context. Over 9000 alterative splicing events and over 6000 non-coding RNAs were further identified and profiled in a developmental context. Together, this work represents a major new resource for cultivated peanut and will be integrated into peanutbase.org as an available resource for all peanut researchers.
27547225	Antinociceptive Activity of Zanthoxylum piperitum DC. Essential Oil.	Zanthoxylum piperitum DC. (ZP) is a traditional medicinal plant used mainly in countries from Asia such as Japan. This study aimed to investigate the antinociceptive effect of ZP essential oil (ZPEO). The major component present in the essential oil was beta-phellandrene (29.39%). Its antinociceptive activity was tested through animal models (formalin-, capsaicin-, and glutamate-induced paw licking and hot plate). The anti-inflammatory effect was evaluated through the carrageenan-induced leukocyte migration into the subcutaneous air pouch (SAP), with measurement of cytokines. The results showed antinociceptive effect for ZPEO for the first phase of the formalin-induced licking, glutamate, and hot plate tests. However, ZPEO had no effect on reducing paw licking induced by capsaicin. Finally, ZPEO had no effect against inflammation induced by carrageenan.
27895695	The Effects of Guizhi Fuling Capsule Drug Serum on Uterine Leiomyoma Cells and Its Mechanism.	Aims. To observe the effects of Guizhi Fuling Capsule (GZFLC) drug serum on uterine leiomyoma cells and explore its mechanism. Main Methods. Sixty Sprague Dawley rats were randomly divided into two groups (normal saline lavage group and GZFLC lavage group), then, respectively, blank serum and GZFLC drug serum were collected, and finally human uterine leiomyoma cells were treated. Human leiomyoma tissues were collected from 20 patients who underwent uterine leiomyomas operations, and leiomyoma cells were primary cultured. The leiomyoma cells were treated by GZFLC drug serum in different concentrations (10%, 20%, and 30%) and variable treatment time (12 h, 24 h, 36 h, 48 h, and 72 h). Cell proliferation was observed using CCK8 assay. Flow cytometry and Annexin V/PI were used to assay the effects of GZFLC drug serum on cell apoptosis. Western blot analysis was used to assay the effects of GZFLC drug serum on TSC2, FOXO, and 14-3-3gamma expression in uterine leiomyoma cells. Key Findings. In the concentrations of 10%30%, GZFLC drug serum could inhibit proliferation of leiomyoma cells in dose-dependent manner; at the time of 36 h, cell inhibition rate was at the peak; GZFLC drug serum could induce apoptosis of leiomyoma also in a dose-dependent manner, and apoptosis rate quickly achieved maximum at 12 h time points, and then second apoptosis peak appeared at 36 h. Compared to nontreatment group, TSC2, FOXO, and 14-3-3gamma expressions in drug serum group were significantly changed after 12 h treatment. Significance. GZFLC drug serum can efficiently inhibit the proliferation and induce apoptosis of leiomyoma cells, which is related to the 14-3-3gamma pathway.
28025639	Evaluation of Bone Metabolism in Critically Ill Patients Using CTx and PINP.	Background. Prolonged immobilization, nutritional and vitamin D deficiency, and specific drug administration may lead to significant bone resorption. Methods and Patients. We prospectively evaluated critically ill patients admitted to the ICU for at least 10 days. Demographics, APACHE II, SOFA scores, length of stay (LOS), and drug administration were recorded. Blood collections were performed at baseline and on a weekly basis for five consecutive weeks. Serum levels of PINP, beta-CTx, iPTH, and 25(OH)vitamin D were measured at each time-point. Results. We enrolled 28 patients of mean age 67.4 +/- 2.3 years, mean APACHE II 22.2 +/- 0.9, SOFA 10.1 +/- 0.6, and LOS 31.6 +/- 5.7 days. Nineteen patients were receiving low molecular weight heparin, 17 nor-epinephrine and low dose hydrocortisone, 18 transfusions, and 3 phenytoin. 25(OH)vitamin D serum levels were very low in all patients at all time-points; iPTH serum levels were increased at baseline tending to normalize on 5th week; beta-CTx serum levels were significantly increased compared to baseline on 2nd week (peak values), whereas PINP levels were increased significantly after the 4th week. Conclusions. Our data show that critically ill patients had a pattern of hypovitaminosis D, increased iPTH, hypocalcaemia, and BTMs compatible with altered bone metabolism.
26915918	Septic arthritis by Sphingobacterium multivorum in imunocompromised pediatric patient.	OBJECTIVE: To report a case septic arthritis with a rare pathogen in a immunosuppressed child. CASE DESCRIPTION: Male patient, 6 years old, had liver transplant 5 and half years ago due to biliary atresia. Patient was using tacrolimus 1mg q.12hours. This patient started to have pain in left foot and ankle and had one episode of fever 3 days before hospital admission. Physical Examination showed weight 17kg, height 109cm, temperature 36,4 degrees C, with pain, swelling and heat in the left ankle, without other clinical signs. Initial tests: hemoglobin 11,7g/dL hematocrit 36.4%, leukocyte count 17600/uL (7% banded neutrophils, 70% segmented neutrophils, 2% eosinophils, basophils 1%, 13% lymphocytes, 7% monocytes) C-reactive protein 170,88mg/L. Joint ultrasound showed moderate effusion in the site. Patient was submitted to surgical procedure and S. multivorum was isolated from the effusion. The germ was susceptible to broad spectrum cephalosporins (ceftriaxone and cefepime) and fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin), and it was resistant to carbapenemic antibiotics and aminoglycosides. He was treated intravenously with oxacillin for 15 days and ceftriaxone for 13 days, and orally with ciprofloxacin for 15 days, with good outcome. COMMENTS: The Sphingobacterium multivorum is a gram negative bacillus that belongs to Flavobacteriaceae family and it is considered non-pathogenic. It has rarely been described as a cause of infections in humans, especially in hospital environment and in immunosuppressed patients. This case report is relevant for its unusual etiology and for the site affected, which may be the first case of septic arthritis described.
27446905	An LTR Retrotransposon-Derived Gene Displays Lineage-Specific Structural and Putative Species-Specific Functional Variations in Eutherians.	Amongst the 11 eutherian-specific genes acquired from a sushi-ichi retrotransposon is the CCHC type zinc-finger protein-encoding gene SIRH11/ZCCHC16. Its contribution to eutherian brain evolution is implied because of its involvement in cognitive function in mice, possibly via the noradrenergic system. Although, the possibility that Sirh11/Zcchc16 functions as a non-coding RNA still remains, dN/dS ratios in pairwise comparisons between its orthologs have provided supportive evidence that it acts as a protein. It became a pseudogene in armadillos (Cingulata) and sloths (Pilosa), the only two extant orders of xenarthra, which prompted us to examine the lineage-specific variations of SIRH11/ZCCHC16 in eutherians. We examined the predicted SIRH11/ZCCHC16 open reading frame (ORF) in 95 eutherian species based on the genomic DNA information in GenBank. A large variation in the SIRH11/ZCCHC16 ORF was detected in several lineages. These include a lack of a CCHC RNA-binding domain in its C-terminus, observed in gibbons (Hylobatidae: Primates) and megabats (Megachiroptera: Chiroptera). A lack of the N-terminal half, on the other hand, was observed in New World monkeys (Platyrrhini: Primates) and species belonging to New World and African Hystricognaths (Caviomorpha and Bathyergidae: Rodents) along with Cetacea and Ruminantia (Cetartiodactyla). Among the hominoids, interestingly, three out of four genera of gibbons have lost normal SIRH11/ZCCHC16 function by deletion or the lack of the CCHC RNA-binding domain. Our extensive dN/dS analysis suggests that such truncated SIRH11/ZCCHC16 ORFs are functionally diversified even within lineages. Combined, our results show that SIRH11/ZCCHC16 may contribute to the diversification of eutherians by lineage-specific structural changes after its domestication in the common eutherian ancestor, followed by putative species-specific functional changes that enhanced fitness and occurred as a consequence of complex natural selection events.
27103782	Prevalence of vitreomacular adhesion: an optical coherence tomography analysis in the retina clinic setting.	PURPOSE: The aims of this study were to determine the prevalence of vitreomacular adhesion (VMA) in a random sample of clinical patients at three US retina clinics and to assess comorbid retinal conditions, ocular diseases, prior treatment history, and other medical histories. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This observational, retrospective cohort study was based on patients from the Doheny Eye Centers, Duke Eye Center, and Tufts Medical Center who received a bilateral spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) scan (one scan/eye) for clinical evaluation with available medical records. The study had three phases: 1) collection of retrospective patient data; 2) review of OCT scans at a reading center to assess VMA and associated conditions; and 3) analyses and reporting of data on the prevalence of VMA, patient demographics, and comorbid conditions. Data were obtained from electronic health records and OCT grading forms. Outcome measures from bilateral SD-OCT scans and medical records included OCT evaluation of VMA and retinal comorbid conditions. RESULTS: In 719 patients with 1,483 reviewable OCT scans, the prevalence of VMA was estimated at 14.74% (90% CI, 12.58%-16.92%). The prevalence of unilateral VMA was estimated at 12.39%, while bilateral VMA was 2.36%. In patients with VMA, 34 out of 123 eyes with VMA (27.64%) also had fovea deformed by vitreomacular traction. Macular hole (MH) was significantly more prevalent in VMA-diagnosed eyes versus non-VMA-diagnosed eyes (6.5% versus 1.9%; P=0.02). There was a significantly higher incidence of full-thickness MH (P=0.008), operculum/flaps (P<0.0001), and lamellar or pseudo-holes (P=0.048) in VMA-diagnosed versus non-VMA-diagnosed eyes. Age, MH as a comorbid condition, full-thickness MH, lamellar or pseudo-holes, and operculum were predictive of a VMA diagnosis. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of VMA was estimated at 14.74% in a random sample of patients from three retina clinics. VMA diagnosis can be predicted by factors, including age, MH as a comorbid condition, and lamellar or pseudo-holes.
27618180	Adoptive Immunotherapy in Postoperative Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.	BACKGROUND: Adoptive immunotherapy (AI) has been applied in the treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients, but the value of postoperative AI has been inconclusive largely as a result of the small number of patients included in each study. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to address this issue for patients with postoperative NSCLC. METHODS: Pubmed, Embase, Cochrane Library were searched for randomized controlled trials comparing adoptive immunotherapy with control therapies in postoperative NSCLC patients. The primary endpoint was overall survival. Hazard ratio (HR) was estimated and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using a fixed-effect model. RESULTS: Compared with control therapies, analyses of 4 randomized controlled trials (472 patients) showed a significant benefit of adoptive immunotherapy on survival (hazard ratio [HR] 0.61, 95% CI 0.45-0.84, p = 0.002), and a 39% reduction in the relative risk of death (no evidence of a difference between trials; p = 0.16, I(2) = 42%). In subgroup analyses by treatment cycles and treatment regimen, significant OS benefit was found in combination therapy of AI with chemotherapy, regardless of whether or not the treatment cycles were more than 10 cycles. CONCLUSION: Adoptive immunotherapy has the potential to improve overall survival in postoperative NSCLC. The findings suggest this is a valid treatment option for these patients. Further randomized clinical trials are urgently needed.
27764234	Uncovering the Complex Transcriptome Response of Mytilus chilensis against Saxitoxin: Implications of Harmful Algal Blooms on Mussel Populations.	Saxitoxin (STX), a principal phycotoxin contributing to paralytic shellfish poisoning, is largely produced by marine microalgae of the genus Alexandrium. This toxin affects a wide range of species, inducing massive deaths in fish and other marine species. However, marine bivalves can resist and accumulate paralytic shellfish poisons. Despite numerous studies on the impact of STX in marine bivalves, knowledge regarding STX recognition at molecular level by benthic species remains scarce. Therefore, the aim of this study was to identify novel genes that interact with STX in the Chilean mussel Mytilus chilensis. For this, RNA-seq and RT-qPCR approaches were used to evaluate the transcriptomic response of M. chilensis to a purified STX as well as in vivo Alexandrium catenella exposure. Approximately 800 million reads were assembled, generating 138,883 contigs that were blasted against the UniProt Mollusca database. Pattern Recognition Receptors (PRRs) involved in mussel immunity, such as Toll-like receptors, tumor necrosis factor receptors, and scavenger-like receptors were found to be strongly upregulated at 8 and 16 h post-STX injection. These results suggest an involvement of PRRs in the response to STX, as well as identifying potential, novel STX-interacting receptors in this Chilean mussel. This study is the first transcriptomic overview of the STX-response in the edible species M. chilensis. However, the most significant contribution of this work is the identification of immune receptors and pathways potentially involved in the recognition and defense against STX's toxicity and its impact of harmful algae blooms on wild and cultivated mussel populations.
27176504	Herniation of the colon through the foramen of Winslow-A case report.	INTRODUCTION: Herniation of the bowel through the foramen of Winslow is a rare condition presenting with acute abdominal pain. Diagnostic delay often results in high morbidity and mortality. CASE PRESENTATION: A patient presented with right sided acute abdominal pain. Computed tomography showed herniation of the ascending colon through the foramen of Winslow which could be reversed laparoscopically without the need for bowel resection. There were no postoperative complications and no recurrences have occurred to date. DISCUSSION: Bowel herniation through the foramen of Winslow is very rare, comprising only 8% of all internal herniations. Historically, the majority of cases was diagnosed intra-operatively and bowel resection was necessary because of ischemia. With the introduction of computed tomography, the diagnosis can be made earlier, possibly resulting in a lower morbidity and mortality rate. CONCLUSION: Herniation through the foramen of Winslow is a rare condition. Patients will present with sudden onset abdominal pain. Early imaging helps to recognize the diagnosis and could prevent bowel ischemia.
27446902	HIV Status Disclosure through Family-Based Intervention Supports Parenting and Child Mental Health in Rwanda.	INTRODUCTION: Few evidence-based interventions exist to support parenting and child mental health during the process of caregiver HIV status disclosure in sub-Saharan Africa. A secondary analysis of a randomized-controlled trial was conducted to examine the role of family-based intervention versus usual social work care (care as usual) in supporting HIV status disclosure within families in Rwanda. METHOD: Approximately 40 households were randomized to family-based intervention and 40 households to care as usual. Parenting, family unity, and child mental health during the process of disclosure were studied using quantitative and qualitative research methods. RESULTS: Many of the families had at least one caregiver who had not disclosed their HIV status at baseline. Immediately post-intervention, children reported lower parenting and family unity scores compared with those in the usual-care group. These changes resolved at 3-month follow-up. Qualitative reports from clinical counselor intervention sessions described supported parenting during disclosure. Overall findings suggest adjustments in parenting, family unity, and trust surrounding the disclosure process. CONCLUSION: Family-based intervention may support parenting and promote child mental health during adjustment to caregiver HIV status disclosure. Further investigation is required to examine the role of family-based intervention in supporting parenting and promoting child mental health in HIV status disclosure.
27101396	Incidence and Estimated Prevalence of Endometriosis and Adenomyosis in Northeast Italy: A Data Linkage Study.	Despite being quite frequent and having serious implications in terms of symptomatology and fertility, data on incidence and prevalence of endometriosis and adenomyosis following gold standard definitions are dramatically lacking. The average time from onset of symptoms to diagnosis in industrialized countries still ranges from five to ten years. Using the regional centralized data linkage system, we calculated incidence and prevalence of endometriosis and adenomyosis in the female population of Friuli Venezia Giulia region, Italy, for the years 2011-2013. Cases were defined as new diagnoses from hospital discharge records, following procedures allowing direct visualization for endometriosis and hysterectomy for adenomyosis, with or without histological confirmation. Diagnoses were considered "new" after verifying women had not been diagnosed in the previous ten years. Incidence of endometriosis and adenomyosis in women aged 15-50 years is 0.14%. Prevalence, estimated from incidence, is 2.00%. Adenomyosis, representing 28% of all diagnoses, becomes increasingly prevalent after the age of 50 years. Our results shows how the study of both endometriosis and adenomyosis should not be limited to women of premenopausal age. Further efforts are needed to sensitize women and health professional, and to find new data linkage possibilities to identify undiagnosed cases.
27242478	Reduced Volume of the Arcuate Fasciculus in Adults with High-Functioning Autism Spectrum Conditions.	Atypical language is a fundamental feature of autism spectrum conditions (ASC), but few studies have examined the structural integrity of the arcuate fasciculus, the major white matter tract connecting frontal and temporal language regions, which is usually implicated as the main transfer route used in processing linguistic information by the brain. Abnormalities in the arcuate have been reported in young children with ASC, mostly in low-functioning or non-verbal individuals, but little is known regarding the structural properties of the arcuate in adults with ASC or, in particular, in individuals with ASC who have intact language, such as those with high-functioning autism or Asperger syndrome. We used probabilistic tractography of diffusion-weighted imaging to isolate and scrutinize the arcuate in a mixed-gender sample of 18 high-functioning adults with ASC (17 Asperger syndrome) and 14 age- and IQ-matched typically developing controls. Arcuate volume was significantly reduced bilaterally with clearest differences in the right hemisphere. This finding remained significant in an analysis of all male participants alone. Volumetric reduction in the arcuate was significantly correlated with the severity of autistic symptoms as measured by the Autism-Spectrum Quotient. These data reveal that structural differences are present even in high-functioning adults with ASC, who presented with no clinically manifest language deficits and had no reported developmental language delay. Arcuate structural integrity may be useful as an index of ASC severity and thus as a predictor and biomarker for ASC. Implications for future research are discussed.
27026878	Potential problems and recommendations regarding substitution of generic antiepileptic drugs: a systematic review of literature.	Despite the availability of generic antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), still patients and neurologists hesitate to make a switch due to assorted reasons. The objectives of this review were to evaluate the risks associated with the generic substitution of AEDs. In this context, we also summarized the recommendations of various international societies to treat epileptic patients. We used a number of electronic databases to identify the relevant published studies which demonstrated the potential problems and recommendations regarding generic substitution of AEDs. Of 204 articles found initially, 153 were selected for additional review. Subsequently, 68 articles were finally selected. This review concluded that potential problems linked with the generic substitution of AEDs could be bioequivalence issues, failure of drug therapy, emergence of adverse events and increase in the frequency of seizures. The reasons could be the pharmacokinetics properties of AEDs and unique characteristics of some epilepsy patients. Consequently, the generic substitution of AEDs affects the successful treatment and quality of life of the patients. Various guidelines recommend the well-controlled epileptic patients to avoid switching from brand-to-generic products, generic-to-brand products or generic to some other generic products.
27441638	Potentiation of LPS-Induced Apoptotic Cell Death in Human Hepatoma HepG2 Cells by Aspirin via ROS and Mitochondrial Dysfunction: Protection by N-Acetyl Cysteine.	Cytotoxicity and inflammation-associated toxic responses have been observed to be induced by bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS) in vitro and in vivo respectively. Use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as aspirin, has been reported to be beneficial in inflammation-associated diseases like cancer, diabetes and cardiovascular disorders. Their precise molecular mechanisms, however, are not clearly understood. Our previous studies on aspirin treated HepG2 cells strongly suggest cell cycle arrest and induction of apoptosis associated with mitochondrial dysfunction. In the present study, we have further demonstrated that HepG2 cells treated with LPS alone or in combination with aspirin induces subcellular toxic responses which are accompanied by increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, oxidative stress, mitochondrial respiratory dysfunction and apoptosis. The LPS/Aspirin induced toxicity was attenuated by pre-treatment of cells with N-acetyl cysteine (NAC). Alterations in oxidative stress and glutathione-dependent redox-homeostasis were more pronounced in mitochondria compared to extra- mitochondrial cellular compartments. Pre-treatment of HepG2 cells with NAC exhibited a selective protection in redox homeostasis and mitochondrial dysfunction. Our results suggest that the altered redox metabolism, oxidative stress and mitochondrial function in HepG2 cells play a critical role in LPS/aspirin-induced cytotoxicity. These results may help in better understanding the pharmacological, toxicological and therapeutic properties of NSAIDs in cancer cells exposed to bacterial endotoxins.
27563518	Fullerenes synthesis by combined resistive heating and arc discharge techniques.	The two main electrode techniques for fullerenes production; the direct arc technique and the resistive heating of graphite rod were employed in this work. One of the electrodes was resistively heated to high temperature and subjected to arc discharge along its length by the second graphite rod. Fullerenes solid were extracted from carbon soot samples collected from an installed arc discharge system using the solvent extraction method. The fullerenes solid obtained from carbon soot collected for 2 min of arc discharge run when one of the electrodes was resistively heated at different voltages all gave higher yields (maximum of 67 % higher, at 150 A arc current and 200 Torr chamber pressure) compared to when no resistive heating was carried out. Scanning electron microscopy and ultraviolet visible spectroscopy analysis carried out on all fullerenes solid indicated the presence of fullerenes. The enhancement of fullerenes production by combined resistive and direct arc techniques shows prospect for possible use at industrial level for large scale production.
26977400	Network analysis of functional brain connectivity in borderline personality disorder using resting-state fMRI.	Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is associated with symptoms such as affect dysregulation, impaired sense of self, and self-harm behaviors. Neuroimaging research on BPD has revealed structural and functional abnormalities in specific brain regions and connections. However, little is known about the topological organizations of brain networks in BPD. We collected resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from 20 patients with BPD and 10 healthy controls, and constructed frequency-specific functional brain networks by correlating wavelet-filtered fMRI signals from 82 cortical and subcortical regions. We employed graph-theory based complex network analysis to investigate the topological properties of the brain networks, and employed network-based statistic to identify functional dysconnections in patients. In the 0.03-0.06 Hz frequency band, compared to controls, patients with BPD showed significantly larger measures of global network topology, including the size of largest connected graph component, clustering coefficient, small-worldness, and local efficiency, indicating increased local cliquishness of the functional brain network. Compared to controls, patients showed lower nodal centrality at several hub nodes but greater centrality at several non-hub nodes in the network. Furthermore, an interconnected subnetwork in 0.03-0.06 Hz frequency band was identified that showed significantly lower connectivity in patients. The links in the subnetwork were mainly long-distance connections between regions located at different lobes; and the mean connectivity of this subnetwork was negatively correlated with the increased global topology measures. Lastly, the key network measures showed high correlations with several clinical symptom scores, and classified BPD patients against healthy controls with high accuracy based on linear discriminant analysis. The abnormal topological properties and connectivity found in this study may add new knowledge to the current understanding of functional brain networks in BPD. However, due to limitation of small sample sizes, the results of the current study should be viewed as exploratory and need to be validated on large samples in future works.
27625666	Genome-Wide Identification and Expression Analysis of the Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Gene Family in Cassava.	Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) play central roles in plant developmental processes, hormone signaling transduction, and responses to abiotic stress. However, no data are currently available about the MAPK family in cassava, an important tropical crop. Herein, 21 MeMAPK genes were identified from cassava. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that MeMAPKs could be classified into four subfamilies. Gene structure analysis demonstrated that the number of introns in MeMAPK genes ranged from 1 to 10, suggesting large variation among cassava MAPK genes. Conserved motif analysis indicated that all MeMAPKs had typical protein kinase domains. Transcriptomic analysis suggested that MeMAPK genes showed differential expression patterns in distinct tissues and in response to drought stress between wild subspecies and cultivated varieties. Interaction networks and co-expression analyses revealed that crucial pathways controlled by MeMAPK networks may be involved in the differential response to drought stress in different accessions of cassava. Expression of nine selected MAPK genes showed that these genes could comprehensively respond to osmotic, salt, cold, oxidative stressors, and abscisic acid (ABA) signaling. These findings yield new insights into the transcriptional control of MAPK gene expression, provide an improved understanding of abiotic stress responses and signaling transduction in cassava, and lead to potential applications in the genetic improvement of cassava cultivars.
27617374	Pink Spot - Literature Review and Case Report.	BACKGROUND: Pink spots in teeth were first described by Mummery in 1920, and were related to resorption. Resorption is a pathologic process that often eludes the clinician with its varied etiologic factors and diverse clinical presentations. Resorption can be generally classified as internal and external resorption. Internal resorption has been described as a rare occurrence as compared to external resorption. CASE REPORT: This article describes a pink spot that was diagnosed as a progressing resorption process. Early diagnosis enabled a successful management of the lesion. CONCLUSION: Early diagnosis and treatment of an internal resorption, clinically seen as a pink spot, in a primary central incisor may prevent its fast progress and subsequent loss.
27506717	Amino Acid Metabolomics Using LC-MS/MS: Assessment of Cancer-Cell Resistance in a Simulated Tumor Microenvironment.	We performed a comprehensive quantification of 20 amino acids in RPMI 1640 medium-cultured human colorectal adenocarcinoma cells to evaluate the efficacy of 5-fluorouracil treatment under hypoxic and hypoglycemic conditions, which mimic the tumor microenvironment. In this study, we developed a simple and comprehensive analytical method by using LC-MS/MS connected to the Intrada amino acid column, which eluted amino acids within 9 min. The present method covered a linearity range of 3.6 - 1818 muM, except for Gly (227 - 1818 muM), Ala, Asp, His (7.1 - 1818 muM each), and Trp (3.6 - 909 muM). The limits of detection were in the range of 0.02 - 38.0 pmol per injection in a standard solution. Amino acid concentration data were analyzed using principal-component analysis to represent samples on two-dimensional graphs. Linear discriminant analysis was used to classify samples on the score plots. Using this approach, the effect of 5-fluorouracil treatment could be successfully discriminated at high discrimination rates. Moreover, several amino acids were extracted from corresponding loading plots as candidate markers for distinguishing the effects of the 5-fluorouracil treatment or tumor microenvironmental conditions. These results suggest that our proposed method might be a useful tool for evaluating the efficacy of anticancer drugs in the tumor microenvironment.
27802314	Detection, Prevalence and Phylogenetic Relationships of Demodex spp and further Skin Prostigmata Mites (Acari, Arachnida) in Wild and Domestic Mammals.	This study was conceived to detect skin mites in social mammals through real-time qPCR, and to estimate taxonomic Demodex and further Prostigmata mite relationships in different host species by comparing sequences from two genes: mitochondrial 16S rRNA and nuclear 18S rRNA. We determined the mite prevalence in the hair follicles of marmots (13%) and bats (17%). The high prevalence found in marmots and bats by sampling only one site on the body may indicate that mites are common inhabitants of their skin. Since we found three different mites (Neuchelacheles sp, Myobia sp and Penthaleus sp) in three bat species (Miotis yumanensis, Miotis californicus and Corynorhinus townsendii) and two different mites (both inferred to be members of the Prostigmata order) in one marmot species (Marmota flaviventris), we tentatively concluded that these skin mites 1) cannot be assigned to the same genus based only on a common host, and 2) seem to evolve according to the specific habitat and/or specific hair and sebaceous gland of the mammalian host. Moreover, two M. yumanensis bats harbored identical Neuchelacheles mites, indicating the possibility of interspecific cross-infection within a colony. However, some skin mites species are less restricted by host species than previously thought. Specifically, Demodex canis seems to be more transmissible across species than other skin mites. D. canis have been found mostly in dogs but also in cats and captive bats. In addition, we report the first case of D. canis infestation in a domestic ferret (Mustela putorius). All these mammalian hosts are related to human activities, and D. canis evolution may be a consequence of this relationship. The monophyletic Demodex clade showing closely related dog and human Demodex sequences also supports this likely hypothesis.
27259331	Immunotherapy of Colorectal Cancer.	It is known that the immune response, reflected by high T cell infiltrates in primary tumors and metastases, influences the clinical course of colorectal cancer (CRC). Therefore, immunotherapy concepts have been adapted from other tumor entities, which typically rely on the activation of T cells in the tumor microenvironment (e.g. blockade of the immune checkpoint molecules PD-1 and CTLA-4). However, most of the strategies using the approved checkpoint inhibitors and/or combination strategies have more or less failed to produce impressive results in early phase trials in CRC. Therefore, a number of novel targets for checkpoint inhibition are currently in early phase clinical testing (TIM-3, Lag-3, OX40, GITR, 4-1BB, CD40, CD70). A simple activation of infiltrating T cells will not, however, lead to a meaningful anti-tumor response without modulating the environmental factors in CRC. Thus, it is absolutely necessary to improve our understanding of the complex regulation of the tumor microenvironment in CRC to design individual combination treatments leading to effective immune control.
27651844	Are Temporal Differences in GDNF and NOS Isoform Induction Contributors to Neurodegeneration? A Fluorescence Microscopy-Based Study.	BACKGROUND: Specific factors in Parkinson's disease have become targets as to their protective and degenerative effects. We have demonstrated that cytokines and PD-CSF detrimentally affect microglia and astrocyte growth. While glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) has been recognized as a possible neuron-rescue agent, nitric oxide synthase (NOS) has been implicated in neurodegenerative processes. OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate that glial cell activation, cytokine production, and NOS induction, play an intimate role in the loss of dopaminergic signaling, via mechanisms that are a result of inflammation and inflammatory stimuli. METHODS: Study animals were sacrificed following endotoxin treatment and tissue sections were harvested and probed for GDNF and NOS isomers by fluorescence deconvolution microscopy. Fluorescence was mapped and quantified for each probe. RESULTS: An immune cell influx into 'vulnerable' areas of the brain was seen, and three NOS isomers, inducible (iNOS), neuronal (nNOS) and endothelial (eNOS), were synthesized in the brains, a finding which suggests that each isomer has a role in neurodegeneration. eNOS was found associated with blood vessels, while iNOS was associated with glial and matrix cells and nNOS was located with both glia and neurons. Following endotoxin treatment, serum levels of nitric oxide were higher at 6-8 hours, while tissue levels of NOS were elevated for much longer. Thus, induction of NOS occurred earlier than the induction of GDNF. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that the protective abilities of GDNF to combat neural destruction are not available rapidly enough, and do not remain at sufficiently high levels long enough to assert its protective effects.

27058342	[Cutaneous larva migrans: report of three cases from the Western Black Sea Region, Turkey].	Cutaneous larva migrans (CLM) is a parasitosis frequently seen in persons who have travelled to tropical or subtropical regions and in those who have worked in contact with soil. The disease frequently develops due to Ancylostoma braziliensis and Ancylostoma caninum species. After penetrating the skin and entering the body, the hookworm larva proceeds to bore tunnels through the epidermis, creating pruritic, erythematous, serpiginous lesions. Secondary bacterial infections of the lesions can often be seen, especially on the legs and buttocks. In this article we presented three atypical local cases which have not been declared previously in our country. The first case, a 54-year-old male who was admitted to hospital in August with complaints of an obverse body rash and itching lasting for a week. Eruptions were observed over a small area on the right side of the abdomen, consisting of itchy, raised, erythematous, curvilinear string-like lesions. Moreover, no eosinophilia was detected in the patient, whose culture showed a growth of Streptococcus pyogenes. The patient was clinically diagnosed with CLM accompanied by secondary bacterial infection and treated for three days with 1 g of amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, mupirocin cream and albendazole 400 mg/d. Under this regime, the lesions were seen to decline. The second case, a 38-year-old male was also admitted in August, complaining of itching and redness on his body. The patient, whose blood count values were normal, exhibited itchy, raised, serpiginous string-like lesions located on the left side of his body. The patient, whose bacterial culture was negative, was clinically diagnosed as CLM and treated for three days with albendazole 400 mg/d and the lesions were seen to improve. The third case, a 23-year old male was admitted in September complaining of itching and redness on his neck. An itchy, crescent-shaped erythematous lesion was detected on his neck; bacteriological cultures and blood count were normal. The common feature for all three cases was the story of working in a hazelnut orchard and mowing weeds using a motorized string trimmer (weed whacker). None of them had a history of travel outside the country. Therefore CLM assumed to be occurred due to the aeration of surface earth layer with the force of motorized string trimmer and entrance of the larvae were from the open parts of the body. In conclusion, it should be keep in mind that hookworm larva-related CLM can be encountered in our country, and reporting of the patients with similar findings are necessary to determine the prevalence of this parasitosis in our country.
27671818	Therapeutic Potential and Molecular Targets of Piceatannol in Chronic Diseases.	Piceatannol (3,3',4,5'-tetrahydroxy-trans-stilbene; PIC) is a naturally occurring stilbene present in diverse plant sources. PIC is a hydroxylated analog of resveratrol and produced from resveratrol by microsomal cytochrome P450 1A11/2 and 1B1 activities. Like resveratrol, PIC has a broad spectrum of health beneficial effects, many of which are attributable to its antioxidative and anti-inflammatory activities. PIC exerts anticarcinogenic effects by targeting specific proteins involved in regulating cancer cell proliferation, survival/death, invasion, metastasis, angiogenesis, etc. in tumor microenvironment. PIC also has other health promoting and disease preventing functions, such as anti-obese, antidiabetic, neuroptotective, cardioprotective, anti-allergic, anti-aging properties. This review outlines the principal biological activities of PIC and underlying mechanisms with special focus on intracellular signaling molecules/pathways involved.
26998341	Maternal stress-associated cortisol stimulation may protect embryos from cortisol excess in zebrafish.	Abnormal embryo cortisol level causes developmental defects and poor survival in zebrafish (Danio rerio). However, no study has demonstrated that maternal stress leads to higher embryo cortisol content in zebrafish. We tested the hypothesis that maternal stress-associated elevation in cortisol levels increases embryo cortisol content in this asynchronous breeder. Zebrafish mothers were fed cortisol-spiked food for 5 days, to mimic maternal stress, followed by daily breeding for 10 days to monitor temporal embryo cortisol content. Cortisol treatment increased mean embryo yield, but the daily fecundity was variable among the groups. Embryo cortisol content was variable in both groups over a 10-day period. A transient elevation in cortisol levels was observed in the embryos from cortisol-fed mothers only on day 3, but not on subsequent days. We tested whether excess cortisol stimulates 11betaHSD2 expression in ovarian follicles as a means to regulate embryo cortisol deposition. Cortisol treatment in vitro increased 11beta HSD2 levels sevenfold, and this expression was regulated by actinomycin D and cycloheximide suggesting tight regulation of cortisol levels in the ovarian follicles. We hypothesize that cortisol-induced upregulation of 11betaHSD2 activity in the ovarian follicles is a mechanism restricting excess cortisol incorporation into the eggs during maternal stress.
27965967	Physiological and Behavioral Responses of Dairy Cattle to the Introduction of Robot Scrapers.	Autonomous mobile robot scrapers are increasingly used in order to clean the floors on dairy farms. Given the complexity of robot scraper operation, stress may occur in cows due to unpredictability of the situation. Experiencing stress can impair animal welfare and, in the long term, the health and milk production of the cows. Therefore, this study addressed potential stress responses of dairy cattle to the robot scraper after introducing the autonomous mobile machine. Thirty-six cows in total were studied on three different farms to explore possible modifications in cardiac function, behavior, and adrenocortical activity. The research protocol on each farm consisted of four experimental periods including one baseline measurement without robot scraper operation followed by three test measurements, in which cows interacted with the robotic cleaning system. Interbeat intervals were recorded in order to calculate the heart rate variability (HRV) parameter RMSSD; behavior was observed to determine time budgets; and fecal samples were collected for analysis of the cortisol metabolites concentration. A statistical analysis was carried out using linear mixed-effects models. HRV decline immediately after the introduction of the robot scraper and modified behavior in the subsequent experimental periods indicated a stress response. The cortisol metabolites concentration remained constant. It is hypothesized that after the initial phase of decrease, HRV stabilized through the behavioral adjustments of the cows in the second part of the study. Persistent alterations in behavior gave rise to the assumption that the animals' habituation process to the robot scraper was not yet completed. In summary, the present study illustrated that the cows showed minor signs of disturbance toward the robotic cleaning system. Thus, our findings suggest that dairy cattle can largely adjust their behavior to avoid aversive effects on animal welfare. Additional research can provide further insight into the development of the animal-machine interaction beyond the initial phase of robot scraper operation considered in this study.
27833986	Dermal plexiform spindle cell lipoma.	Spindle cell lipoma located in the dermis is uncommon. The plexiform variant of this tumor is rare. In fact, only six cases of this variant have been described previously. We report herein a case of dermal plexiform spindle cell lipoma with prominent myxoid matrix. A 47-year-old male patient presented with a solitary, 2.2 cm-cutaneous mass in the right buttock region that had slowly increased in size for over one year. The dermal lesion was characterized by a mixture of mature adipocytes, spindle shaped cells and inconspicuous ropey collagen bundles in a mucinous background. This lesion showed a fascicular and plexiform pattern with adipocytes irregularly arranged, predominant in the depth of the lesion. Immunohistochemically, the spindle cells were positive for CD34, factor XIIIa, and vimentin, and negative for retinoblastoma protein, claudin-1, GLUT-1, epithelial membrane antigen, neurofilament protein, and Sox-10. S100 protein stained a thinned cytoplasmic rim of mature adipocytes and labeled about 25% of spindle cells in the most superficial areas. A review of the seven cases published, including the present report, revealed that there were five females and two males. Most cases located in the thigh-groin-buttock area. The age of the patients ranged from 32 to 58 years with a mean of 45.7 years. Clinical diagnosis suggested a lipomatous or neural tumor in six cases. The main differential diagnosis includes dermal intraneural plexiform neurofibroma and purely intradermal monophasic plexiform spindle cell nevus.
27719872	Psychologic treatment of functional neurologic disorders.	The management of patients with functional neurologic disorders poses many challenges. Psychologic treatments may well start at the point of delivery of the diagnosis, when careful explanations about the nature of the disorder have to be given to the patient and possibly also relatives/carers. Different conceptual models may assist in explaining the factors underlying the presentation, two of which (functional and dissociative) are briefly outlined here. The challenges for neurologists and psychiatrists of delivering a psychologic formulation as part of the diagnosis delivery are considered, along with the importance of clear communication between professionals involved in the patient's care. Existing literature on treatments incorporating psychologic components suggests that, despite limitations in the study designs and the potential bias in some outcome evaluations, there is evidence to support the use of psychologic interventions for at least some functional neurologic disorders, although larger and better-designed studies are required in this area.
27486444	The Resilience of Microbial Community under Drying and Rewetting Cycles of Three Forest Soils.	Forest soil ecosystems are associated with large pools and fluxes of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N), which could be strongly affected by variation in rainfall events under current climate change. Understanding how dry and wet cycle events might influence the metabolic state of indigenous soil microbes is crucial for predicting forest soil responses to environmental change. We used 454 pyrosequencing and quantitative PCR to address how present (DNA-based) and potentially active (RNA-based) soil bacterial communities might response to the changes in water availability across three different forest types located in two continents (Africa and Asia) under controlled drying and rewetting cycles. Sequencing of rRNA gene and transcript indicated that Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Acidobacteria were the most responsive phyla to changes in water availability. We defined the ratio of rRNA transcript to rRNA gene abundance as a key indicator of potential microbial activity and we found that this ratio was increased following soil dry-down process whereas it decreased after soil rewetting. Following rewetting Crenarchaeota-like 16S rRNA gene transcript increased in some forest soils and this was linked to increases in soil nitrate levels suggesting greater nitrification rates under higher soil water availability. Changes in the relative abundance of (1) different microbial phyla and classes, and (2) 16S and amoA genes were found to be site- and taxa-specific and might have been driven by different life-strategies. Overall, we found that, after rewetting, the structure of the present and potentially active bacterial community structure as well as the abundance of bacterial (16S), archaeal (16S) and ammonia oxidizers (amoA), all returned to pre-dry-down levels. This suggests that microbial taxa have the ability to recover from desiccation, a critical response, which will contribute to maintaining microbial biodiversity in harsh ecosystems under environmental perturbations, such as significant changes in water availability.
27253377	Particle Physics in High School: A Diagnose Study.	The science learning process improves when the contents are connected to students' lives. Particle physics has had a great impact in our society in the last years and has changed the theoretical picture about matter fundamental dynamics. Thus, we think that academic contents about matter components and interactions should be updated. With this study we aim to characterize the level of knowledge of high school students about this topic. We built a test with questions about classical atomic models, particle physics, recent discoveries, social implications and students opinions about it. Contrary to our first suspicion, students' answers show a high variability. They have new physics ideas and show a great interest towards modern concepts. We suggest including an updated view of this topic as part of the curriculum.
26833089	Cause and Consequence of Tethering a SubTAD to Different Nuclear Compartments.	Detailed genomic contact maps have revealed that chromosomes are structurally organized in megabase-sized topologically associated domains (TADs) that encompass smaller subTADs. These domains segregate in the nuclear space to form active and inactive nuclear compartments, but cause and consequence of compartmentalization are largely unknown. Here, we combined lacO/lacR binding platforms with allele-specific 4C technologies to track their precise position in the three-dimensional genome upon recruitment of NANOG, SUV39H1, or EZH2. We observed locked genomic loci resistant to spatial repositioning and unlocked loci that could be repositioned to different nuclear subcompartments with distinct chromatin signatures. Focal protein recruitment caused the entire subTAD, but not surrounding regions, to engage in new genomic contacts. Compartment switching was found uncoupled from transcription changes, and the enzymatic modification of histones per se was insufficient for repositioning. Collectively, this suggests that trans-associated factors influence three-dimensional compartmentalization independent of their cis effect on local chromatin composition and activity.
26965781	Melanocortin-4 receptor rs17782313 polymorphisms are associated with serum triglycerides in older Chinese women.	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: MC4R (melanocortin-4 receptor) gene polymorphisms have been associated with serum triglycerides (TG) in Caucasians and Japanese, but no reports are available Chinese. The purpose of this study was to find whether there was an association of rs17782313 polymorphisms at the MC4R gene with serum TG in elderly Chinese. METHODS AND STUDY DESIGN: 2,012 over 40 years participated in a cross-sectional study in which their body mass index (BMI), TG, high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C), and MC4R rs17782313 polymorphisms were determined. RESULTS: For women, carriers of the T/T genotype had significantly lower serum TG than those with C/C genotype (p=0.006). Carriers of the C/C genotype of this polymorphisms exhibited significantly lower fasting HDL-C levels compared with T/T and T/C genotypes (p=0.025), and increased glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) (p=0.043), but no change in blood pressure. Higher serum TG in carriers of the C/C genotype of MC4R gene remained stable after adjustment for age, smoking, drinking, BMI, waist circumference (WC) and three or more components of the metabolic syndrome (MS) by multivariable linear regression (p=0.01) in women. The carriers of the C/C genotype of MC4R gene showed significantly greater odds ratio for TG than T/C and T/T genotypes, even when adjusted for age, smoking, drinking, BMI and WC in women. CONCLUSIONS: The rs17782313 C/C genotype is associated with higher TG levels in older Chinese women.
27115139	Long-Term Health-Related Quality of Life in German Patients with Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis in Comparison to German General Population.	OBJECTIVE: Aims of the study were to investigate health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in adult patients with former diagnosis of Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA), to compare their HRQOL with the general population and to identify factors related to a poor outcome. METHODS: In 2012, a cross-sectional survey was performed by mailing a questionnaire to a large cohort of former and current patients of the German Centre for Rheumatology in Children and Adolescents. Only adult patients (>/=18 years) with a diagnosis compatible with JIA were included (n = 2592; response 66%). The questionnaire included information about HRQOL (EQ5D), disease-related questions and socio-demographics. Prevalence and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of problems with mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain and anxiety/depression were standardized to the German general population. Factors associated with low HRQOL in JIA patients were identified using logistic regression models. RESULTS: Sixty-two percent of the study population was female; age range was 18-73 years. In all dimensions, JIA patients reported statistically significantly more problems than the general population with largest differences in the pain dimension (JIA patients 56%; 95%CI 55-58%; general population 28%; 26-29%) and the anxiety/depression dimension (28%; 27-29% vs. 4%; 4-5%). Lower HRQOL in JIA patients was associated with female sex, older age, lower level of education, still being under rheumatic treatment and disability. CONCLUSIONS: HRQOL in adult JIA patients is considerably lower than in the general population. As this cohort includes historic patients the new therapeutic schemes available today are expected to improve HRQOL in future.
26838917	Differential pulse voltammetric determination of nanomolar concentrations of antiviral drug acyclovir at polymer film modified glassy carbon electrode.	An electrochemical sensor for the sensitive detection of acyclovir was developed by the electropolymerization of Eriochrome black T at a pretreated glassy carbon electrode. The surface morphology of the modified electrode was characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy. Under the optimized conditions, a significant electrochemical improvement was observed toward the electrooxidation of acyclovir on the modified electrode surface relative to the unmodified electrode. The detection limit of 12 nM and two linear calibration ranges of 0.03-0.3 muM and 0.3-1.5 muM were obtained for acyclovir determination using a differential pulse voltammetric method in acetate buffer (0.1 M, pH 4.0). Real sample studies were carried out in human blood serum and pharmaceutical formulations, which offered good recovery (98-102%). The electrode showed excellent reproducibility, selectivity and antifouling effects.
27150550	Microstructural and micromechanical tests of titanium biomaterials intended for prosthetic reconstructions.	PURPOSE: The aim of the present paper was a question of structural identification and evaluation of strength parameters of Titanium (Ticp - grade 2) and its alloy (Ti6Al4V) which are used to serve as a base for those permanent prosthetic supplements which are later manufactured employing CAD/CAM systems. METHODS: Microstructural tests of Ticp and Ti6Al4V were conducted using an optical microscope as well as a scanning microscope. Hardness was measured with the Vickers method. Micromechanical properties of samples: microhardness and Young's modulus value, were measured with the Oliver and Pharr method. RESULTS: Based on studies using optical microscopy it was observed that the Ticp from the milling technology had a single phase, granular microstructure. The Ti64 alloy had a two-phase, fine-grained microstructure with an acicular-lamellar character. The results of scanning tests show that titanium Ticp had a single phase structure. On its grain there was visible acicular martensite. The structure of the two phase Ti64 alloy consists of a beta matrix as well as released alpha phase deposits in the shape of extended needles. Micromechanical tests demonstrated that the alloy of Ti64 in both methods showed twice as high the microhardness as Ticp. In studies of Young's modulus of Ti64 alloy DMLS technology have lower value than titanium milling technology. CONCLUSIONS: According to the results obtained, the following conclusion has been drawn: when strength aspect is discussed, the DMLS method is a preferred one in manufacturing load structures in dentistry and may be an alternate way for the CAD/CAM system used in decrement processing.
27463099	The IRIDICA PCR/Electrospray Ionization-Mass Spectrometry Assay on Bronchoalveolar Lavage for Bacterial Etiology in Mechanically Ventilated Patients with Suspected Pneumonia.	We studied the diagnostic performance of the IRIDICA PCR/electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (PCR/ESI-MS) assay applied on bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples, from 51 mechanically ventilated patients with suspected pneumonia, in a prospective study. In 32 patients with X-ray verified pneumonia, PCR/ESI-MS was positive in 66% and BAL culture was positive in 38% (p = 0.045), and either of the methods was positive in 69%. The following BAL result combinations were noted: PCR/ESI-MS+/culture+, 34%; PCR/ESI-MS+/culture-, 31%; PCR/ESI-MS-/culture+, 3.1%; PCR/ESI-MS-/culture-, 31%; kappa 0.36 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.10-0.63). In pneumonia patients without prior antibiotic treatment, optimal agreement was noted with 88% PCR/ESI-MS+/culture+ and 12% PCR/ESI-MS-/culture- (kappa 1.0). However, in patients with prior antibiotic treatment, the test agreement was poor (kappa 0.16; 95% CI, -0.10-0.44), as 10 patients were PCR/ESI-MS+/culture-. In 8/10 patients the pathogens detected by PCR/ESI-MS could be detected by other conventional tests or PCR tests on BAL. Compared with BAL culture, PCR/ESI-MS showed specificities and negative predictive values of >/=87% for all individual pathogens, an overall sensitivity of 77% and positive predictive value (PPV) of 42%. When other conventional tests and PCR tests were added to the reference standard, the overall PPV increased to 87%. The PCR/ESI-MS semi-quantitative level tended to be higher for PCR/ESI-MS positive cases with pneumonia compared with cases without pneumonia (p = 0.074). In conclusion, PCR/ESI-MS applied on BAL showed a promising performance and has potential to be clinically useful in mechanically ventilated patients with suspected pneumonia. The usefulness of the method for establishment of pneumonia etiology and selection of antibiotic therapy should be further studied.
26967474	Gorab Is Required for Dermal Condensate Cells to Respond to Hedgehog Signals during Hair Follicle Morphogenesis.	GORAB is a golgin that localizes predominantly at the Golgi apparatus and physically interacts with small guanosine triphosphatases. GORAB is ubiquitously expressed in mammalian tissues, including the skin. However, the biological function of this golgin in skin is unknown. Here, we report that disrupting the expression of the Gorab gene in mice results in hair follicle morphogenesis defects that were characterized by impaired follicular keratinocyte differentiation. This hair follicle phenotype was associated with markedly suppressed hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway in dermal condensates in vivo. Gorab-deficient dermal mesenchymal cells also displayed a significantly reduced capability to respond to Hh pathway activation in vitro. Furthermore, we found that the formation of the primary cilium, a cellular organelle that is essential for the Hh pathway, was impaired in mutant dermal condensate cells, suggesting that Gorab may be required for the Hh pathway through facilitating the formation of primary cilia. Thus, data obtained from this study provided insight into the biological functions of Gorab during embryonic morphogenesis of the skin in which Hh signaling and primary cilia exert important functions.
27696257	Epigenetics in Multiple Myeloma.	Multiple myeloma is characterized by clonal proliferation of plasma cells within the bone marrow resulting in anemia, lytic bone lesions, hypercalcemia, and renal impairment. Despite advanced in our understanding of this complex disease in recent years, it is still considered an incurable malignancy. This is, in part, due to the highly heterogenous genomic and phenotypic nature of the disease, which is to date incompletely understood. It is clear that a deeper level of knowledge of the biological events underlying the development of these diseases is needed to identify new targets and generate effective novel therapies. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), which are single strand, 20-nucleotide, noncoding RNA's, are key regulators of gene expression and have been reported to exert transcriptional control in multiple myeloma. miRNAs are now recognized to play a role in many key areas such as cellular proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis and stress response. Substantial advances have been made in recent years in terms of our understanding of the biological role of miRNAs in a diverse range of hematological and solid malignancues, In multiple myeloma these advances have yielded new information of prognostic and diagnostic relevance which have helped to shed light on epigenetic regulation in this disease.
27070240	Expressional and Bioinformatic Analysis of Bovine Filia/Ecat1/Khdc3l Gene: A Comparison with Ovine Species.	Maternal effect genes have highly impressive effects on pre-implantation development. Filia/Ecat1/Khdc3l is a maternal effect gene found in mouse oocytes and embryos, loss of which causes a 50% decrease in fertility. In the present study, we investigated Filia mRNA expression in bovine oviduct, 30- to 40-day fetus, liver, heart, lung, and oocytes (as a positive control), by RT-PCR and detected it only in oocytes. A 443 bp fragment was amplified only in oocytes and was sequenced as a part of bovine predicted Filia mRNA. We analyzed bovine and ovine Filia N-terminal peptide sequence in PHYRE2, and a KH domain was predicted. Protein alignment using ClustalW indicated a highly identical N-terminal extention between the 2 species. Immunohistochemical analysis using anti-bovine Filia antibody showed the expression of Filia protein in the zone surrounding the nuclear membrane, and in the subcortex of ovine oocytes of primary and antral follicles. However, in the bovine, Filia has been found through the oocyte cytoplasm of antral follicles, and here it is further confirmed in the primary follicles. Our data suggests a difference in Filia expression pattern between cow and sheep, although the sequence is highly conserved.
27359368	Developments in Plant Negative-Strand RNA Virus Reverse Genetics.	Twenty years ago, breakthroughs for reverse genetics analyses of negative-strand RNA (NSR) viruses were achieved by devising conditions for generation of infectious viruses in susceptible cells. Recombinant strategies have subsequently been engineered for members of all vertebrate NSR virus families, and research arising from these advances has profoundly increased understanding of infection cycles, pathogenesis, and complexities of host interactions of animal NSR viruses. These strategies also permitted development of many applications, including attenuated vaccines and delivery vehicles for therapeutic and biotechnology proteins. However, for a variety of reasons, it was difficult to devise procedures for reverse genetics analyses of plant NSR viruses. In this review, we discuss advances that have circumvented these problems and resulted in construction of a recombinant system for Sonchus yellow net nucleorhabdovirus. We also discuss possible extensions to other plant NSR viruses as well as the applications that may emanate from recombinant analyses of these pathogens.
27427968	Three-Dimensional Rotation, Twist and Torsion Analyses Using Real-Time 3D Speckle Tracking Imaging: Feasibility, Reproducibility, and Normal Ranges in Pediatric Population.	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The specific aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility, reproducibility and maturational changes of LV rotation, twist and torsion variables by real-time 3D speckle-tracking echocardiography (RT3DSTE) in children. METHODS: A prospective study was conducted in 347 consecutive healthy subjects (181 males/156 females, mean age 7.12 +/- 5.3 years, and range from birth to 18-years) using RT 3D echocardiography (3DE). The LV rotation, twist and torsion measurements were made off-line using TomTec software. Manual landmark selection and endocardial border editing were performed in 3 planes (apical "2"-, "4"-, and "3"- chamber views) and semi-automated tracking yielded LV rotation, twist and torsion measurements. LV rotation, twist and torsion analysis by RT 3DSTE were feasible in 307 out of 347 subjects (88.5%). RESULTS: There was no correlation between rotation or twist and age, height, weight, BSA or heart rate, respectively. However, there was statistically significant, but very modest correlation between LV torsion and age (R2 = 0.036, P< 0.001). The normal ranges were defined for rotation and twist in this cohort, and for torsion for each age group. The intra-observer and inter-observer variabilities for apical and basal rotation, twist and torsion ranged from 7.3% +/- 3.8% to 12.3% +/- 8.8% and from 8.8% +/- 4.6% to 15.7% +/- 10.1%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that analysis of LV rotation, twist and torsion by this new RT3D STE is feasible and reproducible in pediatric population. There is no maturational change in rotation and twist, but torsion decreases with age in this cohort. Further refinement is warranted to validate the utility of this new methodology in more sensitive and quantitative evaluation of congenital and acquired heart diseases in children.
27308274	The Effect of Hemiscorpius lepturus (Scorpionida: Hemiscorpiidae) Venom on Leukocytes and the Leukocyte Subgroups in Peripheral Blood of Rat.	BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of Hemiscorpius lepturus venom on leukocytes and the leukocyte subgroups in peripheral blood of rat. METHODS: In this experimental study, sixty N-Mari rats were divided into three groups of 20 rats. Then the rats in each group were divided into four subgroups based on the blood sampling time that was 2, 6, 24 and 48 hours after the venom injection, respectively. The control group did not receive anything, however, the first and the second experimental groups received 0.1 and 0.01mg/kg of venom, subcutaneously. In accordance with a designated four sampling times, the blood sampling was carried out in three groups. After RBC lysis, the leukocytes and leukocyte sub-populations were determined and counted using appropriate hematological standard methods. RESULTS: The leukocyte and the neutrophil count at two (P<0.05), six (P<0.01) and 24 (P<0.05) hours after the venom injection showed a significant decline compared with the control group, this decrease was significant at the dose of 0.1 mg/kg until 48 hours after the venom injection (P<0.05). The lymphocyte count showed a significant decline throughout the all hours of the experiment, compared with the control group (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: Leukocytes are probably affected by the cytotoxicity effect of the H. lepturus venom in a dose-dependent manner. This could be a wakeup call for the medical staff to perform quick and accurate treatment in the least time possible.
27274245	In vivo evaluation of the anti-infection potential of gentamicin-loaded nanotubes on titania implants.	Titanium-based implants have been widely used in orthopedic surgery; however, failures still occur. Our in vitro study has demonstrated that gentamicin-loaded, 80 nm-diameter nanotubes possessed both antibacterial and osteogenic activities. Thus, the aim of this study was to further investigate the in vivo anti-infection effect of the titanium implants with gentamicin-loaded nanotubes. Thirty-six male Sprague Dawley rats were used to establish an implant-associated infection model. A volume of 50 muL Staphylococcus aureus suspension (1x10(5) CFU/mL) was injected into the medullary cavity of the left femur, and then the titanium rods without modification (Ti), titanium nanotubes without drug loading (NT), and gentamicin-loaded titanium nanotubes (NT-G) were inserted with phosphate-buffered saline-inoculated Ti rods as a blank control. X-ray images were obtained 1 day, 21 days, and 42 days after surgery; micro-computed tomography, microbiological, and histopathological analyses were used to evaluate the infections at the time of sacrifice. Radiographic signs of bone infection, including osteolysis, periosteal reaction, osteosclerosis, and damaged articular surfaces, were demonstrated in the infected Ti group and were slightly alleviated in the NT group but not observed in the NT-G group. Meanwhile, the radiographic and gross bone pathological scores of the NT-G group were significantly lower than those of the infected Ti group (P<0.01). Explant cultures revealed significantly less bacterial growth in the NT-G group than in the Ti and NT groups (P<0.01), and the NT group showed decreased live bacterial growth compared with the Ti group (P<0.01). Confocal laser scanning microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and histopathological observations further confirmed decreased bacterial burden in the NT-G group compared with the Ti and NT groups. We concluded that the NT-G coatings can significantly prevent the development of implant-associated infections in a rat model; therefore, they may provide an effective drug-loading strategy to combat implant-associated infections in clinic.
27182842	"Calculating The Toll Of Trauma" in the headlines: Portrayals of posttraumatic stress disorder in the New York Times (1980-2015).	Public awareness about traumatic stress is needed to address trauma as a public health issue. News media influence public awareness, but little is known about how traumatic-related disorders are portrayed in the news. A content analysis was conducted of all articles that mentioned posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in The New York Times between 1980-2015. There were 871 articles analyzed. The number of PTSD articles published annually increased dramatically, from 2 in 1980 to 70 in 2014. Overall, 50.6% of articles were focused on military populations. Combat was identified as the trauma exposure in 38.0% of articles, while sexual assault was identified in 8.7%. Negative themes such as crimes perpetrated by people with possible PTSD (18.0%) and substance abuse (11.5%) were prominent, substance abuse being more prevalent in articles focused on military populations (16.4% vs. 6.3%, p = <.001). Only 9.1% of articles mentioned PTSD treatment options and this theme became less prevalent over time-ranging from 19.4% of articles published between 1980-1995 to just 5.7% of articles published between 2005-2015 (p = <.001). Results suggest that public awareness of PTSD has increased, but may be incomplete, inaccurate, and perpetuate PTSD stigma at individual- and institutional-levels. These findings can inform advocacy strategies that enhance public awareness about PTSD and traumatic stress. (PsycINFO Database Record
26894391	[The Patient Questionnaire "Monitoring of Exacerbation Probability (MEP)"].	Exacerbations determine the disease process in COPD often decisively, whereas their detection and documentation has not been established satisfactory yet. For this purpose, a simple short Patient Questionnaire with a maximum of five positive answers was developed and evaluated. Values of 2 or more positive responses amplify the signal for an exacerbation, while with the presence of only 1 positive response a potential, but not a likely exacerbation must be considered. The MEP is well suited for a continuous documentation in computer-based administration systems.
28292030	[Prevalence of dyslipemia in Aristide le Dantec biochemistry laboratory in Dakar Senegal].	INTRODUCTION: This study aims to evaluate the prevalence of dyslipidemias among patients who underwent assay of a lipid parameter at the Laboratory of Biochemistry of Aristide Le Dantec University Hospital in 2013. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study of 1356 patients between ages 10-94 years presenting at the laboratory of Biochemistry of CHU Le Dantec from January to December 2013. All patients who had undergone at least one lipid assay whose results were recorded in the laboratory register were enrolled in the study. Total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and triglycerides were measured using enzymatic methods (Cobas Integra 400 plus biochemistry analyzer - Roche Diagnostics). RESULTS: The prevalence of dyslipidemia in our study population was 39.30%. The prevalence of hypercholesterolemia, hypo-HDL-cholesterolemia, hyper-HDL-cholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, mixed hyperlipidemia was 30,89% ; 7,30% ; 31,19% ; 0,51% ; 7,22% respectively. The subjects aged 40 to 59 years appeared to be more exposed. Moreover, there was a female predominance in hypercholesterolemia (54.17% vs 45.82%) the hypocholesterolemia (54.54% vs45,45%), and mixed hyperlipidemia (51.08% vs 48.97%). Dyslipidemias were strongly correlated to hypertension and obesity. CONCLUSION: The high prevalence of dyslipidemias found in our study highlights the importance of studying the prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors, in particular dyslipidemias, in Senegalese population.
26970192	Photocontrolled Intracellular RNA Delivery Using Nanoparticles or Carrier-Photosensitizer Conjugates.	Small interfering RNA (siRNA) and short hairpin RNA (shRNA) may potentially treat a wide variety of diseases through RNA interference-mediated silencing of specific genes. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous regulatory RNA molecules that also modulate gene expression, and thus potential therapeutic approaches using miRNAs have attracted attention. For clinical application of these small RNAs, efficient and safe RNA delivery to target tissues and cells is necessary. Current challenges to RNA delivery are the penetration of negatively charged RNAs through the cell membrane and specific delivery of RNA into target cells. Photocontrolled intracellular RNA delivery is a promising strategy with high target specificity. This strategy includes photodependent endosomal escape of RNA or photodependent release of RNAs from carrier particles. In this chapter, photocontrolled intracellular RNA delivery methods employing gold or silver nanoparticles, upconversion nanoparticles, proteins, or polymers are discussed.

26833520	Atopic eczema.	Atopic eczema is an itchy inflammatory skin disease with a chronic relapsing-remitting course; it has increased in prevalence in recent decades and now affects up to 25% of school-aged children in the developed world and up to 10% of adults. Recent advances in understanding the aetiology of eczema have focused interest on skin barrier dysfunction as a common precursor and pathological feature. In addition, genetically determined skin barrier dysfunction (associated with mutations in the gene encoding filaggrin) is known to predispose to multiple systemic atopic diseases. First-line treatments for atopic eczema focus on maintaining and repairing the skin barrier (emollients) and reducing inflammation (topical steroids); allergen and irritant avoidance are also important to achieve disease control. Second and third-line treatments include topical calcineurin inhibitors, ultraviolet light and systemic immunosuppressant therapies of which only ciclosporin is licenced for the treatment of atopic eczema in adults. Novel biological therapies are in phase II-III clinical trials.
28018316	Leveraging the Attributes of Mucor hiemalis-Derived Silver Nanoparticles for a Synergistic Broad-Spectrum Antimicrobial Platform.	Driven by the need to engineer robust surface coatings for medical devices to prevent infection and sepsis, incorporation of nanoparticles has surfaced as a promising avenue to enhance non-fouling efficacy. Microbial synthesis of such nanoscale metallic structures is of substantive interest as this can offer an eco-friendly, cost-effective, and sustainable route for further development. Here we present a Mucor hiemalis-derived fungal route for synthesis of silver nanoparticles, which display significant antimicrobial properties when tested against six pathological bacterial strains (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas brassicacearum, Aeromonas hydrophila, Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus, and Staphylococcus aureus) and three pathological fungal strains (Candida albicans, Fusarium oxysporum, and Aspergillus flavus). These antimicrobial attributes were comparable to those of established antibiotics (streptomycin, tetracycline, kanamycin, and rifampicin) and fungicides (amphotericin B, fluconazole, and ketoconazole), respectively. Importantly, these nanoparticles show significant synergistic characteristics when combined with the antibiotics and fungicides to offer substantially greater resistance to microbial growth. The blend of antibacterial and antifungal properties, coupled with their intrinsic "green" and facile synthesis, makes these biogenic nanoparticles particularly attractive for future applications in nanomedicine ranging from topical ointments and bandages for wound healing to coated stents.
26843256	An online x-ray based position validation system for prostate hypofractionated radiotherapy.	PURPOSE: Accurate positioning of the target volume during treatment is paramount for stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT). In this work, the authors present the development of an in-house software tool to verify target position with an Elekta-Synergy linear accelerator using kV planar images acquired during treatment delivery. METHODS: In-house software, SeedTracker, was developed in matlab to perform the following three functions: 1. predict intended seed positions in a planar view perpendicular to any gantry angle, simulating a portal imaging device, from the 3D seed co-ordinates derived from the treatment planning system; 2. autosegment seed positions in kV planar images; and 3. report the position shift based on the seed positions in the projection images. The performance of SeedTracker was verified using a CIRS humanoid phantom (CIRS, VA, USA) implanted with three Civco gold seed markers (Civco, IA, USA) in the prostate. The true positive rate of autosegmentation (TPRseg) and the accuracy of the software in alerting the user when the isocenter position was outside the tolerance (TPRtrig) were studied. Two-dimensional and 3D static position offsets introduced to the humanoid phantom and 3D dynamic offsets introduced to a gel phantom containing gold seeds were used for evaluation of the system. RESULTS: SeedTracker showed a TPRseg of 100% in the humanoid phantom for projection images acquired at all angles except in the ranges of 80 degrees -100 degrees and 260 degrees -280 degrees where seeds are obscured by anatomy. This resulted in a TPRtrig of 88% over the entire treatment range for considered 3D static offsets introduced to the phantom. For 2D static offsets where the position offsets were only introduced in the anterior-posterior and lateral directions, the TPRtrig of SeedTracker was limited by both seed detectability and positional offset. SeedTracker showed a false positive trigger in the projection angle range between 130 degrees -170 degrees and 310 degrees -350 degrees (a maximum of 24% of treatment time) due to limited information that can be derived from monoscopic images. The system accurately determined the dynamic trajectory of the isocenter position in the superior and inferior direction for the studied dynamic offset scenarios based on the seed position in monoscopic images. CONCLUSIONS: The developed software has been shown to accurately autosegment the seed positions in kV planar images except for two 20 degrees arcs where seeds are obscured by anatomical structures. The isocenter trajectories determined by the system, based on the monoscopic images, provide useful information for monitoring the prostate position. The developed system has potential application for monitoring prostate position during treatment delivery in linear accelerator based SBRT.
28180158	Seeing the unseen? Illusory causal filling in FIFA referees, players, and novices.	Humans often falsely report having seen a causal link between two dynamic scenes if the second scene depicts a valid logical consequence of the initial scene. As an example, a video clip shows someone kicking a ball including the ball flying. Even if the video clip omitted the moment of contact (i.e., the causal link), participants falsely report having seen this moment. In the current study, we explored the interplay of cognitive-perceptual expertise and event perception by measuring the false-alarm rates of three groups with differing interests in football (soccer in North America) (novices, players, and FIFA referees). We used the event-completion paradigm with video footage of a real football match, presenting either complete clips or incomplete clips (i.e., with the contact moment omitted). Either a causally linked scene or an incoherent scene followed a cut in the incomplete videos. Causally linked scenes induced false recognitions in all three groups: although the ball contact moment was not presented, participants indicated that they had seen the contact as frequently when it was absent as in the complete condition. In a second experiment, we asked the novices to detect the ball contact moment when it was either visible or not and when it was either followed by a causally or non-causally linked scene. Here, instead of presenting pictures of the clip, the participants were give a two-alternative forced-choice task: "Yes, contact was visible", or "No, contact was not visible". The results of Experiment 1 indicate that conceptual interpretations of simple events are independent of expertise: there were no top-down effects on perception. Participants in Experiment 2 detected the ball contact moment significantly more often correctly in the non-causal than in the causal conditions, indicating that the effect observed in Experiment 1 was not due to a possibly influential design (e.g., inducing a false memory for the presented pictures). The theoretical as well as the practical implications are discussed.
27416624	[Impact of low level laser therapy on skin blood flow].	UNLABELLED: The aim of this study was to objectively assess the impact of low level laser therapy on skin blood flow, in terms of two of its components - the flow and trophic and therapeutic effect. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Nineteen children aged 3-15 years have been included in the study (seven boys and twelve girls) with a diagnosis of meningomyelocele in the lumbosacral area. In nine of them (47.3%) bedsores were found in the area of paresis location. Studies of skin blood flow were performed using xenon 133 clearance in the Department of Nuclear Medicine of the Children's Memorial Health Institute. Xenon 133 radioisotope in saline with intrinsic activity 74 MBq in 1 ml was used as the marker. Laser application was performed immediately prior to the application of the marker with a tag shower 60 mW probe, emitting 680 nm red light with surface power density of 0.5 J/cm2. RESULTS: Within the tested children the laser application resulted in a significantly increased skin blood flow. Average results in tested group before LLLT are 7.47 ml/100 g/min, after LLLT 11.08 ml/100 g/min. CONCLUSIONS: 1. LLLT significantly increases the perfusion of the skin. 2. The effect of the increased perfusion as the result of laserotherapy in the most evident in children with skin trophic abnormalities. 3. Results confirmed by clinical observation indicate, that perfusion increase in relation to LLLT takes place with participation of trophic component of skin blood circulation.
26925663	Multiplex RT-PCR Assay for Detection of Common Fusion Transcripts in Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia and Chronic Myeloid Leukemia Cases.	BACKGROUND: Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a heterogeneous disease which requires a risk-stratified approach for appropriate treatment. Specific chromosomal translocations within leukemic blasts are important prognostic factors that allow identification of relevant subgroups. In this study, we developed a multiplex RT-PCR assay for detection of the 4 most frequent translocations in ALL (BCR-ABL, TEL-AML1, MLL-AF4, and E2A- PBX1). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 214 diagnosed ALL samples from both adult and pediatric ALL and 14 cases of CML patients (154 bone marrow and 74 peripheral blood samples) were assessed for specific chromosomal translocations by cytogenetic and multiplex RT-PCR assays. RESULTS: The results showed that 46 cases of ALL and CML (20.2%) contained the fusion transcripts. Within the positive ALL patients, the most prevalent cryptic translocation observed was mBCR-ABL (p190) at 8.41%. In addition, other genetic rearrangements detected by the multiplex PCR were 4.21% TEL-AML1 and 2.34% E2A-PBX1, whereas MLL-AF4 exhibited negative results in all tested samples. Moreover, MBCR-ABL was detected in all 14 CML samples. In 16 samples of normal karyotype ALL (n=9), ALL with no cytogentic result (n=4) and CML with no Philadelphia chromosome (n=3), fusion transcripts were detected. CONCLUSIONS: Multiplex RT-PCR provides a rapid, simple and highly sensitive method to detect fusion transcripts for prognostic and risk stratification of ALL and CML patients.
27055397	The Impact of Axillary Lymph Node Surgery on Breast Skin Thickening During and After Radiation Therapy for Breast Cancer.	PURPOSE: This prospective study was conducted to determine predictors of epidermal thickening during and after whole-breast radiation therapy (XRT) using objective measurements acquired with ultrasound. METHODS AND MATERIALS: After breast-conserving surgery, 70 women received a definitive course of whole-breast XRT (50 Gy plus boost). Prior to XRT, at week 6 of XRT, and 6 weeks after XRT, patients underwent objective ultrasound measurements of epidermal thickness over the lumpectomy cavity and all 4 quadrants of the treated breast. A skin thickness ratio (STRA) was then generated normalizing for corresponding measurements taken of the untreated breast. RESULTS: Baseline measurements indicated that 87% of patients had skin thickening in the treated versus untreated breast (mean increase, 27%; SD, 0.29) prior to XRT. The STRA increased significantly by week 6 of XRT (mean, 25%; SD, 0.46) and continued to increase significantly 6 weeks after XRT (mean, 33%; SD, 0.46) above baseline measurements (P<.001 for both time points). On multivariate analysis, breast volume (P=.003) and surgical evaluation of the axilla with full lymph node dissection (P<.05) predicted for more severe changes in the STRA 6 weeks after XRT compared with baseline. STRA measurements correlated with physician ratings of skin toxicity according to Radiation Therapy Oncology Group grading criteria. CONCLUSIONS: This is one of the first studies to objectively document that lymph node surgery affects XRT-induced skin thickening in patients with breast cancer. Surgical evaluation of the axilla with complete lymph node dissection was associated with the most severe XRT-induced skin changes after XRT completion. These results may inform future studies aimed at minimizing side effects of XRT and surgery, particularly when surgical lymph node assessments may not alter breast cancer management or outcome.
27469155	Chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease in disadvantaged communities of North America: an investigational challenge to limit disease progression and cardiovascular risk.	Chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) are growing public health issues associated with significant morbidity and mortality around the world. In the United States, Black and Hispanic minorities suffer higher rates of CKD and ESRD, mostly attributed to Diabetic Kidney Disease (DKD). DKD is the leading cause of both CKD and ESRD in the developed world and disproportionately affects minority populations such as African Americans, Hispanic Americans, and Aboriginal Americans in comparison with Whites. This review will discuss the incidence, prevalence, and etiology of renal disease in disadvantaged minorities in the U.S. and will take a closer look at diabetic kidney disease as it is the primary cause of kidney disease in these populations.
27818874	Texture-based block partitioning method for motion compensated frame interpolation.	This paper presents a novel motion compensated frame interpolation (MCFI) algorithm that includes texture-based wedgelet partitioning (TWP) and multiple prediction based search (MPS). TWP partitions a rectangular block into two wedge-shaped sub-blocks using the texture information, which makes a better approximation for an actual object region. Thus, detailed motions around the object boundaries can be more precisely represented than by existing MCFI algorithms. To reliably estimate the actual motion, the MPS algorithm is used in addition to TWP. MPS considers the distances between the predicted motion vectors and the candidate motion vectors, as well as the matching error. Experimental results reveal that the proposed MCFI can improve the average peak signal-to-noise ratio performance by up to 2.93 dB compared to existing MCFIs. On the average structural similarity metric, the proposed MCFI algorithm is superior to existing algorithms by a value of up to 0.0256. In addition, the proposed MCFI can reduce the computational complexity by as much as 66.9 % with respect to the sum of absolute difference compared with existing MCFIs.
26930172	The influence of chronotype in the daily lives of young children.	Research on chronotypic differences has been conducted for many years, however, until recently, little attention has been paid to young children. The current study examined the influence of morningness-eveningness in the daily lives of 2 to 4 year olds (291 females, 230 males, 8 gender not given) via an online survey completed by 529 mothers from across the United States. The results replicated previous findings on chronotypic differences in sleep-wake patterns and the development of morningness-eveningness in early childhood. The influence of chronotype on sleep habits, daily routines and schedules was also explored. At both bed and wake times, mothers of evening type (E-type) children were more likely to report challenges. For a while, morning type (M-type) children tended to fall asleep easily and wake themselves up in the morning, E-types were more likely to show bedtime resistance, wake in a negative mood and have conflicts with their parents. In the morning, mothers of M-type children often stuck to their normal routine on days when the child had to be somewhere at 7:00 am, whereas mothers of E-type children employed different strategies to get their child up and out the door. Bedtime routines and daily schedules also differed by chronotype. Individual differences in morningness-eveningness and their impact on sleep-wake patterns and social interactions are evident early on. A greater understanding of how they affect the lives of young children and their future development is needed.
26837396	The role of ultrasound guidance in pediatric caudal block.	OBJECTIVES: To compare the time interval of the procedure, possible complications, post-operative pain levels, additional analgesics, and nurse satisfaction in ultrasonography-guided and standard caudal block applications. METHODS: This retrospective study was conducted in Celal Bayar University Hospital, Manisa, Turkey, between January and December 2014, included 78 pediatric patients. Caudal block was applied to 2 different groups; one with ultrasound guide, and the other using the standard method. RESULTS: The time interval of the procedure was significantly shorter in the standard application group compared with ultrasound-guided group (p=0.020). Wong-Baker FACES Pain Rating Scale values obtained at the 90th minute was statistically lower in the standard application group compared with ultrasound-guided group (p=0.035). No statistically significant difference was found on the other parameters between the 2 groups. The shorter time interval of the procedure at standard application group should not be considered as a distinctive mark by the pediatric anesthesiologists, because this time difference was as short as seconds. CONCLUSION: Ultrasound guidance for caudal block applications would neither increase nor decrease the success of the treatment. However, ultrasound guidance should be needed in cases where the detection of sacral anatomy is difficult, especially by palpations.
27687597	[Pulmonary hypertension: definition, classification and treatments].	Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a cardio-pulmonary disorder that may involve multiple clinical conditions and can complicate the majority of cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. Its definition is an increase in mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP) \hbox{$\geqslant $} 25 mmHg at rest, leading to right heart failure and ultimately death. The clinical classification of pulmonary hypertension (PH) categorizes PH into groups which share similar pathophysiological and hemodynamic characteristics and treatments. Five groups of disorders that cause PH are identified: pulmonary arterial hypertension (Group 1) which is a pre-capillary PH, defined by a normal pulmonary artery wedge pressure (PAWP) \hbox{$\leqslant $} 15 mmH, due to remodelling of the small pulmonary arteries (<500 mum); pulmonary hypertension due to left heart disease (Group 2) which is a post-capillary PH, defined by an increased pulmonary artery wedge pressure (PAWP) >15 mmHg; pulmonary hypertension due to chronic lung disease and/or hypoxia (Group 3); chronic thrombo-embolic pulmonary hypertension (Group 4); and pulmonary hypertension due to unclear and/or multifactorial mechanisms (Group 5). PAH (PH group 1) can be treated with agents targeting three dysfunctional endothelial pathways of PAH: nitric oxide (NO) pathway, endothelin-1 pathway and prostacyclin pathway. Patients at low or intermediate risk can be treated with either initial monotherapy or initial oral combination therapy. In patients at high risk initial combination therapy including intravenous prostacyclin analogues should be considered. Patients with inadequate clinical response to maximum treatment (triple therapy with an intravenous prostacyclin) should be assessed for lung transplantation. Despite progresses, PAH remains a fatal disease with a 3-year survival rate of 58%. Treatment of group 2, group 3 and group 5 PH is the treatment of the causal disease and PAH therapeutics are not recommended. Treatment of group 4 PH is pulmonary endarteriectomy if patients are eligible, otherwise balloon pulmonary angioplasty and/or medical therapy can be considered.
26949417	Bioalerts: a python library for the derivation of structural alerts from bioactivity and toxicity data sets.	BACKGROUND: Assessing compound toxicity at early stages of the drug discovery process is a crucial task to dismiss drug candidates likely to fail in clinical trials. Screening drug candidates against structural alerts, i.e. chemical fragments associated to a toxicological response prior or after being metabolized (bioactivation), has proved a valuable approach for this task. During the last decades, diverse algorithms have been proposed for the automatic derivation of structural alerts from categorical toxicity data sets. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Here, the python library bioalerts is presented, which comprises functionalities for the automatic derivation of structural alerts from categorical (dichotomous), e.g. toxic/non-toxic, and continuous bioactivity data sets, e.g. [Formula: see text] or [Formula: see text] values. The library bioalerts relies on the RDKit implementation of the circular Morgan fingerprint algorithm to compute chemical substructures, which are derived by considering radial atom neighbourhoods of increasing bond radius. In addition to the derivation of structural alerts, bioalerts provides functionalities for the calculation of unhashed (keyed) Morgan fingerprints, which can be used in predictive bioactivity modelling with the advantage of allowing for a chemically meaningful deconvolution of the chemical space. Finally, bioalerts provides functionalities for the easy visualization of the derived structural alerts.
27636369	Plasma Leptin Levels and Risk of Incident Cancer: Results from the Dallas Heart Study.	PURPOSE: Leptin dysregulation has been postulated to affect cancer risk through its effects on obesity and inflammation. Epidemiological data evaluating this relationship are conflicting and studies in non-white cohorts is lacking. Therefore, we examined the association of leptin with the risk of incident cancer in the multiethnic Dallas Heart Study (DHS). METHODS: Participants enrolled in the DHS without prevalent cancer and with baseline leptin measurements were included. Incident cancer cases were identified through a systematic linkage of the DHS and the Texas Cancer Registry. Leptin was evaluated both as a continuous variable and in sex-specific quartiles. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards modeling was performed to examine the association between leptin levels with incident cancer after adjusting for age, sex, race, smoking status, alcohol use, family history of malignancy, body mass index (BMI), diabetes mellitus and C-reactive protein. RESULTS: Among 2,919 participants (median age 44 years; 54% women; 70% nonwhite; median BMI 29.4 kg/m2), 190 (6.5%) developed cancer after median follow- up of 12 years. Median leptin levels were 12.9 (interquartile range [IQR] 5.8-29.5) ng/ml in the incident cancer group vs. 12.3 (IQR 5.4-26.4) ng/ml those without an incident cancer (p = 0.34). Leptin was not associated with cancer incidence in multivariable analysis (unit standard deviation increase in log-transformed leptin, hazard ratio 0.95; 95% confidence interval, 0.77-1.16; p = 0.60). No association was observed in analyses stratified by sex, race/ethnicity, diabetes, or obesity status. CONCLUSIONS: In this study of a predominantly minority population, no association between premorbid leptin levels and cancer incidence was demonstrated. Despite preclinical rationale and positive findings in other studies, this association may not replicate across all racial/ethnic populations.
27547970	Correction: Pathogenicity and Complete Genome Characterization of Fowl Adenoviruses Isolated from Chickens Associated with Inclusion Body Hepatitis and Hydropericardium Syndrome in China.	[This corrects the article DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0133073.].
27290843	[Frequency and maternal complications of the criteria of hemolysis in preeclamptic patients with HELLP syndrome treated in an intensive care unit].	BACKGROUND: HELLP syndrome is an aggressive form of preeclampsia related with hemolysis and its complications. OBJECTIVE: To determine the frequency of the appearance of criteria of hemolysis and maternal complications in preeclamptic patients with HELLP syndrome treated in an intensive care unit. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We carried out a cross-sectional study in 50 preeclamptic women with HELLP syndrome admitted to intensive care unit to determine the presence of the following criteria of hemolysis: peripheral blood schistocytes, anemia (hemoglobin </= 10 g/dL), lactate dehydrogenase >/= 600 U/L, indirect bilirubin >/= 0.6 mg/dL and hemoglobinuria. We also studied maternal complications in patients with lactate dehydrogenase >/= 600 U/L and positive for schistocytes. Descriptive (mean, median, range, standard deviation) and inferential (Student t test) statistics were used. RESULTS: Lactate dehydrogenase >/= 600 U/L was found in 36%, indirect bilirubin 0.6 mg/dL in 20%, positive schistocytes in 16%, hemoglobinuria in 4% and anemia in 0%. Patients with lactate dehydrogenase >/= 600 U/L had more clinical and laboratory deterioration as well as prolonged intensive care unit stay (p = 0.0025). Patients positive for schistocytes did not demonstrate adverse effects. CONCLUSION: Biochemical criteria of hemolysis were more frequent than schistocytes, hemoglobinuria and anemia. Patients with lactate dehydrogenase >/= 600 U/L was alterations more serious than patients with positive schistocytes so its usefulness as a biomarker may be higher.
27375421	Weighing the Cost and Benefit of Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation on Different Reading Subskills.	Adults struggling with low reading skills are underserved by limited available treatments. While brain stimulation techniques such as transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has the potential to improve a variety of cognitive functions, little work has been done examining its potential to treat reading disabilities. Research on the effects of tDCS on reading abilities has been somewhat inconsistent perhaps in part due to discrepancies between studies in the nature of the tasks. In the current study, we examined the effect of tDCS to the left inferior parietal lobe (L IPL) on two reading tasks in low-to-average readers. We compared performance on a sight word efficiency (SWE) task and a rhyme judgment task before and after either stimulation to the L IPL, right superior parietal lobe (R SPL), or sham stimulation. Readers who received stimulation to the L IPL showed greater improvements on the SWE task, but less improvement on the rhyme judgment task compared to the R SPL and sham groups. This study demonstrates for the first time both a positive and negative effect of stimulation under the same stimulation parameters within the same participants. The results highlight the need to consider multiple tasks when assessing the potential of using tDCS as a treatment.
27367352	[The non-damaging method for the insertion of a standard electrode for cochlear ossification].	The objective of the present study was to develop the non-damaging method for the insertion of a standard electrode for cochlear ossification with a view to improving the results of hearing and speech rehabilitation of the patients presenting with grade IV sensorineural impairment of hearing. Twenty preparations of the cadaveric temporal bone were used to investigate topographic and anatomical relationships in the main structures of the middle and internal ears, viz. the second cochlear coil, vestibulum and its windows, processus cochleaformis, spiral lamina, and modiolus. The optimal method for the insertion of a standard electrode into the spiral canal of the cochlea after the removal of the ossified structures is proposed. The optimal site for constructing the second colostomy is determined that allows the spiral plate and modiolus to be maximally preserved. The proposed method was employed to treat 11 patients with grade IV sensorineural impairment of hearing and more than 5 mm ossification of the basal cochlear coil. With this method, it proved possible to insert the maximum number of electrodes into the cochlear spiral canal and thereby to obtain excellent results of hearing and speech rehabilitation in the patients with the ossified cochlea.
27199733	Glial Modulation by N-acylethanolamides in Brain Injury and Neurodegeneration.	Neuroinflammation involves the activation of glial cells and represents a key element in normal aging and pathophysiology of brain damage. N-acylethanolamides (NAEs), naturally occurring amides, are known for their pro-homeostatic effects. An increase in NAEs has been reported in vivo and in vitro in the aging brain and in brain injury. Treatment with NAEs may promote neuroprotection and exert anti-inflammatory actions via PPARalpha activation and/or by counteracting gliosis. This review aims to provide an overview of endogenous and exogenous properties of NAEs in neuroinflammation and to discuss their interaction with glial cells.
27165910	Outcome, Pressure Reactivity and Optimal Cerebral Perfusion Pressure Calculation in Traumatic Brain Injury: A Comparison of Two Variants.	This study investigates the outcome prediction and calculation of optimal cerebral perfusion pressure (CPPopt) in 307 patients after severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) based on cerebrovascular reactivity calculation of a moving correlation correlation coefficient, named PRx, between mean arterial pressure (ABP) and intracranial pressure (ICP). The correlation coefficient was calculated from simultaneously recorded data using different frequencies. PRx was calculated from oscillations between 0.008 and 0.05Hz and the longPRx (L-PRx) was calculated from oscillations between 0.0008 and 0.016 Hz. PRx was a significant mortality predictor, whereas L-PRx was not. CPPopt for pooled data was higher for L-PRx than for PRx, with no statistical difference. Mortality was associated with mean CPP below CPPopt. Severe disability was associated with CPP above CPPopt (PRx). These relationships were not statistically significant for CPPopt (L-PRx). We conclude that PRx and L-PRx cannot be used interchangeably.
27837622	Sorafenib as an adjuvant therapy for resectable hepatocellular carcinoma: A single center experience.	PURPOSE: Resectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is currently treated with surgical resection without any adjuvant therapy. We sought to assess the value of sorafenib as an adjuvant treatment in that clinical setting. METHODS: Of a total of 30 patients, 16 underwent curative- intent liver resection for HCC and subsequently received adjuvant sorafenib, while 14 underwent surgery alone. Clinicopathological characteristics were analyzed and the impact of adjuvant sorafenib on overall survival (OS) was assessed. RESULTS: The median follow up time was 38.2 months. The median patient age was 63.5 and 76.7% of them were male. The majority of patients had a solitary tumor (74.1%) with a median size of 7.75 cm. Five-year OS for the whole cohort was 60.2%. OS for patients who underwent only resection was 52.9 vs 68.1% for patients who underwent resection and received adjuvant sorafenib (p=0.19). CONCLUSION: Sorafenib seems to be associated with an acceptable safety profile but does not confer any substantial clinical benefit in terms of survival in HCC patients who have undergone curative-intent liver resection.
26905665	Clinical risk scoring system for predicting extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli infection in hospitalized patients.	BACKGROUND: Extended spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli (ESBL-EC) has important implications for infection control and empiric antibiotic prescribing. This study aims to develop a risk scoring system for predicting ESBL-EC infection based on local epidemiology. METHODS: The study retrospectively collected eligible patients with a positive culture for E. coli during 2011 to 2014. The risk scoring system was developed using variables independently associated with ESBL-EC infection through logistic regression-based prediction. Area under the receiver-operator characteristic curve (AuROC) was determined to confirm the prediction power of the model. FINDINGS: Predictors for ESBL-EC infection were male gender [odds ratio (OR): 1.53], age >/=55 years (OR: 1.50), healthcare-associated infection (OR: 3.21), hospital-acquired infection (OR: 2.28), sepsis (OR: 1.79), prolonged hospitalization (OR: 1.88), history of ESBL infection within one year (OR: 7.88), prior use of broad-spectrum cephalosporins within three months (OR: 12.92), and prior use of other antibiotics within three months (OR: 2.14). Points scored ranged from 0 to 47, and were divided into three groups based on diagnostic performance parameters: low risk (score: 0-8; 44.57%), moderate risk (score: 9-11; 21.85%) and high risk (score: >/=12; 33.58%). The model displayed moderate power of prediction (AuROC: 0.773; 95% confidence interval: 0.742-0.805) and good calibration (Hosmer-Lemeshow chi(2) = 13.29; P = 0.065). CONCLUSION: This tool may optimize the prescribing of empirical antibiotic therapy, minimize time to identify patients, and prevent spreading of ESBL-EC. Prior to adoption into routine clinical practice, further validation study of the tool is needed.
27656179	Longitudinal Comparison of Antibiotic Resistance in Diarrheagenic and Non-pathogenic Escherichia coli from Young Tanzanian Children.	Enteroaggregative, enteropathogenic, and enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli contribute significantly to the burden of diarrheal infections particularly in developing countries. Antibiotic resistance is increasingly common among bacterial pathogens including pathogenic E. coli. We assessed the relationship between pathogenic E. coli carriage and resistance to six antibiotics in E. coli isolated from young children in rural Tanzania. We surveyed temporal stability in antibiotic resistance in 2492 E. coli isolated from fecal samples obtained from young children in rural Tanzania collected over a 6 months period. Approximately half of the 377 children sampled were exposed to an azithromycin mass treatment program for trachoma control and half resided in control villages. Children were sampled at baseline, 1-, 3-, and 6 months following azithromycin treatment. We compared resistance to six antibiotics in pathogenic and non-pathogenic strains at the population level, within fecal specimens, and within individuals over time using chi-square tests, paired odds ratios, and logistic regression, respectively. Resistance to ampicillin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole was highly prevalent (>65%). Resistance to 5 of 6 antibiotics tested and multi-drug resistance occurred more frequently in pathogenic isolates (p </= 0.001) within fecal specimens and overall. Azithromycin mass treatment exposure was significantly associated with increased odds of carriage of isolates resistant to erythromycin (OR 3.64, p < 0.001) and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (OR 1.60, p < 0.05). Pathogenic isolates were approximately twice as likely to be resistant to erythromycin, ampicillin, or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole compared to non-pathogenic isolates from the same fecal specimen. The potential linkage between resistance and virulence in E. coli suggests hygiene and sanitation interventions aimed at reducing disease burden could play a role in controlling transmission of antibiotic resistance.
27203858	Text Mining of Journal Articles for Sleep Disorder Terminologies.	OBJECTIVE: Research on publication trends in journal articles on sleep disorders (SDs) and the associated methodologies by using text mining has been limited. The present study involved text mining for terms to determine the publication trends in sleep-related journal articles published during 2000-2013 and to identify associations between SD and methodology terms as well as conducting statistical analyses of the text mining findings. METHODS: SD and methodology terms were extracted from 3,720 sleep-related journal articles in the PubMed database by using MetaMap. The extracted data set was analyzed using hierarchical cluster analyses and adjusted logistic regression models to investigate publication trends and associations between SD and methodology terms. RESULTS: MetaMap had a text mining precision, recall, and false positive rate of 0.70, 0.77, and 11.51%, respectively. The most common SD term was breathing-related sleep disorder, whereas narcolepsy was the least common. Cluster analyses showed similar methodology clusters for each SD term, except narcolepsy. The logistic regression models showed an increasing prevalence of insomnia, parasomnia, and other sleep disorders but a decreasing prevalence of breathing-related sleep disorder during 2000-2013. Different SD terms were positively associated with different methodology terms regarding research design terms, measure terms, and analysis terms. CONCLUSION: Insomnia-, parasomnia-, and other sleep disorder-related articles showed an increasing publication trend, whereas those related to breathing-related sleep disorder showed a decreasing trend. Furthermore, experimental studies more commonly focused on hypersomnia and other SDs and less commonly on insomnia, breathing-related sleep disorder, narcolepsy, and parasomnia. Thus, text mining may facilitate the exploration of the publication trends in SDs and the associated methodologies.
27022481	Prevalence of Anemia and Its Associated Factors among Pregnant Women Attending Antenatal Care in Health Institutions of Arba Minch Town, Gamo Gofa Zone, Ethiopia: A Cross-Sectional Study.	Background. Anemia during pregnancy is a major cause of morbidity and mortality of pregnant women in developing countries and has both maternal and fetal consequences. Despite its known serious effect on health, there is very little research based evidence on this vital public health problem in Gamo Gofa zone in general and in Arba Minch town of Southern Ethiopia in particular. Therefore, this study aims to assess the prevalence and factors associated with anemia among pregnant women attending antenatal care in health institutions of Arba Minch town, Gamo Gofa zone, Southern Ethiopia. Method. Institution-based, cross-sectional study was conducted from February 16 to April 8, 2015, among 332 pregnant women who attended antenatal care at government health institutions of Arba Minch town. Interviewer-administered questionnaire supplemented by laboratory tests was used to obtain the data. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regressions were used to identify predictors of anemia. Result. The prevalence of anemia among antenatal care attendant pregnant women of Arba Minch town was 32.8%. Low average monthly income of the family (AOR = 4.0; 95% CI: 5.62-11.01), having birth interval less than two years (AOR = 3.1; 95% CI: 6.01, 10.23), iron supplementation (AOR = 2.31; 95% CI: 7.21, 9.31), and family size >2 (AOR = 2.8; 95% CI: 1.17, 6.81) were found to be independent predictors of anemia in pregnancy. Conclusion. Anemia is found to be a moderate public health problem in the study area. Low average monthly income, birth interval less than two years, iron supplementation, and large family size were found to be risk factors for anemia in pregnancy. Awareness creation towards birth spacing, nutritional counselling on consumption of iron-rich foods, and iron supplementation are recommended to prevent anemia among pregnant women with special emphasis on those having low income and large family size.
27075877	Relative contribution of ruminal buffering systems to pH regulation in feedlot cattle fed either low- or high-forage diets.	The relative contribution of ruminal short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) absorption and salivary buffering to pH regulation could potentially change under different dietary conditions. Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate the effects of altering the ruminal supply of rapidly fermentable carbohydrate (CHO) on absorptive function and salivation in beef cattle. Eight heifers (mean BW+/-SD=410+/-14 kg) were randomly allocated to two treatments in a crossover design with 37-day periods. Dietary treatments were barley silage at 30% low forage (LF) or 70% high forage (HF) of dietary dry matter (DM), with the remainder of the diet consisting of barley grain (65% or 25% on a DM basis) and a constant level (5%) of supplement. The LF and HF diets contained 45.3% and 30.9% starch, and 4.1% and 14.0% physically effective fiber (DM basis), respectively. Ruminal pH was continuously measured from day 17 to day 23, whereas ruminal fluid was collected on day 23 to determine SCFA concentration. Ruminal liquid passage rate was determined on day 23 using Cr-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid. Eating or resting salivation was measured by collecting masticate (days 28 and 29) or saliva samples (days 30 and 31) at the cardia, respectively. On days 30 and 31, the temporarily isolated and washed reticulo-rumen technique was used to measure total, and Cl--competitive (an indirect measure of protein-mediated transport) absorption of acetate, propionate and butyrate. As a result of the higher dietary starch content and DM intake, the ruminal supply of rapidly fermentable CHO, total ruminal SCFA concentration (118 v. 95 mM; P<0.001) and osmolality (330 v. 306 mOsm/kg; P=0.018) were greater in cattle fed LF compared with HF. In addition, feeding LF resulted in a longer duration (2.50 v. 0.09 h/day; P=0.02) and a larger area (0.44 v. 0.01 (pHxh)/day; P=0.050) that pH was below 5.5. There was no diet effect on total and Cl--competitive absorption (mmol/h and %/h) of acetate, propionate, butyrate and total SCFA (acetate+propionate+butyrate), but eating salivation was less (131 v. 152 ml/min; P=0.02), and resting salivation tended to be less (87 v. 104 ml/min; P=0.10) in cattle fed an LF diet. In summary, lower ruminal pH in cattle with greater rapidly fermentable CHO intake was attributed to an increase in SCFA production and decrease in salivation, which were not compensated for by an increase in epithelial permeability.
26862748	Cutaneous Leishmaniasis: An Overlooked Etiology of Midfacial Destructive Lesions.	BACKGROUND: Midline destructive lesions of the face (MDL) have a wide range of etiologies. Cutaneous Leishmaniasis (CL) is rarely reported as a possible cause. METHODS: Fifteen patients with solitary nasal lesions caused by CL were studied. The clinical data, biopsies/scrapings and PCR were collected/performed. Ridley's Pattern (RP) and Parasitic Index (PI) were documented. RESULTS: Patients' age ranged from 1 to 60 years including 7 males and 8 females. The duration of the observed lesions ranged from 1 to 18 months. Clinically, the lesions showed 6 patterns varying from dermal erythematous papulonodular with no epidermal changes to destructive erythematous plaque with massive central hemorrhagic crust. The clinical impression ranged from neoplastic to inflammatory processes. RP varied among the cases [RP 3 (n = 6), RP 4 (n = 3), RP 5 (n = 6)]. All cases show low PI [PI 0 (n = 7), PI 1 (n = 6), PI 2 (n = 1), and PI 3 (n = 1)]. Higher PI was noted in the pediatric group [average age 24 years for PI 0-1 vs. 6.5 years for PI 2-3]. Molecular speciation showed Leishmania tropica (n = 13) and Leishmania major (n = 2). All the patients received Meglumine Antimoniate (Glucantine) injections and had initial cure defined as complete scarring and disappearance of inflammatory signs within 3 months. CONCLUSION: Leishmaniasis may cause MDL especially in endemic areas. PCR is instrumental in confirming the diagnosis. MDL caused by CL showed wide spectrum of clinical and microscopic presentation.
27019575	Minimally Invasive Treatment of Liver Hydatidosis.	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Open surgery has been the mainstay treatment for liver hydatidosis in the past. Today, for treatment of simple and uncomplicated cysts, we have a variety of choices: antihelmintic therapy, the PAIR (puncture, aspiration, injection, and respiration) technique, and the laparoscopic approach. We reviewed our series of 267 cases of hepatic hydatidosis submitted to surgery over a period of 20 years, from 1995 through 2014, comparing the results of these minimally invasive treatments. METHODS: In 92 patients (25.7% of cases) who presented with complicated liver hydatid cysts, we performed open surgery. In 16.4% of cases (59 patients), we used a laparoscopic approach, and in 208 patients (57.9% of cases), we used the PAIR technique. All patients were monitored after surgery for a mean of 61.7 months (range, 16-127). Postoperative follow-up consisted of clinical examination, laboratory investigation, abdominal ultrasound, and magnetic resonance imaging. RESULTS: Almost all patients (198, 95.2%) treated with the PAIR technique and 55 patients (93.2%) treated with the laparoscopic approach were cured. Six patients (2.8%) from the echo-guided puncture group had to undergo a repeat of the procedure because the cavity did not disappear after 2 years. In 4 patients (2%), we performed open surgery for 2 biliary fistulas and 2 hepatic abscesses. Four patients from the laparoscopic group needed additional procedures. Open surgery was necessary in 2 patients for a recurrence after 2 years; 1 patient had developed a liver abscess and the other had a biliary fistula. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, open surgery remains the viable option for complicated cysts, with biliary communication, with multiple daughter vesicles, or with calcified walls. For simple, uncomplicated hydatid cysts, both methods (the PAIR technique and laparoscopic procedure) are safe and efficient, with very good results and low morbidity rates.
27595063	Recurrence of pulmonary alveolar proteinosis after bilateral lung transplantation in a patient with a nonsense mutation in CSF2RB.	Hereditary pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) caused by mutations in CSF2RA or CSF2RB, which encode GM-CSF receptor alpha and beta respectively, is a rare disease. Although some experimental therapeutic strategies have been proposed, no clinical evidence has yet been reported. We herein describe the clinical course and recurrence of hereditary PAP after lung transplantation. A 36-year-old woman developed PAP of unknown etiology. She underwent bilateral lung transplantation from living donors at the age of 42 years because of severe respiratory failure complicated by pulmonary fibrosis. However, PAP recurred after 9 months, and we found that donor-origin alveolar macrophages had been almost completely replaced with recipient-origin macrophages. We performed a genetic analysis and identified a point deletion in the CSF2RB gene that caused a GM-CSF receptor-mediated signaling defect. PAP progressed with fibrosis in both transplanted lungs, and the patient died of respiratory failure 5 years after the lung transplantation. Distinct from recent reports on pulmonary macrophage transplantation in mice, this case suggests that human alveolar macrophages might not maintain their population only by self-renewal but may depend on a supply of precursor cells from the circulation. Bone marrow transplantation should be considered for treatment of severe PAP with GM-CSF receptor gene deficiency.
26900198	Relationship Satisfaction and Communication Among Urban Minority HIV-Positive and HIV-Negative Mothers: The Influence on Daughter's Alcohol Use.	Family relationships influence children's beliefs and behaviors. This work examined qualities associated with communication about alcohol among 176 mothers and the influence of this communication on daughters' alcohol use. Path analyses by maternal HIV status indicated significant differences. Relationship satisfaction was associated with self-efficacy for both HIV-positive (beta = 0.545, p < .001) and HIV-negative (beta = 0.557, p < .001) mothers. Maternal self-efficacy was associated with communication for both HIV-positive (beta = 0.364, p < .01) and HIV-negative (beta = 0.310, p < .05) mothers; maternal attitudes toward alcohol use were associated with communication among HIV-negative mothers (beta = 0.20, p < .05). Relationship satisfaction was indirectly related to daughter's alcohol use in HIV-positive dyads (beta = 0.153, p < .05). In families with interfamilial and environmental stressors, investing in the mother-daughter relationship, in part by discussing issues related to alcohol use, is protective in nature.
26842677	Ultrasound measurement of deep and superficial abdominal muscles thickness during standing postural tasks in participants with and without chronic low back pain.	BACKGROUND: Activity of deep abdominal muscles increases the lumbar stability. Majority of previous studies indicated abdominal muscle activity dysfunction during static activity in patients with low back pain (LBP). However, the number of studies that evaluated deep abdominal muscle activity in dynamic standing activities in patients is limited, while this assessment provides better understanding of pain behavior during these activities. OBJECTIVE: Investigation of superficial and deep abdominal muscles activity in participants with chronic LBP as compared to healthy individuals during standing tasks. DESIGN: Case control study. METHODS: Ultrasound imaging was used to measure the thickness of transverse abdominis (TrA), internal oblique (IO) and external oblique (EO) muscles in female participants with (N = 45) and without chronic LBP (CLBP) (N = 45) during tests. The Biodex Balance System was used to provide standing tasks. The thickness of each muscle in a standing task was normalized to actual thickness at rest in the supine lying position to estimate its activity. RESULTS: The results indicate increases in thickness of all muscles in both groups during dynamic as compared to static standing tasks (P < 0.05, ES > 0.5). Lower percentages of thickness change for TrA muscle and higher for EO muscle were found in the patients as compared to healthy individuals during all tests (P < 0.05, ES > 1.28). CONCLUSIONS: Higher activity of superficial than deep abdominal muscles in patients as compared to healthy individuals during standing tasks indicates motor control dysfunction in patients with CLBP. Standing tasks can discriminate the individuals with and without LBP and can be progressively used in training.
27987289	Cryptococcemia in an HIV-negative patient with decompensated liver cirrhosis.	BACKGROUND: Cryptococcal infections have been mostly associated with immunocompromised individuals, 80-90% of whom have been HIV-positive patients. Increasingly, cryptococcal infections are being reported in cirrhotic patients who are HIV-negative. The underlying immunologic defects in cirrhotic patients seem to play an important role in predisposing them to cryptococcosis and affecting their morbidity and mortality. CASE PRESENTATION: We present a case of disseminated cryptococcosis in an HIV-negative patient with underlying cirrhosis, who had rapid worsening of his hyponatremia with renal failure and was unable to recover, despite aggressive measures. CONCLUSION: Cryptococcus is a more common culprit of infections seen in cirrhotic patients than what it was previously known, and a high index of suspicion is required to diagnose these patients. Identification of poor prognostic factors, early diagnosis and intervention is crucial in the management of these patients.
27486313	A role of ZnO nanoparticle electrostatic properties in cancer cell cytotoxicity.	ZnO nanoparticles (NPs) have previously been shown to exhibit selective cytotoxicity against certain types of cancerous cells suggesting their potential use in biomedical applications. In this study, we investigate the effect of surface modification of ZnO NPs on their cytotoxicity to both cancerous and primary T cells. Our results show that polyacrylic acid capping produces negatively charged ZnO NPs that are significantly more toxic compared to uncapped positively charged NPs of identical size and composition. In contrast, the greatest selectivity against cancerous cells relative to normal cells is observed with cationic NPs. In addition, differences in NP cytotoxicity inversely correlate with NP hydrodynamic size, propensity for aggregation, and dissolution profiles. The generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was also observed in the toxicity mechanism with anionic NPs generating higher levels of mitochondrial superoxide without appreciably affecting glutathione levels. Additional experiments evaluated the combined effects of charged ZnO NPs and nontoxic cationic or anionic CeO2 NPs. Results show that the CeO2 NPs offer protective effects against cytotoxicity from anionic ZnO NPs via antioxidant properties. Altogether, study data indicate that surface modification of NPs and resulting changes in their surface charge affect the level of intracellular ROS production, which can be ameliorated by the CeO2 ROS scavenger, suggesting that ROS generation is a dominant mechanism of ZnO NP cytotoxicity. These findings demonstrate the importance of surface electrostatic properties for controlling NP toxicity and illustrate an approach for engineering NPs with desired properties for potential use in biological applications.
27529786	Premature Atrial Contractions on the Screening Electrocardiogram and Risk of Ischemic Stroke: The Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke Study.	BACKGROUND: It is currently unknown if premature atrial contractions (PACs) detected on the routine screening electrocardiogram are associated with an increased risk of ischemic stroke. METHODS: We examined the association between PACs and ischemic stroke in 22,975 (mean age 64 +/- 9.2; 56% women; 40% black) participants from the Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke study. Participants who were free of stroke at baseline were included. PACs were detected from centrally read electrocardiograms at baseline. Cox regression was used to examine the association between PACs and ischemic stroke events through March 31, 2014. RESULTS: PACs were present in 1,687 (7.3%) participants at baseline. In a Cox regression model adjusted for stroke risk factors and potential confounders, PACs were associated with an increased risk of ischemic stroke (hazards ratio (HR) 1.34, 95% CI 1.04-1.74). The relationship was limited to non-lacunar infarcts (HR 1.42, 95% CI 1.08-1.87), and not lacunar strokes (HR 1.01, 95% CI 0.51-2.03). An interaction by sex was detected, with the association between PACs and ischemic stroke being stronger among women (HR 1.82, 95% CI 1.29-2.56) than men (HR 1.03, 95% CI 0.69-1.52; p-interaction = 0.0095). CONCLUSION: PACs detected on the routine electrocardiogram are associated with an increased risk for non-lacunar ischemic strokes, especially in women.

28005980	The Prognosis of Anti-Angiogenesis Treatments Combined with Standard Therapy for Newly Diagnosed Glioblastoma: A Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials.	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Although bevacizumab (BV) has been approved as second-line therapy for recurrent glioblastoma (GB), the efficacy and safety of BV for patients with newly diagnosed GB remain unclear. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We systematically searched electronic databases (PubMed, EMBASE, OVID, etc.) to identify related studies published from January 1966 and August 2016. Eight randomized controlled trials including a total of 2,185 patients with GB were included. We found that the median progression-free survival (PFS) was higher in the BV group than in the standard therapy (ST) group (pooled hazard ratio, 0.73; 95%CI, 0.62-0.86; P = 0.0001). Compared with ST, BV improved the PFS rate at 6 months (OR 3.33, 95% CI 2.73-4.06, p<0.00001) and 12 months (OR 2.10, 95% CI 1.74-2.54, p<0.00001). There were no significant differences in median overall survival between the BV and ST groups (OR, 1.01; 95%CI, 0.83-1.23; P = 0.95). The BV group had higher survival rates at 6 months (OR, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.09-1.84; P = 0.01) and 12 months (OR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.02-1.48; P = 0.03), but a low survival rate at the 36-month follow-up (OR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.32-0.98; P = 0.04). For the incidence of adverse events, three adverse outcomes were found to be significantly different between BV and ST groups, including hypertension (8.37% vs. 1.62%, p<0.000001), proteinuria (7.65% vs. 0%, p<0.001), and fatigue (14.54% vs. 9.01%, p = 0.05). CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our study indicates that combination of BV with ST for newly diagnosed GB did not improve the median overall survival but result in longer median PFS, maintaining the quality of life and functional status. However, the long-term use of BV is associated with a higher incidence of adverse events and mortality. STUDY REGISTRATION: This research was registered at PROSPERO. (Registration Number: CRD42016038247).
26843248	Nonthermal ablation of deep brain targets: A simulation study on a large animal model.	PURPOSE: Thermal ablation with transcranial MRI-guided focused ultrasound (FUS) is currently limited to central brain targets because of heating and other beam effects caused by the presence of the skull. Recently, it was shown that it is possible to ablate tissues without depositing thermal energy by driving intravenously administered microbubbles to inertial cavitation using low-duty-cycle burst sonications. A recent study demonstrated that this ablation method could ablate tissue volumes near the skull base in nonhuman primates without thermally damaging the nearby bone. However, blood-brain disruption was observed in the prefocal region, and in some cases, this region contained small areas of tissue damage. The objective of this study was to analyze the experimental model with simulations and to interpret the cause of these effects. METHODS: The authors simulated prior experiments where nonthermal ablation was performed in the brain in anesthetized rhesus macaques using a 220 kHz clinical prototype transcranial MRI-guided FUS system. Low-duty-cycle sonications were applied at deep brain targets with the ultrasound contrast agent Definity. For simulations, a 3D pseudospectral finite difference time domain tool was used. The effects of shear mode conversion, focal steering, skull aberrations, nonlinear propagation, and the presence of skull base on the pressure field were investigated using acoustic and elastic wave propagation models. RESULTS: The simulation results were in agreement with the experimental findings in the prefocal region. In the postfocal region, however, side lobes were predicted by the simulations, but no effects were evident in the experiments. The main beam was not affected by the different simulated scenarios except for a shift of about 1 mm in peak position due to skull aberrations. However, the authors observed differences in the volume, amplitude, and distribution of the side lobes. In the experiments, a single element passive cavitation detector was used to measure the inertial cavitation threshold and to determine the pressure amplitude to use for ablation. Simulations of the detector's acoustic field suggest that its maximum sensitivity was in the lower part of the main beam, which may have led to excessive exposure levels in the experiments that may have contributed to damage in the prefocal area. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, these results suggest that case-specific full wave simulations before the procedure can be useful to predict the focal and the prefocal side lobes and the extent of the resulting bioeffects produced by nonthermal ablation. Such simulations can also be used to optimally position passive cavitation detectors. The disagreement between the simulations and the experiments in the postfocal region may have been due to shielding of the ultrasound field due to microbubble activity in the focal region. Future efforts should include the effects of microbubble activity and vascularization on the pressure field.
27158473	Current techniques for visualizing RNA in cells.	Labeling RNA is of utmost interest, particularly in living cells, and thus RNA imaging is an emerging field. There are numerous methods relying on different concepts ranging from hybridization-based probes, over RNA-binding proteins to chemo-enzymatic modification of RNA. These methods have different benefits and limitations. This review aims to outline the current state-of-the-art techniques and point out their benefits and limitations.
27182447	Bell's palsy at high altitude -- an unsuspected finding.	BACKGROUND: Bell's palsy is a common condition seen in clinical practice. The aetiology of this condition is not clearly defined and neuroimaging is essential to exclude intracranial causes of infra-nuclear facial palsy. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a young soldier, who presented with Bell's palsy and neuroimaging revealed an unsuspected finding of multiple intracranial calcifications. Detailed evaluation revealed the additional diagnosis of vitamin D deficiency and secondary hyperparathyroidism due to lack of sun exposure at high altitude area. CONCLUSION: The health care practitioners, looking after the soldiers at high altitude areas should be aware of the measures to prevent vitamin D deficiency. Intracranial calcifications are uncommon in hyperparathyroidism and Bell's palsy.
27559339	Carotenoids in Staple Cereals: Metabolism, Regulation, and Genetic Manipulation.	Carotenoids play a critical role in animal and human health. Animals and humans are unable to synthesize carotenoids de novo, and therefore rely upon diet as sources of these compounds. However, major staple cereals often contain only small amounts of carotenoids in their grains. Consequently, there is considerable interest in genetic manipulation of carotenoid content in cereal grain. In this review, we focus on carotenoid metabolism and regulation in non-green plant tissues, as well as genetic manipulation in staple cereals such as rice, maize, and wheat. Significant progress has been made in three aspects: (1) seven carotenogenes play vital roles in carotenoid regulation in non-green plant tissues, including 1-deoxyxylulose-5-phosphate synthase influencing isoprenoid precursor supply, phytoene synthase, beta-cyclase, and epsilon-cyclase controlling biosynthesis, 1-hydroxy-2-methyl-2-(E)-butenyl 4-diphosphate reductase and carotenoid cleavage dioxygenases responsible for degradation, and orange gene conditioning sequestration sink; (2) provitamin A-biofortified crops, such as rice and maize, were developed by either metabolic engineering or marker-assisted breeding; (3) quantitative trait loci for carotenoid content on chromosomes 3B, 7A, and 7B were consistently identified, eight carotenogenes including 23 loci were detected, and 10 gene-specific markers for carotenoid accumulation were developed and applied in wheat improvement. A comprehensive and deeper understanding of the regulatory mechanisms of carotenoid metabolism in crops will be beneficial in improving our precision in improving carotenoid contents. Genomic selection and gene editing are emerging as transformative technologies for provitamin A biofortification.

27736901	DNApi: A De Novo Adapter Prediction Algorithm for Small RNA Sequencing Data.	With the rapid accumulation of publicly available small RNA sequencing datasets, third-party meta-analysis across many datasets is becoming increasingly powerful. Although removing the 3 adapter is an essential step for small RNA sequencing analysis, the adapter sequence information is not always available in the metadata. The information can be also erroneous even when it is available. In this study, we developed DNApi, a lightweight Python software package that predicts the 3 adapter sequence de novo and provides the user with cleansed small RNA sequences ready for down stream analysis. Tested on 539 publicly available small RNA libraries accompanied with 3 adapter sequences in their metadata, DNApi shows near-perfect accuracy (98.5%) with fast runtime (~2.85 seconds per library) and efficient memory usage (~43 MB on average). In addition to 3 adapter prediction, it is also important to classify whether the input small RNA libraries were already processed, i.e. the 3 adapters were removed. DNApi perfectly judged that given another batch of datasets, 192 publicly available processed libraries were "ready-to-map" small RNA sequence. DNApi is compatible with Python 2 and 3, and is available at https://github.com/jnktsj/DNApi. The 731 small RNA libraries used for DNApi evaluation were from human tissues and were carefully and manually collected. This study also provides readers with the curated datasets that can be integrated into their studies.
27046059	Hepatoprotective Effect of Wheat-Based Solid-State Fermented Antrodia cinnamomea in Carbon Tetrachloride-Induced Liver Injury in Rat.	Antrodia cinnamomea (A. cinnamomea) is an indigenous medical fungus in Taiwan and has multiple biological functions, including hepatoprotective and immune-modulatory effects. Currently, the commercially available A. cinnamomea are mainly liquid- and solid-state fermented A. cinnamomea. However, the hepatoprotective effect of solid-state fermented A. cinnamomea has never been reported. Here we evaluate the ability of air-dried, ground and non-extracted wheat-based solid-state fermented A. cinnamomea (WFAC) to protect against carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-induced hepatic injury in vivo. The results showed that oral administration of WFAC dose dependently (180, 540 and 1080 mg/kg) ameliorated the increase in plasma aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase levels caused by chronic repeated CCl4 intoxication in rats. WFAC significantly reduced the CCl4-induced increase in hepatic lipid peroxidation levels and hydroxyproline contents, as well as reducing the spleen weight and water content of the liver. WFAC also restored the hepatic soluble protein synthesis and plasma albumin concentration in CCl4-intoxicated rats, but it did not affect the activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase, or glutathione peroxidase. In addition, a hepatic morphological analysis showed that the hepatic fibrosis and necrosis induced by CCl4 were significantly ameliorated by WFAC. Furthermore, the body weights of control rats and WFAC-administered rats were not significantly different, and no adverse effects were observed in WFAC-administered rats. These results indicate that WFAC is a nontoxic hepatoprotective agent against chronic CCl4-induced hepatic injury.
27430063	[FEATURES OF THE CONTENT OF MOVABLE FORMS OF HEAVY METALS AND SELENIUM IN SOILS OF THE YAROSLAVL REGION].	With the use of the method of inversion voltammetry there was analyzed the content of movableforms of trace elements: (selenium, zinc, copper lead, cadmium) in soils in the Yaroslavl district of the Yaroslavl region, and also content of zinc, copper lead, cadmium in soils and snow cover in the city of Yaroslavl. According to values of concentrations of movable compounds in soils determined trace elements can be ranked into the following row: zinc > lead > copper > selenium > cadmium. There was revealed insufficient if compared with literature data concentrations, content of movable compounds of selenium, copper and zinc in examined explored soils. The maximal concentrations of lead are revealed in the close proximity to both the city of Yaroslavl and large highways of the city. It indicates to the anthropogenic pollution of soils by this element.
27243628	Effect of Surface Modifications of Ti40Zr10Cu38Pd12 Bulk Metallic Glass and Ti-6Al-4V Alloy on Human Osteoblasts In Vitro Biocompatibility.	The use of biocompatible materials, including bulk metallic glasses (BMGs), for tissue regeneration and transplantation is increasing. The good mechanical and corrosion properties of Ti40Zr10Cu38Pd12 BMG and its previously described biocompatibility makes it a potential candidate for medical applications. However, it is known that surface properties like topography might play an important role in regulating cell adhesion, proliferation and differentiation. Thus, in the present study, Ti40Zr10Cu38Pd12 BMG and Ti6-Al-4V alloy were surface-modified electrochemically (nanomesh) or physically (microscratched) to investigate the effect of material topography on human osteoblasts cells (Saos-2) adhesion, proliferation and differentiation. For comparative purposes, the effect of mirror-like polished surfaces was also studied. Electrochemical treatments led to a highly interconnected hierarchical porous structure rich in oxides, which have been described to improve corrosion resistance, whereas microscratched surfaces showed a groove pattern with parallel trenches. Cell viability was higher than 96% for the three topographies tested and for both alloy compositions. In all cases, cells were able to adhere, proliferate and differentiate on the alloys, hence indicating that surface topography plays a minor role on these processes, although a clear cell orientation was observed on microscratched surfaces. Overall, our results provide further evidence that Ti40Zr10Cu38Pd12 BMG is an excellent candidate, in the present two topographies, for bone repair purposes.
27375585	Anti-viral Effect of Bifidobacterium adolescentis against Noroviruses.	This study aims to investigate the effect of Bifidobacterium adolescentis against noroviruses (NoVs). Murine norovirus-1 (MNV-1) used as a surrogate was detected by plaque assay and RT-qPCR. Human NoV virus like particles (VLPs) were detected by cell-binding assay. It was shown that the presence of B. adolescentis could inhibit the multiplication of MNV-1 on RAW 264.7 cells within 48 h of co-incubation period at 37 degrees C. This inhibition did not occur at the viral binding stage, as no difference was observed in MNV-1 genomic copies collected from washed RAW 264.7 cells without and with B. adolescentis after co-incubation for 1 h at room temperature. Meanwhile, the presence of B. adolescentis decreased the binding of human NoV GI.1 VLPs to both Caco-2 cells and HT-29 cells, while no reduction was induced for the binding of human NoV GII.4 VLPs to Caco-2 cells.
27738916	Use of Antibiotics and Antimicrobial Resistance in Veterinary Medicine as Exemplified by the Swine Pathogen Streptococcus suis.	Use of antimicrobial agents in veterinary medicine is essential to control infectious diseases, thereby keeping animals healthy and animal products safe for the consumer. On the other hand, development and spread of antimicrobial resistance is of major concern for public health. Streptococcus (S.) suis reflects a typical bacterial pathogen in modern swine production due to its facultative pathogenic nature and wide spread in the pig population. Thus, in the present review we focus on certain current aspects and problems related to antimicrobial use and resistance in S. suis as a paradigm for a bacterial pathogen affecting swine husbandry worldwide. The review includes (i) general aspects of antimicrobial use and resistance in veterinary medicine with emphasis on swine, (ii) genetic resistance mechanisms of S. suis known to contribute to bacterial survival under antibiotic selection pressure, and (iii) possible other factors which may contribute to problems in antimicrobial therapy of S. suis infections, such as bacterial persister cell formation, biofilm production, and co-infections. The latter shows that we hardly understand the complexity of factors affecting the success of antimicrobial treatment of (porcine) infectious diseases and underlines the need for further research in this field.
26831540	The cohort study for the determination of reference values for spinopelvic parameters (T1 pelvic angle and global tilt) in elderly volunteers.	PURPOSE: T1 pelvic angle (TPA) and global tilt (GT) are spinopelvic parameters that account for trunk anteversion and pelvic retroversion. To investigate spinopelvic parameters, especially TPA and GT, in Japanese adults and determine norms for each parameter related to health-related quality of life (HRQOL). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Six hundred and fifty-six volunteers (262 men and 394 women) aged 50-92 years (mean, 72.8 years) were enrolled in this study. The incidence of vertebral fracture, spondylolisthesis and coronal malalignment were measured. Five spinopelvic parameters (TPA, GT, sagittal vertical axis [SVA], pelvic tilt [PT], and pelvic incidence-lumbar lordosis [PI-LL]) were measured using whole spine standing radiographs. The mean values for each parameter were estimated by sex and decade of life. HRQOL measures, including the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) and EuroQuol-5D (EQ-5D), were also obtained. Pearson's correlation coefficients were determined between each parameter and HRQOL measure. Moreover, the factors contributing to the QOL score were calculated using logistic regression with age, sex, the existence of vertebral fracture and spondylolisthesis, coronal malalignment (coronal curve >30 degrees ) and sagittal malalignment (SVA >95 mm) as explanatory variables and the presence of disability (ODI >40) as a free variable. RESULTS: The mean values for the spinopelvic parameters were as follows: TPA, 17.9 degrees ; GT, 23.2 degrees ; SVA, 50.2 mm; PT, 18.6 degrees ; and PI-LL, 7.5 degrees . TPA and GT strongly correlated with each other (r = 0.990) and with the other spinopelvic parameters. TPA and GT correlated with ODI (r = 0.339, r = 0.348, respectively) and EQ-5D (r = -0.285, r = -0.288, respectively), similar to those for SVA. TPA, GT, PT, and PI-LL were significantly higher in women than in men. PT and PI-LL gradually increased with age, while TPA, GT, and SVA tended to deteriorate after the 7th decade. Based on a logistic regression analysis, the deterioration of ODI was mostly affected by the sagittal malalignment. The TPA and GT cut-off values for severe disability (ODI >40) based on linear regression modeling were 26.0 degrees and 33.7 degrees , respectively. CONCLUSIONS: We determined reference values for spinopelvic parameters in elderly volunteers. Similar to SVA, TPA and GT correlated with HRQOL. TPA, GT, PT, and PI-LL were worse in women and progressed with age.
27812163	Use of Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) as Part of the Oncological Treatment: Survey about Patients' Attitude towards CAM in a University-Based Oncology Center in Germany.	INTRODUCTION: To understand if and which patients would be open-minded to Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) use parallel to their oncological treatment. Moreover, we sought to determine which methods are most accepted and which are the primary motivators to use CAM. METHODS: We developed and anonymously conducted a questionnaire for patients in the oncology center (TU Munich). Questions focus on different CAM methods, previous experiences, and willingness to apply or use CAM when offered in a university-based setting. RESULTS: A total of 171 of 376 patients (37.4% women, 62.0% men, 0.6% unknown) participated. This corresponds to a return rate of 45%. Median age was 64 years (17-87 years). Of all participants, 15.2% used CAM during their oncological therapy; 32.7% have used it in the past. The majority (81.9%) was not using CAM during therapy; 55.5% have not used CAM in the past respectively. The analysis revealed a significant correlation between education and CAM use during therapy (r = 0.18; p = 0.02), and CAM use in the past (r = 0.17; p = 0.04). Of all patients using CAM during therapy, favored methods were food supplements (42.3%), vitamins/minerals (42.3%), massage (34.6%). Motivations are especially the reduction of side effect and stress, the positive effect of certain CAM-treatments on the immune system and tumor therapy. Results showed no difference between women and men. Most patients not having had any experience with CAM complain about the deficiency of information by their treating oncologist (31.4%) as well as missing treatment possibilities (54.3%). CONCLUSION: Since many patients believe in study results demonstrating the efficacy of CAM, it stresses our task to develop innovative study protocols to investigate the outcomes of certain CAM on symptom reduction or other endpoints. Thus, prospective trials and innovative evidence-based treatment concepts to include CAM into high-end oncology is what patients demand and what a modern oncology center should offer.
27042212	Microbial network for waste activated sludge cascade utilization in an integrated system of microbial electrolysis and anaerobic fermentation.	BACKGROUND: Bioelectrochemical systems have been considered a promising novel technology that shows an enhanced energy recovery, as well as generation of value-added products. A number of recent studies suggested that an enhancement of carbon conversion and biogas production can be achieved in an integrated system of microbial electrolysis cell (MEC) and anaerobic digestion (AD) for waste activated sludge (WAS). Microbial communities in integrated system would build a thorough energetic and metabolic interaction network regarding fermentation communities and electrode respiring communities. The characterization of integrated community structure and community shifts is not well understood, however, it starts to attract interest of scientists and engineers. RESULTS: In the present work, energy recovery and WAS conversion are comprehensively affected by typical pretreated biosolid characteristics. We investigated the interaction of fermentation communities and electrode respiring communities in an integrated system of WAS fermentation and MEC for hydrogen recovery. A high energy recovery was achieved in the MECs feeding WAS fermentation liquid through alkaline pretreatment. Some anaerobes belonging to Firmicutes (Acetoanaerobium, Acetobacterium, and Fusibacter) showed synergistic relationship with exoelectrogens in the degradation of complex organic matter or recycling of MEC products (H2). High protein and polysaccharide but low fatty acid content led to the dominance of Proteiniclasticum and Parabacteroides, which showed a delayed contribution to the extracellular electron transport leading to a slow cascade utilization of WAS. CONCLUSIONS: Efficient pretreatment could supply more short-chain fatty acids and higher conductivities in the fermentative liquid, which facilitated mass transfer in anodic biofilm. The overall performance of WAS cascade utilization was substantially related to the microbial community structures, which in turn depended on the initial pretreatment to enhance WAS fermentation. It is worth noting that species in AD and MEC communities are able to build complex networks of interaction, which have not been sufficiently studied so far. It is therefore important to understand how choosing operational parameters can influence reactor performances. The current study highlights the interaction of fermentative bacteria and exoelectrogens in the integrated system.
27087939	Fam3c modulates osteogenic cell differentiation and affects bone volume and cortical bone mineral density.	Fam3c, a cytokine-like growth factor, has been suggested to have a role in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), tumor growth and metastasis. A single-nucleotide polymorphism affecting bone mineral density has been found in the first intron of the Fam3c gene in a study analyzing an Asian population cohort. Other independent studies on different population cohorts have found the fam3c locus to be associated with bone mineral density and fractures. In order to investigate the role of Fam3c in bone biology, we have generated a Fam3c knock-out (KO) mouse strain. The Fam3c KO mice were found to have normal appearance, behavior and fertility, but small changes in bone morphology and content were also observed. Micro-CT analysis of tibiae of the female mice revealed decreased number of trabeculae. In male mice the changes in the bone phenotype were smaller, but hematological changes were observed. Furthermore, there was a negative correlation between body weight and tibial trabecular and cortical bone volume in the male KO mice. There was a small increase in cortical bone mineral density, but in the lateral direction of tibiae the breaking strength was reduced. Fam3c KO bone marrow cells showed accelerated osteogenic differentiation and mineralization in vitro. The reduced number of bone trabeculae in Fam3c KO mice and the stimulated osteogenic differentiation indicate a role for Fam3c in osteoblast differentiation and bone homeostasis.
26880419	Differential expression of beta-tubulin isotypes in different life stages of Parascaris spp after exposure to thiabendazole.	Anthelmintic resistance (AR) to macrocyclic lactones (ML) has been described in Parascaris of horses world-wide. In contrast, benzimidazoles (BZ) are still effective, although reduced efficacy to this drug class was recently reported. The mode of action of BZ is binding to beta-tubulin, which prevents polymerisation of microtubules. In this study, beta-tubulin gene expression of isotypes 1 and 2 was investigated at seven time points (0, 6, 24, 72, 96 and 120 h) during embryogenesis and in adult worms. In addition, an in ovo larval developmental test was developed to study beta-tubulin gene expression of both isotypes in parasacaris eggs after exposure to different concentrations of thiabendazole (TBZ) for five days at 25 degrees C. A strong pattern of differential expression of beta-tubulin and isotype 1 was observed in all stages, while isotype 2 expression was mainly found at an early phase of the embryogenesis. For isotype 1, a 5-fold increase was observed during the first 48 h, but gene expression gradually decreased after 72, 96 and 120 h. Isotype 2 was only expressed during the first 24h, followed by a 130-fold decrease at (time points) 72, 96 and 120 h. The in ovo larval developmental test, in which we exposed initially unembryonated eggs to increased concentrations of TBZ, did affect isotype 1 gene expression but not isotype 2. This assumes that each isotype has specific functions in different life stages. This is in agreement with the 'multi-tubulin' hypothesis, which states that different tubulin isotypes are required for specialised microtubule functions. Isotype 1 is the most likely drug target for BZs, as isotype 2 was only expressed at very low levels later in development. Increasing concentrations of TBZ altered beta-tubulin isotype 1 gene expression after exposure of the eggs for five days, but this was not seen for isotype 2.
27749200	Effects of exercise, patient education, and resource support on women with fibromyalgia: An extended long-term study.	This research examined whether a long-term, multi-component program positively affected physical fitness, pain and fatigue in seven women with fibromyalgia syndrome. These women lived independently in the community. They attended a university-based program 3 days per week, 1 hour per session, year-around for many years. They were evaluated periodically with a fitness test and rating scale regarding pain and fatigue. Results from when they began the program versus most recently are provided. All of these women showed various positive results from participation in the program.
27419010	Utilization of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) in patients diagnosed with diabetes: Analysis from the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey.	OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to determine if a difference exists in the proportion of visits for the prescribing of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI), or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) in diabetic patients during 2007-2010. METHODS: This retrospective, cross-sectional, observational study included adults diagnosed with diabetes mellitus from the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS) during 2007-2010. Weighted chi-square tests and a multivariable logistic regression model were used to analyze associations between ACEI/ARB prescriptions and predictors of interest. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were reported. RESULTS: An unweighted total of 13,590 outpatient ambulatory care visits were identified for adult patients with diabetes without contraindications to ACEIs or ARBs in the NAMCS for the years studied. No statistically significant increase in the proportion of visits with an ACEI/ARB prescription was identified for years 2007-2010 (28.1% in 2007 to 32.2% in 2010). Females (OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.69- 0.89), patients 18-39 years old (OR 0.56, 95% CI 0.43- 0.75), and Medicare users (OR 0.81, 95% CI 0.70- 0.94) were significantly less likely to receive an ACEI/ARB prescription. Patients with hypertension (OR 2.80, 95% CI 2.39-3.29), hyperlipidemia (OR 1.42, 95% CI 1.22-1.65), and ischemic heart disease (OR 1.36, 95% CI 1.10-1.70) were significantly more likely to receive an ACEI/ARB prescription. CONCLUSIONS: Despite extensive evidence showing the benefits of ACEI/ARB medications in diabetic patients, disparities of treatment remain evident.
27119337	Differential Expression of Long Noncoding RNAs between Sperm Samples from Diabetic and Non-Diabetic Mice.	To investigate the potential core reproduction-related genes associated with the development of diabetes, the expression profiles of long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) and messenger RNA (mRNA) in the sperm of diabetic mice were studied. We used microarray analysis to detect the expression of lncRNAs and coding transcripts in six diabetic and six normal sperm samples, and differentially expressed lncRNAs and mRNAs were identified through Volcano Plot filtering. The function of differentially expressed mRNA was determined by pathway and gene ontology (GO) analysis, and the function of lncRNAs was studied by subgroup analysis and their physical or functional relationships with corresponding mRNAs. A total of 7721 lncRNAs and 6097 mRNAs were found to be differentially expressed between the diabetic and normal sperm groups. The diabetic sperm exhibited aberrant expression profiles for lncRNAs and mRNAs, and GO and pathway analyses showed that the functions of differentially expressed mRNAs were closely related with many processes involved in the development of diabetes. Furthermore, potential core genes that might play important roles in the pathogenesis of diabetes-related low fertility were revealed by lncRNA- and mRNA-interaction studies, as well as coding-noncoding gene co-expression analysis based on the microarray expression profiles.
26929458	Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography in ischemic cardiomyopathy: an update.	Ischemic cardiomyopathy is one of the major health problems worldwide, representing a significant part of mortality in the general population nowadays. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMRI) and cardiac computed tomography (CCT) are noninvasive imaging methods that serve as useful tools in the diagnosis of coronary artery disease and may also help in screening individuals with risk factors for developing this illness. Technological developments of CMRI and CCT have contributed to the rise of several clinical indications of these imaging methods complementarily to other investigation methods, particularly in cases where they are inconclusive. In terms of accuracy, CMRI and CCT are similar to the other imaging methods, with few absolute contraindications and minimal risks of adverse side-effects. This fact strengthens these methods as powerful and safe tools in the management of patients. The present study is aimed at describing the role played by CMRI and CCT in the diagnosis of ischemic cardiomyopathies.
27645738	Use of CE to Analyze Solutes in Pico- and Nano-Liter Samples from Plant Cells and Rhizosphere.	This chapter describes the use of capillary electrophoresis (CE) in the accurate quantitative mapping of small molecules and ions in intact function tissues between individual cells at single cell resolution. It can also be used for the analysis of the heterogeneity of soil surrounding roots at similar spatial resolution, providing a link between plant and environment. No pretreatment or genetic manipulation of the plant is required. The application is an extension of the Single Cell Sampling and Analysis technique (SiCSA), in which glass micromanipulation of microcapillaries allows samples in the pl and nl volume range to be obtained and manipulated under paraffin oil (to prevent evaporation) before being introduced to the CE column. An advantage of this approach is that the entire sample can be brought to the detector (without the loading losses associated with other techniques). The power of SiCSA-CE is that the results can be directly related to a range of other single-cell resolution parameters ranging from mechanical and hydraulic properties to gene expression. Several protocols and (contrasting) applications are provided.
27281127	Extracellular Matrix in Atherosclerosis: Hyaluronan and Proteoglycans Insights.	BACKGROUND: Atherosclerosis, a chronic inflammatory disease of the blood vessel wall, is the most common cause of cardiovascular pathologies. Hyaluronan, the major polysaccharide involved in this process, plays a pivotal role acting as a modulator of all inflammatory stages, affecting the behavior of both endothelial and smooth muscle cells. OBJECTIVE: The inflammatory condition is the main reason of the increased deposition of extracellular matrix, that in turn, traps lipoproteins and inflammatory/growth factors from the circulation within the vessel wall and thicken the arterial wall. Therefore, this chronic condition that continuously affects the arterial walls in a specific area causes a severe remodeling of the tissue architecture and a drastic change in the resident cell behavior. METHODS: Because of the great complexity of the extracellular matrix in the arterial wall, we investigate the modification in the different layers of the vessels with a particular attention to hyaluronan and proteoglycans and to the events that affects their normal turnover. RESULTS: Hyaluronan, the major polysaccharide involved in this process, plays a pivotal role acting as a modulator of all inflammatory stages, affecting the behavior of both endothelial and smooth muscle cells. Moreover, glycosaminoglycans and proteoglycans had been shown to change during the lesion progression, and to possess the chemical features essential for lipid retention, immune system activation, smooth cells proliferation and macrophages recruitment. CONCLUSION: The ECM characteristics should be investigated in order to understand their prevention potentials as well as their negative impact on the onset of the disease.
26863616	Lamellipodia and Membrane Blebs Drive Efficient Electrotactic Migration of Rat Walker Carcinosarcoma Cells WC 256.	The endogenous electric field (EF) may provide an important signal for directional cell migration during wound healing, embryonic development and cancer metastasis but the mechanism of cell electrotaxis is poorly understood. Additionally, there is no research addressing the question on the difference in electrotactic motility of cells representing various strategies of cell movement-specifically blebbing vs. lamellipodial migration. In the current study we constructed a unique experimental model which allowed for the investigation of electrotactic movement of cells of the same origin but representing different modes of cell migration: weakly adherent, spontaneously blebbing (BC) and lamellipodia forming (LC) WC256 cells. We report that both BC and LC sublines show robust cathodal migration in a physiological EF (1-3 V/cm). The directionality of cell movement was completely reversible upon reversing the field polarity. However, the full reversal of cell direction after the change of EF polarity was much faster in the case of BC (10 minutes) than LC cells (30 minutes). We also investigated the distinct requirements for Rac, Cdc42 and Rho pathways and intracellular Ca2+ in electrotaxis of WC256 sublines forming different types of cell protrusions. It was found that Rac1 is required for directional movement of LC to a much greater extent than for BC, but Cdc42 and RhoA are more crucial for BC than for LC cells. The inhibition of ROCK did not affect electrotaxis of LC in contrast to BC cells. The results also showed that intracellular Ca2+ is essential only for the electrotactic reaction of BC cells. Moreover, inhibition of MLCK and myosin II did not affect the electrotaxis of LC in contrast to BC cells. In conclusion, our results revealed that both lamellipodia and membrane blebs can efficiently drive electrotactic migration of WC 256 carcinosarcoma cells, however directional migration is mediated by different signalling pathways.
26963390	Monitoring of Heart and Breathing Rates Using Dual Cameras on a Smartphone.	Some smartphones have the capability to process video streams from both the front- and rear-facing cameras simultaneously. This paper proposes a new monitoring method for simultaneous estimation of heart and breathing rates using dual cameras of a smartphone. The proposed approach estimates heart rates using a rear-facing camera, while at the same time breathing rates are estimated using a non-contact front-facing camera. For heart rate estimation, a simple application protocol is used to analyze the varying color signals of a fingertip placed in contact with the rear camera. The breathing rate is estimated from non-contact video recordings from both chest and abdominal motions. Reference breathing rates were measured by a respiration belt placed around the chest and abdomen of a subject; reference heart rates (HR) were determined using the standard electrocardiogram. An automated selection of either the chest or abdominal video signal was determined by choosing the signal with a greater autocorrelation value. The breathing rate was then determined by selecting the dominant peak in the power spectrum. To evaluate the performance of the proposed methods, data were collected from 11 healthy subjects. The breathing ranges spanned both low and high frequencies (6-60 breaths/min), and the results show that the average median errors from the reflectance imaging on the chest and the abdominal walls based on choosing the maximum spectral peak were 1.43% and 1.62%, respectively. Similarly, HR estimates were also found to be accurate.
27842299	Docosahexaenoic Acid.	Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is a long-chain, highly unsaturated omega-3 (n-3) fatty acid. It has a structure that gives it unique physical and functional properties. DHA is metabolically related to other n-3 fatty acids: it can be synthesised from the plant essential fatty acid alpha-linolenic acid (ALA). However, this pathway does not appear to be very efficient in many individuals, although the conversion of ALA to DHA is much better in young women than in young men. Furthermore, young infants may be more efficient converters of ALA to DHA than many adults, although the conversion rate is variable among infants. Many factors have been identified that affect the rate of conversion. The implication of poor conversion is that preformed DHA needs to be consumed. DHA is found in fairly high amounts in seafood, especially fatty fish, and in various forms of n-3 supplements. The amount of DHA in seafood and in supplements varies. Breast milk contains DHA. DHA is found esterified into complex lipids within the bloodstream, in adipose stores and in cell membranes. Its concentration in different compartments varies greatly. The brain and eye have high DHA contents compared to other organs. DHA is especially concentrated in the grey matter of the brain and in the rod outer segments of the retina. In the brain DHA is involved in neuronal signalling, while in the eye it is involved in the quality of vision. DHA is accumulated in the brain and eye late in pregnancy and in early infancy. A lower DHA content is linked to poorer cognitive development and visual function. DHA affects cell and tissue physiology and function through numerous mechanisms, including alterations in membrane structure and function, in membrane protein function, in cellular signalling and in lipid mediator production.
26908778	Phosphorus metabolism in peritoneal dialysis- and haemodialysis-treated patients.	BACKGROUND: Phosphorus control is generally considered to be better in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients as compared with haemodialysis (HD) patients. Predialysis phosphorus concentrations are misleading as a measure of phosphorus exposure in HD, as these neglect significant dialysis-related fluctuations. METHODS: Parameters of mineral metabolism, including parathyroid hormone (PTH) and fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF-23), were determined in 79 HD and 61 PD patients. In PD, phosphorus levels were determined mid-morning. In HD, time-averaged phosphorus concentrations were modelled from measurements before and after the mid-week dialysis session. Weekly renal, dialytic and total phosphorus clearances as well as total mass removal were calculated from urine and dialysate collections. RESULTS: Time-averaged serum phosphorus concentrations in HD (3.5 +/- 1.0 mg/dL) were significantly lower than the mid-morning concentrations in PD (5.0 +/- 1.4 mg/dL, P < 0.0001). In contrast, predialysis phosphorus concentrations (4.6 +/- 1.4 mg/dL) were not different from PD. PTH and FGF-23 levels were significantly higher in PD. Despite higher residual renal function, total phosphorus clearance was significantly lower in PD (P < 0.0001). Total phosphorus mass removal, conversely, was significantly higher in PD (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that the time-averaged phosphorus concentrations in patients treated with PD are higher as compared with patients treated with HD. Despite a better preserved renal function, total phosphorus clearance is lower in patients treated with PD. Additional studies are needed to confirm these findings in a population with a different demographic profile and dietary background and to define clinical implications.
27445947	Differences in the Association between Segment and Language: Early Bilinguals Pattern with Monolinguals and Are Less Accurate than Late Bilinguals.	Early bilinguals often show as much sensitivity to L2-specific contrasts as monolingual speakers of the L2, but most work on cross-language speech perception has focused on isolated segments, and typically only on neighboring vowels or stop contrasts. In tasks that include sounds in context, listeners' success is more variable, so segment discrimination in isolation may not adequately represent the phonetic detail in stored representations. The current study explores the relationship between language experience and sensitivity to segmental cues in context by comparing the categorization patterns of monolingual English listeners and early and late Spanish-English bilinguals. Participants categorized nonce words containing different classes of English- and Spanish-specific sounds as being more English-like or more Spanish-like; target segments included phonemic cues, cues for which there is no analogous sound in the other language, or phonetic cues, cues for which English and Spanish share the category but for which each language varies in its phonetic implementation. Listeners' language categorization accuracy and reaction times were analyzed. Our results reveal a largely uniform categorization pattern across listener groups: Spanish cues were categorized more accurately than English cues, and phonemic cues were easier for listeners to categorize than phonetic cues. There were no differences in the sensitivity of monolinguals and early bilinguals to language-specific cues, suggesting that the early bilinguals' exposure to Spanish did not fundamentally change their representations of English phonology. However, neither did the early bilinguals show more sensitivity than the monolinguals to Spanish sounds. The late bilinguals however, were significantly more accurate than either of the other groups. These findings indicate that listeners with varying exposure to English and Spanish are able to use language-specific cues in a nonce-word language categorization task. Differences in how, and not only when, a language was acquired may influence listener sensitivity to more difficult cues, and the advantage for phonemic cues may reflect the greater salience of categories unique to each language. Implications for foreign-accent categorization and cross-language speech perception are discussed, and future directions are outlined to better understand how salience varies across language-specific phonemic and phonetic cues.
27077605	High-intensity light-emitting diode vs fluorescent tubes for intensive phototherapy in neonates.	BACKGROUND: Special blue fluorescent tubes are recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) as the most effective light source for lowering serum bilirubin. A high-intensity light-emitting diode ('super LED') could render intensive phototherapy more effective than the above conventional methods. This study compared the efficacy and safety of a high-intensity light-emitting diode bed vs conventional intensive phototherapy with triple fluorescent tube units as a rescue treatment for severe unconjugated neonatal hyperbilirubinaemia. METHOD: This was a randomised, prospective trial. Two hundred jaundiced neonates >/= 35 weeks gestation who met the criteria for intensive phototherapy as per AAP guidelines were randomly assigned to be treated either with triple fluorescent tube units (group 1, n = 100) or a super LED bed (group 2, n = 100). The outcome was the avoidance of exchange transfusion by successful control of hyperbilirubinaemia. RESULTS: Statistically significant higher success rates of intensive phototherapy were achieved among neonates treated with super LED (group 2) than in those treated conventionally (group 1) (87% vs 64%, P = 0.003). Significantly higher 'bilirubin decline' rates were reported in both haemolytic and non-haemolytic subgroups treated with the super LED bed compared with a similar sub-population in the conventionally treated group. Comparable numbers of neonates in both groups developed rebound jaundice (8% vs 10% of groups 1 and 2, respectively). Side-effects were mild in both groups, but higher rates of hyperthermia (12% vs 0%, P = 0.03), dehydration (8% vs 2%, P = 0.26) and skin rash (39% vs 1%, P = 0.002) were reported in the fluorescent tubes-treated group compared with the LED group. CONCLUSIONS: Super LED is a safe rescue treatment for severe neonatal hyperbilirubinaemia, and its implementation may reduce the need for exchange transfusion.
26923396	Emerging Potential of Natural Products as an Alternative Strategy to Pharmacological Agents Used Against Metabolic Disorders.	BACKGROUND: Human metabolism is an essential biological process that involves the consumption of different substrates to ensure the nutritional and energetic needs of cells. The disruption of this highly regulated system constitutes the onset of several disorders/dysfunctions such as diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular diseases and hypertension. OBJECTIVE: In this review, we propose to discuss promising natural products that can act as modulators of cell metabolism and point towards possible targets to take into account in the development of new therapies against metabolic diseases. METHODS: After having defined our main focus, we undertook an intensive search of bibliographic databases to select the peer-reviewed papers that fits within the review thematic. The information of the screened papers was described in an organized manner through the review and different types of studies were included. RESULTS: Two hundred and seventy papers were included in the review, as well as one reliable website from the World Health Organization. Several articles described that pharmacological agents are commonly used to counteract metabolic disorders. However, in many cases these products are insufficient, represent high costs to health care systems and are associated with several undesirable effects, highlighting the need to search for new therapies. Notably, many papers reported the promising results of natural products in the treatment of several metabolic disorders, constituting a possible alternative or complementary strategy to pharmacological agents. CONCLUSION: The findings of this review confirm that the currently available treatments for metabolic disorders and its associated complications remain far below the expected results.
27052494	The mutual effect of pregestational body mass index, maternal hyperglycemia and gestational weight gain on adverse pregnancy outcomes.	OBJECTIVE: To investigate the mutual effect of obesity, gestational diabetes (GDM) and gestational weight gain (GWG) on adverse pregnancy outcomes. METHODS: Charts of patients who delivered in our hospital between June 2001 and June 2006 singleton, live births >24 weeks gestation were reviewed. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression were used to assess pregnancy outcomes defined as large for gestational age (LGA), primary cesarean section (PCS) and a composite outcome of LGA and/or PCS. RESULTS: A total of 8595 women were included. Frequency of composite outcome increased with increasing body mass index (BMI), increasing hyperglycemia and above-recommended GWG. In the multivariate logistic regression analysis compared to women with normal BMI, odds ratio (OR) for composite outcome was 1.23 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.06-1.44) in overweight women, OR = 1.86 (1.51-2.31) in obese women and in severe obesity OR = 2.97 (2.15-4.11). Compared to normoglycemic women, odds for composite outcome in women with abnormal glucose challenge test OR = 1.46 (1.20-1.79), impaired glucose tolerance OR = 1.65 (1.14-2.4) and GDM OR = 1.56 (1.16-2.10). Women with GWG above recommended had OR = 1.58, (1.37-1.81) for composite outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Higher pregestational BMI, maternal hyperglycemia and above-recommended GWG independently contribute to adverse pregnancy outcomes. Furthermore, there is mutual effect between these three factors and adverse outcomes. Appropriate pregestational weight and adequate GWG might reduce risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes.
26949314	Macrosomic Births in a Tertiary Public Hospital: A Survey of Maternal Characteristics and Fetal Outcome.	BACKGROUND: Macrosomic fetuses are high risk with their delivery process being associated with potential risk to both mother and baby The aim of this study is to determine the incidence of macrosomic births and the associated maternal characteristics and to ascertain the fetal outcome. METHODS: It was a retrospective survey of maternal characteristics and pregnancy outcome of macrosomic births. Comparison was made with the next selected normal birth weight delivery during the study period. RESULTS: There were 8607 deliveries during the period (3 years) reviewed. Of this, 306 were macrosomic deliveries, a frequency of 3.6%. The mean weight for macrosomic babies was 4.23kg (range 4.01 - 5.62kg). There was a higher mean maternal weight and gestational age of mothers with macrosomic deliveries compared to mothers in the control group, (85.87 +/- 19.39kg vs 74.92 +/- 19.11kg P<0.01; and 41.51+/-1.46 vs 39.02+/-1.29, P<0.001). Caesarean delivery was significantly associated with macrosomic births compared to controls, p<0.0001, odds ratio 3.977. Also, asphyxia and shoulder dystocia occurred more in macrosomic babies, 10.4% vs 2.9% and 2.28% vs 0.65%, P<0.001. The majority of the asphyxiated babies amongst macroomic births were following vagina delivery compared to caesarean delivery, (65.6% vs 34.4%) p= 0.001. There were 3 cases of still birth in the macrosomic deliveries, but no maternal deaths were encountered. CONCLUSION: Macrosomic births could be tragic. Although delivery outcome seems better with a caesarean section, good fetal outcome can only be assured on the premise of astute labour and delivery management.
26855060	"It Was My Fault": Bullied Students' Causal and Controllable Attributions in Bullying Blogs.	Student bullying is a growing and damaging social problem. The devastating outcomes bullied individuals often experience due to such treatment make understanding this phenomenon imperative. Utilizing Heider's (1958) attribution theory, this study explores how bullied students (n = 100) attribute locus of causality and controllability for their victimization in 5 bullying blogs. Findings from this investigation reveal that (a) male and female bloggers' causal and controllable attributions do not differ; (b) bloggers most often attribute blame to bullies, although a noteworthy portion also attribute internal causation; and (c) bloggers often attribute bullying as uncontrollable for several reasons. This study also identifies factors that influence shifts in negative attributions about bullying. These findings inform bullying programs with the hope of reducing destructive attribution formations that potentially lead to prolonged victimization and detrimental consequences.
26841015	Inhibition of the Bruton Tyrosine Kinase Pathway in B-Cell Lymphoproliferative Disorders.	Activation of the Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) pathway plays an important role in the pathophysiology of a number of B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders (LPDs). A number of preclinical studies support inhibiting BTK as a mechanism to treat LPDs. Clinically, BTK inhibitors, specifically ibrutinib, have shown to be safe and effective on treating patients with indolent B-cell lymphomas and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Ibrutinib has recently gained approval for the treatment of patients with mantle cell lymphoma, Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia, and CLL. Ongoing clinical trials are investigating ibrutinib and other BTK inhibitors alone or in combination for the treatment of mantle cell lymphoma, Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia, CLL, activated B-cell-type diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, and follicular lymphoma, among others. The objective of this review is to succinctly summarize the current body of evidence on BTK inhibition in patients with B-cell LPDs.
27199996	Host Lipid Bodies as Platforms for Intracellular Survival of Protozoan Parasites.	Pathogens induce several changes in the host cell signaling and trafficking mechanisms in order to evade and manipulate the immune response. One prominent pathogen-mediated change is the formation of lipid-rich organelles, termed lipid bodies (LBs) or lipid droplets, in the host cell cytoplasm. Protozoan parasites, which contribute expressively to the burden of infectious diseases worldwide, are able to induce LB genesis in non-immune and immune cells, mainly macrophages, key players in the initial resistance to the infection. Under host-parasite interaction, LBs not only accumulate in the host cytoplasm but also relocate around and move into parasitophorous vacuoles. There is increasing evidence that protozoan parasites may target host-derived LBs either for gaining nutrients or for escaping the host immune response. Newly formed, parasite-induced LBs may serve as lipid sources for parasite growth and also produce inflammatory mediators that potentially act in the host immune response deactivation. In this mini review, we summarize current knowledge on the formation and role of host LBs as sites exploited by intracellular protozoan parasites as a strategy to maintain their own survival.
27637637	Lateral Position of the External Carotid Artery: A Rare Variation to Be Recognized During Carotid Endarterectomy.	BACKGROUND: External carotid artery (ECA) positioned laterally to the internal carotid artery (ICA) at the level of the common carotid artery (CCA) bifurcation is occasionally encountered during carotid endarterectomy (CEA). This study aimed to determine the frequency of this phenomenon and provide technical tips for performing CEA. METHODS: The study included 199 consecutive patients (209 carotid arteries) who underwent CEA at Otaru Municipal Medical Center in 2007-2014. The position of the ECA with respect to the ICA at the CCA bifurcation was preoperatively rated as either lateral or normal, using three-dimensional computerized tomographic angiography (3-D CTA) anteroposterior projections. Postoperative diffusion-weighted images (DWIs), and postoperative 3-D CTA images were reviewed. RESULTS: Among the 209 carotid arteries with atherosclerosis, 11 instances (5.3 %) of lateral position of the ECA were detected in 11 patients. Ten of these arteries (91 %) were right-sided (odds ratio 11.1; 95 % confidence interval 1.38-88.9). Wider longitudinal exposure of the arteries was used during CEA, and the CCA and ECA were rotated clockwise or counter clockwise. The ICA lying behind the ECA along the surgical access route was then pulled out laterally and moved to the shallow surgical field. Cross-clamping, arteriotomy, plaque removal, and wall suturing were performed as usual. No cerebral infarcts were detected on postoperative DWIs, and 3-D CTA revealed no CCA and ICA kinking. CONCLUSIONS: Lateral position of the ECA is not extremely rare in patients undergoing CEA for atherosclerosis and may be a congenital variation, although this is still controversial. CEA can be performed safely if the arteries from the CCA to the ICA are rotated, and the ICA is moved to the shallow surgical field under wider longitudinal exposure. Although no postoperative cerebral infarcts were detected, the risk of artery-to-artery embolism resulting from artery repositioning prior to plaque removal should be taken into consideration.
27110712	Inhibition of Aromatase Induces Partial Sex Change in a Cichlid Fish: Distinct Functions for Sex Steroids in Brains and Gonads.	Sex steroids are major drivers of sexual development and also responsible for the maintenance of the established gender. Especially fishes exhibit great plasticity and less conservation in sex determination and sexual development compared to other vertebrate groups. In addition, fishes have a constant sex steroid production throughout their entire lifespan, which makes them particularly susceptible to interferences with the endogenous sex steroid system. This susceptibility has recently been used to show that inhibition of the key enzyme of estrogen synthesis, aromatase Cyp19a1, can induce functional sex reversal even in adult fish. Here, we investigated the impact of the aromatase inhibitor (AI) fadrozole in adult females of the East African cichlid fish Astatotilapia burtoni. Using gene expression, phenotypic measurements, behavioral experiments, and hormone measurements, we assessed if females treated with fadrozole develop a male-like phenotype. We found that AI treatment has a different effect on gene expression in the gonad compared to the brain, the 2 tissues mostly implicated in sexual development. In contrast to observations in other gonochoristic species, A. burtoni ovaries cannot be transformed into functional testis by AI. However, rapid changes towards a male-like phenotype can be induced with AI in coloration, hormone levels, and behavior.
27814359	Whole-Transcriptome Selection and Evaluation of Internal Reference Genes for Expression Analysis in Protocorm Development of Dendrobium officinale Kimura et Migo.	Dendrobium officinale Kimu et Migo has increased many researchers' interest for its high medical and horticultural values and the molecular mechanism of its protocorm development remains unclear. In this study, 19 genes from 26 most stably expressed genes in whole transcriptome of protocorms and 5 housekeeping genes were used as candidate reference genes and screened with 4 application softwares (geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper and RefFinder). The results showed that a few reference genes could effectively normalize expression level of specific genes in protocorm development and the optimal top 2 reference genes were ASS and APH1L. Meanwhile, validation of GNOM, AP2 and temperature induced gene (TIL) for normalization demonstrates the usefulness of the validated candidate reference genes. The expression profiles of these genes varied under protocorms and temperature stress according to the stablest and unstablest reference genes, which proved the importance of the choice of appropriate reference genes. The first systematic evaluation of stably expressed genes will be very useful in the future analysis of specific genes expression in D. officinale.
27195073	Effects of Moderate Aerobic Exercise on Cognitive Abilities and Redox State Biomarkers in Older Adults.	We used a moderate aerobic exercise program for 24 weeks to measure the positive impact of physical activity on oxidative stress and inflammatory markers and its association with cognitive performance in healthy older adults. A total of 100 healthy subjects (65-95 Yrs) were randomly classified into two groups: control group (n = 50) and exercise group (n = 50). Cognitive functioning, physical activity score, MDA, 8-OHdG, TAC, and hs-CRP were assessed using LOTCA battery, prevalidated PA questionnaire, and immunoassay techniques. LOTCA 7-set scores of cognitive performance showed a significant correlation with physical activity status and the regulation of both oxidative stress free radicals and inflammatory markers in all older subjects following 24 weeks of moderate exercise. Physically active persons showed a higher cognitive performance along with reduction in the levels of MDA, 8-OHdG, and hs-CRP and increase in TAC activity compared with sedentary participants. Cognitive performance correlated positively with the increase in TAC activity and physical fitness scores and negatively with MDA, 8-OHdG, and hs-CRP, respectively. There was a significant improvement in motor praxis, vasomotor organization, thinking operations, and attention and concentration among older adults. In conclusion, moderate aerobic training for 24 weeks has a positive significant effect in improving cognitive functions via modulating redox and inflammatory status of older adults.
27780236	Conditioned Medium from Placental Mesenchymal Stem Cells Reduces Oxidative Stress during the Cryopreservation of Ex Vivo Expanded Umbilical Cord Blood Cells.	BACKGROUND: The limited cell dose in umbilical cord blood (UCB) necessitates ex vivo expansion of UCB. Further, the effective cryopreservation of these expanded cells is important in widening their use in the clinics. During cryopreservation, cells experience oxidative stress due to the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Conditioned medium from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs-CM) has been shown to alleviate the oxidative stress during wound healing, Alzheimer's disease and ischemic disease. This premise prompted us to investigate the influence of MSCs-CM during cryopreservation of expanded UCB cells. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPLE FINDINGS: CM-was collected from cord/placental MSCs(C-MSCs-CM, P-MSC-CM). UCB CD34+cells were expanded as suspension cultures in serum free medium containing cytokines for 10 days. Cells were frozen with/without C-MSCs-CM and or P-MSCs-CM in the conventional freezing medium containing 20%FCS +10%DMSO using a programmable freezer and stored in liquid nitrogen. Upon revival, cells frozen with MSCs-CM were found to be superior to cells frozen in conventional medium in terms of viability, CD34+content and clonogenecity. Priming of revived cells for 48 hrs with MSCs-CM further improved their transplantation ability, as compared to those cultured without MSCs-CM. P-MSCs-CM radically reduced the oxidative stress in cryopreserved cells, resulting in better post thaw functionality of CD34+ cells than with C-MSCs-CM. The observed cryoprotective effect of MSCs-CM was primarily due to anti-oxidative and anti-apoptotic properties of the MSCs-CM and not because of the exosomes secreted by them. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our data suggest that MSCs-CM can serve as a valuable additive to the freezing or the priming medium for expanded UCB cells, which would increase their clinical applicability.
27114977	Assessing Predictive Validity of Pressure Ulcer Risk Scales- A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.	BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to present a scientific reason for pressure ulcer risk scales: Cubbin& Jackson modified Braden, Norton, and Waterlow, as a nursing diagnosis tool by utilizing predictive validity of pressure sores. METHODS: Articles published between 1966 and 2013 from periodicals indexed in the Ovid Medline, Embase, CINAHL, KoreaMed, NDSL, and other databases were selected using the key word "pressure ulcer". QUADAS-II was applied for assessment for internal validity of the diagnostic studies. Selected studies were analyzed using meta-analysis with MetaDisc 1.4. RESULTS: Seventeen diagnostic studies with high methodological quality, involving 5,185 patients, were included. In the results of the meta-analysis, sROC AUC of Braden, Norton, and Waterflow scale was over 0.7, showing moderate predictive validity, but they have limited interpretation due to significant differences between studies. In addition, Waterlow scale is insufficient as a screening tool owing to low sensitivity compared with other scales. CONCLUSION: The contemporary pressure ulcer risk scale is not suitable for uninform practice on patients under standardized criteria. Therefore, in order to provide more effective nursing care for bedsores, a new or modified pressure ulcer risk scale should be developed upon strength and weaknesses of existing tools.
27500183	The CRISPR/Cas9 system for gene editing and its potential application in pain research.	The CRISPR/Cas9 system is a research hotspot in genome editing and regulation. Currently, it is used in genomic silencing and knock-in experiments as well as transcriptional activation and repression. This versatile system consists of two components: a guide RNA (gRNA) and a Cas9 nuclease. Recognition of a genomic DNA target is mediated through base pairing with a 20-base gRNA. The latter further recruits the Cas9 endonuclease protein to the target site and creates double-stranded breaks in the target DNA. Compared with traditional genome editing directed by DNA-binding protein domains, this short RNA-directed Cas9 endonuclease system is simple and easily programmable. Although this system may have off-target effects and in vivo delivery and immune challenges, researchers have employed this system in vivo to establish disease models, study specific gene functions under certain disease conditions, and correct genomic information for disease treatment. In regards to pain research, the CRISPR/Cas9 system may act as a novel tool in gene correction therapy for pain-associated hereditary diseases and may be a new approach for RNA-guided transcriptional activation or repression of pain-related genes. In addition, this system is also applied to loss-of-function mutations in pain-related genes and knockin of reporter genes or loxP tags at pain-related genomic loci. The CRISPR/Cas9 system will likely be carried out widely in both bench work and clinical settings in the pain field.
28066156	Spinal rehabilitative exercise or manual treatment for the prevention of tension-type headache in adults.	This is the protocol for a review and there is no abstract. The objectives are as follows: To assess the short- and long-term effects of manual treatment and spinal rehabilitative exercise for the prevention of tension-type headache in adults.
26934716	An Evaluation of the Non-Neutrality of Money.	This paper evaluates the effect of a change in the quantity of money on relative prices in the U.S. economy based on quarterly time-series for the period of 1959 to 2013. We also estimate the implication of a change in relative prices on the rate of inflation and macroeconomic variables. The empirical results indicate that the change of money supply not only affects relative prices but also affects the inflation rate and real variables, such as investment, natural rate of unemployment and potential GDP, through the change in relative prices. The relevant finding of our study is that money is not neutral in a non-traditional sense because a change in the money supply disturbs relative prices and, consequently, the allocation of resources in the economy. This finding has serious implications that must be considered in the transmission mechanisms of monetary policy.
27162714	Preliminary Results of Bioactive Amniotic Suspension with Allograft for Achieving One and Two-Level Lumbar Interbody Fusion.	BACKGROUND: Bone graft material for lumbar fusion was historically autologous bone graft (ABG). In recent years alternatives such as allograft, demineralized bone matrix (DBM), ceramics, and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) have gained favor, although the complications of these are not fully understood. Bioactive amniotic suspension (BAS) with allograft is a new class of material derived from human amniotic tissue. METHODS: Eligible patients receiving a one or two level lumbar interbody fusion with Nucel, a BAS with allograft, were contacted and scheduled for a mininmim 12 month follow-up visit. Patients were evaluated for fusion using CT's and plain radiographs. Clincal outcomes, including ODI, VAS back and leg were collected, as well as comorbidities including BMI, smoking status, diabetes and previous lumbar surgery. RESULTS: One-level patients (N=38) were 71.1% female with mean age of 58.4 +/- 12.7 and mean BMI of 30.6 +/- 6.08. Two-level patients (N=34) were 58.8% female with mean age of 49.3 +/-10.9 and mean BMI of 30.1 +/- 5.82. Kinematic fusion was achieved in 97.4% of one-level patients and 100% of two-level patients. Baseline comorbidities were present in 89.5% of one-level patients and 88.2% of two-level patients. No adverse events related to BAS were reported in this study. CONCLUSION: Fusion status is evaluated with many different biologics and varying methods in the literature. BAS with allograft in this study demonstrated high fusion rates with no complications within a largely comorbid population. Although a small population, BAS with allograft results were encouraging for one and two-level lumbar interbody fusion in this study. Further prospective studies should be conducted to investigate safety and efficacy in a larger population.
26858543	Development of spermatic granuloma in albino rats following administration of water extract of Heliotropium bacciferum Forssk.	A spermatic granuloma is a chronic inflammatory reaction produced in response to extravasated sperm within the intertubular connective tissue. The present study investigates the possible toxic effects of water extract of Heliotropium bacciferum on the reproductive system of male albino rats and the associated potential for the development of spermatic granulomas. H. bacciferum is a herbal plant used in traditional medicine and reported to have cytotoxic effects due to pyrrolizidine alkaloids. Histological examinations revealed no changes in the tissues of the testes, although, some changes were detected in the cauda epididymis, the most important of which was the development of small lesions of spermatic granulomas. Clear gaps were observed between the epithelial linings of the epididymal tubules.
26833838	Sex differences in partner preferences in humans and animals.	A large number of morphological, physiological and behavioural traits are differentially expressed by males and females in all vertebrates including humans. These sex differences, sometimes, reflect the different hormonal environment of the adults, but they often remain present after subjects of both sexes are placed in the same endocrine conditions following gonadectomy associated or not with hormonal replacement therapy. They are then the result of combined influences of organizational actions of sex steroids acting early during development, or genetic differences between the sexes, or epigenetic mechanisms differentially affecting males and females. Sexual partner preference is a sexually differentiated behavioural trait that is clearly controlled in animals by the same type of mechanisms. This is also probably true in humans, even if critical experiments that would be needed to obtain scientific proof of this assertion are often impossible for pragmatic or ethical reasons. Clinical, epidemiological and correlative studies provide, however, converging evidence strongly suggesting, if not demonstrating, that endocrine, genetic and epigenetic mechanisms acting during the pre- or perinatal life control human sexual orientation, i.e. homosexuality versus heterosexuality. Whether they interact with postnatal psychosexual influences remains, however, unclear at present.
27797237	Frequency of FLT3 (ITD, D835) Gene Mutations in Acute Myelogenous Leukemia: a Report from Northeastern Iran.	BACKGROUND: FLT3 is mutated in about 1/3 of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) patients. The aim of the present study was to report the prevalence of FLT3 mutations and comparison with prognostic factors in AML patients in the Northeastern of Iran. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This cross-sectional study concerned 100 AML cases diagnosed based on bone marrow aspiration and peripheral blood. DNA for every AML patient was extracted and underwent PCR with FLT3-ITD primers. RESULTS: The mean age at diagnosis was 28.5 years (range, 1-66 years), 52 patients (52%) being male. Out of 100 AML patients, 21 (21%) had FLT3 mutation, (17 with FLT3- ITD, 81%, and 4 with FLT3-D825, 19%). Of the 21, 14 (66.7%) had heterozygous mutation. There was no significant difference between age, sex and organomegaly between patients with FLT3 mutation versus FLT3 wild-type. CONCLUSIONS: Our frequency of FLT3 is in line with earlier fidnings of approximately 20 to 30% and also the prevalence of FLT3-ITD is more than FLT3-D35 mutation. There was no significant difference between prognostic factors (age and sex) in the patients with FLT3 mutation versus FLT3 wild-type. The prevalence of FLT3 heterozygous mutations is more that homozygous mutations in AML patients.
27303278	First Steps in Using Multi-Voxel Pattern Analysis to Disentangle Neural Processes Underlying Generalization of Spider Fear.	A core symptom of anxiety disorders is the tendency to interpret ambiguous information as threatening. Using electroencephalography and blood oxygenation level dependent magnetic resonance imaging (BOLD-MRI), several studies have begun to elucidate brain processes involved in fear-related perceptual biases, but thus far mainly found evidence for general hypervigilance in high fearful individuals. Recently, multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA) has become popular for decoding cognitive states from distributed patterns of neural activation. Here, we used this technique to assess whether biased fear generalization, characteristic of clinical fear, is already present during the initial perception and categorization of a stimulus, or emerges during the subsequent interpretation of a stimulus. Individuals with low spider fear (n = 20) and high spider fear (n = 18) underwent functional MRI scanning while viewing series of schematic flowers morphing to spiders. In line with previous studies, individuals with high fear of spiders were behaviorally more likely to classify ambiguous morphs as spiders than individuals with low fear of spiders. Univariate analyses of BOLD-MRI data revealed stronger activation toward spider pictures in high fearful individuals compared to low fearful individuals in numerous areas. Yet, neither average activation, nor support vector machine classification (i.e., a form of MVPA) matched the behavioral results - i.e., a biased response toward ambiguous stimuli - in any of the regions of interest. This may point to limitations of the current design, and to challenges associated with classifying emotional and neutral stimuli in groups that differ in their judgment of emotionality. Improvements for future research are suggested.
27525228	Overexpression of molecular chaperons GRP78 and GRP94 in CD44(hi)/CD24(lo) breast cancer stem cells.	INTRODUCTION: Breast cancer stem cell with CD44(hi)/CD24(lo) phonotype is described having stem cell properties and represented as the main driving factor in breast cancer initiation, growth, metastasis and low response to anti-cancer agents. Glucoseregulated proteins (GRPs) are heat shock protein family chaperons that are charged with regulation of protein machinery and modulation of endoplasmic reticulum homeostasis whose important roles in stem cell development and invasion of various cancers have been demonstrated. Here, we investigated the expression levels of GRP78 and GRP94 in CD44(hi)/CD24(lo) phenotype breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs). METHODS: MCF7, T-47D and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell lines were used. CD44(hi)/CD24(lo) phenotype cell population were analyzed and sorted by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). Transcriptional and translational expression of GRP78 and GRP94 were investigated by western blotting and quantitative real time PCR. RESULTS: RESULTS showed different proportion of CD44(hi)/CD24(lo) phenotype cell population in their original bulk cells. The ranking of the cell lines in terms of CD44(hi)/CD24(lo) phenotype cell population was as MCF7<T-47D<MDA-MB-231. Our results also indicated that CD44(hi)/CD24(lo) phenotype cells exhibited higher mRNA and protein expression level of GRP78 and GRP94 compared to their original bulk cells. CONCLUSION: Our results show a relationship between overexpression of GRP78 and GRP94 and exhibiting CD44hi/CD24lo phenotype in breast cancer cells. We conclude that upregulation of GRPs may be an important factor in the emergence of CD44hi/CD24lo phenotype BCSCs features.
27150081	Genetically Defined Strains in Drug Development and Toxicity Testing.	There is growing concern about the poor quality and lack of repeatability of many pre-clinical experiments involving laboratory animals. According to one estimate as much as $28 billion is wasted annually in the USA alone in such studies. A decade ago the FDA's "Critical path" white paper noted that "The traditional tools used to assess product safety-animal toxicology and outcomes from human studies-have changed little over many decades and have largely not benefited from recent gains in scientific knowledge. The inability to better assess and predict product safety leads to failures during clinical development and, occasionally, after marketing." Repeat-dose 28-days and 90-days toxicity tests in rodents have been widely used as part of a strategy to assess the safety of drugs and chemicals but their repeatability and power to detect adverse effects have not been formally evaluated.The guidelines (OECD TG 407 and 408) for these tests specify the dose levels and number of animals per dose but do not specify the strain of animals which should be used. In practice, almost all the tests are done using genetically undefined "albino" rats or mice in which the genetic variation, a major cause of inter-individual and strain variability, is unknown and uncontrolled. This chapter suggests that a better strategy would be to use small numbers of animals of several genetically defined strains of mice or rats instead of the undefined animals used at present. Inbred strains are more stable providing more repeatable data than outbred stocks. Importantly their greater phenotypic uniformity should lead to more powerful and repeatable tests. Any observed strain differences would indicate genetic variation in response to the test substance, providing key data. We suggest that the FDA and other regulators and funding organizations should support research to evaluate this alternative.
27313872	Comparison between Limbal and Pars Plana Approaches Using Microincision Vitrectomy for Removal of Congenital Cataracts with Primary Intraocular Lens Implantation.	Purpose. To compare the surgical outcomes of limbal versus pars plana vitrectomy using the 23-gauge microincision system for removal of congenital cataracts with primary intraocular lens implantation. Methods. We retrospectively reviewed all eyes that underwent cataract removal through limbal or pars plana incision. Main outcome measures included visual outcomes and complications. Results. We included 40 eyes (26 patients) in the limbal group and 41 eyes (30 patients) in the pars plana group. The mean age was 46 months. There was no significant difference in best-corrected visual acuity between the two groups (P = 0.64). Significantly, more eyes had at least one intraoperative complication in the limbal group than in the pars plana group (P = 0.03) that were mainly distributed at 1.5-3 years of age (P = 0.01). The most common intraoperative complications were iris aspiration, iris prolapse, and iris injury. More eyes in the limbal group had postoperative complications and required additional intraocular surgery, but the difference was not significant (P = 0.19). Conclusions. The visual results were encouraging in both approaches. We recommend the pars plana approach for lower incidence of complications. The limbal approach should be reserved for children older than 3 years of age and caution should be exercised to minimize iris disturbance.
27052757	Reaction Rate Maxima at Large Distances between Reactants.	One commonly thinks that two reactants need to come very close to one another in order for a chemical reaction to occur. This is true for most reaction types, but electron transfer is an exception in this regard. It is a well-documented fact that electron transfers can occur over long distances (>/=15 A), but it is much less well-known that theory predicts a regime in which electron transfer rates in crease with increasing distance between reactants. This contribution explains the physical origin of this counter-intuitive behavior, and it identifies a set of conditions that might facilitate its experimental observation.
27070473	[Ultrastructural changes of lymphocytes in patients with schizophrenia treated with olanzapine].	OBJECTIVE: to study the effect of olanzapine on the ultrastructure of different populations of lymphocytes and lymphoblasts in patients with schizophrenia. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Authors performed a morphometric study using electron microscopy of lymphocytes in 56 patients with schizophrenia treated for 8 weeks with olanzapine and 49 patients treated for 28 weeks with olanzapine before and after treatment. Authors estimated the frequency and ultrastructural parameters of small, large, large activated lymphocytes and lymphoblasts. RESULTS: The frequency of small lymphocytes in patients treated with olanzapine increased and that of large lymphocytes decreased in treated patients as compared to the patients before treatment. The volume fraction of lysosomes increased significantly in small, large and large activated lymphocytes after treatment as compared to the patients before treatment. CONCLUSION: The increased lysosome content in different lymphocyte subpopulations might contribute to the mechanism of olanzapine efficacy.
27429502	The domain interface method: a general-purpose non-intrusive technique for non-conforming domain decomposition problems.	A domain decomposition technique is proposed which is capable of properly connecting arbitrary non-conforming interfaces. The strategy essentially consists in considering a fictitious zero-width interface between the non-matching meshes which is discretized using a Delaunay triangulation. Continuity is satisfied across domains through normal and tangential stresses provided by the discretized interface and inserted in the formulation in the form of Lagrange multipliers. The final structure of the global system of equations resembles the dual assembly of substructures where the Lagrange multipliers are employed to nullify the gap between domains. A new approach to handle floating subdomains is outlined which can be implemented without significantly altering the structure of standard industrial finite element codes. The effectiveness of the developed algorithm is demonstrated through a patch test example and a number of tests that highlight the accuracy of the methodology and independence of the results with respect to the framework parameters. Considering its high degree of flexibility and non-intrusive character, the proposed domain decomposition framework is regarded as an attractive alternative to other established techniques such as the mortar approach.
27738473	Peripartum Type A Aortic Dissection Repair Using Frozen Elephant Trunk Technique.	A 43-year-old woman with abdominal and back pain during childbirth consulted us 1 day postdelivery. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) revealed partially thrombosed type A aortic dissection with intimal tear in the proximal descending thoracic aorta. Conservative antihypertensive treatment was started. However, her abdominal pain progressively deteriorated. Repeat CT revealed narrowing of the descending aorta true lumen and progressive bowel malperfusion. Total arch replacement was urgently performed using the frozen elephant trunk technique. Postoperative CT showed true lumen widening and symptom disappearance. Follow-up CT demonstrated excellent aortic remodeling.
27284213	Improvements in Cd stable isotope analysis achieved through use of liquid-liquid extraction to remove organic residues from Cd separates obtained by extraction chromatography.	Organic compounds released from resins that are commonly employed for trace element separations are known to have a detrimental impact on the quality of isotopic analyses by MC-ICP-MS. A recent study highlighted that such effects can be particularly problematic for Cd stable isotope measurements (M. Gault-Ringold and C. H. Stirling, J. Anal. At. Spectrom., 2012, 27, 449-459). In this case, the final stage of sample purification commonly applies extraction chromatography with Eichrom TRU resin, which employs particles coated with octylphenyl-N,N-di-isobutyl carbamoylphosphine oxide (CMPO) dissolved in tri-n-butyl phosphate (TBP). During chromatography, it appears that some of these compounds are eluted alongside Cd and cannot be removed by evaporation due to their high boiling points. When aliquots of the zero-epsilon reference material were processed through the purification procedure, refluxed in concentrated HNO3 and analyzed at minimum dilution (in 1 ml 0.1 M HNO3), they yielded Cd isotopic compositions (epsilon114/110Cd = 4.6 +/- 3.4, 2SD, n = 4) that differed significantly from the expected value, despite the use of a double spike technique to correct for instrumental mass fractionation. This result was accompanied by a 35% reduction in instrumental sensitivity for Cd. With increasing dilution of the organic resin residue, both of these effects are reduced and they are insignificant when the eluted Cd is dissolved in >/=3 ml 0.1 M HNO3. Our results, furthermore, indicate that the isotopic artefacts are most likely related to anomalous mass bias behavior. Previous studies have shown that perchloric acid can be effective at avoiding such effects (Gault-Ringold and Stirling, 2012; K. C. Crocket, M. Lambelet, T. van de Flierdt, M. Rehkamper and L. F. Robinson, Chem. Geol., 2014, 374-375, 128-140), presumably by oxidizing the resin-derived organics, but there are numerous disadvantages to its use. Here we show that liquid-liquid extraction with n-heptane removes the organic compounds, dramatically improving quality of the Cd isotope data for samples that are analyzed at or close to minimum dilution factors. This technique is quick, simple and may be of use prior to analysis of other isotope systems where similar resins are employed.
26857308	Hereditary angioedema type 2 presented as an orbital complication of acute rhinosinusitis.	Hereditary angioedema is an autosomal dominant and life-threatening disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of non-pitting edema affecting the skin, respiratory system and digestive tracts and caused by a congenital deficiency or function defect of the C1 esterase inhibitor. Preseptal cellulitis is defined as an infection of the tissues of the anterior orbital septum. It is generally caused by complications from an upper respiratory tract infection, dacryocystitis, dermal infection, and, rarely, sinusitis. The disease presents with orbital pain, edema on the eyelids, erythema, and fever. In this case, a child with hereditary angioedema type 2 who presented as mimicking a complication of acute sinusitis is discussed.
27070166	[Duodenal motility in norm and in some diseases. Hypothesis].	AIM: to investigate the duodenal motility on the basis of radiological studies. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We tested our hypothesis that sphincters of Kapandji and Ochsner are contracted in response to stimulation of duodenum by hydrochloric acid. These sphincters are not found in standard X-ray studies because barium does not contain hydrochloric acid when it coming from the stomach into the duodenum. The retrospective analysis of radiological studies of the upper digestive tract of 116 patients aged 55 to 92 years was done. The first group consisted of 83 patients in whom the study was conducted using conventional barium suspension. The second group consisted of 8 patients who received 200 ml of barium with the addition of 3 grams of vitamin C. The third group was comprised of 25 patients with primary duodenal diverticula. The fourth group included radiographs from 35 articles devoted to the superior mesenteric artery syndrome (SMAS). We measured the width of the duodenum and the length of the sphincters on these radiographs. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: We found an important role of the sphincters (bulbo-duodenal, Kapandji, Ochsner) in the duodenal physiology. On this basis, we proposed the hypothesis defining basic patterns of the duodenal motor function. Proposed hypothesis allows us to understand how the duodenum performs important functions and provides new avenues for understanding the pathogenesis of acquired diseases of the upper gastrointestinal tract. The different forms dyskinesia of these sphincters play an important role in the pathogenesis of the SMAS, primary duodenal diverticula and sphincter Oddi dyskinesia.
27936208	Developmental Stage, Muscle and Genetic Type Modify Muscle Transcriptome in Pigs: Effects on Gene Expression and Regulatory Factors Involved in Growth and Metabolism.	Iberian pig production includes purebred (IB) and Duroc-crossbred (IBxDU) pigs, which show important differences in growth, fattening and tissue composition. This experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of genetic type and muscle (Longissimus dorsi (LD) vs Biceps femoris (BF)) on gene expression and transcriptional regulation at two developmental stages. Nine IB and 10 IBxDU piglets were slaughtered at birth, and seven IB and 10 IBxDU at four months of age (growing period). Carcass traits and LD intramuscular fat (IMF) content were measured. Muscle transcriptome was analyzed on LD samples with RNA-Seq technology. Carcasses were smaller in IB than in IBxDU neonates (p < 0.001), while growing IB pigs showed greater IMF content (p < 0.05). Gene expression was affected (p < 0.01 and Fold change > 1.5) by the developmental stage (5,812 genes), muscle type (135 genes), and genetic type (261 genes at birth and 113 at growth). Newborns transcriptome reflected a highly proliferative developmental stage, while older pigs showed upregulation of catabolic and muscle functioning processes. Regarding the genetic type effect, IBxDU newborns showed enrichment of gene pathways involved in muscle growth, in agreement with the higher prenatal growth observed in these pigs. However, IB growing pigs showed enrichment of pathways involved in protein deposition and cellular growth, supporting the compensatory gain experienced by IB pigs during this period. Moreover, newborn and growing IB pigs showed more active glucose and lipid metabolism than IBxDU pigs. Moreover, LD muscle seems to have more active muscular and cell growth, while BF points towards lipid metabolism and fat deposition. Several regulators controlling transcriptome changes in both genotypes were identified across muscles and ages (SIM1, PVALB, MEFs, TCF7L2 or FOXO1), being strong candidate genes to drive expression and thus, phenotypic differences between IB and IBxDU pigs. Many of the identified regulators were known to be involved in muscle and adipose tissues development, but others not previously associated with pig muscle growth were also identified, as PVALB, KLF1 or IRF2. The present study discloses potential molecular mechanisms underlying phenotypic differences observed between IB and IBxDU pigs and highlights candidate genes implicated in these molecular mechanisms.
27822361	Serious bicycle crash injury in chiropractic practice - a case report of delayed diagnosis.	BACKGROUND: Bicyclists are vulnerable road users and are at risk of serious spinal injury if involved in traffic crashes. In Denmark approximately 25 bicyclists are killed each year and some 20.000 bicycle related casualties are registered in the National Patient Registry each year. In addition to these figures, a large number of casualties remain unregistered despite injury. Many of the casualties will consult chiropractors in primary practice with or without preceding evaluation in the established emergency care facilities. Therefore, chiropractors are expected to be able to proficiently evaluate these patients clinically and radiologically in order to ensure the best possible patient care. CASE PRESENTATION: This report involves a middle-aged female who consulted several physicians following a collision with a motor vehicle while riding a bike. Despite clinical symptoms and consequent examinations she suffered from inadequate diagnostic evaluation until a radiological examination was performed 18 days following the injurious crash identifying unstable cervical spine fractures. CONCLUSIONS: The presented case is an example of the serious spinal injuries bicyclists may suffer when involved in high-energy traffic crashes despite wearing a bicycle helmet. The case report highlights the need for relevant clinical (including radiological) decision strategies when dealing with trauma patients in chiropractic practice. This involves the direct access to radiological procedures with no unnecessary delay when indicated as in most trauma cases. Furthermore, clearly defined and easy accessible referral schemes from primary care settings to emergency departments must be available to the chiropractic physician. Chiropractors are clinically competent to examine and diagnose, including radiologically evaluate, patients who have been injured in traffic crashes. Hence, chiropractors may contribute to the diagnosis, management and rehabilitation of spinal injured patients following many types of crashes and accident, including bicycle crashes.
27911901	The Researchers' View of Scientific Rigor-Survey on the Conduct and Reporting of In Vivo Research.	Reproducibility in animal research is alarmingly low, and a lack of scientific rigor has been proposed as a major cause. Systematic reviews found low reporting rates of measures against risks of bias (e.g., randomization, blinding), and a correlation between low reporting rates and overstated treatment effects. Reporting rates of measures against bias are thus used as a proxy measure for scientific rigor, and reporting guidelines (e.g., ARRIVE) have become a major weapon in the fight against risks of bias in animal research. Surprisingly, animal scientists have never been asked about their use of measures against risks of bias and how they report these in publications. Whether poor reporting reflects poor use of such measures, and whether reporting guidelines may effectively reduce risks of bias has therefore remained elusive. To address these questions, we asked in vivo researchers about their use and reporting of measures against risks of bias and examined how self-reports relate to reporting rates obtained through systematic reviews. An online survey was sent out to all registered in vivo researchers in Switzerland (N = 1891) and was complemented by personal interviews with five representative in vivo researchers to facilitate interpretation of the survey results. Return rate was 28% (N = 530), of which 302 participants (16%) returned fully completed questionnaires that were used for further analysis. According to the researchers' self-report, they use measures against risks of bias to a much greater extent than suggested by reporting rates obtained through systematic reviews. However, the researchers' self-reports are likely biased to some extent. Thus, although they claimed to be reporting measures against risks of bias at much lower rates than they claimed to be using these measures, the self-reported reporting rates were considerably higher than reporting rates found by systematic reviews. Furthermore, participants performed rather poorly when asked to choose effective over ineffective measures against six different biases. Our results further indicate that knowledge of the ARRIVE guidelines had a positive effect on scientific rigor. However, the ARRIVE guidelines were known by less than half of the participants (43.7%); and among those whose latest paper was published in a journal that had endorsed the ARRIVE guidelines, more than half (51%) had never heard of these guidelines. Our results suggest that whereas reporting rates may underestimate the true use of measures against risks of bias, self-reports may overestimate it. To a large extent, this discrepancy can be explained by the researchers' ignorance and lack of knowledge of risks of bias and measures to prevent them. Our analysis thus adds significant new evidence to the assessment of research integrity in animal research. Our findings further question the confidence that the authorities have in scientific rigor, which is taken for granted in the harm-benefit analyses on which approval of animal experiments is based. Furthermore, they suggest that better education on scientific integrity and good research practice is needed. However, they also question reliance on reporting rates as indicators of scientific rigor and highlight a need for more reliable predictors.
26903934	The "Smart Dining Table": Automatic Behavioral Tracking of a Meal with a Multi-Touch-Computer.	Studying how humans eat in the context of a meal is important to understanding basic mechanisms of food intake regulation and can help develop new interventions for the promotion of healthy eating and prevention of obesity and eating disorders. While there are a number of methodologies available for behavioral evaluation of a meal, there is a need for new tools that can simplify data collection through automatic and online analysis. Also, there are currently no methods that leverage technology to add a dimension of interactivity to the meal table. In this study, we examined the feasibility of a new technology for automatic detection and classification of bites during a laboratory meal. We used a SUR40 multi-touch tabletop computer, powered by an infrared camera behind the screen. Tags were attached to three plates, allowing their positions to be tracked, and the saturation (a measure of the infrared intensity) in the surrounding region was measured. A Kinect camera was used to record the meals for manual verification and provide gesture detection for when the bites were taken. Bite detections triggered classification of the source plate by the SUR40 based on saturation flux in the preceding time window. Five healthy subjects (aged 20-40 years, one female) were tested, providing a total sample of 320 bites. Sensitivity, defined as the number of correctly detected bites out of the number of actual bites, was 67.5%. Classification accuracy, defined as the number of correctly classified bites out of those detected, was 82.4%. Due to the poor sensitivity, a second experiment was designed using a single plate and a Myo armband containing a nine-axis accelerometer as an alternative method for bite detection. The same subjects were tested (sample: 195 bites). Using a simple threshold on the pitch reading of the magnetometer, the Myo data achieved 86.1% sensitivity vs. 60.5% with the Kinect. Further, the precision of positive predictive value was 72.1% for the Myo vs. 42.8% for the Kinect. We conclude that the SUR40 + Myo combination is feasible for automatic detection and classification of bites with adequate accuracy for a range of applications.
27799903	The Neural Bases of Disgust for Cheese: An fMRI Study.	The study of food aversion in humans by the induction of illness is ethically unthinkable, and it is difficult to propose a type of food that is disgusting for everybody. However, although cheese is considered edible by most people, it can also be perceived as particularly disgusting to some individuals. As such, the perception of cheese constitutes a good model to study the cerebral processes of food disgust and aversion. In this study, we show that a higher percentage of people are disgusted by cheese than by other types of food. Functional magnetic resonance imaging then reveals that the internal and external globus pallidus and the substantia nigra belonging to the basal ganglia are more activated in participants who dislike or diswant to eat cheese (Anti) than in other participants who like to eat cheese, as revealed following stimulation with cheese odors and pictures. We suggest that the aforementioned basal ganglia structures commonly involved in reward are also involved in the aversive motivated behaviors. Our results further show that the ventral pallidum, a core structure of the reward circuit, is deactivated in Anti subjects stimulated by cheese in the wanting task, highlighting the suppression of motivation-related activation in subjects disgusted by cheese.
27305001	Examining the Effect of Reverse Worded Items on the Factor Structure of the Need for Cognition Scale.	Reverse worded (RW) items are often used to reduce or eliminate acquiescence bias, but there is a rising concern about their harmful effects on the covariance structure of the scale. Therefore, results obtained via traditional covariance analyses may be distorted. This study examined the effect of the RW items on the factor structure of the abbreviated 18-item Need for Cognition (NFC) scale using confirmatory factor analysis. We modified the scale to create three revised versions, varying from no RW items to all RW items. We also manipulated the type of the RW items (polar opposite vs. negated). To each of the four scales, we fit four previously developed models. The four models included a 1-factor model, a 2-factor model distinguishing between positively worded (PW) items and RW items, and two 2-factor models, each with one substantive factor and one method factor. Results showed that the number and type of the RW items affected the factor structure of the NFC scale. Consistent with previous research findings, for the original NFC scale, which contains both PW and RW items, the 1-factor model did not have good fit. In contrast, for the revised scales that had no RW items or all RW items, the 1-factor model had reasonably good fit. In addition, for the scale with polar opposite and negated RW items, the factor model with a method factor among the polar opposite items had considerably better fit than the 1-factor model.
27010457	Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting of Rickettsia prowazekii-Infected Host Cells Based on Bacterial Burden and Early Detection of Fluorescent Rickettsial Transformants.	Rickettsia prowazekii, the causative agent of epidemic typhus, is an obligate intracellular bacterium that replicates only within the cytosol of a eukaryotic host cell. Despite the barriers to genetic manipulation that such a life style creates, rickettsial mutants have been generated by transposon insertion as well as by homologous recombination mechanisms. However, progress is hampered by the length of time required to identify and isolate R. prowazekii transformants. To reduce the time required and variability associated with propagation and harvesting of rickettsiae for each transformation experiment, characterized frozen stocks were used to generate electrocompetent rickettsiae. Transformation experiments employing these rickettsiae established that fluorescent rickettsial populations could be identified using a fluorescence activated cell sorter within one week following electroporation. Early detection was improved with increasing amounts of transforming DNA. In addition, we demonstrate that heterogeneous populations of rickettsiae-infected cells can be sorted into distinct sub-populations based on the number of rickettsiae per cell. Together our data suggest the combination of fluorescent reporters and cell sorting represent an important technical advance that will facilitate isolation of distinct R. prowazekii mutants and allow for closer examination of the effects of infection on host cells at various infectious burdens.
27764186	Drivers of Tree Growth, Mortality and Harvest Preferences in Species-Rich Plantations for Smallholders and Communities in the Tropics.	There is growing interest in multi-species tropical plantations but little information exists to guide their design and silviculture. The Rainforestation Farming system is the oldest tropical polyculture planting system in the Philippines and provides a unique opportunity to understand the underlying processes affecting tree performance within diverse plantings. Data collected from 85 plots distributed across the 18 mixed-species plantations in the Philippines was used to identify the factors influencing growth, probability of harvest, and death of trees in these complex plantings. The 18 sites (aged from 6 to 11 years at time of first measurement) were measured on three occasions over a 6-year period. We used data from the first period of data collection to develop models predicting harvesting probability and growth of trees in the second period. We found little evidence that tree species diversity had an effect on tree growth and tree loss at the community level, although a negative effect was found on tree growth of specific species such as Parashorea plicata and Swietenia macrophylla. While tree density of stands at age 10+ years (more than 1000 trees/ha with diameter > 5cm) did not have an impact on growth, growth rates were decreasing in stands with a high basal area. Tree size in the first period of measure was a good predictor for both tree growth and tree status in the next period, with larger trees tending to grow faster and having a greater chance of being harvested, and a lower possibility of mortality than smaller trees. Shade-intolerant trees were both more likely to be harvested, and had a higher probability of death, than shade-tolerant individuals. Native species and exotic species were equally likely to have been lost from the plots between measurement periods. However, shade-tolerant native trees were likely to grow faster than the others at age 10+ years. Our findings suggest that species traits (e.g. shade tolerance) could play an important role in optimizing species composition for this type of plantation. Shade-intolerant species with rapid early growth could contribute early income for farmers in mixed plantings where some products may take years to realize. We also suggest selective harvesting or thinning (for small shade-intolerant trees) applied at age 10+ years could reduce the competition for resources between individuals.
27723834	Collaboration Networks in Applied Conservation Projects across Europe.	The main funding instrument for implementing EU policies on nature conservation and supporting environmental and climate action is the LIFE Nature programme, established by the European Commission in 1992. LIFE Nature projects (>1400 awarded) are applied conservation projects in which partnerships between institutions are critical for successful conservation outcomes, yet little is known about the structure of collaborative networks within and between EU countries. The aim of our study is to understand the nature of collaboration in LIFE Nature projects using a novel application of social network theory at two levels: (1) collaboration between countries, and (2) collaboration within countries using six case studies: Western Europe (United Kingdom and Netherlands), Eastern Europe (Romania and Latvia) and Southern Europe (Greece and Portugal). Using data on 1261 projects financed between 1996 and 2013, we found that Italy was the most successful country not only in terms of awarded number of projects, but also in terms of overall influence being by far the most influent country in the European LIFE Nature network, having the highest eigenvector (0.989) and degree centrality (0.177). Another key player in the network is Netherlands, which ensures a fast communication flow with other network members (closeness-0.318) by staying connected with the most active countries. Although Western European countries have higher centrality scores than most of the Eastern European countries, our results showed that overall there is a lower tendency to create partnerships between different organization categories. Also, the comparisons of the six case studies indicates significant differences in regards to the pattern of creating partnerships, providing valuable information on collaboration on EU nature conservation. This study represents a starting point in predicting the formation of future partnerships within LIFE Nature programme, suggesting ways to improve transnational cooperation and communication.
27935962	MAP3K19 Is Overexpressed in COPD and Is a Central Mediator of Cigarette Smoke-Induced Pulmonary Inflammation and Lower Airway Destruction.	Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterized by persistent airflow limitation and lung inflammation resulting in a progressive decline in lung function whose principle cause is cigarette smoke. MAP3K19 is a novel kinase expressed predominantly by alveolar and interstitial macrophages and bronchial epithelial cells in the lung. We found that MAP3K19 mRNA was overexpressed in a limited sampling of lung tissue from COPD patients, and a closer examination found it to be overexpressed in bronchoalveolar macrophages from COPD patients, as well as the bronchial epithelium and inflammatory cells in the lamina propria. We further found MAP3K19 to be induced in various cell lines upon environmental stress, such as cigarette smoke, oxidative and osmotic stress. Exogenous expression of MAP3K19 in cells caused an upregulation of transcriptionally active NF-kappaB, and secretion of the chemokines CXCL-8, CCL-20 and CCL-7. Inhibition of MAP3K19 activity by siRNA or small molecular weight inhibitors caused a decrease in cigarette smoke-induced inflammation in various murine models, which included a decrease in pulmonary neutrophilia and KC levels. In a chronic cigarette smoke model, inhibition of MAP3K19 significantly attenuated emphysematous changes in airway parenchyma. Finally, in a viral exacerbation model, mice exposed to cigarette smoke and influenza A virus showed a decrease in pulmonary neutrophilia, pro-inflammatory cytokines and viral load upon inhibition of MAP3K19. Collectively, these results suggest that inhibition of MAP3K19 may represent a novel strategy to target COPD that promises to have a potential therapeutic benefit for patients.
27014019	NIRS-Based Hyperscanning Reveals Inter-brain Neural Synchronization during Cooperative Jenga Game with Face-to-Face Communication.	Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is an increasingly popular technology for studying social cognition. In particular, fNIRS permits simultaneous measurement of hemodynamic activity in two or more individuals interacting in a naturalistic setting. Here, we used fNIRS hyperscanning to study social cognition and communication in human dyads engaged in cooperative and obstructive interaction while they played the game of Jenga. Novel methods were developed to identify synchronized channels for each dyad and a structural node-based spatial registration approach was utilized for inter-dyad analyses. Strong inter-brain neural synchrony (INS) was observed in the posterior region of the right middle and superior frontal gyrus, in particular Brodmann area 8 (BA8), during cooperative and obstructive interaction. This synchrony was not observed during the parallel game play condition and the dialog section, suggesting that BA8 was involved in goal-oriented social interaction such as complex interactive movements and social decision-making. INS was also observed in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC), in particular Brodmann 9, during cooperative interaction only. These additional findings suggest that BA9 may be particularly engaged when theory-of-mind (ToM) is required for cooperative social interaction. The new methods described here have the potential to significantly extend fNIRS applications to social cognitive research.
27777871	Combined spinal-epidural anesthesia for radical hysterectomy in a patient with Sjogren syndrome with progressive interstitial lung disease.	INTRODUCTION: Interstitial lung disease (ILD), which is the most common form of respiratory involvement of Sjogren syndrome (SS), is highly associated with postoperative pulmonary complications after surgery. We report the successful anesthetic management of a cervical cancer patient with SS and ILD under combined spinal-epidural anesthesia (CSE) to avoid postoperative pulmonary complications. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 41-year-old woman with SS complicated by recently progressive ILD was scheduled for an elective radical hysterectomy under the diagnosis of cervical cancer. We performed CSE with separate needle technique (SNT) using two different interspaces. An epidural catheter was inserted at T11-T12 before administration of spinal medication at L3-L4. We could achieve successful anesthetic management for radical hysterectomy, maintaining stable hemodynamic variables. Postoperative analgesia, using epidural catheter, was effective and devoid of any postoperative pulmonary morbidity. DISCUSSION AND EVALUATION: CSE could offer a high level of sensory blockade, profound muscular blockade, longer duration of surgical anesthesia, excellent postoperative pain control, and reduction in the incidence of pulmonary morbidity. Therefore it would be excellent anesthetic option for the patients with pulmonary impairment. CONCLUSION: CSE with SNT may be particularly advantageous in patients with pulmonary impairment such as progressive ILD when general anesthesia is associated with high risk of postoperative complications.
26888617	Salience and Default Mode Network Coupling Predicts Cognition in Aging and Parkinson's Disease.	OBJECTIVES: Cognitive impairment is common in Parkinson's disease (PD). Three neurocognitive networks support efficient cognition: the salience network, the default mode network, and the central executive network. The salience network is thought to switch between activating and deactivating the default mode and central executive networks. Anti-correlated interactions between the salience and default mode networks in particular are necessary for efficient cognition. Our previous work demonstrated altered functional coupling between the neurocognitive networks in non-demented individuals with PD compared to age-matched control participants. Here, we aim to identify associations between cognition and functional coupling between these neurocognitive networks in the same group of participants. METHODS: We investigated the extent to which intrinsic functional coupling among these neurocognitive networks is related to cognitive performance across three neuropsychological domains: executive functioning, psychomotor speed, and verbal memory. Twenty-four non-demented individuals with mild to moderate PD and 20 control participants were scanned at rest and evaluated on three neuropsychological domains. RESULTS: PD participants were impaired on tests from all three domains compared to control participants. Our imaging results demonstrated that successful cognition across healthy aging and Parkinson's disease participants was related to anti-correlated coupling between the salience and default mode networks. Individuals with poorer performance scores across groups demonstrated more positive salience network/default-mode network coupling. CONCLUSIONS: Successful cognition relies on healthy coupling between the salience and default mode networks, which may become dysfunctional in PD. These results can help inform non-pharmacological interventions (repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation) targeting these specific networks before they become vulnerable in early stages of Parkinson's disease.
27099930	The Association between Regional Environmental Factors and Road Trauma Rates: A Geospatial Analysis of 10 Years of Road Traffic Crashes in British Columbia, Canada.	BACKGROUND: British Columbia, Canada is a geographically large jurisdiction with varied environmental and socio-cultural contexts. This cross-sectional study examined variation in motor vehicle crash rates across 100 police patrols to investigate the association of crashes with key explanatory factors. METHODS: Eleven crash outcomes (total crashes, injury crashes, fatal crashes, speed related fatal crashes, total fatalities, single-vehicle night-time crashes, rear-end collisions, and collisions involving heavy vehicles, pedestrians, cyclists, or motorcyclists) were identified from police collision reports and insurance claims and mapped to police patrols. Six potential explanatory factors (intensity of traffic law enforcement, speed limits, climate, remoteness, socio-economic factors, and alcohol consumption) were also mapped to police patrols. We then studied the association between crashes and explanatory factors using negative binomial models with crash count per patrol as the response variable and explanatory factors as covariates. RESULTS: Between 2003 and 2012 there were 1,434,239 insurance claim collisions, 386,326 police reported crashes, and 3,404 fatal crashes. Across police patrols, there was marked variation in per capita crash rate and in potential explanatory factors. Several factors were associated with crash rates. Percent roads with speed limits </= 60 km/hr was positively associated with total crashes, injury crashes, rear end collisions, and collisions involving pedestrians, cyclists, and heavy vehicles; and negatively associated with single vehicle night-time crashes, fatal crashes, fatal speeding crashes, and total fatalities. Higher winter temperature was associated with lower rates of overall collisions, single vehicle night-time collisions, collisions involving heavy vehicles, and total fatalities. Lower socio-economic status was associated with higher rates of injury collisions, pedestrian collisions, fatal speeding collisions, and fatal collisions. Regions with dedicated traffic officers had fewer fatal crashes and fewer fatal speed related crashes but more rear end crashes and more crashes involving cyclists or pedestrians. The number of traffic citations per 1000 drivers was positively associated with total crashes, fatal crashes, total fatalities, fatal speeding crashes, injury crashes, single vehicle night-time crashes, and heavy vehicle crashes. Possible explanations for these associations are discussed. CONCLUSIONS: There is wide variation in per capita rates of motor vehicle crashes across BC police patrols. Some variation is explained by factors such as climate, road type, remoteness, socioeconomic variables, and enforcement intensity. The ability of explanatory factors to predict crash rates would be improved if considered with local traffic volume by all travel modes.
26956457	Antigenic Drift of A/H3N2/Virus and Circulation of Influenza-Like Viruses During the 2014/2015 Influenza Season in Poland.	Morbidity rates of influenza could be greatly reduced due to vaccination. However, the virus is able to evolve through genetic mutations, which is why vaccines with updated composition are necessary every season. Their effectiveness depends on whether there is a good antigenic match between circulating viruses and vaccine strains. In Poland, the 2014/2015 influenza epidemic started in week 5 (January/February) of 2015 and continued until week 17 (April) of 2015. The influenza activity was moderate with the highest incidence of influence-like illness at week 10/2015 (March). During that season, antigenic drift of influenza virus A/H3N2/ occurred causing higher rates of A/H3N2/ infections. Among the 2416 tested specimens, 22.6 % of influenza cases were positive for A/H3N2/, while A/H1N1/pdm09 constituted 14.6 % cases. Influenza A viruses were detected in co-circulation with influenza B viruses; the latter amounted to 34.1 % of all influenza detections. Other detected causes of influenza-like illness consisted of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), being predominant, and, sporadically, human coronavirus, parainfluenza 1-3, rhinovirus, and adenovirus. Despite low vaccine effectiveness of solely one component, A/H3N2/, the vaccine could mitigate or shorten the length of influenza infection and reduce the number of severe outcomes and mortality. Thus, vaccination against influenza remains the most effective way to prevent illness and possibly fatal outcomes.
27723651	Excess Body Weight during Childhood and Adolescence Is Associated with the Risk of Multiple Sclerosis: A Meta-Analysis.	BACKGROUND AND AIM: Several epidemiological studies have reported the association between obesity and multiple sclerosis (MS). METHODS: A literature search of the observational studies, published as original articles in English before December 2015, was performed using electronic databases. RESULTS: Five observational studies were included, of which 3 were case-control studies and 2 were cohort studies. The pooled relative risk (RR) for overweight and obesity during childhood and adolescence compared with normal weight (body mass index = 18.5-24.9 kg/m2) was 1.44 (95% CI 1.22-1.70) and 2.01 (95% CI 1.63-2.48), respectively. In subgroup analyses, we found that excess body weight during childhood and adolescence increased the risk of MS in the female group (overweight: pooled RR = 1.62, 95% CI 1.35-1.94; obesity: pooled RR = 2.25, 95% CI 1.77-2.85), but not in the male group (overweight: pooled RR = 1.19, 95% CI 0.91-1.55; obesity: pooled RR = 1.22, 95% CI 0.79-1.90). CONCLUSIONS: Excess body weight during childhood and adolescence was associated with an increased risk of MS; severe obesity demonstrated a stronger risk. A statistically significant association was found in the female group, but not in the male group.
27135609	Factors Contributing to Satisfaction with Changes in Physical Function after Orthopedic Surgery for Musculoskeletal Dysfunction in Patients with Cerebral Palsy.	BACKGROUND: The recognition of required treatments for cerebral palsy (CP) patients, including orthopedic surgery, differs according to region. This study was performed to identify factors associated with satisfactory changes in physical function after orthopedic surgery. METHODS: 358 patients were selected for the questionnaire survey. The following information was collected: gender, primary disease, age of initial surgery, total procedural count, operated sites, satisfaction of postoperative rehabilitation frequency, ideal amount of postoperative rehabilitation sessions per week, frequency of voluntary home training per week, satisfaction of the timing of surgery and the current satisfaction with the changes in physical function after the orthopedic surgery. We classified the patients into the satisfied and dissatisfied group according to satisfactory changes in physical function after the surgery. We performed unpaired t-tests and chi-square tests to determine the variables that differed significantly between the groups. Variables with a p value of <0.2 were included in the multivariate logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: The logistic model was revised and summed up to two potential predictors of postsurgical satisfaction with physical function: satisfaction with the frequency of postoperative rehabilitation sessions and the orthopedic surgery of the hip (distinction hit ratio, 75.4%). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that the frequency of postoperative rehabilitation and history of hip surgery seemed to be related to the satisfaction with the changes in physical function after orthopedic surgery.
27455563	[THE UNESTERIFIED FATTY ACIDS IN BLOOD PLASMA AND INTERCELLULAR MEDIUM: EFFECT OF INSULIN AND ALBUMIN (THE LECTURE)].	The high content of palmitic saturated fatty acid, palmitic triglycerides in food, the large amount of lipoproteins of very low density of the same name in blood, obvious insufficient amount of unesterified fatty acids releasing under lipolysis in blood to meet in vivo requirements in biotransforming energy of ATP are the causes of biological malfunction of homeostasis. As a rule, for every cell in vivo everything is always to be enough. The deficiency of synthesis of ATP by reason of non-optimal substratum for acquirement of ATP by mitochondria is followed by activation also phylogenetically earlier biological function of adaptation, biological reaction of stress. Thus, surplus of palmitic unesterified fatty acid after every food intake forms in vivo biological reaction of "metabolic" stress, deficiency of energy by reason of realization by mitochondria in vivo non-optimal exogenous substratum-palmitic unesterified fatty acid, deficiency of acyl- and acetyl-KoA and prognostically formation of potentially ineffective palmitic alternative of metabolism of fatty acids. The deficiency of palmitic unesterified fatty acids in biological reaction of exotrophy after every intake of food compensates biological reaction of stress, activation of releasing of palmitic unesterified fatty acids from visceral fatty cells of gland as it physiologically occurs in biological reaction of endotrophy. At that, adrenalin increases lipolysis in visceral fatty cells of gland and physiologically late insulin can't inhibit lipolysis in phylogenetically early visceral fatty cells. Increasing of content of unesterifed fatty acids in blood plasma, as it always occurs in vivo, stops absorption of glucose by cells initiating hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and syndrome of resistance to insulin. The result of such a compensation of biological reaction of exotrophy is biological reaction of endotrophy, condition of "metabolic" stress, depletion of function of beta-cells of islets with formation of diabetes mellitus type I, deficiency in vivo of insulin synthesis. The biological role of albumin - transfer of fatty acids in intercellular medium inform of unesterifed fatty acids and prevention of formation of pool of free fatty acids effecting aphysiologically.
27167045	[Mortality from work-related accidents among agricultural workers in Brazil, 2000-2010].	This study estimated annual mortality from work-related injuries in agriculture in Brazil, 2000-2010. The Mortality Information System (SIM) was used to identify cases. Missing data for occupation and work-related injuries were retrieved through other available individual records and incorporated into total cases. Population data were obtained from the official censuses. A total of 8,923 deaths from work-related injuries were identified, of which 44.8% were located by data retrieval. In the year 2000, estimated crude mortality from work-related injuries was 6.4/100,000 workers, increasing to 8.1/100,000 in 2003 and declining to 7.3/100,000 in 2010. The leading circumstances of deaths in men involved "riding animals or using animal-drawn vehicles", whereas pesticide poisoning was the leading cause in women. Overall mortality from work-related injuries in agriculture was low when compared to that of other countries, suggesting residual under-recording despite data retrieval and thus calling for quality improvement in records. Gender-sensitive preventive measures are necessary.
27580923	Skeleton Genetics: a comprehensive database for genes and mutations related to genetic skeletal disorders.	Genetic skeletal disorders (GSD) involving the skeletal system arises through disturbances in the complex processes of skeletal development, growth and homeostasis and remain a diagnostic challenge because of their clinical heterogeneity and genetic variety. Over the past decades, tremendous effort platforms have been made to explore the complex heterogeneity, and massive new genes and mutations have been identified in different GSD, but the information supplied by literature is still limited and it is hard to meet the further needs of scientists and clinicians. In this study, combined with Nosology and Classification of genetic skeletal disorders, we developed the first comprehensive and annotated genetic skeletal disorders database, named 'SkeletonGenetics', which contains information about all GSD-related knowledge including 8225 mutations in 357 genes, with detailed information associated with 481 clinical diseases (2260 clinical phenotype) classified in 42 groups defined by molecular, biochemical and/or radiographic criteria from 1698 publications. Further annotations were performed to each entry including Gene Ontology, pathways analysis, protein-protein interaction, mutation annotations, disease-disease clustering and gene-disease networking. Furthermore, using concise search methods, intuitive graphical displays, convenient browsing functions and constantly updatable features, 'SkeletonGenetics' could serve as a central and integrative database for unveiling the genetic and pathways pre-dispositions of GSD.Database URL: http://101.200.211.232/skeletongenetics/.
27200415	Pharmacokinetic, biodistribution and therapeutic efficacy of 5-fluorouracil-loaded pH-sensitive PEGylated liposomal nanoparticles in HCT-116 tumor bearing mouse.	The objective of the study was to investigate the pharmacokinetics and efficacy of 5-FU entrapped pH-sensitive liposomal nanoparticles with surface-modified anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) antibody (pHLNps-5-FU) delivery system. Cytotoxicity of 5-FU and pHLNps-5-FU was determined in vitro against HCT-116 cells. The biodistribution and pharmacokinetic parameters of the administered 5-FU and pHLNps-5-FU as well as efficacy of 5-FU and pHLNps-5-FU were determined in HCT-116 subcutaneous mouse model. Mean size of pHLNp-5-FU was 164.3 +/- 8.4 nm with entrapment efficiency (E.E) of 54.17%. While cytotoxicity of 5-FU and pHLNps-5-FU showed a strong dose-dependent, pHLNps-5-FU proved to be more effective (2-3 fold high) than that of 5-FU against HCT-116 cells. Pharmacokinetic study showed a prolonged plasma circulation of pHLNps-5-FU and a more significant body exposure while accumulation of pHLNps-5-FU in tumor was significantly higher than that of free 5-FU. Further, the efficacy of pHLNps-5-FU, was greater than free 5-FU at equivalent 5-FU dose. The study suggests that pHLNps may be an effective drug delivery system to enhance the anticancer activity of 5-FU against colorectal tumor growth.
27741262	A Qualitative Analysis of Disclosure Patterns among Women with Sexual Violence-Related Pregnancies in Eastern Democratic Republic of Congo.	The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) has experienced nearly two decades of civil conflict in the Eastern regions of North and South Kivu. This conflict has been notorious for the use of sexual violence as a weapon of war, leading in many cases to pregnancy after rape. The objectives of this analysis were: 1) to describe patterns of sexual violence-related pregnancy (SVRP) disclosure; 2) to consider why survivors chose to disclose to particular individuals; and 3) to examine the dialogue around SVRPs between women with SVRPs and their confidants. In South Kivu Province, Democratic Republic of Congo, two sub-groups of sexual violence survivors completed qualitative interviews, those currently raising a child from an SVRP (parenting group, N = 38) and those who had terminated an SVRP (termination group, N = 17). The findings show that a majority of SVRPs were conceived when participants were held in sexual captivity for prolonged periods of time. The SVRPs were disclosed to friends, family members, other sexual violence survivors, community members, spouses, health care providers, or perpetrators. The confidants were most often chosen because they were perceived by the participants as being discreet, trusted, and supportive. The confidants often provided advice about continuing or terminating the SVRP. Trust and discretion are the most important factors determining to whom women with SVRPs disclose their pregnancies. The vital role of confidants in giving support after disclosure cannot be overlooked. Providing opportunities for survivors to safely disclose their SVRPs, including to health care providers, is a necessary first step in allowing them to access safe and comprehensive post-assault care and services.
26966362	The investigation of factors related to suicide attempts in Southeastern Turkey.	BACKGROUND: Suicide is an important health problem in Turkey as it is in all regions of the world. Suicidal behavior has multiple causes, which are broadly divided into those related to proximal stressors and those due to predisposition. Suicide statistics may be associated with mental health disorders, which are among the foremost predictors of suicide attempts. More than 90% of patients who commit suicide have a diagnosable psychiatric disorder, usually a major depressive disorder. Other major risk factors for suicide attempts are history of suicide attempts in the family, stressful life events, sleep disturbances, poor income, unemployment, severity of symptoms of depression, and anxiety. Sleep is a complex phenomenon. Sleep disturbances can therefore be contributed to the emergence of suicidal behavior allowing for the possibility of predicting future suicides. METHODS: We evaluated 106 patients who were admitted after suicide attempts to the Department of Psychiatry at Dicle University Faculty of Medicine. The recruited subjects were assessed by Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I disorders, and the intensity of symptoms was evaluated using the Beck Anxiety Inventory, Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. The mean values of the subjects attempting multiple and single suicides were compared using appropriate inferential statistical tests. RESULTS: Most suicide attempts are believed to be preventable. Our results revealed that a great variety of risk factors are associated with an increased risk for multiple suicide attempts. Most of these attempts appeared to be spontaneous and impulsive rather than planned. In particular, this study highlights the importance of previous suicide attempts, history of suicide in the family, history of stressful life events in the previous 6 months, poor income, unemployment, sleep disturbances, severe hopelessness with depression, and coexisting symptoms of anxiety as risk factors. CONCLUSION: The first step in prevention of suicides is doubtlessly strong and reliable communication, due to the fact that the majority of subjects who commit suicide have had contact with a health professional during the month before the suicide.
27536203	The association between interleukin-4 -590C/T genetic polymorphism, IL-4 serum level, and advanced endometriosis.	AIM OF THE STUDY: Aim of the study was to investigate interleukin (IL)-4 serum levels in patients with advanced endometriosis and whether IL-4 promoter region (-590C/T) genetic polymorphism is involved in genetic susceptibility to endometriosis. MATERIAL AND METHODS: IL-4 serum levels and IL-4 -590C/T genetic polymorphism were determined for 80 patients with advanced endometriosis and 85 healthy fertile women using a multiplex cytokine kit, with a Luminex 200 system; high molecular weight genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes, and further analyzed by PCR amplification and restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-PFLP). The relationship between IL-4 serum levels, genotypes and haplotypes and the presence of endometriosis was explored. RESULTS: Interleukin 4 serum levels were significantly higher in the endometriosis group compared to controls (138,459 compared to 84,710, p < 0.001). No significant difference was observed in IL-4 serum levels between genotypes. There were no differences in IL-4 -590C/T genotypes and allele frequencies between control women and patients with endometriosis (chi (2) = 0.496, and chi (2) = 0.928, OR = 1.3636, CI: 0.725-2.564). CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that in patients with advanced stages of endometriosis there is a higher serum level of IL-4, and that this value, or the presence of the disease, is not influenced by the presence of IL-4 -590C/T genetic polymorphism.
26832419	Hierarchical Oct4 Binding in Concert with Primed Epigenetic Rearrangements during Somatic Cell Reprogramming.	The core pluripotency factor Oct4 plays key roles in somatic cell reprogramming through transcriptional control. Here, we profile Oct4 occupancy, epigenetic changes, and gene expression in reprogramming. We find that Oct4 binds in a hierarchical manner to target sites with primed epigenetic modifications. Oct4 binding is temporally continuous and seldom switches between bound and unbound. Oct4 occupancy in most of promoters is maintained throughout the entire reprogramming process. In contrast, somatic cell-specific enhancers are silenced in the early and intermediate stages, whereas stem cell-specific enhancers are activated in the late stage in parallel with cell fate transition. Both epigenetic remodeling and Oct4 binding contribute to the hyperdynamic enhancer signature transitions. The hierarchical Oct4 bindings are associated with distinct functional themes at different stages. Collectively, our results provide a comprehensive molecular roadmap of Oct4 binding in concert with epigenetic rearrangements and rich resources for future reprogramming studies.
27756030	Osseocutaneous radial forearm flap with beavertail modification; a case report of a novel, single, reconstructive free flap for the tongue, floor of mouth and mandible.	INTRODUCTION: Complex hard and soft tissue defects produced as a result of ablative resection of head and neck malignancy can represent a reconstructive challenge, especially when patients are medically compromised. PRESENTATION OF CASE: We present the case of 72-year-old women presenting with an oral squamous cell carcinoma of the right floor of mouth invading the right mandible. Surgical management of the disease required ablative surgery with complex free tissue transfer reconstruction to provide restoration of form and function. Potential reconstructive options were limited by her medical comorbidities and poor vessel patency in the lower limbs, requiring novel thinking and adaptation of established techniques. DISCUSSION: We describe the first reported use of an osseofasciocutaneous radial forearm flap with a 'beavertail modification' to provide a single and combined reconstructive option to reconstruct a complex hard and soft tissue defect. CONCLUSION: This novel free-flap technique adds to the reconstructive armamentarium of the head and neck surgeon.
26856633	Fabrication technologies and sensing applications of graphene-based composite films: Advances and challenges.	Graphene (G)-based composite materials have been widely explored for the sensing applications ascribing to their atom-thick two-dimensional conjugated structures, high conductivity, large specific surface areas and controlled modification. With the enormous advantages of film structure, G-based composite films (GCFs), prepared by combining G with different functional nanomaterials (noble metals, metal compounds, carbon materials, polymer materials, etc.), show unique optical, mechanical, electrical, chemical, and catalytic properties. Therefore, great quantities of sensors with high sensitivity, selectivity, and stability have been created in recent years. In this review, we focus on the recent advances in the fabrication technologies of GCFs and their specific sensing applications. In addition, the relationship between the properties of GCFs and sensing performance is concentrated on. Finally, the personal perspectives and key challenges of GCFs are mentioned in the hope to shed a light on their potential future research directions.
27433125	Seroepidemiological evidence of severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus infections in wild boars in Nagasaki, Japan.	Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) is an emerging disease in East Asia. It is thought that the SFTS virus (SFTSV) circulates between ticks and animals in nature and that the virus is transmitted to humans by tick bites. SFTS is endemic to Nagasaki in western Japan; however, epidemiological information regarding SFTSV in Nagasaki is not known. In this study, we performed SFTSV IgG ELISAs and neutralization antibody assays for a seroepidemiological survey using samples from wild boars captured in six areas of Nagasaki. SFTSV seropositive animals were found in three areas. Our findings provide epidemiological information on the distribution of SFTSV in Nagasaki.
28028526	Investigation of the relationship between idiopathic microscopic hematuria (in the first and second trimesters) and major adverse outcomes of pregnancy.	BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between idiopathic microscopic hematuria (in the first and second trimesters) and major adverse outcomes of pregnancy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Urinalysis was done for 700 pregnant women before 24 weeks of pregnancy. Those who had 3-5 red blood cells per milliliter in urinalysis were considered positive urinalysis. Then, all individuals were examined for blood pressure and other alarm signs of pregnancy complications in each visit. All mothers were followed for the incidence of preeclampsia, preterm delivery, and pregnancy outcome until the end of pregnancy. RESULTS: The results of this study showed that no significant difference in terms of incident of pregnancy complications between the pregnant women with and without hematuria and the only abortions and neonatal deaths differed between the two groups. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that further studies are needed to determine whether idiopathic microscopic hematuria can be a predictive value for pregnancy complications or not.
27036068	Contributions of DNA repair and damage response pathways to the non-linear genotoxic responses of alkylating agents.	From a risk assessment perspective, DNA-reactive agents are conventionally assumed to have genotoxic risks at all exposure levels, thus applying a linear extrapolation for low-dose responses. New approaches discussed here, including more diverse and sensitive methods for assessing DNA damage and DNA repair, strongly support the existence of measurable regions where genotoxic responses with increasing doses are insignificant relative to control. Model monofunctional alkylating agents have in vitro and in vivo datasets amenable to determination of points of departure (PoDs) for genotoxic effects. A session at the 2013 Society of Toxicology meeting provided an opportunity to survey the progress in understanding the biological basis of empirically-observed PoDs for DNA alkylating agents. Together with the literature published since, this review discusses cellular pathways activated by endogenous and exogenous alkylation DNA damage. Cells have evolved conserved processes that monitor and counteract a spontaneous steady-state level of DNA damage. The ubiquitous network of DNA repair pathways serves as the first line of defense for clearing of the DNA damage and preventing mutation. Other biological pathways discussed here that are activated by genotoxic stress include post-translational activation of cell cycle networks and transcriptional networks for apoptosis/cell death. The interactions of various DNA repair and DNA damage response pathways provide biological bases for the observed PoD behaviors seen with genotoxic compounds. Thus, after formation of DNA adducts, the activation of cellular pathways can lead to the avoidance of a mutagenic outcome. The understanding of the cellular mechanisms acting within the low-dose region will serve to better characterize risks from exposures to DNA-reactive agents at environmentally-relevant concentrations.
27432672	Imaging acute ischemic stroke.	Acute ischemic stroke is common and often treatable, but treatment requires reliable information on the state of the brain that may be provided by modern neuroimaging. Critical information includes: the presence of hemorrhage; the site of arterial occlusion; the size of the early infarct "core"; and the size of underperfused, potentially threatened brain parenchyma, commonly referred to as the "penumbra." In this chapter we review the major determinants of outcomes in ischemic stroke patients, and the clinical value of various advanced computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging methods that may provide key physiologic information in these patients. The focus is on major strokes due to occlusions of large arteries of the anterior circulation, the most common cause of a severe stroke syndrome. The current evidence-based approach to imaging the acute stroke patient at the Massachusetts General Hospital is presented, which is applicable for all stroke types. We conclude with new information on time and stroke evolution that imaging has revealed, and how it may open the possibilities of treating many more patients.
27403958	Accelerometer-Measured Physical Activity and Sedentary Time Differ According to Education Level in Young Adults.	This study examined the association of education level with objectively measured physical activity and sedentary time in young adults. Data from the Finnish ESTER study (2009-2011) (n = 538) was used to examine the association between educational attainment and different subcomponents of physical activity and sedentary time measured using hip-worn accelerometers (ActiGraph GT1M) for seven consecutive days. Overall physical activity, moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), light-intensity physical activity and sedentary time were calculated separately for weekdays and weekend days. A latent profile analysis was conducted to identify the different profiles of sedentary time and the subcomponents of physical activity. The educational differences in accelerometer-measured physical activity and sedentary time varied according to the subcomponents of physical activity, and between weekdays and weekend days. A high education level was associated with high MVPA during weekdays and weekend days in both sexes, high sedentary time during weekdays in both sexes, and a low amount of light-intensity physical activity during weekdays in males and during weekdays and weekend days in females. The results indicate different challenges related to unhealthy behaviours in young adults with low and high education: low education is associated with a lack of MVPA, whereas high education is associated with a lack of light-intensity physical activity and high sedentary time especially during weekdays.
26901643	New Phylogenetic Groups of Torque Teno Virus Identified in Eastern Taiwan Indigenes.	Torque teno virus (TTV) is a single-stranded DNA virus highly prevalent in the world. It has been detected in eastern Taiwan indigenes with a low prevalence of 11% by using N22 region of which known to underestimate TTV prevalence excessively. In order to clarify their realistic epidemiology, we re-analyzed TTV prevalence with UTR region. One hundred and forty serum samples from eastern Taiwanese indigenous population were collected and TTV DNA was detected in 133 (95%) samples. Direct sequencing revealed an extensive mix-infection of different TTV strains within the infected individual. Entire TTV open reading frame 1 was amplified and cloned from a TTV positive individual to distinguish mix-infected strains. Phylogenetic analysis showed eleven isolates were clustered into a monophyletic group that is distinct from all known groups. In addition, another our isolate was clustered with recently described Hebei-1 strain and formed an independent clade. Based on the distribution pattern of pairwise distances, both new clusters were placed at phylogenetic group level, designed as the 6th and 7th phylogenetic group. In present study, we showed a very high prevalence of TTV infection in eastern Taiwan indigenes and indentified new phylogenetic groups from the infected individual. Both intra- and inter-phylogenetic group mix-infections can be found from one healthy person. Our study has further broadened the field of human TTVs and proposed a robust criterion for classification of the major TTV phylogenetic groups.
27681876	Absence of TolC Impairs Biofilm Formation in Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae by Reducing Initial Attachment.	Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae is the etiologic agent of porcine contagious pleuropneumonia, a major cause of economic loss in swine industry worldwide. TolC, the key component of multidrug efflux pumps and type I secretion systems, has been well-studied as an exit duct for numerous substances in many Gram-negative bacteria. By contrast, little is known on the role of TolC in biofilm formation. In this study, a DeltatolC mutant was used to examine the importance of TolC in biofilm formation of A. pleuropneumoniae. Surface attachment assays demonstrated the essential role of TolC in initial attachment of biofilm cells. The loss of TolC function altered surface hydrophobicity, and resulted in greatly reduced autoaggregation in DeltatolC. Using both enzymatic treatments and confocal microscopy, biofilm composition and architecture were characterized. When compared against the wild-type strain, the poly-beta-1, 6-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (PGA), an important biofilm matrix component of A. pleuropneumoniae, was significantly reduced at the initial attachment stage in DeltatolC. These results were confirmed by mRNA level using quantitative RT-PCR. Additionally, defective secretion systems in DeltatolC may also contribute to the deficiency in biofilm formation. Taken together, the current study demonstrated the importance of TolC in the initial biofilm formation stage in A. pleuropneumoniae. These findings could have important clinical implications in developing new treatments against biofilm-related infections by A. pleuropneumoniae.
27652130	Age and gender distribution of Hepatitis C virus prevalence and genotypes of individuals of physical examination in WuHan, Central China.	Approximately 170 million people in the world are infected with Hepatitis C virus (HCV). There are no published population based studies about the prevalence of HCV genotypes and the associations of genotype and Infection frequency with gender and age in WuHan. We aimed to investigate the distribution of HCV prevalence and genotypes among different gender and age patients with chronic HCV infection in WuHan from 2011 to 2015. A total of 2685 anti-HCV positive serum samples from individuals of physical examinationwere recruited from the Renmin Hospital of WuHan University, Hubei Province in China from January 2011 to December 2015. From these 2685 anti-HCV positive serum samples, 496 samples were with a positive PCR for HCV RNA. The number of HCV infection showed an increase with year, but the annual infection rate has remained similar (chi(2) = 2.94, P = 0.568). 2685 cases were infected with HCV from 2011 to 2015 in WuHan city of China. Blood transfusion (18.14 %) was the main routs of transmission, followed by Surgery (8.94 %). The highest prevalence of HCV infection was at the age group 50-59 (25.85 % of 2685) and the lowest prevalence was 0-9 (0.93 % of 2685). HCV genotype 1 was the most prevalent (73.39 %), followed by genotypes 2 (17.14 %), 3 (5.25 %) and 6 (3.22 %). Genotype 4 and 5 was not detected in these patients. The most prevalent subtype was subtype 1b (71.98 %), followed by genotypes 2a (17.14 %). Five patients had mixed infection across the HCV subtypes. Among all genotypes, genotype 1 was highest in both male (73.27 %) and female (73.47 %) patients, followed by genotype 2. Genotype 1 (male: 29.84 % of 496, vs female: 43.55 % of 496, chi(2) = 20.07, P < 0.0001), genotype 2 (male: 6.25 % of 496, vs female: 10.89 % of 496, chi(2) = 6.81, P = 0.009), and 6 (male: 1.41 % of 496, vs female: 1.81 % of 496, chi(2) = 0.626, P = 0.401) were more common in female patients than males, while no significant gender differences were observed for genotype 6. Among age group 50-59 years Genotype 1 was most common in male patients (29.05 % of 148) followed in 20-29 years (23.65 % of 148), genotype 2 in the age group 60-69 (12 cases of 31) and genotype 3 in the age group 50-59 (4 cases of 13) and genotype 6 was most frequent in the age group 30-39 (4 cases of 7). The frequency of HCV prevalence was significantly higher in female patients compared to males before ages 60, while the opposite result was observed after 60 years. The most common HCV genotype in WuHan was subtype 1b followed by 2a and more common among women than males patients. Further studies are needed to collect a large number of samples to estimate the different epidemiology of the HCV genotypes, because the sample size of non-genotype 1b and 2a is not large enough and other factors like disease history/monthly income/etc. are not included in our study.
27033526	Report on religious slaughter practices in Italy.	The term 'religious slaughter' commonly refers to the practice of killing animals without stunning, according to the precepts of Jewish and Muslim religions. The aim of this paper is to assess the situation concerning ritual slaughtering in not-stun bovines, small ruminants, and poultry in Italy in 2012. The study was divided into 2 phases. During the rst phase, preliminary data about all slaughterhouses authorized for ritual slaughter in Italy in 2012 are collected through the compilation of a questionnaire sent to each plants. The second step involved a sampling of not-stun animals religiously slaughtered in 5 selected plants. Authors collected and compiled all informations about management, restrain system and rite taking into account in particular animal welfare.
27706194	Work-Related Factors Considered by Sickness-Absent Employees When Estimating Timeframes for Returning to Work.	INTRODUCTION: Work-related factors have been found to be influential in shaping a number of return-to-work outcomes including return-to-work expectations. Based on the idea that work-related factors have the potential for modification through workplace-based initiatives, this study involved a detailed examination of work-related factors referenced by workers as being taken into consideration when estimating timeframes for returning to work. METHODS: Focus groups were conducted with 30 employees, currently off work (</= 3 months) due to a musculoskeletal condition. During the focus groups, participants wrote and spoke about the factors that they considered when forming their expectations for returning to work. Data were subjected to thematic content analysis. RESULTS: Discussions revealed that participants' considerations tended to differ depending on whether or not they had a job to return to. Those with jobs (n = 23) referenced specific influences such as working relationships, accommodations, physical and practical limitations, as well as concerns about their ability to do their job. Those without a job to return to (n = 7) talked about the ways they would go about finding work, and how long they thought this would take. Both groups mentioned the influence of wanting to find the "right" job, retraining and being limited due to the need for income. CONCLUSION: Findings indicate that employees reference numerous work-related factors when estimating their timeframes for returning to work, and that many of these have been previously identified as relating to other return-to-work outcomes. Findings suggest the potential to improve return-to-work expectation through addressing work-related influences, and helping people work through the tasks they need to complete in order to move forward in the return-to-work process.
27105061	A hierarchical Bayesian approach to adaptive vision testing: A case study with the contrast sensitivity function.	Measurement efficiency is of concern when a large number of observations are required to obtain reliable estimates for parametric models of vision. The standard entropy-based Bayesian adaptive testing procedures addressed the issue by selecting the most informative stimulus in sequential experimental trials. Noninformative, diffuse priors were commonly used in those tests. Hierarchical adaptive design optimization (HADO; Kim, Pitt, Lu, Steyvers, & Myung, 2014) further improves the efficiency of the standard Bayesian adaptive testing procedures by constructing an informative prior using data from observers who have already participated in the experiment. The present study represents an empirical validation of HADO in estimating the human contrast sensitivity function. The results show that HADO significantly improves the accuracy and precision of parameter estimates, and therefore requires many fewer observations to obtain reliable inference about contrast sensitivity, compared to the method of quick contrast sensitivity function (Lesmes, Lu, Baek, & Albright, 2010), which uses the standard Bayesian procedure. The improvement with HADO was maintained even when the prior was constructed from heterogeneous populations or a relatively small number of observers. These results of this case study support the conclusion that HADO can be used in Bayesian adaptive testing by replacing noninformative, diffuse priors with statistically justified informative priors without introducing unwanted bias.
26904345	Bilateral Congenital Agenesis of the Long Head of the Biceps Tendon: The Beginning.	The biceps brachii muscle is prone to variants but absence of the long head of the biceps (LHB) tendon is an exceptionally rare anomaly. This report concerns the fourth case of bilateral congenital absence of the LHB tendon and presents the ultrasonography (US) and magnetic resonance (MR) findings. Our case has the peculiarity of being the first in which bilateral LHB tendon agenesis is not associated with rotator cuff or labral tears.
27583077	[Multifocal tuberculosis in immunocompetent patients].	Multifocal tuberculosis is defined as the presence of lesions affecting at least two extrapulmonary sites, with or without pulmonary involvement. This retrospective study of 10 cases aims to investigate the clinical and evolutionary characteristics of multifocal tuberculosis. It included 41 cases with tuberculosis collected between 1999 and 2013. Ten patients had multifocal tuberculosis (24%): 9 women and 1 man, the average age was 50 years (30-68 years). Our patients were correctly BCG vaccinated. The evaluation of immunodepression was negative in all patients. 7 cases had lymph node tuberculosis, 3 cases digestive tuberculosis, 2 cases pericardial tuberculosis, 2 cases osteoarticular tuberculosis, 1 case brain tuberculosis, 2 cases urinary tuberculosis, 4 cases urogenital tuberculosis, 1 case adrenal tuberculosis, 1 case cutaneous and 1 case muscle tuberculosis. All patients received anti-tuberculosis treatment for a mean duration of 10 months, with good evolution. Multifocal tuberculosis is difficult to diagnose. It can affect immunocompetent patients but often has good prognosis. Anti-tuberculosis therapy must be initiated as soon as possible to avoid sequelae.
27219110	Influence of the Oil Phase and Topical Formulation on the Wound Healing Ability of a Birch Bark Dry Extract.	Triterpenes from the outer bark of birch are known for various pharmacological effects including enhanced wound healing (WH). A birch bark dry extract (TE) obtained by accelerated solvent extraction showed the ability to form oleogels when it is suspended in oils. Consistency of the oleogels and the dissolved amount of triterpenes varies largely with the used oil. Here we wanted to know to what extent different oils and formulations (oleogel versus o/w emulsion) influence WH. Looking at the plain oils, medium-chain triglycerides (MCT) enhanced WH (ca. 1.4-fold), while e.g. castor oil (ca.0.3-fold) or light liquid paraffin (LLP; ca. 0.5-fold) significantly decreased WH. Concerning the respective oleogels, TE-MCT showed no improvement although the solubility of the TE was high. In contrast, the oleogel of sunflower oil which alone showed a slight tendency to impair WH, enhanced WH significantly (ca. 1.6-fold). These results can be explained by release experiments where the release rate of betulin, the main component of TE, from MCT oleogels was significantly lower than from sunflower oil oleogels. LLP impaired WH as plain oil and even though it released betulin comparable to sunflower oil it still results in an overall negative effect of the oleogel on WH. As a further formulation option also surfactant free o/w emulsions were prepared using MCT, sunflower oil and LLP as a nonpolar oil phase. Depending on the preparation method (suspension or oleogel method) the distribution of the TE varied markedly and affected also release kinetics. However, the released betulin was clearly below the values measured with the respective oleogels. Consequently, none of the emulsions showed a significantly positive effect on WH. In conclusion, our data show that the oil used as a vehicle influences wound healing not only by affecting the release of the extract, but also by having its own vehicle effect on wound healing. This is also of importance for other applications where drugs have to be applied in non-polar vehicles because these solvents likely influence the outcome of the experiment substantially.
27050433	Smoking and Subclinical ILD in RA versus the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis.	A population-based cohort showed an association between cigarette smoking and subclinical parenchymal lung disease defined as regions of increased computed tomography (CT) lung densitometry. This technique has not been applied to the rheumatoid arthritis (RA) population where associated ILD is highly prevalent. The association between cumulative cigarette smoking and volume of areas of high attenuation (HAA: >-600 and <-250 Hounsfield Units) on full inspiratory CT was compared in 172 RA participants and 3,969 controls in a general population sample. Multivariable regression models were used to adjust for demography, anthropometrics, percent emphysema, and CT parameters. The mean cumulative cigarette smoking exposure was 25 (IQR 10-42) and 15(IQR 5-31) pack-years for the RA and non-RA cohorts, respectively. Mean HAA was 153(+/-57) cm3 and 129(+/-50) cm3 in the RA and non-RA cohorts, respectively. Each 10 cigarette pack-year increment was associated with a higher HAA by 0.03% (95% CI, 0.007-0.05%) in RA patients and by 0.008% (95% CI, 0.003-0.01%) in those without RA (interaction p = 0.001). Cigarette smoking was associated with higher lung attenuation; with a magnitude of association more pronounced in those with RA than in the general population. These data suggest that cigarette smoking may be a more potent ILD risk factor for RA patients than in the general population.
27326248	MiR-34a and miR-203 Inhibit Survivin Expression to Control Cell Proliferation and Survival in Human Osteosarcoma Cells.	Elevated expression of survivin is observed in a number of cancer types, including human osteosarcoma. Few studies have demonstrated that survivin expression levels can be considered an independent predictor of survival for human osteosarcoma patients. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of survivin in the process of human osteosarcoma carcinogenesis remain unclear. In the current study, we evaluated the biological effects of survivin knockdown on osteosarcoma cell proliferation, colony formation rate, and sensitivity to the chemotherapeutic agent cisplatin. We found that two different osteosarcoma cell lines, U2OS and Saos-2, have relatively higher expression levels of survivin, and specific knockdown of survivin resulted in a number of effects, such as inhibition of cell proliferation, decreased colony formation rate, cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase, induction of apoptosis, and increased sensitivity to cisplatin. In addition, we identified two microRNAs, miR-34a and miR-203, that are aberrantly expressed in human osteosarcoma cells and specifically target survivin by inhibiting its expression, therefore repressing osteosarcoma cell maintenance and proliferation.
27650016	[AbstractA woman with knee pain after a fall in childhood].	A 32-year-old woman presented with pain in her left knee ever since she had fallen down the stairs as a child and had landed on this knee. On the X-ray we saw two large patella fragments. We made the diagnosis of dislocated and subluxated fracture of the patella without consolidation. The previously missed fracture was treated conservatively.
27560977	Argon Preconditioning Protects Airway Epithelial Cells against Hydrogen Peroxide-Induced Oxidative Stress.	BACKGROUND: Oxidative stress is the predominant pathogenic mechanism of ischaemia-reperfusion (IR) injury. The noble gas argon has been shown to alleviate oxidative stress-related myocardial and cerebral injury. The risk of lung IR injury is increased in some major surgeries, reducing clinical outcome. However, no study has examined the lung-protective efficacy of argon preconditioning. The present study investigated the protective effects of argon preconditioning on airway epithelial cells exposed to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) to induce oxidative stress. METHODS: A549 airway epithelial cells were treated with a cytotoxic concentration of H2O2 after exposure to standard air or 30 or 50% argon/21% oxygen/5% carbon dioxide/rest nitrogen for 30, 45 or 180 min. Cells were stained with annexin V/propidium iodide, and apoptosis was evaluated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Protective signalling pathways activated by argon exposure were identified by Western blot analysis for phosphorylated candidate molecules of the mitogen-activated protein kinase and protein kinase B (Akt) pathways. RESULTS: Preconditioning with 50% argon for 30, 45 and 180 min and 30% argon for 180 min caused significant protection of A549 cells against H2O2-induced apoptosis, with increases in cellular viability of 5-47% (p < 0.0001). A small adverse effect was also observed, which presented as a 12-15% increase in cellular necrosis in argon-treated groups. Argon exposure resulted in early activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38, peaking 10- 30 min after the start of preconditioning, and delayed activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) pathway, peaking after 60-90 min. CONCLUSIONS: Argon preconditioning protects airway epithelial cells from H2O2-induced apoptotic cell death. Argon activates the JNK, p38, and ERK1/2 pathways, but not the Akt pathway. The cytoprotective properties of argon suggest possible prophylactic applications in surgery-related IR injury of the lungs.
27446081	Recognition and Regulation of T Cells by NK Cells.	Regulation of T cell responses by innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) is increasingly documented and studied. Direct or indirect crosstalk between ILCs and T cells early during and after T cell activation can affect their differentiation, polarization, and survival. Natural killer (NK) cells that belong to the ILC1 group were initially described for their function in recognizing and eliminating "altered self" and as source of early inflammatory cytokines, most notably type II interferon. Using signals conveyed by various germ-line encoded activating and inhibitory receptors, NK cells are geared to sense sudden cellular changes that can be caused by infection events, malignant transformation, or cellular stress responses. T cells, when activated by TCR engagement (signal 1), costimulation (signal 2), and cytokines (signal 3), commit to a number of cellular alterations, including entry into rapid cell cycling, metabolic changes, and acquisition of effector functions. These abrupt changes may alert NK cells, and T cells might thereby expose themselves as NK cell targets. Here, we review how activated T cells can be recognized and regulated by NK cells and what consequences such regulation bears for T cell immunity in the context of vaccination, infection, or autoimmunity. Conversely, we will discuss mechanisms by which activated T cells protect themselves against NK cell attack and outline the significance of this safeguard mechanism.
27463520	Distending Pressure Did Not Activate Acute Phase or Inflammatory Responses in the Airways and Lungs of Fetal, Preterm Lambs.	BACKGROUND: Mechanical ventilation at birth causes airway injury and lung inflammation in preterm sheep. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is being increasingly used clinically to transition preterm infants at birth. OBJECTIVE: To test if distending pressures will activate acute phase reactants and inflammatory changes in the airways of fetal, preterm lambs. METHODS: The head and chest of fetal lambs at 128+/-1 day GA were surgically exteriorized. With placental circulation intact, fetal lambs were then randomized to one of five 15 minute interventions: PEEP of 0, 4, 8, 12, or 16 cmH2O. Recruitment volumes were recorded. Fetal lambs remained on placental support for 30 min after the intervention. The twins of each 0 cmH2O animal served as controls. Fetal lung fluid (FLF), bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BAL), right mainstem bronchi and peripheral lung tissue were evaluated for inflammation. RESULTS: Recruitment volume increased from 0.4+/-0.04 mL/kg at 4 cmH2O to 2.4+/-0.3 mL/kg at 16 cmH2O. The lambs were surfactant deficient, and all pressures were below the opening inflection pressure on pressure-volume curve. mRNA expression of early response genes and pro-inflammatory cytokines did not increase in airway tissue or lung tissue at any pressure compared to controls. FLF and BAL also did not have increases in early response proteins. No histologic changes or Egr-1 activation was present at the pressures used. CONCLUSION: Distending pressures as high as 16 cmH2O did not recruit lung volume at birth and did not increase markers of injury in the lung or airways in non-breathing preterm fetal sheep.
26849256	Single and Combined Exposure to Zinc- and Copper-Containing Welding Fumes Lead to Asymptomatic Systemic Inflammation.	OBJECTIVE: Recently, it has been shown that exposure to welding fumes containing both zinc and copper leads to asymptomatic systemic inflammation in humans as shown by an increase of blood C-reactive protein. In the present study, it was investigated which metal is responsible for this effect. METHODS: Fifteen healthy male subjects were exposed under controlled conditions to welding fumes containing either zinc, or copper, or copper and zinc. RESULTS: For each exposure blood C-reactive protein increased. CONCLUSIONS: Copper- and zinc-containing welding fumes are able to induce systemic inflammation.
27806357	Virtues and Weaknesses of DNA Methylation as a Test for Cervical Cancer Prevention.	Epigenetics is the study of heritable and non-heritable genetic coding that is additive to information contained within classical DNA base pair sequences. Differential methylation has a fundamental role in the development and outcome of malignancies, chronic and degenerative diseases and aging. DNA methylation can be measured accurately and easily via various molecular methods and has become a key technology for research and healthcare delivery, with immediate roles in the elucidation of disease natural history, diagnostics and drug discovery. This review focuses on cancers of the lower genital tract, for which the most epigenetic information exists. DNA methylation has been proposed as a triage for women infected with human papillomavirus (HPV) and may eventually directly complement or replace HPV screening as a one-step molecular diagnostic and prognostic test. Methylation of human genes is strongly associated with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and cancer. Of the more than 100 human methylation biomarker genes tested so far in cervical tissue, close to 20 have been reported in different studies, and approximately 10 have been repeatedly shown to have elevated methylation in cervical cancers and high-grade CIN (CIN2 and CIN3), most prominently CADM1, EPB41L3, FAM19A4, MAL, miR-124, PAX1 and SOX1. Obtaining consistent performance data from the literature is quite difficult because most methylation studies used a variety of different assay methodologies and had incomplete and/or biased clinical specimen sets, varying assay thresholds and disparate target gene regions. There have been relatively few validation studies of DNA methylation biomarkers in large population-based screening studies, but an encouraging development more recently is the execution of well-designed studies to test the true performance of the markers in real-world settings. Methylation of HPV genes, especially HPV16, HPV18, HPV31, HPV33 and HPV45, in disease progression has been a major focus of research. Elevated methylation of the HPV16 L1 and L2 open reading frames, in particular, is associated with CIN2, CIN3 and invasive cancer. Essentially all cancers have high levels of methylation for human genes and for driver HPV types, which suggests that quantitative methylation tests may have utility in predicting CIN2 and CIN3 that are likely to progress. It is still early in the process of development of methylation biomarkers, but already they are showing strong promise as a universal and systematic approach to molecular triage, applicable to all cancers, not just cancer of the cervix. DNA methylation testing is better than HPV genotyping triage and is competitive with or complementary to other approaches such as cytology and p16 staining. Genome-wide studies are underway to systematically expand methylation classifier panels and find the best combinations of biomarkers. Methylation testing is likely to show big improvements in performance in the next 5 years.
27366183	Patient Characteristics and Outcomes of Outpatient Parenteral Antimicrobial Therapy: A Retrospective Study.	Outpatient parenteral antimicrobial therapy (OPAT) is a safe and effective alternative to hospitalization for many patients with infectious diseases. The objective of this study was to describe the OPAT experience at a Canadian tertiary academic centre in the absence of a formal OPAT program. This was achieved through a retrospective chart review of OPAT patients discharged from Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre within a one-year period. Between June 2012 and May 2013, 104 patients (median age 63 years) were discharged home with parenteral antimicrobials. The most commonly treated syndromes included surgical site infections (33%), osteoarticular infections (28%), and bacteremia (21%). The most frequently prescribed antimicrobials were ceftriaxone (21%) and cefazolin (20%). Only 56% of the patients received follow-up care from an infectious diseases specialist. In the 60 days following discharge, 43% of the patients returned to the emergency department, while 26% required readmission. Forty-eight percent of the return visits were due to infection relapse or treatment failure, and 23% could be attributed to OPAT-related complications. These results suggest that many OPAT patients have unplanned health care encounters because of issues related to their infection or treatment, and the creation of a formal OPAT clinic may help improve outcomes.
27433596	Investigating the Fluorescence Quenching of Doxorubicin in Folic Acid Solutions and its Relation to Ligand-Targeted Nanocarriers.	Folic acid (FA) is one of the most utilized moieties in active (ligand) drug delivery. The folate receptor is widely expressed on the surface of several cell lines and tumors; including ovarian, brain, kidney, breast, and lung cancers. During our previous experiments with Doxorubicin (Dox) encapsulated in folate-targeted micelles, we found that flow cytometry underestimated the amount of drug that accu- mulates inside cells. We attributed this effect to the quenching of Dox by FA and herein investigate this phenomenon in an attempt to obtain a correction factor that could be applied to the fluorescence of Dox in the presence of FA. Initially, we examine the effect of pH on the fluorescence spectra of FA, Dox, equimolar solutions of FA and Dox in water, HCI (0.1 M), and NaOH (0.1 M) solutions. We then measure the effect of the gradual increase of FA concentration on the fluorescence intensity of Dox in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solutions (pH of 7.4). Using the Stern-Volmer equation, we estimate the association constant of FA-Dox to be K(SV) = 1.5 x 10(4) M(-1). Such an association constant indicates that at the concentrations of FA used in targeted drug delivery systems, a significant concentration of Dox exists as FA-Dox complexes with a quenched fluorescence. Therefore, we conclude that when Dox is used in FA-active drug delivery systems, a correction factor is needed to predict the correct fluorescence intensity of agent in vitro and in vivo.
27547675	Tactical expertise assessment in youth football using representative tasks.	Specific football drills improve the development of technical/tactical and physical variables in players. Based on this principle, in recent years it has been possible to observe in daily training a growing volume of small-sided and conditioned games. These games are smaller and modified forms of formal games that augment players' perception of specific tactics. Despite this approach, the assessment of players' knowledge and tactical execution has not been well documented, due mainly to the difficulty in measuring tactical behavior. For that reason, this study aims to provide a narrative review about the tactical assessment of football training by using representative tasks to measure the tactical expertise of youth football players during small-sided and conditioned games. This study gives an overview of the ecological approach to training and the principles used for representative task design, providing relevant contribution and direction for future research into the assessment of tactical expertise in youth football.
27026773	German gynecologists' experience with a universal screening for gestational diabetes mellitus in daily practice: A qualitative study.	OBJECTIVE: In March 2012, a universal screening for gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) was implemented in Germany. Despite international recommendations, a two-step approach was introduced [step 1: 50-g glucose challenge test (GCT); if GCT is suspicious, step 2 follows: 75-g oral glucose tolerance test with (OGTT)]. This qualitative study aimed at examining how gynecologists administer the screening for GDM in daily practice, whether they perceive any difficulties, and whether they have suggestions for improvement. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Seventeen resident gynecologists were interviewed face-to-face in semi-structured interviews. The interviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim, coded, and analyzed using qualitative content techniques. RESULTS: We revealed differences in the screening administration. Three gynecologists directly offered the second step of the two-step screening (OGTT) instead of completing the first step before offering the second step. These gynecologists only conducted GCT if the woman (with statutory health insurance) was not willing to pay for OGTT. Critique concerns the late introduction of billing codes, lack of information from official institutions, unavailability of readymade syrup with 50-g glucose, and lack of information material for pregnant women. CONCLUSION: Our results reflect that not all gynecologists appear to conduct the screening conforming to the maternity directive. However, this has to be validated in larger quantitative surveys. That some gynecologists directly conducted OGTT may fuel the discussion regarding the screening procedure. The two-step approach was already highly controversial at the time of introducing the screening because national and international organizations recommend a one-step approach. Therefore, our results are also relevant for other countries who have implemented a two-step screening and for countries planning to implement a screening.
27064898	Clinical Impact of Pancreatic Metastases from Renal Cell Carcinoma: A Multicenter Retrospective Analysis.	Pancreatic metastases from renal cell carcinoma are uncommon and their prognostic significance is not well defined. In this analysis we evaluated the outcome of patients with pancreatic metastases treated with either targeted therapies or local treatment to the pancreas. Patients with pancreatic metastases from renal cell carcinoma treated between 1993 and 2014 were identified from 11 European centers. Clinical records were retrospectively reviewed. Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test were used to evaluate progression-free survival and overall survival. Cox's proportional hazard models were used for survival analysis. In total, 276 PM patients were evaluated, including 77 (28%) patients treated by either surgery or radiotherapy to the pancreas, and 256 (93%) who received systemic therapy. Median time from nephrectomy to diagnosis of pancreatic metastases was 91 months (IQR 54-142). Disease control rate after first-line TTs was 84%, with a median progression-free survival of 12 months (95% CI 10-14). Median overall survival was 73 months (95% CI 61-86) with a 5-year OS of 58%. Median OS of patients treated with local treatment was 106 months (95% CI 78-204) with a 5-year overall survival of 75%. On multivariable analysis, nephrectomy (HR 5.31; 95%CI 2.36-11.92; p<0.0001), Memorial Sloan Kettering/International Metastatic RCC Database Consortium prognostic score (HR 1.45, 95% CI 0.94-2.23 for intermediate vs good vs risk; HR 2.76 95%, CI 1.43-5.35 for poor vs good risk p = 0.0099) and pancreatic local treatment (HR 0.48; 95%CI 0.30-0.78 p = 0.0029) were associated with overall survival. Difference in median OS between patients with PM and that reported in a matched-control group of mRCC patients with extrapancreatic metastases was statistically significant (p < .0001). Pancreatic metastases from renal cell carcinoma usually occur years after nephrectomy, are associated with an indolent behavior and a prolonged survival. Targeted therapies and locoregional approaches are active and achieve high disease control rate.
26865965	Phenotypic plasticity in growth and fecundity induced by strong population fluctuations affects reproductive traits of female fish.	Fish are known for their high phenotypic plasticity in life-history traits in relation to environmental variability, and this is particularly pronounced among salmonids in the Northern Hemisphere. Resource limitation leads to trade-offs in phenotypic plasticity between life-history traits related to the reproduction, growth, and survival of individual fish, which have consequences for the age and size distributions of populations, as well as their dynamics and productivity. We studied the effect of plasticity in growth and fecundity of vendace females on their reproductive traits using a series of long-term incubation experiments. The wild parental fish originated from four separate populations with markedly different densities, and hence naturally induced differences in their growth and fecundity. The energy allocation to somatic tissues and eggs prior to spawning served as a proxy for total resource availability to individual females, and its effects on offspring survival and growth were analyzed. Vendace females allocated a rather constant proportion of available energy to eggs (per body mass) despite different growth patterns depending on the total resources in the different lakes; investment into eggs thus dictated the share remaining for growth. The energy allocation to eggs per mass was higher in young than in old spawners and the egg size and the relative fecundity differed between them: Young females produced more and smaller eggs and larvae than old spawners. In contrast to earlier observations of salmonids, a shortage of maternal food resources did not increase offspring size and survival. Vendace females in sparse populations with ample resources and high growth produced larger eggs and larvae. Vendace accommodate strong population fluctuations by their high plasticity in growth and fecundity, which affect their offspring size and consequently their recruitment and productivity, and account for their persistence and resilience in the face of high fishing mortality.
27076845	miR-196, an Emerging Cancer Biomarker for Digestive Tract Cancers.	Over the past decade, the emergence of microRNA (miRNA) research has firmly established this molecular family as a key component in cells. MiRNAs, which function as negative gene regulators, participate in multiple biological processes and maintain homeostasis in cells. The dysregulation of miRNA may contribute to numerous human disorders, including cancer. Recently, miR-196 was found to be aberrantly expressed in a wide range of malignant diseases, which suggests that it plays important roles in carcinogenesis. Here, we summarize the current knowledge concerning miR-196 family in cancers. This review includes miR-196 gene structure and aberrant expression in various cancers, and current understanding of numerous functions and regulatory targets of miR-196 in specific cancers. Since miR-196 are consistently found over-expressed in digestive tract cancer tissues, we also reviewed the clinical significance and potential applications of miR-196 in these cancers. We highlight that miR-196 may serve as an emerging cancer biomarker for digestive tract cancers.
26911222	Patient and health system delays among adult smear-positive tuberculosis patients diagnosed at medical colleges of Puducherry in south India.	Early diagnosis and prompt initiation of treatment are essential for an effective tuberculosis (TB) control program. This study was done to assess the extent of various delays among TB patients diagnosed at medical colleges of Puducherry. A cross-sectional study involving retrospective medical record review and prospective patient interviews was conducted in and around the union territory of Puducherry during the period 2009-10. Various delays and adjusted odds ratios (ORs) were calculated. Level of significance was determined at 95% confidence interval (CI) (P value <0.05) and all tests were two-sided. Among 216 new sputum smear-positive TB patients, 11.1% and 10.6% were smokers and alcohol users, respectively. The median patient delay, health system delay, and total delay was 37 days, 28 days, and 65 days respectively. Being a resident of Puducherry (OR = 0.39, 95% CI = 0.18-0.87) and family size of </=5 (OR = 0.45, 95% CI = 0.21-0.97) were found as the determinants of patient delays and total delays, respectively.
27578009	Enhancing the Three-Dimensional Structure of Adherent Gingival Fibroblasts and Spheroids via a Fibrous Protein-Based Hydrogel Cover.	Tissue engineering-based therapies rely on the delivery of monolayered fibroblasts on two-dimensional polystyrene-coated and extracellular matrix (ECM) surfaces to regenerate connective tissues. However, this approach may fail to mimic their three-dimensional (3D) native architecture and function. We hypothesize that ECM fibrous proteins, which direct the migration of cells in vivo, may attach and guide polystyrene- and Matrigel-ECM (M-ECM)-adherent fibroblasts to rearrangement into large multicellular macrostructures with the ability to proliferate. Gingival monolayered fibroblasts and their derived spheroids were added and adhered to tissue culture polystyrene and M-ECM surfaces. The cells were covered with a layer of collagen1 hydrogel combined with vitronectin, fibronectin or fibrin, or 10% M-ECM. The development of 3D cell constructs was characterized by epifluorescence and confocal scanning microscope image analysis. The ECM turnover and the proliferative capabilities of the fibroblasts were determined via gene expression profiling of collagen1, fibronectin, matrix metalloproteinase/metallopeptidase 2, Nanog, and SRY (sex-determining region Y)-box2 (Sox2). Expression of the Sox2 protein was followed by immunostaining. The collagen1 protein had the strongest effect on monolayered and spheroid cell rearrangements, forming large spherical shapes and fused 3D macroconstructs. The addition of fibrin protein was typically required to achieve a similar effect on M-ECM-adherent monolayered fibroblasts. The spheroid fusion process was followed by an increase in cell density and the formation of tight clusters. The fused spheroids continued to maintain their intracellular ECM turnover and proliferation capacities. Collagen1 is a valuable component in the rearrangement of adherent fibroblast monolayers and spheroids. Fibroblast spheroids should preferably be used as basic building blocks to assemble multicellular connective tissue-like macrostructures.
27080667	Dynamics of Cochlear Nonlinearity.	Dynamic aspects of cochlear mechanical compression were studied by recording basilar membrane (BM) vibrations evoked by tone pairs ("beat stimuli") in the 11-19 kHz region of the gerbil cochlea. The frequencies of the stimulus components were varied to produce a range of "beat rates" at or near the characteristic frequency (CF) of the BM site under study, and the amplitudes of the components were balanced to produce near perfect periodic cancellations, visible as sharp notches in the envelope of the BM response. We found a compressive relation between instantaneous stimulus intensity and BM response magnitude that was strongest at low beat rates (e.g., 10-100 Hz). At higher beat rates, the amount of compression reduced progressively (i.e. the responses became linearized), and the rising and falling flanks of the response envelope showed increasing amounts of hysteresis; the rising flank becoming steeper than the falling flank. This hysteresis indicates that cochlear mechanical compression is not instantaneous, and is suggestive of a gain control mechanism having finite attack and release times. In gain control terms, the linearization that occurs at higher beat rates occurs because the instantaneous gain becomes smoothened, or low-pass filtered, with respect to the magnitude fluctuations in the stimulus. In terms of peripheral processing, the linearization corresponds to an enhanced coding, or decompression, of rapid amplitude modulations. These findings are relevant both to those who wish to understand the underlying mechanisms and those who need a realistic model of nonlinear processing by the auditory periphery.
27583361	Longitudinal Executive Changes in Drivers with Parkinson's Disease: Study Using Neuropsychological and Driving Simulator Tasks.	BACKGROUND/AIMS: (1) To investigate how specific executive functions change over 2 years in drivers with Parkinson's disease (PD) compared to controls, using both neuropsychological and driving simulator tasks; and (2) to explore the association between the decline of specific executive functions and changes in driving habits in PD. METHODS: Sixteen PD patients and 21 controls underwent neuropsychological testing twice and performed tasks on a driving simulator, with an interval of approximately 2 years. Questions on participants' self-perception of their driving ability were administered. RESULTS: A significant decline was observed in shift cost over time (Plus Minus Test) in patients (p = 0.008). This decline was greater in patients than in controls (p = 0.008). No significant change emerged over time in the flexibility cost of PD patients on a simulator (p = 0.158). Significant correlations were found between the decline in shift cost over time and driving question outcomes (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: This study reveals a differential course of executive functions in PD. Over time, patients displayed significant decline in flexibility associated with modifications in their driving. Flexibility seems to be affected as the disease progresses. This research opens new avenues in cognitive and driving rehabilitation.
27941194	[Genetic mutations as a cause of acute recurrent pancreatitis in children - case report and literature review].	Acute recurrent pancreatitis is not common in children. The epidemiology, etiology and clinical presentation of pediatric acute recurrent pancreatitis are not well understood. The etiology is diverse and multifactorial, with many cases being idiopathic. The most common etiology of acute recurrent pancreatitis in children are genetic factors, biliary duct disorders, anatomic anomalies of the pancreatobiliary system and metabolic diseases. Mutations are most commonly found in the cationic trypsynogen gene (PRSS1), the pancreatic secretory trypsin inhibitor gene (SPINK1) and the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene (CFTR). The case described here is that of a 6-year-old boy, without a family history of pancreatitis, who was hospitalized several times over 5 years, with epigastric pain and high serum levels of amylase and lipase. Genetic testing showed a heterozygous variation, c.194+2T>C (IVS3+2T>C) in the SPINK1 gene and variation c.1210-34TG(11) T(5) (IVS8-5T+(TG)11) in the CFTR gene. Other etiological factors also occurred leading to the initiation and relapses of the disease.
28157046	Use of modern contraceptives among married women in Vietnam: a multilevel analysis using the Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (2011) and the Vietnam Population and Housing Census (2009).	Background The prevalence of modern contraceptive use is an important indicator that reflects accessibility to reproductive health services. Satisfying unmet needs for family planning alone could reduce the number of maternal deaths by almost a third. This study uses multiple data sources to examine multilevel factors associated with the use of modern contraceptives among married women in Vietnam aged 15-49 years. Design Data from different national surveys (Vietnam Population and Housing Census, Vietnam Living Standard Survey, and Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey) were linked to create a dataset including individual and contextual (provincial) variables (N=8,341). Multilevel modeling was undertaken to examine the impact of both individual and provincial characteristics on modern contraceptive use. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) are reported. Results Individual factors significantly associated with the use of modern contraceptives were age 30-34 years (reference 15-19 years) (OR=1.63); high socioeconomic status (SES) (OR=0.8); having two living children (OR=2.4); and having a son (OR=1.4). The provincial poverty rate mediated the association between the individual's SES and the likelihood of using modern contraceptives. Conclusions The proportion of women in Vietnam using modern contraceptive methods has remained relatively high in recent years with significant variation across Vietnam's 63 provinces. Women of lower SES are more likely to use modern contraceptive methods, especially in the poorer provinces. Achieving access to universal reproductive health is one of the Millennium Development Goals. Vietnam must continue to make progress in this area.
28247709	[Application of temporary polyurethane-covered nitinol endoprosthesis in treating urethral stricture].	The incidence of urethral strictures and their recurrences is high. The effectiveness of optical urethrotomy in men is insufficient. Reconstructive urethroplasty is the "gold standard", but it is traumatic and accompanied by a prolonged period of rehabilitation. The results of using metal endourethral stents were unsatisfactory because of their incrustation and migration. This paper presents the results treating urethral strictures of various etiologies in 22 patients, who underwent optical urethrotomy with temporary placement of a new generation polyurethane-covered nitinol stents. After removing the stents from 3 to 8 months after implantation, there was a stable effect of preserving the urethral lumen. The recurrence of the stricture occurred in 1 case 1 month following the stent removal. In other cases, there were no recurrences over 1-3 year follow-up. We consider placing an internal stent as an alternative adjunctive treatment of patients with urethral strictures.
27275439	Ocular diseases: immunological and molecular mechanisms.	Many factors, such as environmental, microbial and endogenous stress, antigen localization, can trigger the immunological events that affect the ending of the diverse spectrum of ocular disorders. Significant advances in understanding of immunological and molecular mechanisms have been researched to improve the diagnosis and therapy for patients with ocular inflammatory diseases. Some kinds of ocular diseases are inadequately responsive to current medications; therefore, immunotherapy may be a potential choice as an alternative or adjunctive treatment, even in the prophylactic setting. This article first provides an overview of the immunological and molecular mechanisms concerning several typical and common ocular diseases; second, the functions of immunological roles in some of systemic autoimmunity will be discussed; third, we will provide a summary of the mechanisms that dictate immune cell trafficking to ocular local microenvironment in response to inflammation.
26858738	Transient Glyco-Engineering to Produce Recombinant IgA1 with Defined N- and O-Glycans in Plants.	The production of therapeutic antibodies to combat pathogens and treat diseases, such as cancer is of great interest for the biotechnology industry. The recent development of plant-based expression systems has demonstrated that plants are well-suited for the production of recombinant monoclonal antibodies with defined glycosylation. Compared to immunoglobulin G (IgG), less effort has been undertaken to express immunoglobulin A (IgA), which is the most prevalent antibody class at mucosal sites and a promising candidate for novel recombinant biopharmaceuticals with enhanced anti-tumor activity. Here, we transiently expressed recombinant human IgA1 against the VP8* rotavirus antigen in glyco-engineered DeltaXT/FT Nicotiana benthamiana plants. Mass spectrometric analysis of IgA1 glycopeptides revealed the presence of complex biantennary N-glycans with terminal N-acetylglucosamine present on the N-glycosylation site of the CH2 domain in the IgA1 alpha chain. Analysis of the peptide carrying nine potential O-glycosylation sites in the IgA1 alpha chain hinge region showed the presence of plant-specific modifications including hydroxyproline formation and the attachment of pentoses. By co-expression of enzymes required for initiation and elongation of human O-glycosylation it was possible to generate disialylated mucin-type core 1 O-glycans on plant-produced IgA1. Our data demonstrate that DeltaXT/FT N. benthamiana plants can be engineered toward the production of recombinant IgA1 with defined human-type N- and O-linked glycans.
26890694	Objective Assessment of Nuclear and Cortical Cataracts through Scheimpflug Images: Agreement with the LOCS III Scale.	PURPOSE: To assess nuclear and cortical opacities through the objective analysis of Scheimpflug images, and to check the correlation with the Lens Opacity Classification System III (LOCS III). METHODS: Nuclear and cortical opacities were graded according to the LOCS III rules after pupil dilation. The maximum and average pixel intensity values along an elliptical mask within the lens nucleus were taken to analyse nuclear cataracts. A new metric based on the percentage of opaque pixels within a region of interest was used to analyse cortical cataracts. The percentage of opaque pixels was also calculated for half, third and quarter areas from the region of interest's periphery. RESULTS: The maximum and average intensity values along the nucleus were directly proportional to the LOCS III grade: The larger the LOCS III value, the larger maximum and average intensity ones. These metrics showed a positive and significant correlation with the LOCS grade: The larger the LOCS grade, the higher was percentage of opaque pixels along the cortex within the same mask's size. This metric showed a significant correlation to the LOCS grade. CONCLUSION: The metrics used to assess nuclear opacities showed good correlation with the LOCS III. The percentage of opaque pixels showed to be a useful metric to measure objectively the severity of the cortical opacity. These metrics could be implemented in an algorithm to detect and grade lens opacities automatically and objectively.
27006536	Sonographic assessment of predictors of depth of the corner pocket for ultrasound-guided supraclavicular brachial plexus block.	BACKGROUND AND AIMS: There is wide variation in depth of brachial plexus in patient population at supraclavicular region. We plan to find the depth of the corner pocket and correlate it with age, weight, height and body mass index (BMI). MATERIAL AND METHODS: After approval from Ethics Committee, right-sided supraclavicular region of volunteers was scanned. Once an optimal image, which included subclavian artery, pleura, first rib and nerve bundles, was obtained, the corner pocket was kept in the middle of the screen and the image was frozen. Depth of the corner pocket from the skin was measured. Thereafter longest distance (LD) approximating needle trajectory was calculated. The Pearson correlation was used to calculate the relation between these two distances and various predictors such as weight, height, and BMI. RESULTS: Mean shortest distance that is, vertical distance from skin to corner pocket for all volunteers was found to be 1.7 +/- 0.8 cm and the mean LD that is, distance traveled by needle entering 1 cm from the edge of foot process to the corner pocket in an in-plane approach was 3.7 +/- 0.2 cm. We did not find any significant correlation between age, height versus measured distances. However, significant correlation (0.11) was found between weights, BMI versus two lengths. CONCLUSION: Prescanning of supraclavicular region for estimating depth of corner pocket should be done before choosing an appropriate size needle. Furthermore, the needle should not be advanced more than the predicted corner pocket depth.
27078933	[Investigation of Carbonaceous Airborne Particles by Scanning Proton Microprobe].	Carbonaceous particles are an important component of the atmospheric aerosol particles and important for global climate change, air quality and human health. The PM(1)(0) single particles from two environmental monitor locations and seven pollution emission sources were analyzed using scanning proton microprobe (SPM) techniques. The concentration of carbon in individual particles was quantitatively determined by proton non-Rutherford elastic backscattering spectrometry (EBS). The results of this investigation showed that carbonaceous particles were dominant in the pollution sources of coal and oil combustions, diesel busexhaust and automobile exhaust, while inorganic particles were dominant in the sources of steel industry, cement dust and soil dust. Carbonaceous matter was enriched in particles from the city center, while mineral matter was the main component of airborne particles in the industrial area. Elemental mapping of single aerosol particles yielded important information on the chemical reactions of aerosol particles. The micro-PIXE (particle induced X-ray emission) maps of S, Ca and Fe of individual carbonaceous particles showed that sulfuration reaction occurred between SO(2)and mineral particles, which increased the sulfur content of particles.
27898714	Comparable Effectiveness of First Week Treatment with Anti-Staphylococcal Penicillin versus Cephalosporin in Methicillin-Sensitive Staphylococcus aureus Bacteremia: A Propensity-Score Adjusted Retrospective Study.	The objective was to compare the prognostic impact of first week treatment with anti-staphylococcal penicillin (ASP) versus cephalosporin in methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia (MS-SAB). Altogether 580 patients were retrospectively followed and categorized according to first week treatment; 84% (488) received ASP (cloxacillin) and 16% (92) cephalosporin (cefuroxime or ceftriaxone). SAB management was optimized with formal bedside infectious disease specialist consultation in 88%, deep infection foci diagnosed in 77% and adjunctive rifampicin therapy given to 61% of patients. The total case fatality in 580 patients was 12% at 28 days and 18% at 90 days. When comparing effectiveness of first week ASP versus cephalosporin treatment there were no significant differences in 28-days (11% vs. 12%, OR; 1.05, 95% CI, 0.53-2.09) or 90-days (17% vs. 21% OR; 1.25, 95% CI, 0.72-2.19) outcome. In univariate analysis no prognostic impact of either first week ASP or cephalosporin treatment was observed for 28-days (OR; 0.96, 95% CI, 0.48-1.90 and OR; 1.05, 95% CI, 0.53-2.09) or 90-days (OR; 0.80, 95% CI, 0.46-1.39 and OR; 1.25, 95% CI, 0.72-2.19) outcome. Propensity-score adjusted Cox proportional regression analysis for first week treatment with cephalosporin demonstrated no significant prognostic impact at 28-days (HR 1.54, 95% CI 0.72-3.23) or 90-days (HR 1.56, 95% CI 0.88-2.86). IN CONCLUSION: There is a comparable effectiveness with respect to 28- and 90-days outcome for first week treatment with ASP versus cephalosporin in MS-SAB. The results indicate that the difference in prognostic impact between first week ASP and cephalosporin may be non-significant in patient cohorts with SAB management optimized by infectious disease specialist consultation.
27396124	[Effects of inter-row economic crop planting on soil moisture in a rain-fed jujube orchard in loess hilly region, China].	Soil moisture variation in dryland sloping jujube. orchard was investigated after introducing two economic crops, i.e., feed Brassica napus (JR) and Hemerocallis fulva (JH) planted between jujube rows. Jujube tree without inter-row crop was set as control (CK). The results showed that mean soil moisture for JR and JH in the 0-180 cm soil layer increased by 6.2% and 10.1% compared with CK, respectively. Soil moisture changed mainly in the 0-60 cm soil layer in growth stage of Jujube trees. Soil moisture in JR and JH treatments significantly increased in the 0-60 cm soil layer, which could meet the demand in water resource of jujube plantation. The water consumption of jujube trees also mainly concentrated in the 0-60 cm soil layer. There was a significant decay exponential relationship between the soil moisture in the 0-20 cm layer and the drought duration after rainfall. During the 18-day dry period after rain, the soil moisture contents of JR and JH were apparently higher than that of CK. In conclusion, the jujube-crop intercropping system improved the soil moisture condition. It was an effective measure to overcome the seasonal drought in jujube orchards on the loess hilly region.
27309734	Assessment of Open-Angle Glaucoma Peripapillary and Macular Choroidal Thickness Using Swept-Source Optical Coherence Tomography (SS-OCT).	OBJECTIVE: To compare peripapillary and macular choroidal thickness (PCT and MCT) between open-angle glaucoma (OAG) and normal controls using swept-source optical coherence tomography (SS-OCT), and to evaluate global and localized relationships between choroidal thickness and various factors in OAG, also using SS-OCT. METHODS: In this cross-sectional comparative study, 134 OAG patients and 73 normal controls were examined. PCT (global, 12 clock-hour sectors), MCT (global, six sectors) were measured by SS-OCT. The difference in choroidal thickness between the OAG patients and the normal controls was analyzed. The relationships between choroidal thickness and various factors including age, sex, spherical equivalent (SE), axial length (AXL), central corneal thickness (CCT), intraocular pressure (IOP), peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer thickness (pRNFLT), visual field mean deviation (MD), ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer thickness (GCIPLT), and disc area were analyzed by univariate and multivariate linear regression. Global and regional analyses were performed in 12 segments of the peripapillary circle and in six sectors of the macula. RESULTS: There were significant differences in global PCT and MCT between the OAG patients and the normal controls (115.22+/-41.17 vs. 138.89+/-44.70, P<0.001), (184.36+/-57.15 vs. 209.25+/-61.11, P = 0.004). The difference in global PCT remained, both after adjusting for age, AXL (117.08+/-3.45 vs. 135.47+/-4.70, P = 0.002) and also after adjusting for age, AXL, disc area (117.46+/-3.46 vs. 135.67+/-4.67, P = 0.002). But the difference in global MCT did not remain after adjusting for age, AXL, SE (188.18+/-4.46 vs. 202.25+/-6.08, P = 0.066). PCT showed significant differences between the groups in all of the 12 clock-hour sectors. These differences remained after adjusting for age, AXL and for age, AXL, disc area, with the exception of the 10 o'clock (o/c) sector. MCT in six sectors showed differences between the two groups, but they did not remain after adjusting for age, AXL, SE. In a multivariate regression analysis of the OAG patients, global PCT showed correlations with age (beta = -1.18, P = 0.001), AXL (beta = -14.01, P<0.001), and disc area (beta = -16.67, P = 0.026). Global MCT, meanwhile, showed a significant correlation with age (beta = -1.92, P<0.001), AXL. (beta = -21.97, P<0.001). Choroidal thickness did not show any global or localized relationship with glaucoma severity in the OAG patients. CONCLUSIONS: The global and all 12 clock-hour PCT, with the exception of the 10 o/c sector, were thinner in OAG; however, they did not show any correlation with glaucoma severity. Possible roles of PCT in glaucoma pathogenesis should be investigated further.
26888794	The Evolving Biology of Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer: Review of Recommendations From the Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group 3.	In 2008, the Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group 2 (PCWG2) developed consensus guidelines for clinical trial design and conduct that redefined trial endpoints, with a dual-objective paradigm: to (1) controlling, relieving, or eliminating disease manifestations at the start of treatment; and (2) preventing or delaying further disease manifestations. Clinical and translational research in prostate cancer has expanded our current-day understanding of the mechanisms of its pathogenesis, as well as the different clinicopathologic and molecular subtypes of the disease, and has improved the therapeutic armamentarium for the management of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). These new advances led to the development of the updated PCWG3 guidelines in 2015. In this review, we analyze our evolving understanding of the biology of CRPC, acquired resistance mechanisms, and emerging therapeutic targets in light of the updated PCWG3 guidelines. We present a joint perspective from the medical oncology and urologic disciplines on the ongoing efforts to advance clinical trial performance in order to discover new therapies for this fatal disease.
27408686	Assessment of pharmacogenomic agreement.	In 2013 we published an analysis demonstrating that drug response data and gene-drug associations reported in two independent large-scale pharmacogenomic screens, Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC) and Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE), were inconsistent. The GDSC and CCLE investigators recently reported that their respective studies exhibit reasonable agreement and yield similar molecular predictors of drug response, seemingly contradicting our previous findings. Reanalyzing the authors' published methods and results, we found that their analysis failed to account for variability in the genomic data and more importantly compared different drug sensitivity measures from each study, which substantially deviate from our more stringent consistency assessment. Our comparison of the most updated genomic and pharmacological data from the GDSC and CCLE confirms our published findings that the measures of drug response reported by these two groups are not consistent. We believe that a principled approach to assess the reproducibility of drug sensitivity predictors is necessary before envisioning their translation into clinical settings.
27070255	[The algorithm for surgical treatment of skull base tumors invading the craniovertebral junction].	UNLABELLED: Surgical treatment of skull base tumors invading the craniovertebral junction is a complex medical problem due to a high rate of adverse postoperative outcomes in these patients. AIM: The study aim was to optimize surgical treatment in patients with skull base tumors invading the craniovertebral junction. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A comparative analysis of 2 groups of patients was performed. The study group included 28 patients with skull base and craniovertebral junction chordomas who underwent single-stage surgery, including posterior occipitospondylodesis and tumour resection using the transoral and combined transoral and transnasal approaches, in the period between 2000 and 2015. The control group included 21 patients with the same pathology who underwent microsurgery using the transoral approach without occipitospondylodesis in the period between 1990 and 2009. RESULTS: Most of the patients in both groups were operated on at late disease stages when they presented with gross clinical signs. The use of single-stage occipitospondylodesis and transoral skull base tumor removal significantly (compared to the control group) extends indications for surgical treatment of skull base tumors, which were previously considered unresectable, and provides better results. CONCLUSION: New surgical techniques significantly increase the completeness of tumor resection, decrease the rate of postoperative complications, accelerate the rehabilitation process, and improve the patient's quality of life.
28210587	Level of physical activity and screen time among Iranian children and adolescents at the national and provincial level: The CASPIAN-IV study.	Background: There are few epidemiological reports on adherence to physical activity (PA) and screen-time (ST) recommendations among Iranian children and adolescents at the provincial level. We used nationally representative data to provide recent prevalence estimates of Iranian children who met the recommendations for PA and ST. Methods: This nationwide study was conducted among 14,880 students aged 6-18 years from 30 provinces of Iran. The frequency of the recommended level for PA (>1 hours/week) and ST (<2 hours/day) and different combinations of PA and ST was determined in the studied population. Results: In this study, 13,486 students (response rate: 90.6%) were studied. Overall, 18.62%, 34.11%, 50.66% and 9.63% of the students reported high ST, low level of PA, high TV watching and high computer working, respectively. The frequency of the recommended level of PA and ST was 53.92%. Of the studied population, 6.63% had low PA and high ST. Paradox combinations of low PA and low ST and moderate/high PA and high ST was prevalent among 27.47% and 6.26% of the children and adolescents. The lowest and highest frequency of recommended level of PA and ST was 38.9% and 65%, respectively. The lowest and highest frequency of low PA and high ST was 1.87% and 13.77%, respectively. Conclusion: The results of this study revealed that the frequency of low PA was high and that approximately 46% of the students did not meet the recommended level of PA and ST. The findings indicated that preparing facilities for improving PA level among children should be the main priority in our future interventions in this field.
27266033	[CHOICE OF SANITARY-INDICATIVE MICROORGANISMS FOR THE ASSESSMENT OF THE SAFETY OF SPLIT-SYSTEMS].	UNLABELLED: Purpose of work is a compilation of data about the microflora which colonizes a split-system, with the aim of selection of sanitary-indicative microorganisms, whose presence in the sample would indicate to the need for cleaning and disinfection of split-systems. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In the article there were used data of five years author's scientific inquiry, related to the prevention of respiratory diseases, associated with the usage of a local air conditioning systems. We also use the data from the literature. RESULTS: For selection of "indicative" microorganisms, we proposed the usage of nine criteria, each of them have numeric value from 0 to 3 points (risk for health, prevalence rate of the disease, epidemiological link, speed of split system's colonization, difficulty of cultivation, resistance in the environment, resistance to disinfectants, frequency of detection in home air conditioning systems, frequency of detection in air conditioning systems of public buildings). After the calculation Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus received maximal score (20 points). Therefore, these two types of bacteria are indicative microorganisms. The detection of these microorganisms in split systems will indicate to the contamination of air-conditioning system. This microflora also is a criterion of cleaning and disinfection quality--presence of these microorganisms in the samples after this process will mean that the processing of air conditioning systems was performed poorly. CONCLUSIONS: Split systems are very faster colonized by conditionally pathogenic and pathogenic microflora. To prevent the possible hazard for population's health it is necessary to develop the normative base, according to which sanitary-and-hygienic control over the split-systems working must be carried out. Proposed criteria suggest that Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus are indicative microorganisms, and it's identification in the air-conditioning system would mean risk for health and necessity for cleaning and disinfection.
27583273	Partial tendon tear as unusual cause of trigger finger: a case report.	We report a case of post-traumatic trigger finger due to a partial longitudinal tear of the flexor digitorum superficialis. The suspect came from the clinical history and the young age of the patient. It was successfully treated with tendon flap suture and pulley A1 release.
27442440	Adherence to Concurrent Tuberculosis Treatment and Antiretroviral Treatment among Co-Infected Persons in South Africa, 2008-2010.	BACKGROUND: Adherence to tuberculosis (TB) treatment and antiretroviral therapy (ART) reduces morbidity and mortality among persons co-infected with TB/HIV. We measured adherence and determined factors associated with non-adherence to concurrent TB treatment and ART among co-infected persons in two provinces in South Africa. METHODS: A convenience sample of 35 clinics providing integrated TB/HIV care was included due to financial and logistic considerations. Retrospective chart reviews were conducted among persons who received concurrent TB treatment and ART and who had a TB treatment outcome recorded during 1 January 2008-31 December 2010. Adherence to concurrent TB and HIV treatment was defined as: (1) taking >/=80% of TB prescribed doses by directly observed therapy (DOT) as noted in the patient card; and (2) taking >90% ART doses as documented in the ART medical record during the concurrent treatment period (period of time when the patient was prescribed both TB treatment and ART). Risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to identify factors associated with non-adherence. RESULTS: Of the 1,252 persons receiving concurrent treatment, 138 (11.0%) were not adherent. Non-adherent persons were more likely to have extrapulmonary TB (RR: 1.71, 95% CI: 1.12 to 2.60) and had not disclosed their HIV status (RR: 1.96, 95% CI: 1.96 to 3.76). CONCLUSIONS: The majority of persons with TB/HIV were adherent to concurrent treatment. Close monitoring and support of persons with extrapulmonary TB and for persons who have not disclosed their HIV status may further improve adherence to concurrent TB and antiretroviral treatment.
27474830	Post-coital vaginal cuff dehiscence with small bowel evisceration after laparoscopic type II radical hysterectomy: A case report.	INTRODUCTION: Vaginal cuff dehiscence after hysterectomy can be life-threating condition. Vaginal evisceration of bowel may lead to intestinal ischemia and intraabdominal infection. Immediate recognition and surgical repair are crucial for succesful management. CASE REPORT: Herein, we report a case of vaginal cuff dehiscence with small bowel evisceration in a 32-year old woman who underwent laparoscopic type II hysterectomy for stage IA2 cervical cancer. CONCLUSION: Patients who have undergone hysterectomy should be advised about when to restart coitus. Vaginal repair of vaginal cuff dehiscence is recommended if intestinal ischemia is excluded.
27239349	Fractalkine Attenuates Microglial Cell Activation Induced by Prenatal Stress.	The potential contribution of inflammation to the development of neuropsychiatric diseases has recently received substantial attention. In the brain, the main immune cells are the microglia. As they are the main source of inflammatory factors, it is plausible that the regulation of their activation may be a potential therapeutic target. Fractalkine (CX3CL1) and its receptor CX3CR1 play a crucial role in the control of the biological activity of the microglia. In the present study, using microglial cultures we investigated whether fractalkine is able to reverse changes in microglia caused by a prenatal stress procedure. Our study found that the microglia do not express fractalkine. Prenatal stress decreases the expression of the fractalkine receptor, which in turn is enhanced by the administration of exogenous fractalkine. Moreover, treatment with fractalkine diminishes the prenatal stress-induced overproduction of proinflammatory factors such as IL-1beta, IL-18, IL-6, TNF-alpha, CCL2, or NO in the microglial cells derived from prenatally stressed newborns. In conclusion, the present results revealed that the pathological activation of microglia in prenatally stressed newborns may be attenuated by fractalkine administration. Therefore, understanding of the role of the CX3CL1-CX3CR1 system may help to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the neuron-microglia interaction and its role in pathological conditions in the brain.
27026892	Perturbational blowup solutions to the compressible Euler equations with damping.	BACKGROUND: The N-dimensional isentropic compressible Euler system with a damping term is one of the most fundamental equations in fluid dynamics. Since it does not have a general solution in a closed form for arbitrary well-posed initial value problems. Constructing exact solutions to the system is a useful way to obtain important information on the properties of its solutions. METHOD: In this article, we construct two families of exact solutions for the one-dimensional isentropic compressible Euler equations with damping by the perturbational method. The two families of exact solutions found include the cases [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text], where [Formula: see text] is the adiabatic constant. RESULTS: With analysis of the key ordinary differential equation, we show that the classes of solutions include both blowup type and global existence type when the parameters are suitably chosen. Moreover, in the blowup cases, we show that the singularities are of essential type in the sense that they cannot be smoothed by redefining values at the odd points. CONCLUSION: The two families of exact solutions obtained in this paper can be useful to study of related numerical methods and algorithms such as the finite difference method, the finite element method and the finite volume method that are applied by scientists to simulate the fluids for applications.
27177566	Effect of Lidocaine-Ketamine Infusions Combined with Morphine or Fentanyl in Sevoflurane-Anesthetized Pigs.	Providing lidocaine, ketamine, and an opioid greatly decreases the minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) of volatile anesthetics in dogs. However, the efficacy of this combination shows marked interspecies variation, and opioids are likely to be less effective in pigs than in other species. The aim of the study was to determine the effects of constant-rate infusion of lidocaine and ketamine combined with either morphine or fentanyl on the MAC of sevoflurane in pigs. In a prospective, randomized, crossover design, 8 healthy crossbred pigs were premedicated with ketamine and midazolam, and anesthesia was induced and maintained with sevoflurane. Pigs then received ketamine (0.6 mg/kg/h) and lidocaine (3 mg/kg/h) combined with either morphine (0.24 mg/kg/h; MLK) or fentanyl (0.0045 mg/kg/h; FLK) after a loading dose; the control group received Ringers lactate solution. The anesthetic-sparing action of the 2 infusion protocols was calculated according to the MAC, by using dewclaw clamping as the standard noxious stimulus. The sevoflurane MAC (mean +/- 1 SD) was 2.0% +/- 0.2%, 1.9% +/- 0.4%, and 1.8% +/- 0.2% in the control, MLK, and FLK groups, respectively. No differences among groups or treatments were found. In conclusion, the administration of MLK or FLK at the studied doses did not reduce the MAC of sevoflurane in pigs.
27687599	[Pulmonary arterial hypertension, bone marrow, endothelial cell precursors and serotonin].	Serotonin and bone-marrow-derived stem cells participate together in triggering pulmonary hypertension. Our work has shown that the absence of 5-HT2B receptors generates permanent changes in the composition of the blood and bone-marrow in the myeloid lineages, particularly in endothelial cell progenitors. The initial functions of 5-HT2B receptors in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) are restricted to bone-marrow cells. They contribute to the differentiation/proliferation/mobilization of endothelial progenitor cells from the bone-marrow. Those bone-marrow-derived cells have a critical role in the development of pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary vascular remodeling. These data indicate that bone-marrow derived endothelial progenitors play a key role in the pathogenesis of PAH and suggest that interactions involving serotonin and bone morphogenic protein type 2 receptor (BMPR2) could take place at the level of the bone-marrow.
26929654	Costs associated with rheumatoid arthritis in Italy: past, present, and future.	This literature review examines available evidence on the current and past costs associated with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in Italy, together with the future health-economic prospects for the disease. Studies have been conducted to date on the prevalence, or the associated costs, of RA in Italy. Although future changes in the incidence of RA are a matter of debate, the impact of RA on health care costs is expected to grow in coming decades in line with projected increases in life expectancy and in the proportion of elderly people in Italy. It has been estimated that the indirect (productivity loss and informal care) and intangible (deterioration in health-related quality of life) costs of the disease will contribute to an increase in national health service expenditure, which will correspond to 1% of the total health care costs of the nation in the near future. The introduction of biological agents for the treatment of rheumatic diseases has resulted in an increase in the direct costs of RA; however, economic analyses that exclude indirect costs will underestimate the full economic impact of RA. The effectiveness of innovative therapies in preventing disease progression and functional impairment may, over time, attenuate the cost impact of RA in terms of hospitalizations and work absenteeism. Further research is needed to develop estimates of the economic impact of different therapeutic approaches in patients with RA in Italy, in order to provide tools that can drive the choice of the most cost-effective therapeutic option while maintaining high-quality care.
27221907	Estimating the Economic Burden of Premature Mortality Caused by Cancer in Iran: 2006-2010.	BACKGROUND: Cancer is currently one of the main public health problems all over the world and its economic burden is substantial both for health systems and for society as a whole.To inform priorities for cancer control, we here estimated years of potential life lost (YPLL) and productivity losses due to cancer-related premature mortality in Iran from 2006 to 2010. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The number of cancer deaths by sex and age groups for top ten leading cancers in Iran were obtained from the Ministry of Health and Medical Education. To estimate theYPLL and the cost of productivity loss due to cancer-related premature mortality, the life expectancy method and the human capital approach were used, respectively. RESULTS: There were 138,228 cancer-related deaths in Iran (without Tehran province) of which 76 % (106,954) were attributable to the top 10 ranked cancers. Some 63 % of total cancer-related deaths were of males. The top 10 ranked cancers resulted in 106,766,942 YPLL in total, 64,171,529 (60 %) in males and 42,595,412 (40%) in females. The estimated YPPLL due to top 10 ranked cancers was 58,581,737 during the period studied of which 32,214,524 (54%) was accounted for in males.The total cost of lost productivity caused by premature deaths because of top 10 cancers was 1.68 billion dollars (US$) from 2006 to 2010, ranging from 251 million dollars in 2006 to 283 million dollars in 2010. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that the economic burden of premature mortality attributable to cancer is significant for Iranian society. The findings provide useful information about the economic impact of cancer for health system policy/ decision makers and should facilitate planning of preventive intervention and effective resource allocation.
27049096	Early enteral and parenteral nutrition on immune functions of neurocritically ill patients.	This study was designed to investigate the influence of early enteral and parenteral nutrition on immune functions of neurocritically ill patients. Patients who were admitted to the neurological intensive care unit (ICU) of The Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University between May 2014 and January 2016 were selected. They had been hospitalized for more than one week and received enteral nutrition (EN) via nasogastric tube, with a gross energy of 25 kcal/(Kg d). Patients were divided into EN group, EN + early PN (EPN) group and EN + supplemental PN (SPN) group according to the time of PN support. Differences in patients general information and changes in serum protein and immune indexes were compared between the three groups. On admission, patients Glasgow coma scale (GCS), age, immune functions and protein indexes had no obvious differences between the three groups. After nutritional support, serum protein level reduced in the EN group while prealbumin (PALB) and retinol binding protein (RBP) increased in the EN + EPN group and EN + SPN group after one week of admission to hospital, and the differences were statistically significant (p less than 0.05). Total protein (TP), albumin (ALB), PALB and transferrin (TRF) increased significantly in the EN + EPN group and EN + SPN group compared with the EN group (p < 0.05); before and after treatment, an increase was found in ALB in the EN + EPN group in comparison with EN + SPN group, with a notable difference (p < 0.05); C3, C4, immunoglobulin M (IgM) and immunoglobulin A (IgA) increased in the EN + SPN group after nutritional support compared with before treatment, and the difference was statistically significant (p < 0.05). Moreover, immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgA in the EN + EPN group increased after nutritional support comparing to prior to nutritional support, and the difference was statistically significant (p < 0.05). After nutritional treatment, IgA and IgG increased markedly in the EN + EPN group, and there was a statistical significance between the groups (p < 0.05); the EN + EPN group and EN + SPN group exceeded the EN group in total lymphocyte count (TLC), and the difference had a statistical significance (p less than 0.05). These results demonstrate that neurocritically ill patients achieving the target energy can avoid malnutrition and immunodeficiency; serum protein decrease can cause malnutrition after one week of EN support; and enteral and parenteral nutrition can improve nutritional and immune indicators of neurocritically ill patients in the acute phase. In addition, EPN is more likely to improve malnutrition and immune functions of critical patients than SPN.
27055309	Trends in the Supply and Practice Environment of Nurse Practitioners in New Mexico.	This study examines the practice environment for nurse practitioners (NPs) in New Mexico and assesses whether the future supply of NPs will be adequate to meet the health care needs of a varied population in a sparsely populated state with a relatively low average standard of living, yet one that offers a broad scope of practice authority for its NPs. The study's models forecast decreasing numbers of New Mexico NPs between the ages of 40 and 60 in the state's metropolitan counties. These decreases are not offset by gains in other age brackets. Thus, over time, the state's metro areas may not maintain their 2013 NP-to-insured and NP-to-senior population ratios. In contrast, the study's models forecast improving ratios in nonmetropolitan counties. The future need for NPs in New Mexico and similarly situated states may therefore be greatest in fast-growing urban areas, where the number of newly insured individuals with primary care needs is likely to be high.
27588248	Effect of bolting on roadway support in extremely weak rock.	In mine roadway support operations, floor bolting not only played a role in floor heave control, but also in reinforcing roof and its two sides. Correspondingly, bolting of roof and two sides also played a part in floor heave control. To quantify the effect of such bolting, based on roadway support in extremely weak rock, three physical models were produced and tested in laboratory. Through comparison of their displacements in three physical simulation experiments, the reinforcing effect of bolting in extremely weak rock roadways was quantified. Reinforcing coefficients was defined as displacement ratio between original support and new support regime. Results indicated that the reinforcing coefficients, for bolting of roof and its two sides, on floor, two sides, and roof reached 2.18, 3.56, and 1.81 respectively. The reinforcing coefficients for floor bolting on floor, two sides, and roof reached 3.06, 2.34, and 1.39 respectively. So in this extremely weak rock, the surrounding rock should be considered as an integral structure in any support operation: this allows for better local strength improvement, and provided future design guidance.
27100787	Target and Non-Target Processing during Oddball and Cyberball: A Comparative Event-Related Potential Study.	The phenomenon of social exclusion can be investigated by using a virtual ball-tossing game called Cyberball. In neuroimaging studies, structures have been identified which are activated during social exclusion. But to date the underlying mechanisms are not fully disclosed. In previous electrophysiological studies it was shown that the P3 complex is sensitive to exclusion manipulations in the Cyberball paradigm and that there is a correlation between P3 amplitude and self-reported social pain. Since this posterior event-related potential (ERP) was widely investigated using the oddball paradigm, we directly compared the ERP effects elicited by the target (Cyberball: "ball possession") and non-target (Cyberball: "ball possession of a co-player) events in both paradigms. Analyses mainly focused on the effect of altered stimulus probabilities of the target and non-target events between two consecutive blocks of the tasks. In the first block, the probability of the target and non-target event was 33% (Cyberball: inclusion), in the second block target probability was reduced to 17%, and accordingly, non-target probability was increased to 66% (Cyberball: exclusion). Our results indicate that ERP amplitude differences between inclusion and exclusion are comparable to ERP amplitude effects in a visual oddball task. We therefore suggest that ERP effects--especially in the P3 range--in the Oddball and Cyberball paradigm rely on similar mechanisms, namely the probability of target and non-target events. Since the simulation of social exclusion (Cyberball) did not trigger a unique ERP response, the idea of an exclusion-specific neural alarm system is not supported. The limitations of an ERP-based approach will be discussed.
27227775	Sampling Enrichment toward Target Structures Using Hybrid Molecular Dynamics-Monte Carlo Simulations.	Sampling enrichment toward a target state, an analogue of the improvement of sampling efficiency (SE), is critical in both the refinement of protein structures and the generation of near-native structure ensembles for the exploration of structure-function relationships. We developed a hybrid molecular dynamics (MD)-Monte Carlo (MC) approach to enrich the sampling toward the target structures. In this approach, the higher SE is achieved by perturbing the conventional MD simulations with a MC structure-acceptance judgment, which is based on the coincidence degree of small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) intensity profiles between the simulation structures and the target structure. We found that the hybrid simulations could significantly improve SE by making the top-ranked models much closer to the target structures both in the secondary and tertiary structures. Specifically, for the 20 mono-residue peptides, when the initial structures had the root-mean-squared deviation (RMSD) from the target structure smaller than 7 A, the hybrid MD-MC simulations afforded, on average, 0.83 A and 1.73 A in RMSD closer to the target than the parallel MD simulations at 310K and 370K, respectively. Meanwhile, the average SE values are also increased by 13.2% and 15.7%. The enrichment of sampling becomes more significant when the target states are gradually detectable in the MD-MC simulations in comparison with the parallel MD simulations, and provide >200% improvement in SE. We also performed a test of the hybrid MD-MC approach in the real protein system, the results showed that the SE for 3 out of 5 real proteins are improved. Overall, this work presents an efficient way of utilizing solution SAXS to improve protein structure prediction and refinement, as well as the generation of near native structures for function annotation.
27414032	Density of Key-Species Determines Efficiency of Macroalgae Detritus Uptake by Intertidal Benthic Communities.	Accumulating evidence shows that increased biodiversity has a positive effect on ecosystem functioning, but the mechanisms that underpin this positive relationship are contentious. Complete extinctions of regional species pools are comparatively rare whereas compositional changes and reductions in abundance and biomass are common, although seldom the focus of biodiversity-ecosystem functioning studies. We use natural, small-scale patchiness in the density of two species of large bivalves with contrasting feeding modes (the suspension-feeding Austrovenus stutchburyi and deposit-feeding Macomona liliana) to examine their influence on the uptake of nitrogen from macroalgae detritus (i.e. measure of ecosystem function and food web efficiency) by other infauna in a 10-d laboratory isotope-tracer experiment. We predicted that densities of these key bivalve species and functional group diversity (calculated as Shannons H, a density-independent measure of community composition) of the intact infaunal community will be critical factors explaining variance in macroalgal per capita uptake rates by the community members and hence determine total uptake by the community. Results show that only two species, M. liliana and a large orbiniid polychaete (Scoloplos cylindrifer) dominated macroalgal nitrogen taken up by the whole community due to their large biomass. However, their densities were mostly not important or negatively influenced per capita uptake by other species. Instead, the density of a head-down deposit-feeder (the capitellid Heteromastus filiformis), scavengers (mainly nemertines and nereids) and species and functional group diversity, best explained per capita uptake rates in community members. Our results demonstrate the importance of species identity, density and large body size for ecosystem functioning and highlight the complex interactions underlying loss of ecological functions with declining biodiversity and compositional changes.
26836920	Longitudinal Measurement of Pleural Fluid Biochemistry and Cytokines in Malignant Pleural Effusions.	BACKGROUND: Malignant pleural effusion (MPE) is common. Existing literature on pleural fluid compositions is restricted to cross-sectional sampling with little information on longitudinal changes of fluid biochemistry and cytokines with disease progression. Indwelling pleural catheters provide the unique opportunity for repeated sampling and longitudinal evaluation of MPE, which may provide insight into tumor pathobiology. METHODS: We collected 638 MPE samples from 103 patients managed with indwelling pleural catheters over 95 days (median, range 0-735 days) and analyzed them for protein, pH, lactate dehydrogenase, and glucose levels. Peripheral blood was quantified for hematocrit, platelets, leukocytes, protein, and albumin. Cytokine levels (monocyte chemotactic protein [MCP]-1; vascular endothelial growth factor; interleukin-6, -8, and -10; tumor necrosis factor-alpha; and interferon-gamma) were determined in 298 samples from 35 patients with mesothelioma. Longitudinal changes of all parameters were analyzed using a linear mixed model. RESULTS: Significant decreases were observed over time in pleural fluid protein by 8 g/L per 100 days (SE, 1.32; P < .0001) and pH (0.04/100 days; SE, 0.02; P = .0203), accompanied by a nonsignificant rise in lactate dehydrogenase. The ratio of pleural fluid to serum protein decreased by 0.06/100 days (SE, 0.02; P = .04). MPEs from mesothelioma (n = 63) had lower pleural fluid glucose (P = .0104) at baseline and a faster rate of decline in glucose (P = .0423) when compared with non-mesothelioma effusions (n = 38). A progressive rise in mesothelioma pleural fluid concentration of [log] MCP-1 ([log] 0.37 pg/mL per 100 days; SE, 0.13; P = .0046), but not of other cytokines, was observed. CONCLUSIONS: MPE fluids become less exudative and more acidic over the disease course. The rise in MCP-1 levels suggests a pathobiological role in MPE.
27007760	Deflection test evaluation of different lots of the same nickel-titanium wire commercial brand.	INTRODUCTION: The aim of this in vitro study was to compare the elastic properties of the load-deflection ratio of orthodontic wires of different lot numbers and the same commercial brand. METHODS: A total of 40 nickel-titanium (NiTi) wire segments (Morelli Ortodontia--Sorocaba, SP, Brazil), 0.016-in in diameter were used. Groups were sorted according to lot numbers (lots 1, 2, 3 and 4). 28-mm length segments from the straight portion (ends) of archwires were used. Deflection tests were performed in an EMIC universal testing machine with 5-N load cell at 1 mm/minute speed. Force at deactivation was recorded at 0.5, 1, 2 and 3 mm deflection. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to compare differences between group means. RESULTS: When comparing the force of groups at the same deflection (3, 2 and 1 mm), during deactivation, no statistical differences were found. CONCLUSION: There are no changes in the elastic properties of different lots of the same commercial brand; thus, the use of different lots of the orthodontic wires used in this research does not compromise the final outcomes of the load-deflection ratio.
26854045	Clinical examination of anterior cruciate ligament rupture: a systematic review and meta-analysis.	OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of 3 tests for assessing anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) ruptures. METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and CBM (Chinese Biomedical Literature Database) searches were performed. Studies selected for data extraction were those that addressed the accuracy of at least 1 physical diagnostic test for ACL rupture in comparison with a clinical reference standard such as arthroscopy, arthrotomy, or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The references of the included studies were also reviewed. Searches were limited to English and Chinese languages. RESULTS: Sixteen studies that assessed the accuracy of the 3 tests for diagnosing ACL ruptures met the inclusion criteria. Study results were, however, heterogeneous. The Lachman test is the most sensitive test to determine ACL tears, showing a pooled sensitivity of 87.1% (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.84-0.90). The pivot shift test is the most specific test, showing a pooled specificity of 97.5% (95% CI 0.95-0.99); additionally, it has the highest positive likelihood ratios (LR+) of 16.00 (95% CI 7.34-34.87). The Lachman test has the lowest negative likelihood ratios (LR-) of 0.17 (95% CI 0.11-0.25). CONCLUSION: In cases of suspected ACL injury, it is recommended to perform the pivot shift test, as it is highly specific and has greater likelihood and discrimination of accurately diagnosing ACL rupture. The Lachman test has great efficacy in ruling out a diagnosis of ACL rupture because of the lowest negative likelihood ratios.
27034951	Development of High-Field Permanent Magnetic Circuits for NMRI/MRI and Imaging on Mice.	The high-field permanent magnetic circuits of 1.2 T and 1.5 T with novel magnetic focusing and curved-surface correction are developed. The permanent magnetic circuit comprises a magnetic yoke, main magnetic steel, nonspherical curved-surface magnetic poles, plugging magnetic steel, and side magnetic steel. In this work, a novel shimming method is proposed for the effective correction of base magnetic field (B 0) inhomogeneities, which is based on passive shimming on the telescope aspheric cutting, grinding, and fine processing technology of the nonspherical curved-surface magnetic poles and active shimming adding higher-order gradient coils. Meanwhile, the magnetic resonance imaging dedicated alloy with high-saturation magnetic field induction intensity and high electrical resistivity is developed, and nonspherical curved-surface magnetic poles which are made of the dedicated alloy have very good anti-eddy-current effect. In addition, the large temperature coefficient problem of permanent magnet can be effectively controlled by using a high quality temperature controller and deuterium external locking technique. Combining our patents such as gradient coil, RF coil, and integration computer software, two kinds of small animal Micro-MRI instruments are developed, by which the high quality MRI images of mice were obtained.
26929890	Trauma Boot Camp: A Simulation-Based Pilot Study.	INTRODUCTION: Interns are often unprepared to effectively communicate in the acute trauma setting. Despite the many strengths of the Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) program, the main shortcoming within the course is the deficiency of teamwork and leadership training. In this study, we describe the creation of an interdisciplinary boot camp in which interns' basic trauma knowledge, level of confidence, and teamwork skills are assessed. METHODS: We designed a one-day, boot camp curriculum for interns of various specialties with the purpose of improving communication and teamwork skills for effective management of acute trauma patients. Our curriculum consisted of a one-day, twelve-hour experience, which included trauma patient simulations, content expert lectures, group discussion of video demonstrations, and skill development workstations. Baseline and acquired knowledge were assessed through the use of confidence surveys, cognitive questionnaires, and a validated evaluation tool of teamwork and leadership skills for trauma Results: Fifteen interns entered the boot camp with an overall confidence score of 3.2 (1-5 scale) in the management of trauma cases. At the culmination of the study, there was a significant increase in the overall confidence level of interns in role delegation, leadership, Crisis Resource Management (CRM) principles, and in the performance of primary and secondary surveys. No significant changes were seen in determining and effectively using the Glasgow Coma Scale, Orthopedic splinting/reduction skills, and effective use of closed-loop communication. CONCLUSION: An intensive one-day trauma boot camp demonstrated significant improvement in self-reported confidence of CRM concepts, role delegation, leadership, and performance of primary and secondary surveys. Despite the intensive curriculum, there was no significant improvement in overall teamwork and leadership performance during simulated cases. Our boot camp curriculum offers educators a unique framework to which they can apply to their own training program as a foundation for effective leadership and teamwork training for interns.
27199799	Disentangling Metaphor from Context: An ERP Study.	A large body of electrophysiological literature showed that metaphor comprehension elicits two different event-related brain potential responses, namely the so-called N400 and P600 components. Yet most of these studies test metaphor in isolation while in natural conversation metaphors do not come out of the blue but embedded in linguistic and extra-linguistic context. This study aimed at assessing the role of context in the metaphor comprehension process. We recorded EEG activity while participants were presented with metaphors and equivalent literal expressions in a minimal context (Experiment 1) and in a supportive context where the word expressing the ground between the metaphor's topic and vehicle was made explicit (Experiment 2). The N400 effect was visible only in minimal context, whereas the P600 was visible both in the absence and in the presence of contextual cues. These findings suggest that the N400 observed for metaphor is related to contextual aspects, possibly indexing contextual expectations on upcoming words that guide lexical access and retrieval, while the P600 seems to reflect truly pragmatic interpretative processes needed to make sense of a metaphor and derive the speaker's meaning, also in the presence of contextual cues. In sum, previous information in the linguistic context biases toward a metaphorical interpretation but does not suppress interpretative pragmatic mechanisms to establish the intended meaning.
27741314	Respiratory Illness and Allergy Related to Work and Home Environment among Commercial Pilots.	The aim was to study associations between work and home environment and prevalence and incidence of respiratory health and a history of atopy in a 3-y cohort of commercial pilots. A questionnaire was mailed in 1997 to all pilots in a Scandinavian airline company (N = 622); 577 (93%) participated. The same questionnaire was sent to the participants 3 years later, 436 participated (76%). There were questions on asthma, respiratory symptoms and infections, allergies, the cabin environment, psychosocial environment and the home environment. Associations were analyzed by multiple logistic regression, calculating odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (95%CI). The incidence of doctors' diagnosed asthma and atopy were 2.4 and 16.6 per 1000 person years, respectively. Pilots changing type of flight during follow-up got more airway infections (OR = 11.27; 95% CI 2.39-53.14). Those reporting decreased work control (OR = 1.85; 95% CI 1.03-3.31 for 1 unit change) and those with environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) at home (OR = 3.73; 95% CI 1.09-12.83) had a higher incidence of atopy during follow up. Dampness or mould at home was associated with a higher prevalence of asthma symptoms (OR = 3.55; 95% CI 1.43-8.82) and airway infections (OR = 3.12 95% CI 1.27-7.68). Window pane condensation in winter at home, reported at baseline, was associated with increased incidence of asthma symptoms (OR = 4.14; 95% CI 1.32-12.97) and pilots living in newer buildings at baseline had a higher incidence of airway infections (OR = 5.23; 95% CI 1.43-19.10). In conclusion, lack of work control and ETS at home can be a risk factors for development of allergic symptoms in pilots. Window pane condensation at home can be a risk factor for incidence of asthma symptoms. Dampness and mould at home can be a risk factor for prevalence of asthma symptoms and airway infections and living in newer buildings can be a risk factor for incidence of airway infections.
27785054	Prognostic value of PD-L1 and PD-1 expression in pulmonary neuroendocrine tumors.	PURPOSE: Programmed death 1 (PD-1) receptor and its ligand, programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1), play critical roles in the immune invasion of various tumors. This study aimed to explore the clinical significance of PD-L1/PD-1 expression in the progression of pulmonary neuroendocrine tumors (PNETs). METHODS: The expression of PD-L1 and PD-1 in 80 patients diagnosed with PNETs were investigated. Immunohistochemical analysis was performed on 80 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue specimens from PNETs and 20 corresponding cancer-adjacent tissue specimens. RESULTS: Tissues from PNETs had higher levels of PD-L1 (58.8%) and PD-1 (51.3%) compared to the cancer-adjacent tissues (25% and 20%, respectively). Meanwhile, PD-L1 expression was associated with PD-1 expression (P=0.007). PD-L1 expression was significantly associated with histological type (P=0.014) and tumor stage (P=0.014). Univariate analyses showed that the overall survival time of PNETs patients was significantly associated with PD-L1 expression in cancer cells (P=0.003), PD-1 expression in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (P=0.001), tumor node metastasis stage (P<0.05), and distant metastasis (P<0.001). Additionally, multivariate analysis revealed that PD-L1 expression, PD1 expression, and distant metastasis of PNETs were independently associated with survival time. Moreover, Kaplan-Meier survival curves analysis revealed that patients with negative PD-L1 and PD-1 expression had better prognoses. CONCLUSION: Data suggested that PD-L1 and PD-1 can be useful prognostic biomarkers for survival and can pave the way toward new immunotherapy regimens against PNETs through targeting the PD-L1/PD-1 pathway.
27358502	First example of stepwise, zwitterionic mechanism for bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene (norbornene) formation process catalyzed by the 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium cations.	ABSTRACT: B3LYP/6-31++G(d) calculations indicated that the reaction of (2E)-3-phenyl-2-nitroprop-2-enenitrile with cyclopentadiene catalyzed by cations of 1,3-dialkylimidazolium ionic liquid shall not take place according to the classical scheme of one-step [2+4] Diels-Alder cycloaddition. Along the path finally leading to bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene (norbornene) with a nitro group in endo orientation, the process of bicarbocyclic skeleton formation shall take place according to the domino mechanism, via [2+4] heterocycloadduct. On the other hand, along the path leading finally to bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene with a nitro group in exo orientation, acyclic adduct with a zwitterionic nature is formed in the first reaction, which undergoes cyclisation next in the second step of the reaction. GRAPHICAL ABSTRACT:
27795835	Effect of dietary energy levels and phase feeding by protein levels on growth performance, blood profiles and carcass characteristics in growing-finishing pigs.	BACKGROUND: Providing of insufficient nutrients limits the potential growth of pig, while feeding of excessive nutrients increases the economic loss and causes environment pollution. For these reasons, phase feeding had been introduced in swine farm for improving animal production. This experiment was conducted to evaluate the effects of dietary energy levels and phase feeding by protein levels on growth performance, blood profiles and carcass characteristics in growing-finishing pigs. METHODS: A total of 128 growing pigs ([Yorkshire x Landrace] x Duroc), averaging 26.62 +/- 3.07 kg body weight, were assigned in a 2 x 4 factorial arrangement with 4 pigs per pen. The first factor was two dietary energy level (3,265 kcal of ME/kg or 3,365 kcal of ME/kg), and the second factor was four different levels of dietary protein by phase feeding (1growing(G)-2finishing(F) phases, 2G-2F phases, 2G-3F phases and 2G-3F phases with low CP requirement). RESULTS: In feeding trial, there was no significant difference in growth performance. The BUN concentration was decreased as dietary protein level decreased in 6 week and blood creatinine was increased in 13 week when pigs were fed diets with different dietary energy level. The digestibility of crude fat was improved as dietary energy levels increased and excretion of urinary nitrogen was reduced when low protein diet was provided. Chemical compositions of longissimus muscle were not affected by dietary treatments. In backfat thickness (P2) at 13 week, pigs fed high energy diet had thicker backfat thickness (P = 0.06) and pigs fed low protein diet showed the trend of backfat thinness reduction (P = 0.09). In addition, water holding capacity was decreased (P = 0.01) and cooking loss was increased (P = 0.07) as dietary protein level reduced. When pigs were fed high energy diet with low subdivision of phase feeding, days to 120 kg market weight was reached earlier compared to other treatments. CONCLUSION: Feeding the low energy diet and subdivision of growing-finishing phase by dietary protein levels had no significant effect on growth performance and carcass characteristics. Also, phase feeding with low energy and low protein diet had no negative effects on growth performance, carcass characteristics but economical profits was improved.
26914126	Long-term clinical outcomes in critical limb ischemia--A retrospective study of 181 patients.	OBJECTIVE: Critical limb ischemia (CLI) is the most severe manifestation of the peripheral arterial disease. To date, several prognostic factors have been identified but the data of long-term follow-up in real life setting are scarce. The aim of our study is to describe a large group of CLI patients and identify possible prognostic factors, in a long-term follow-up. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Case-control, retrospective study. 181 consecutive CLI patients with a minimum follow-up of 5 years were included in the study. RESULTS: Overall mortality was 15%, 24%, and 43% at 1, 2, and 5 years, respectively. Among known risk factors, only arterial hypertension was significantly correlated with survival rate; no differences were found between diabetics and non-diabetics. Patients treated with intravenous iloprost (46%), compared to untreated patients, showed a better (p < 0.0001) long-term outcome in terms of major amputation (6% vs. 21%), subsequent vascular surgery (4% vs. 32%) and survival rates (69% vs. 47%), at 5-year follow-up. Major amputations were significantly correlated with lower median forefoot transcutaneous values of O2 (0/3 mmHg, p < 0.001) and higher median values of CO2 (83/53 mmHg, p < 0.0001) in supine/dependent position, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our results confirm the poor prognosis of CLI patients in a very long-term follow-up and the severe metabolic damage caused by ischemia. A favourable role of iloprost was observed, in agreement with previous evidence in the literature.
27551314	Differences in genome-wide gene expression response in peripheral blood mononuclear cells between young and old men upon caloric restriction.	BACKGROUND: Caloric restriction (CR) is considered to increase lifespan and to prevent various age-related diseases in different nonhuman organisms. Only a limited number of CR studies have been performed on humans, and results put CR as a beneficial tool to decrease risk factors in several age-related diseases. The question remains at what age CR should be implemented to be most effective with respect to healthy aging. The aim of our study was to elucidate the role of age in the transcriptional response to a completely controlled 30 % CR diet on immune cells, as immune response is affected during aging. Ten healthy young men, aged 20-28, and nine healthy old men, aged 64-85, were subjected to a 2-week weight maintenance diet, followed by 3 weeks of 30 % CR. Before and after 30 % CR, the whole genome gene expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) was assessed. RESULTS: Expression of 554 genes showed a different response between young and old men upon CR. Gene set enrichment analysis revealed a downregulation of gene sets involved in the immune response in young but not in old men. At baseline, immune response-related genes were higher expressed in old compared to young men. Upstream regulator analyses revealed that most potential regulators were controlling the immune response. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the gene expression data, we theorise that a short period of CR is not effective in old men regarding immune-related pathways while it is effective in young men. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT00561145.
26927354	Identification of the KCNJ2 Mutation in a Korean Family with Andersen-Tawil Syndrome and Developmental Delay.	Andersen-Tawil syndrome is a rare autosomal dominant disease characterized by the clinical triad of periodic paralysis, long QT with ventricular arrhythmias, and dysmorphic facial or skeletal features. However, the phenotypic heterogeneity and poor disease awareness of this syndrome can hinder an accurate and timely diagnosis. In this study, we describe a Korean family with Andersen-Tawil syndrome with a G215D mutation of the KCNJ2 gene revealed by diagnostic exome sequencing. Two sisters had severe growth restriction, characteristic facial anomalies, and developmental delay. The father carried the same mutation with similar characteristic facial features and short stature. This family lacked periodic paralysis. This report highlights the importance of an exome study for unusual clinical manifestations, such as preand postnatal growth restriction, developmental delay, and the lack of a critical diagnostic clue, such as periodic paralysis.
27403435	Molecular Diagnosis and Identification of Leishmania Species in Jordan from Saved Dry Samples.	Diagnosis of the endemic cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) in Jordan relies on patient clinical presentation and microscopic identification. Studies toward improved identification of the causative Leishmania species, especially in regions where multiple species exist, and the introduction of these techniques into medical diagnosis is paramount. This study looked at the current epidemiology of CL in Jordan. Clinically diagnosed 41 patients with CL were tested for the presence of Leishmania parasite using both Giemsa staining from skin scraps on glass slides and ITS1-PCR from samples blotted onto storage cards (NucleoCards(R)). Microscopically, 28 out of the 41 (68.3%) collected samples were positive for amastigotes, whereas the molecular ITS1-PCR amplification successfully identified 30 of the 41 samples (73.2%). Furthermore, PCR-RFLP analysis allowed species identification which is impossible microscopically. Of the 30 PCR positive samples, 28 were Leishmania major positive and the other two samples were Leishmania tropica. This indicates that L. major is the most prevalent species in Jordan and the two L. tropica cases originated from Syria indicating possible future L. tropica outbreaks. Diagnosis of CL based on clinical presentation only may falsely increase its prevalence. Although PCR is more sensitive, it is still not available in our medical laboratories in Jordan.
27195013	A Novel Hydrodynamic Injection Mouse Model of HBV Genotype C for the Study of HBV Biology and the Anti-Viral Activity of Lamivudine.	BACKGROUND: Absence of an immunocompetent mouse model of persistent hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection has hindered the research of HBV infection and the development of antiviral medications. OBJECTIVES: In the present study, we aimed to develop a novel HBV genotype C mouse model by hydrodynamic injection (HI) and then used it to evaluate the antiviral activity of lamivudine. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A quantity of 15 mug of HBV plasmid [pcDNA3.1 (+)-HBV1.3C], adeno-associated virus-HBV1.3C (pAAV-HBV1.3C) or pAAV-HBV1.2A) were injected into male C57BL/6 mice, by HI, accounting for a total of 13 mice per group. Then, lamivudine was administered to mice with sustained HBV viremia, for 4 weeks. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunohistochemistry methods were used to detect HBsAg, HBeAg, HBsAb, HBcAg and HBV DNA, in serum or liver of the mice, at indicated time points. RESULTS: In 60% of the mice injected with pcDNA3.1 (+)-HBV1.3C, HBsAg, HBeAg, HBcAg and HBV DNA persisted for > 20 weeks in liver, post-injection, with no HBsAb appearance. Meanwhile, no significant inflammation was observed in these mice. Compared with pAAV-HBV1.2A and pAAV-HBV1.3C, pcDNA3.1 (+)-HBV1.3C administration led to higher and longer HBV viremia. Furthermore, serum HBV DNA was significantly reduced by lamivudine, after 4 weeks administration, and returned to the original level, after ceasing administration for 1 week, in the mice. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, our observations indicated that pcDNA3.1 (+)-HBV1.3C was superior to AAV/HBV plasmid for establishment of persistent HBV infection by HI, in vivo, and this mouse model could be useful for studies of hepatitis virology and for the development of innovatory treatments for HBV infections.
27081462	Mucosal acidification increases hydrogen sulfide release through up-regulating gene and protein expressions of cystathionine gamma-lyase in the rat gastric mucosa.	OBJECTIVES: This study was performed to investigate the effects of mucosal acidification on mRNA expression and protein synthesis of cystathionine gamma lyase (CSE), cystathionine beta synthase (CBS), and mucosal release of H2S in gastric mucosa in rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-two rats were randomly assigned into 4 groups (8 in each), including: the control group, HCl (10 mM) treated group, HCl (100 mM) treated group, and one group to study the effect of Nomega-Nitro-L-arginine methyl ester hydrochloride (L-NAME). Anesthetized rats underwent tracheostomy and midline laparotomy. Ninety min after the instillation of neutral or acidic solutions, animals were sacrificed and the gastric mucosa was collected to measure the H2S concentration by ELISA method and to quantify mRNA expression of CSE and CBS by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). Protein synthesis was also detected by Western blot method. RESULTS: Mucosal acidification with 10 and 100 HCl, significantly increased mucosal levels of H2S (P<0.01 and P<0.001) and mRNA (P<0.01 and P<0.001) and protein expressions of CSE (P<0.01 and P<0.001). L-NAME treatment reversed H2S release to control level. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicated that mucosal acidification with HCl increased mucosal release of H2S through upregulation of CSE gene and its protein expression. This effect is mainly mediated through the involvement of nitric oxide.
27437043	From Information Management to Information Visualization: Development of Radiology Dashboards.	OBJECTIVE: The development and implementation of a dashboard of medical imaging department (MID) performance indicators. METHOD: Several articles discussing performance measures of imaging departments were searched for this study. All the related measures were extracted. Then, a panel of imaging experts were asked to rate these measures with an open ended question to seek further potential indicators. A second round was performed to confirm the performance rating. The indicators and their ratings were then reviewed by an executive panel. Based on the final panel's rating, a list of indicators to be used was developed. A team of information technology consultants were asked to determine a set of user interface requirements for the building of the dashboard. In the first round, based on the panel's rating, a list of main features or requirements to be used was determined. Next, Qlikview was utilized to implement the dashboard to visualize a set of selected KPI metrics. Finally, an evaluation of the dashboard was performed. RESULTS: 92 MID indicators were identified. On top of this, 53 main user interface requirements to build of the prototype of dashboard were determined. Then, the project team successfully implemented a prototype of radiology management dashboards into study site. The visual display that was designed was rated highly by users. CONCLUSION: To develop a dashboard, management of information is essential. It is recommended that a quality map be designed for the MID. It can be used to specify the sequence of activities, their related indicators and required data for calculating these indicators. To achieve both an effective dashboard and a comprehensive view of operations, it is necessary to design a data warehouse for gathering data from a variety of systems. Utilizing interoperability standards for exchanging data among different systems can be also effective in this regard.
27004036	Development of a reservoir type prolonged release system with felodipine via simplex methodology.	BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Felodipine is a dihydropyridine calcium antagonist that presents good characteristics to be formulated as prolonged release preparations. The aim of the study was the formulation and in vitro characterization of a reservoir type prolonged release system with felodipine, over a 12 hours period using the Simplex method. METHODS: The first step of the Simplex method was to study the influence of the granules coating method on the felodipine release. Furthermore the influence of the coating polymer type, the percent of the coating polymer and the percent of pore forming agent in the coating on the felodipine release were studied. Afterwards these two steps of the experimental design the percent of Surelease applied on the felodipine loaded granules and the percent of pore former in the polymeric coating formulation variables were studied. The in vitro dissolution of model drug was performed in phosphate buffer solution (pH 6.5) with 1% sodium lauryl sulfate. The released drug quantification was done using an HPLC method. The release kinetics of felodipine from the final granules was assessed using different mathematical models. RESULTS: A 12 hours release was achieved using granules with the size between 315-500 mum coated with 45% Surelease with different pore former ratios in the coating via the top-spray method. CONCLUSION: We have prepared prolonged release coated granules with felodipine using a fluid bed system based on the Simplex method. The API from the studied final formulations was released over a 12 hours period and the release kinetics of the model drug substance from the optimized preparations fitted best the Higuchi and Peppas kinetic models.
27443004	[Enhancing glutamate decarboxylase activity by site-directed mutagenesis: an insight from Ramachandran plot].	Glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) can catalyze the decarboxylation of glutamate into gamma-aminobutyrate (GABA) and is the only enzyme of GABA biosynthesis. Improving GAD activity and thermostability will be helpful for the highly efficient biosynthesis of GABA. According to the Ramachandran plot information of GAD 1407 three-dimensional structure from Lactobacillus brevis CGMCC No. 1306, we identified the unstable site K413 as the mutation target, constructed the mutant GAD by site-directed mutagenesis and measured the thermostability and activity of the wide type and mutant GAD. Mutant K413A led to a remarkably slower inactivation rate, and its half-life at 50 degrees C reached 105 min which was 2.1-fold higher than the wild type GAD1407. Moreover, mutant K413I exhibited 1.6-fold higher activity in comparison with the wide type GAD1407, although it had little improvement in thermostability of GAD. Ramachandran plot can be considered as a potential approach to increase GAD thermostability and activity.
26849058	Experimental Evaluation of a Braille-Reading-Inspired Finger Motion Adaptive Algorithm.	Braille reading is a complex process involving intricate finger-motion patterns and finger-rubbing actions across Braille letters for the stimulation of appropriate nerves. Although Braille reading is performed by smoothly moving the finger from left-to-right, research shows that even fluent reading requires right-to-left movements of the finger, known as "reversal". Reversals are crucial as they not only enhance stimulation of nerves for correctly reading the letters, but they also show one to re-read the letters that were missed in the first pass. Moreover, it is known that reversals can be performed as often as in every sentence and can start at any location in a sentence. Here, we report experimental results on the feasibility of an algorithm that can render a machine to automatically adapt to reversal gestures of one's finger. Through Braille-reading-analogous tasks, the algorithm is tested with thirty sighted subjects that volunteered in the study. We find that the finger motion adaptive algorithm (FMAA) is useful in achieving cooperation between human finger and the machine. In the presence of FMAA, subjects' performance metrics associated with the tasks have significantly improved as supported by statistical analysis. In light of these encouraging results, preliminary experiments are carried out with five blind subjects with the aim to put the algorithm to test. Results obtained from carefully designed experiments showed that subjects' Braille reading accuracy in the presence of FMAA was more favorable then when FMAA was turned off. Utilization of FMAA in future generation Braille reading devices thus holds strong promise.
27163909	A Rotational Pressure-Correction Scheme for Incompressible Two-Phase Flows with Open Boundaries.	Two-phase outflows refer to situations where the interface formed between two immiscible incompressible fluids passes through open portions of the domain boundary. We present several new forms of open boundary conditions for two-phase outflow simulations within the phase field framework, as well as a rotational pressure correction based algorithm for numerically treating these open boundary conditions. Our algorithm gives rise to linear algebraic systems for the velocity and the pressure that involve only constant and time-independent coefficient matrices after discretization, despite the variable density and variable viscosity of the two-phase mixture. By comparing simulation results with theory and the experimental data, we show that the method produces physically accurate results. We also present numerical experiments to demonstrate the long-term stability of the method in situations where large density contrast, large viscosity contrast, and backflows occur at the two-phase open boundaries.
27013814	Community Acquired Enterococcal Urinary Tract Infections and Antibiotic Resistance Profile in North India.	BACKGROUND: Urinary tract infections (UTIs) remain a major problem both in hospitalized and outdoor patients. Multidrug-resistant enterococci are emerging as a major nosocomial pathogen with increasing frequency. However, the incidence of community-acquired enterococcal infections and species prevalent in India is not thoroughly investigated. OBJECTIVES: This study aims to estimate the burden of community-acquired UTIs seen at a tertiary care hospital and to identify the Enterococcus species isolated from these patients. The study also aims to determine the antibiotic susceptibility pattern with reference to high-level aminoglycosides and vancomycin. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Semi-quantitative cultures from a total of 22,810 urine samples obtained from patients seen at various Outpatient Departments were analyzed. From them 115 nonduplicate isolates of enterococci were obtained as significant pure growth (>10(5) cfu/ml) and speciated. Antibiotic susceptibility was performed by Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method. Vancomycin resistance screening was performed by the vancomycin screen agar method recommended by Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute and confirmed by determination of minimum inhibitory concentration by agar dilution method. RESULTS: Of 115 enterococcal isolates, 61 were identified as Enterococcus faecalis, 42 as Enterococcus faecium, 3 each as Enterococcus dispar, and Enterococcus pseudoavium. High-level gentamicin resistance (HLGR) was higher in E. faecium (47.6%) than E. faecalis (32.7%) and HLSR also showed the same pattern with 47.6% and 27.9% resistance, respectively. Vancomycin resistant enterococci accounted for 11.3% of the isolates, and out of them 53.8% were E. faecium by agar dilution method. CONCLUSION: High rate of resistance to antibiotics of penicillin group and aminoglycosides was observed in our tertiary care hospital even in community acquired UTIs. Hence, there is an urgent need for more rational and restricted use of antimicrobials.
27190650	Repeated Exposure to Dissection Does Not Influence Students' Attitudes towards Human Body Donation for Anatomy Teaching.	The use of unclaimed bodies for anatomical dissection has been the main method of instruction at our institution. There is however a shortage of cadavers for dissection given the increase in the number of medical schools as well as in the number of students enrolling in these schools. This shortage could be mitigated by having voluntary human body donation programs. This study aimed at assessing the attitudes of medical students and surgical residents towards body donation for anatomy learning. We conducted an online survey involving 72 first-year medical students and 41 surgical residents at University of Nairobi who had completed one year of anatomy dissection. For the medical students, this was their first dissection experience while it was the second exposure for the surgery trainees. Most of the surgical trainees (70.7%) and medical students (68.1%) were opposed to self-body donation. This was mainly due to cultural (37%) and religious (20%) barriers. Surprisingly, of those not willing to donate themselves, 67.9% (82.8% surgical trainees, 59.2% medical students) would recommend the practice to other people. Exposure to repeated dissection does not change the perceptions towards body donation. It is noteworthy that culture and religion rank high as clear barriers amongst this "highly informed" group of potential donors.
26958089	Assessing the Key Attributes of Low Utilization of Mammography Screening and Breast-self Exam among African-American Women.	PURPOSE: African-American (AA) women living in four Black Belt Counties (BBC) of Alabama; consisting of Barbour, Macon, Green and Wilcox are known to have lower mammogram utilization and breast self-exam rates when compared to their white female counterparts. The influence of socioeconomic and demographic factors on these disparities has not been clearly defined so far. Our study was designed to determine whether these observed disparities can be predicted with the socioeconomic and other demographic attributes. METHODS: Health Disparity Questionnaires data (n = 516) for BBC of Alabama was analyzed using a logistic regression model to examine the association of breast cancer screening rates and breast self-exam with income, the level of education, family doctor, type of health insurance, obesity, and age. RESULTS: Income, education, family doctor, age and health insurance were independent predictors for the low utilization rate of mammography and breast self-exam (BSE). CONCLUSION: Improving socioeconomic conditions such as level of education and availability of health care are essential to increase the rates of breast cancer screening test and breast self-exam in the BBC of Alabama.
27688890	Biosynthesis and molecular actions of specialized 1,4-naphthoquinone natural products produced by horticultural plants.	The 1,4-naphthoquinones (1,4-NQs) are a diverse group of natural products found in every kingdom of life. Plants, including many horticultural species, collectively synthesize hundreds of specialized 1,4-NQs with ecological roles in plant-plant (allelopathy), plant-insect and plant-microbe interactions. Numerous horticultural plants producing 1,4-NQs have also served as sources of traditional medicines for hundreds of years. As a result, horticultural species have been at the forefront of many basic studies conducted to understand the metabolism and function of specialized plant 1,4-NQs. Several 1,4-NQ natural products derived from horticultural plants have also emerged as promising scaffolds for developing new drugs. In this review, the current understanding of the core metabolic pathways leading to plant 1,4-NQs is provided with additional emphasis on downstream natural products originating from horticultural species. An overview on the biochemical mechanisms of action, both from an ecological and pharmacological perspective, of 1,4-NQs derived from horticultural plants is also provided. In addition, future directions for improving basic knowledge about plant 1,4-NQ metabolism are discussed.
27010529	New norterpenoids and a sphingolipid from Carissa opaca.	Chemical investigations on the aerial parts of Carissa opaca resulted in the isolation and characterization of two new nor-triterpenoids (compounds 1 and 2) and a new sphingolipid (compound 3) together with six known compounds. The structures of all the isolates were established using spectral data. All the isolated compounds showed DPPH radical scavenging and enzyme inhibitory activities against enzymes acetylcholinesterase, butyrylcholinesterase, and lipoxygenase.
26901762	Risk Factors and Post-Resection Independent Predictive Score for the Recurrence of Hepatitis B-Related Hepatocellular Carcinoma.	BACKGROUND: Independent risk factors associated with hepatitis B (HBV)-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after resection remains unknown. An accurate risk score for HCC recurrence is lacking. METHODS: We prospectively followed up 200 patients who underwent liver resection for HBV-related HCC for at least 2 years. Demographic, biochemical, tumor, virological and anti-viral treatment factors were analyzed to identify independent risk factors associated with recurrence after resection and a risk score for HCC recurrence formulated. RESULTS: Two hundred patients (80% male) who underwent liver resection for HBV-related HCC were recruited. The median time of recurrence was 184 weeks (IQR 52-207 weeks) for the entire cohort and 100 patients (50%) developed HCC recurrence. Stepwise Cox regression analysis identified that one-month post resection HBV DNA >20,000 IU/mL (p = 0.019; relative risk (RR) 1.67; 95% confidence interval (C.I.): 1.09-2.57), the presence of lymphovascular permeation (p<0.001; RR 2.69; 95% C.I.: 1.75-4.12), microsatellite lesions (p<0.001; RR 2.86; 95% C.I.: 1.82-4.51), and AFP >100ng/mL before resection (p = 0.021; RR 1.63; 95% C.I.: 1.08-2.47) were independently associated with HCC recurrence. Antiviral treatment before resection (p = 0.024; RR 0.1; 95% C.I.: 0.01-0.74) was independently associated with reduced risk of HCC recurrence. A post-resection independent predictive score (PRIPS) was derived and validated with sensitivity of 75.3% and 60.6% and specificity of 55.7% and 79.2%, to predict the 1- and 3-year risks for the HCC recurrence respectively with the hazard ratio of 2.71 (95% C.I.: 2.12-3.48; p<0.001). The AUC for the 1- and 3-year prediction were 0.675 (95% C.I.: 0.6-0.78) and 0.746 (95% C.I.: 0.69-0.82) respectively. CONCLUSION: Several tumor, virological and biochemical factors were associated with a higher cumulative risk of HCC recurrence after resection. PRIPS was derived for more accurate risk assessment. Regardless of the HBV DNA level, antiviral treatment should be given to patients before resection to reduce the risk of recurrence.
28105053	Neuroendocrine Differentiation in Breast Cancer: Clinicopathological Significance of Bcl-2 Positive Solid Papillary Carcinoma.	Solid papillary carcinoma (SPC) is considered a rare malignant breast tumor. Maluf and Koerner first reported this disease entity as a special type of ductal carcinoma in situ with several characteristic histopathological features, including low-grade cellular atypia, intracellular or extracellular mucin deposition, and solid papillary growth pattern, as well as neuroendocrine differentiation. The present paper describes a case of SPC with bcl-2 expression, which is known as a marker for malignancy of neuroendocrine tumors. Interestingly, despite bcl-2 expression being a poor prognostic indicator of neuroendocrine tumors, the patient with this tumor has achieved long-term survival (approximately 6 years) at the time of writing this report. Because previous investigators reported that bcl-2 expression might play a role in the inhibition of the development of breast cancer, we suggest that bcl-2 expression might reflect a good prognosis in patients with SPC, rather than being a poor prognostic indicator, as it is in several types of neuroendocrine tumor. However, to confirm this hypothesis, further investigation is required.
26839539	Interventional Treatment of Abdominal Compartment Syndrome during Severe Acute Pancreatitis: Current Status and Historical Perspective.	Abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) in patients with severe acute pancreatitis (SAP) is a marker of severe disease. It occurs as combination of inflammation of retroperitoneum, visceral edema, ascites, acute peripancreatic fluid collections, paralytic ileus, and aggressive fluid resuscitation. The frequency of ACS in SAP may be rising due to more aggressive fluid resuscitation, a trend towards conservative treatment, and attempts to use a minimally invasive approach. There remains uncertainty about the most appropriate surgical technique for the treatment of ACS in SAP. Some unresolved questions remain including medical treatment, indications, timing, and interventional techniques. This review will focus on interventional treatment of this serious condition. First line therapy is conservative treatment aiming to decrease IAP and to restore organ dysfunction. If nonoperative measures are not effective, early abdominal decompression is mandatory. Midline laparostomy seems to be method of choice. Since it carries significant morbidity we need randomized studies to establish firm advantages over other described techniques. After ACS resolves efforts should be made to achieve early primary fascia closure. Additional data are necessary to resolve uncertainties regarding ideal timing and indication for operative treatment.
27192604	Shift of the Muscular Inhibition Latency during On-Line Acquisition of Anticipatory Postural Adjustments.	During action, Anticipatory Postural Adjustments (APAs) cancel the consequences of a movement on postural stabilization. Their muscular expression is characterized by early changes in the activity of the postural muscles, before the movement begins. To explore the mechanisms enabling the acquisition of APAs, a learning paradigm was designed in which the voluntary lifting of a load with one hand triggered the unloading of another load suspended below the contralateral forearm. The aim of this study was to investigate changes in the muscular expression that uncovers the progressive learning of new APAs. A trial-by-trial analysis of kinematic and electromyographic signals recorded on the right arm was conducted in twelve adults through six sessions of learning. Kinematic results reported an enhancement of the postural stabilization across learning. The main EMG pattern found during learning consisted of a flexor inhibition, where latency was shifted towards an earlier occurrence in parallel with the improvement of the postural performance. A linear regression analysis conducted between the inhibition latency and the maximal amplitude of elbow rotation showed that the earlier the inhibition onset, the better the postural stabilization. This study revealed that the progressive shift of the postural flexor inhibition latency could be considered as a reliable neurophysiological marker of the progressive learning of new APAs. Importantly, this marker could be used to track motor learning abnormalities in pathology. We relate our findings to the update of a forward predictive model of action, defined as a system that predicts beforehand the consequences of the action on posture.
27774068	The Apical Localization of Na+, K+-ATPase in Cultured Human Retinal Pigment Epithelial Cells Depends on Expression of the beta2 Subunit.	Na+, K+-ATPase, or the Na+ pump, is a key component in the maintenance of the epithelial phenotype. In most epithelia, the pump is located in the basolateral domain. Studies from our laboratory have shown that the beta1 subunit of Na+, K+-ATPase plays an important role in this mechanism because homotypic beta1-beta1 interactions between neighboring cells stabilize the pump in the lateral membrane. However, in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), the Na+ pump is located in the apical domain. The mechanism of polarization in this epithelium is unclear. We hypothesized that the apical polarization of the pump in RPE cells depends on the expression of its beta2 subunit. ARPE-19 cells cultured for up to 8 weeks on inserts did not polarize, and Na+, K+-ATPase was expressed in the basolateral membrane. In the presence of insulin, transferrin and selenic acid (ITS), ARPE-19 cells cultured for 4 weeks acquired an RPE phenotype, and the Na+ pump was visible in the apical domain. Under these conditions, Western blot analysis was employed to detect the beta2 isoform and immunofluorescence analysis revealed an apparent apical distribution of the beta2 subunit. qPCR results showed a time-dependent increase in the level of beta2 isoform mRNA, suggesting regulation at the transcriptional level. Moreover, silencing the expression of the beta2 isoform in ARPE-19 cells resulted in a decrease in the apical localization of the pump, as assessed by the mislocalization of the alpha2 subunit in that domain. Our results demonstrate that the apical polarization of Na+, K+-ATPase in RPE cells depends on the expression of the beta2 subunit.
26936761	Treatment Options for Visceral Leishmaniasis and HIV Coinfection.	Leishmania and HIV coinfection is a major health problem in more than 35 countries worldwide. The impaired immune function of visceral leishmaniasis/HIV-coinfected patients may: (i) favor the reactivation of latent Leishmania infection; (ii) induce a more severe presentation of visceral leishmaniasis; (iii) cause a poorer therapeutic response; and (iv) increase the risk of relapse after treatment. One of the major challenges in the management of visceral leishmaniasis/HIV coinfection is developing an effective drug therapy that not only resolves the first episode of visceral leishmaniasis but also prevents relapse. However, scarce evidence and data are available on the optimal therapy for visceral leishmaniasis/HIV coinfection. In our study we reviewed the efficacy of several drugs currently employed for visceral leishmaniasis in HIV patients and current knowledge of secondary prophylaxis. Additionally, we reviewed a set of ongoing clinical trials that are being performed to evaluate the efficacy of new therapeutic regimens for visceral leishmaniasis in patients with and without HIV. Finally, other therapeutic strategies based on immunotherapy, vaccination, or screening for latent leishmaniasis infection in HIV patients are reviewed. Apart from being potentially useful in clinical practice, the results obtained in our study highlight the need for further research on the management of visceral leishmaniasis/HIV coinfection.
27684573	Optimizing Trial Designs for Targeted Therapies.	An important objective in the development of targeted therapies is to identify the populations where the treatment under consideration has positive benefit risk balance. We consider pivotal clinical trials, where the efficacy of a treatment is tested in an overall population and/or in a pre-specified subpopulation. Based on a decision theoretic framework we derive optimized trial designs by maximizing utility functions. Features to be optimized include the sample size and the population in which the trial is performed (the full population or the targeted subgroup only) as well as the underlying multiple test procedure. The approach accounts for prior knowledge of the efficacy of the drug in the considered populations using a two dimensional prior distribution. The considered utility functions account for the costs of the clinical trial as well as the expected benefit when demonstrating efficacy in the different subpopulations. We model utility functions from a sponsor's as well as from a public health perspective, reflecting actual civil interests. Examples of optimized trial designs obtained by numerical optimization are presented for both perspectives.
26995203	Juxtarenal Mycotic Aneurysm as a Complication of Acute Exacerbation of Chronic Cholecystitis Treated by Resection and Replacement by a Fresh Allograft.	We present a case of a female patient with infectious (mycotic) juxtarenal abdominal aneurysm with atypical symptoms beginning as acute exacerbation of chronic cholecystitis. Apart from common antibiotic treatment, the patient successfully underwent resection of the diseased segment and replacement by a fresh allograft in order to reduce the risk of infection of the graft, but with the need of subsequent life-long immunosuppressive therapy. Perioperative monitoring of the spinal cord by near infrared spectroscopy was used to identify possible spinal ischemia. The choice of the fresh allograft was based on our experience supported by review of the literature.
27746707	Large-scale untargeted LC-MS metabolomics data correction using between-batch feature alignment and cluster-based within-batch signal intensity drift correction.	INTRODUCTION: Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) is a commonly used technique in untargeted metabolomics owing to broad coverage of metabolites, high sensitivity and simple sample preparation. However, data generated from multiple batches are affected by measurement errors inherent to alterations in signal intensity, drift in mass accuracy and retention times between samples both within and between batches. These measurement errors reduce repeatability and reproducibility and may thus decrease the power to detect biological responses and obscure interpretation. OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to develop procedures to address and correct for within- and between-batch variability in processing multiple-batch untargeted LC-MS metabolomics data to increase their quality. METHODS: Algorithms were developed for: (i) alignment and merging of features that are systematically misaligned between batches, through aggregating feature presence/missingness on batch level and combining similar features orthogonally present between batches; and (ii) within-batch drift correction using a cluster-based approach that allows multiple drift patterns within batch. Furthermore, a heuristic criterion was developed for the feature-wise choice of reference-based or population-based between-batch normalisation. RESULTS: In authentic data, between-batch alignment resulted in picking 15 % more features and deconvoluting 15 % of features previously erroneously aligned. Within-batch correction provided a decrease in median quality control feature coefficient of variation from 20.5 to 15.1 %. Algorithms are open source and available as an R package ('batchCorr'). CONCLUSIONS: The developed procedures provide unbiased measures of improved data quality, with implications for improved data analysis. Although developed for LC-MS based metabolomics, these methods are generic and can be applied to other data suffering from similar limitations.
26931926	24 GHz microwave mode converter optimized for superconducting ECR ion source SECRAL.	Over-sized round waveguide with a diameter about O33.0 mm excited in the TE01 mode has been widely adopted for microwave transmission and coupling to the ECR (Electron Cyclotron Resonance) plasma with the superconducting ECR ion sources operating at 24 or 28 GHz, such as SECRAL and VENUS. In order to study the impact of different microwave modes on ECRH (Electron Cyclotron Resonance Heating) efficiency and especially the production of highly charged ions, a set of compact and efficient TE01-HE11 mode conversion and coupling system applicable to 24 GHz SECRAL whose overall length is 330 mm has been designed, fabricated and tested. Good agreements between off-line tests and calculation results have been achieved, which indicates the TE01-HE11 converter meets the application design. The detailed results of the optimized coupling system will be presented in the paper.
27008025	It's DE-licious: A Recipe for Differential Expression Analyses of RNA-seq Experiments Using Quasi-Likelihood Methods in edgeR.	RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) is widely used to profile transcriptional activity in biological systems. Here we present an analysis pipeline for differential expression analysis of RNA-seq experiments using the Rsubread and edgeR software packages. The basic pipeline includes read alignment and counting, filtering and normalization, modelling of biological variability and hypothesis testing. For hypothesis testing, we describe particularly the quasi-likelihood features of edgeR. Some more advanced downstream analysis steps are also covered, including complex comparisons, gene ontology enrichment analyses and gene set testing. The code required to run each step is described, along with an outline of the underlying theory. The chapter includes a case study in which the pipeline is used to study the expression profiles of mammary gland cells in virgin, pregnant and lactating mice.
27766035	Dmp1 Null Mice Develop a Unique Osteoarthritis-like Phenotype.	Patients with hypophosphatemia rickets (including DMP1 mutations) develop severe osteoarthritis (OA), although the mechanism is largely unknown. In this study, we first identified the expression of DMP1 in hypertrophic chondrocytes using immunohistochemistry (IHC) and X-gal analysis of Dmp1-knockout-lacZ-knockin heterozygous mice. Next, we characterized the OA-like phenotype in Dmp1 null mice from 7-week-old to one-year-old using multiple techniques, including X-ray, micro-CT, H&E staining, Goldner staining, scanning electronic microscopy, IHC assays, etc. We found a classical OA-like phenotype in Dmp1 null mice such as articular cartilage degradation, osteophyte formation, and subchondral osteosclerosis. These Dmp1 null mice also developed unique pathological changes, including a biphasic change in their articular cartilage from the initial expansion of hypertrophic chondrocytes at the age of 1-month to a quick diminished articular cartilage layer at the age of 3-months. Further, these null mice displayed severe enlarged knees and poorly formed bone with an expanded osteoid area. To address whether DMP1 plays a direct role in the articular cartilage, we deleted Dmp1 specifically in hypertrophic chondrocytes by crossing the Dmp1-loxP mice with Col X Cre mice. Interestingly, these conditional knockout mice didn't display notable defects in either the articular cartilage or the growth plate. Because of the hypophosphatemia remained in the entire life span of the Dmp1 null mice, we also investigated whether a high phosphate diet would improve the OA-like phenotype. A 8-week treatment of a high phosphate diet significantly rescued the OA-like defect in Dmp1 null mice, supporting the critical role of phosphate homeostasis in maintaining the healthy joint morphology and function. Taken together, this study demonstrates a unique OA-like phenotype in Dmp1 null mice, but a lack of the direct impact of DMP1 on chondrogenesis. Instead, the regulation of phosphate homeostasis by DMP1 via the axis of "FGF23-renal phosphorus reabsorption" is vital for maintaining a healthy joint.
27733812	Checklist of British and Irish Hymenoptera - Ichneumonidae.	BACKGROUND: The checklist of British and Irish Ichneumonidae is revised, based in large part on the collections of the Natural History Museum, London and the National Museums of Scotland, Edinburgh. Distribution records are provided at the country level. NEW INFORMATION: Of the 2,447 species regarded as valid and certainly identified, 214 are here recorded for the first time from the British Isles. Neorhacodinae is considered to be a separate subfamily rather than a synonym of Tersilochinae. Echthrini is treated as a junior synonym of the tribe Cryptini, not Hemigastrini. Echthrus Gravenhorst and Helcostizus Forster are classified in Cryptini rather than, respectively, Hemigastrini and Phygadeuontini.
27441367	Model-Free Machine Learning in Biomedicine: Feasibility Study in Type 1 Diabetes.	Although reinforcement learning (RL) is suitable for highly uncertain systems, the applicability of this class of algorithms to medical treatment may be limited by the patient variability which dictates individualised tuning for their usually multiple algorithmic parameters. This study explores the feasibility of RL in the framework of artificial pancreas development for type 1 diabetes (T1D). In this approach, an Actor-Critic (AC) learning algorithm is designed and developed for the optimisation of insulin infusion for personalised glucose regulation. AC optimises the daily basal insulin rate and insulin:carbohydrate ratio for each patient, on the basis of his/her measured glucose profile. Automatic, personalised tuning of AC is based on the estimation of information transfer (IT) from insulin to glucose signals. Insulin-to-glucose IT is linked to patient-specific characteristics related to total daily insulin needs and insulin sensitivity (SI). The AC algorithm is evaluated using an FDA-accepted T1D simulator on a large patient database under a complex meal protocol, meal uncertainty and diurnal SI variation. The results showed that 95.66% of time was spent in normoglycaemia in the presence of meal uncertainty and 93.02% when meal uncertainty and SI variation were simultaneously considered. The time spent in hypoglycaemia was 0.27% in both cases. The novel tuning method reduced the risk of severe hypoglycaemia, especially in patients with low SI.
26837405	Surgical treatment of peripheral ulcerative keratitis and necrotizing scleritis in granulomatosis with polyangiitis.	The efficacy of surgical management of refractory ophthalmic complications of granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), which is a sight threatening was reported. A 70-year-old man presented with a progressively worsening pain and redness in his right eye during the previous 6 months, and decreasing visual acuity that started one month earlier. He was misdiagnosed and treated as keratitis elsewhere, but the pain has not decreased. The diagnosis of necrotizing scleritis with peripheral ulcerative keratitis (PUK) in GPA was made in our department. Surgery was performed with necrotic tissue removal, combined with cryotherapy and a conjunctival flap covering surgery. The symptom was relieved after surgery, and the patient's ocular condition remained stable thereafter. This case first demonstrates limited ophthalmic GPA (such as, PUK and necrotizing scleritis) that was not sensitive or aggravated for traditional methods can be successfully treated by combined surgical interventions.
27011395	Methodological Issues in Cytokine Measurement in Schizophrenia.	There is mounting evidence that inflammation is a major factor in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Inflammatory status is commonly ascertained by measuring peripheral cytokine concentrations. An issue concerning research on inflammation and schizophrenia relates to assay methodology. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is the most widely used and the gold standard method used to measure cytokine concentrations. ELISA has a number of limitations. Both ELISA and multiplex are limited by not being able to distinguish between bioactive and inactive molecules and the matrix and heterophilic (auto-) antibody interference. Multiplex assays when combined with gene expression analysis and flow cytometry techniques such as fluorescence-activated cell sorting may be useful to detect abnormalities in specific immune pathways. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells cultures, to evaluate in vitro lipopolysaccharide-induced cytokine production, may be a better technology than measuring cytokines in the serum. The purpose of this paper is to shed light on major methodological issues that need to be addressed in order to advance the study of cytokines in schizophrenia. We make a few recommendations on how to address these issues.
26962295	A Quantitative Proteomic Analysis of Urine from Gamma-Irradiated Non-Human Primates.	The molecular effects of total body gamma-irradiation exposure are of critical importance as large populations of people could be exposed either by terrorists, nuclear blast, or medical therapy. In this study, we aimed to identify changes in the urine proteome using a non-human primate model system, Rhesus macaque, in order to characterize effects of acute radiation syndrome following whole body irradiation (Co-60) at 6.7 Gy and 7.4 Gy with a twelve day observation period. The urine proteome is potentially a valuable and non-invasive diagnostic for radiation exposure. Using high-resolution mass spectrometry, we identified 2346 proteins in the urine proteome. We show proteins involved in disease, cell adhesion, and metabolic pathway were significantly changed upon exposure to differing levels and durations of radiation exposure. Cell damage increased at a faster rate at 7.4 Gy compared with 6.7 Gy exposures. We report sets of proteins that are putative biomarkers of time- and dose-dependent radiation exposure. The proteomic study presented here is a comprehensive analysis of the urine proteome following radiation exposure.
26853287	The Preventive Effect of L-Lysine on Lysozyme Glycation in Type 2 Diabetes.	Lysozyme is a bactericidal enzyme whose structure and functions change in diabetes. Chemical chaperones are small molecules including polyamines (e.g. spermine), amino acids (e.g. L-lysine) and polyols (e.g. glycerol). They can improve protein conformation in several stressful conditions such as glycation. In this study, the authors aimed to observe the effect of L-lysine as a chemical chaperone on structure and function of glycated lysozyme. In this study, in vitro and in vivo effects of L-lysine on lysozyme glycation were investigated. Lysozyme was incubated with glucose and/or L-lysine, followed by an investigation of its structure by electrophoresis, fluorescence spectroscopy, and circular dichroism spectroscopy and also assessment of its bactericidal activity against M. lysodeikticus. In the clinical trial, patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) were randomly divided into two groups of 25 (test and control). All patients received metformin and glibenclamide for a three months period. The test group was supplemented with 3 g/day of L-lysine. The quantity and activity of lysozyme and other parameters were then measured. Among the test group, L-lysine was found to reduce the advanced glycation end products (AGEs) in the sera of patients with T2DM and in vitro condition. This chemical chaperone reversed the alteration in lysozyme structure and function due to glycation and resulted in increased lysozyme activity. Structure and function of glycated lysozyme are significantly improved by l-lysine; therefore it can be considered an effective therapeutic supplementation in T2DM, decreasing the risk of infection in these patients.
27143898	The correlation between stress and economic crisis: a systematic review.	In 2008 a deep economic crisis started in the US and rapidly spread around the world. The crisis severely affected the labor market and employees' well-being. Hence, the aim of this work is to implement a systematic review of the principal studies that analyze the impact of the economic crisis on the health of workers. We conducted our search on the PubMed database, and a total of 19 articles were selected for review. All studies showed that the economic crisis was an important stressor that had a negative impact on workers' mental health. Most of the studies documented that a rise in unemployment, increased workload, staff reduction, and wages reduction were linked to an increased rate of mood disorders, anxiety, depression, dysthymia, and suicide. Some studies showed that problems related to the crisis may have also affected the general health of workers by increasing the risk of such health problems as cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. Finally, some studies looked at the impact of the crisis on health care services. These studies demonstrated that the reduction in public expenditure on health care services, and the reduction of public hospital budgets due to the recession, led to organizational problems (eg, medical supply shortages).
27141777	[Case-control study on effect of anterolateral and posterolateral approaches on early postoperative hip abductor strength in total hip arthroplasty].	OBJECTIVE: To compare the difference of early postoperative hip abductor strength and function between improved Gibson anterolateral approach (group A) and conventional Gibson posterolateral approach (group B) in patients who had underwent total hip arthroplasty (THA). METHODS: Among 149 patients performing total hip arthroplasty,130 patients were followed up and were randomly divided into two groups (19 unqualified cases were excluded). Group A included 65 cases who underwent anterolateral approach, and the other group included 65 cases who underwent posterolateral approach. In the group A, male:female = 26:39,with an average age of (72.5 +/- 8.3) years old, BMI of (24.7 +/- 3.7) kg/m(2), and hip abductor strength of (1.08 +/- 0.49) N . m/kg. In the group B, male:female = 30:35, with an average age of (71.6 +/- 7.1) years old, BMI of (25.5 +/- 3.9) kg/m(2), and hip abductor strength of (1.05 +/- 0.51) N . m/kg. In the age-related control group, male:female = 33:32, with an average age of (73.1 +/- 7.5) years old, BMI of (24.2 +/- 3.8) kg/m(2), and hip abductor strength of (1.17 +/- 0.53) N . m/kg. The age, BMI, hip abductor strength, anatomy of surgical approach, hip abduction angles and Harris score in all patients were evaluated at the day before surgery and at 1, 2, 3, 6, and 12 months after surgery. All preoperative clinical data (age, BMI and abductor strength of the uninjured side limb ) of these cases had no significant differences. RESULTS: At 1, 2, 3, 6, and 12 months after surgery, the hip abductor strength in group A were (0.53 +/- 0.13), (0.66 +/- 0.21), (0.85 +/- 0.15), (0.95 +/- 0.19), (1.03 +/- 0.13) N . m/kg respectively, while in group B were (0.46 +/- 0.14), (0.57 +/- 0.18), (0.78 +/- 0.12), (0.85 +/- 0.18), (0.98 +/- 0.14) N . m/ kg respectively.The differences between the two groups at the 6th months after operation were significant; the hip abduction angles in group A were (25.35 +/- 4.31) degrees , (36.53 +/- 5.13) degrees , (48.07 +/- 1.62) degrees , (61.53 +/- 1.77) degrees , (68.62 +/- 3.16) degrees ,while in group B were (23.47 +/- 2.41) degrees , (33.42 +/- 4.23) degrees , (46.64 +/- 2.51) degrees , (60.96 +/- 1.75) degrees , (67.47 +/- 4.36) degrees . The differences between the two groups at the 3rd month after operation were significant. Harris score in the group A were 72.23 +/- 2.57, 79.36 +/- 3.91, 84.75 +/- 3.17, 88.63 +/- 2.16, 95.21 +/- 1.37 repectively ; while in the group B were 71.58 +/- 3.62, 78.96 +/- 2.21, 83.97 +/- 3.57, 87.92 +/- 2.94, 94.83 +/- 1.62 respectively. There were no significant differences between them. CONCLUSION: Owing to less muscles interrupted, the THA with improved Gibson anterolateral approach offers a better improvement in earlier hip abductor strength and abduction angle compared with the conventional surgery.
27047721	Survival in patients with non-metastatic breast cancer treated with adjuvant trastuzumab in clinical practice.	PURPOSE: The NSABP Trial B-31 and NCCTG Trial N9831 (B-31/N9831 trials, Romond et al. in N Engl J Med 353:1673-84, 2005. doi:10.1056/NEJMoa052122; Perez et al. in J Clin Oncol 32:3744-52, 2014. doi:10.1200/JCO.2014.55.5730) established the efficacy of adjuvant trastuzumab for patients with HER2-positive early stage breast cancer. We aimed to estimate the overall survival (OS) and relapse-free survival (RFS) of HER2-positive non-metastatic breast cancer patients treated with adjuvant trastuzumab in a clinical practice setting in the United States. METHODS: Adult women initiating adjuvant trastuzumab within 1 year of breast cancer surgery were identified in the health claims database of the US Department of Defense (01/2003-12/2012). OS and RFS unadjusted rates at 4 and 6 years after the first trastuzumab treatment following the breast cancer diagnosis were estimated from Kaplan-Meier analyses. RESULTS: The study sample included 3188 women followed for a median of 3.3 years after trastuzumab initiation and treated continuously with trastuzumab for a median of 12 months. The OS rates (95 % confidence intervals) at 4 and 6 years were 90.0 % (88.6-91.2) and 87.1 (85.3-88.6), respectively. The corresponding RFS rates were 75.8 % (74.0-77.5) and 72.7 (70.7-74.7), respectively. The OS and RFS rates at 6 years reported in the B-31/N9831 trials were 89.8 and 81.4 %, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: OS rates estimated in this study were in range with those estimated in the B-31/N9831 trials, while RFS rates were lower. However, patients in the B-31/N9831 trials were younger and possibly had fewer comorbidities than patients in the current study; these differences were not adjusted for in the crude OS and RFS analyses.
27274361	Complete genome sequence of Leuconostoc gelidum subsp. gasicomitatum KG16-1, isolated from vacuum-packaged vegetable sausages.	Leuconostoc gelidum subsp. gasicomitatum is a predominant lactic acid bacterium (LAB) in spoilage microbial communities of different kinds of modified-atmosphere packaged (MAP) food products. So far, only one genome sequence of a poultry-originating type strain of this bacterium (LMG 18811(T)) has been available. In the current study, we present the completely sequenced and functionally annotated genome of strain KG16-1 isolated from a vegetable-based product. In addition, six other vegetable-associated strains were sequenced to study possible "niche" specificity suggested by recent multilocus sequence typing. The genome of strain KG16-1 consisted of one circular chromosome and three plasmids, which together contained 2,035 CDSs. The chromosome carried at least three prophage regions and one of the plasmids encoded a galactan degradation cluster, which might provide a survival advantage in plant-related environments. The genome comparison with LMG 18811(T) and six other vegetable strains suggests no major differences between the meat- and vegetable-associated strains that would explain their "niche" specificity. Finally, the comparison with the genomes of other leuconostocs highlights the distribution of functionally interesting genes across the L. gelidum strains and the genus Leuconostoc.
27829797	Oenanthe millefolia (Umbelliferae), a new species record for the Turkish and Greek Flora.	Oenanthe millefolia (Apiaceae), which is presented as a new recorded species for the Turkish flora, was discovered for the first time in Kirklareli province of Turkey. It is also reported as a new species for the Greek flora based on an unidentified specimen which was collected from the Thrace region of Greece. In this study, an expanded morphological description, the geographical distribution, the habitat properties and the ecological features of the species are exhibited with illustrative figures. Moreover, the micromorphological and anatomical characters of the fruits and the anatomical properties of the stem, petiole, leaves and the palynological features of Oenanthe millefolia are determined and described for the first time.
27829802	Revision of the Lima clade (Miconia sect. Lima, Miconieae, Melastomataceae) of the Greater Antilles.	Miconia sect. Lima is an entirely Greater Antillean clade that consists of 19 known species of shrubs and small trees, which were previously recognized under the polyphyletic genera Leandra and Ossaea. The highest species richness in the clade is represented on Cuba (10 species), followed by Hispaniola (8 species) and then Jamaica (1 species). Here we present a taxonomic revision of the clade based on the study of species in the field, herbarium specimens, as well as a DNA-based phylogeny reconstruction. The Lima clade most likely originated on Cuba and then spread to Jamaica once and Hispaniola multiple times. Species of this clade can be recognized by the well developed bulla-based hairs of the adaxial leaf surface, as well as the clavate-dendritic hairs produced along the primary, secondary and tertiary veins of the adaxial leaf surface, mostly towards the leaf base, terminal inflorescences, acute petal apices, slightly bulla-based hairs produced subapically along the petal abaxial surface, and anthers with a dorso-basal appendage and a single, dorsally oriented pore. Descriptions, synonymies, along with distribution maps and illustrations/figures, are given for each species. Miconia pagnolensissp. nov. is newly described in this revision.
27895665	Sugammadex-Enhanced Neuronal Apoptosis following Neonatal Sevoflurane Exposure in Mice.	In rodents, neonatal sevoflurane exposure induces neonatal apoptosis in the brain and results in learning deficits. Sugammadex is a new selective neuromuscular blockade (NMB) binding agent that anesthesiologists can use to achieve immediate reversal of an NMB with few side effects. Given its molecular weight of 2178, sugammadex is thought to be unable to pass through the blood brain barrier (BBB). Volatile anesthetics can influence BBB opening and integrity. Therefore, we investigated whether the intraperitoneal administration of sugammadex could exacerbate neuronal damage following neonatal 2% sevoflurane exposure via changes in BBB integrity. Cleaved caspase-3 immunoblotting was used to detect apoptosis, and the ultrastructure of the BBB was examined by transmission electron microscopy. Exposure to 2% sevoflurane for 6 h resulted in BBB ultrastructural abnormalities in the hippocampus of neonatal mice. Sugammadex alone without sevoflurane did not induce apoptosis. The coadministration of sugammadex with sevoflurane to neonatal mice caused a significant increase (150%) in neuroapoptosis in the brain compared with 2% sevoflurane. In neonatal anesthesia, sugammadex could influence neurotoxicity together with sevoflurane. Exposure to 2% sevoflurane for 6 h resulted in BBB ultrastructural abnormalities in the hippocampus of neonatal mice.
28461927	Intercarpal fusions: indications, treatment options and techniques.	Partial wrist fusion is a useful technique for the treatment of such specific carpal disorders as arthritis, Kienbock's disease, midcarpal instability, scaphoid nonunion, etc.Many techniques have been described by removing arthritic joint surfaces and transfering load, using, for bone fixation, K-wires, screws, staples, and more recently dedicated plates.The goal of this procedure is to maximise wrist motion and strength while minimizing or eliminating pain.The purpose of this article is to discuss the most commonly used combination of intercarpal arthrodeses, to clarify the indications for each fusion, to describe the appropriate surgical technique for each fusion, and to provide an overview of results and current concepts.

27041906	Successful treatment of Class II malocclusion with bidental protrusion using standard edgewise prescription.	This case report deals with the successful orthodontic treatment of a 14-year-old female patient having Class II malocclusion with bidental protrusion using standard edgewise prescription. She reported with forwardly placed upper front teeth and difficulty in closing lips. She had prognathic maxilla, retrognathic mandible, and full cusp Class II molar and canine relation bilaterally with overjet of 7 mm. She was in cervical vertebrae maturation indicator Stage IV. The case was treated by fixed extraction mechanotherapy. Interarch Class II mechanics was used to retract the upper incisor and to mesialize the lower molars. Simultaneously, Class I mechanics was used to upright lower incisors. Tip back bend, curve of Spee, and extra palatal root torque were incorporated in upper archwire to maintain molars in upright position and prevent extrusion and deepening of bite, respectively. There was satisfactory improvement in facial profile at the end of 24 months. After a follow-up of 6 months, occlusion was stable.
27627650	Quantitative Determination of Ceramide Molecular Species in Dendritic Cells.	BACKGROUND/AIMS: The activation of acid sphingomyelinase by cellular stress or receptors or the de novo synthesis lead to the formation of ceramide (N-acylsphingosine), which in turn modifies the biophysical properties of cellular membrane and greatly amplifies the intensity of the initial signal. Ceramide, which acts by re-organizing a given signalosome rather than being a second messenger, has many functions in infection biology, cancer, cardiovascular syndromes, and immune regulation. Experimental studies on the infection of human cells with different bacterial agents demonstrated the activation of the acid sphingomyelinase/ceramide system. Moreover, the release of ceramide was found to be a requisite for the uptake of the pathogen. Considering the particular importance of the cellular role of ceramide, it was necessary to develop sensitive and accurate methods for its quantification. METHODS: Here, we describe a method quantifying ceramide in dendritic cells and defining the different fatty acids (FA) bound to sphingosine. The main steps of the method include extraction of total lipids, separation of the ceramide by thin-layer chromatography, derivatization of ceramide-fatty acids (Cer-FA), and quantitation of these acids in their methyl form by gas chromatography on polar capillary columns. The identification of FA was achieved by means of known standards and confirmed by mass spectrometry. RESULTS: FA ranging between C10 and C24 could be detected and quantified. The concentration of the sum of Cer-FA amounted to 14.88 +/- 8.98 nmol/106 cells (n=10). Oleic acid, which accounted for approximately half of Cer-FA (7.73 +/- 6.52 nmol/106 cells) was the predominant fatty acid followed by palmitic acid (3.47 +/- 1.54 nmol/106 cells). CONCLUSION: This highly sensitive method allows the quantification of different molecular species of ceramides.
26908818	Rising Oseltamivir Use Among Hospitalized Children in a Postpandemic Era.	BACKGROUND: Oseltamivir prescribing among pediatric inpatients with influenza varied from 2% to 48% prior to the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. After the pandemic, prescribing guidelines were expanded, and studies reported benefits for hospitalized children. Post-pandemic prescribing practices among children are unclear. OBJECTIVES: To report the rate of oseltamivir use and to identify factors associated with its use among inpatients with confirmed influenza infection from 2010 to 2014 at a tertiary children's hospital. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of inpatients with polymerase chain reaction-confirmed influenza from December 2010 to April 2014 at Children's Hospital Colorado. The primary outcome was oseltamivir use. Variables regarding demographics, underlying medical conditions, diagnoses, and hospital course were also explored. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed. RESULTS: Among 395 inpatients with influenza, 323 (82%) received oseltamivir. In univariate analyses, oseltamivir use was associated with admission within 48 hours of symptom onset (89% vs 77%), ICU admission (88% vs 79%), longer length of stay (90% for >6 days vs 77% for </=2 days), and influenza A H1N1 infection (P < .05 for all). In multivariate logistic regression analysis, longer length of stay, illness during the 2013-2014 season, and admission within 48 hours of symptom onset were associated with higher odds of oseltamivir use. CONCLUSIONS: Oseltamivir use for children with influenza in the postpandemic era is increasing at our institution, aligning with official recommendations and reported benefits. We report highest use for patients in the 2013-2014 season, those who present early in their illness, and those requiring a prolonged hospital stay.
26907439	Experimental characterization of a 400 Gbit/s orbital angular momentum multiplexed free-space optical link over 120 m.	We experimentally demonstrate and characterize the performance of a 400-Gbit/s orbital angular momentum (OAM) multiplexed free-space optical link over 120 m on the roof of a building. Four OAM beams, each carrying a 100-Gbit/s quadrature-phase-shift-keyed channel are multiplexed and transmitted. We investigate the influence of channel impairments on the received power, intermodal crosstalk among channels, and system power penalties. Without laser tracking and compensation systems, the measured received power and crosstalk among OAM channels fluctuate by 4.5 dB and 5 dB, respectively, over 180 s. For a beam displacement of 2 mm that corresponds to a pointing error less than 16.7 murad, the link bit error rates are below the forward error correction threshold of 3.8x10(-3) for all channels. Both experimental and simulation results show that power penalties increase rapidly when the displacement increases.
26929462	Glenohumeral interposition of rotator cuff stumps: a rare complication of traumatic rotator cuff tear.	The present report describes a case where typical findings of traumatic glenohumeral interposition of rotator cuff stumps were surgically confirmed. This condition is a rare complication of shoulder trauma. Generally, it occurs in high-energy trauma, frequently in association with glenohumeral joint dislocation. Radiography demonstrated increased joint space, internal rotation of the humerus and coracoid process fracture. In addition to the mentioned findings, magnetic resonance imaging showed massive rotator cuff tear with interposition of the supraspinatus, infraspinatus and subscapularis stumps within the glenohumeral joint. Surgical treatment was performed confirming the injury and the rotator cuff stumps interposition. It is important that radiologists and orthopedic surgeons become familiar with this entity which, because of its rarity, might be neglected in cases of shoulder trauma.
27435293	Synthesis and bioactivity studies of 1-aryl-3-(2-hydroxyethylthio)-1-propanones.	A series of Mannich bases having piperidine moiety were reacted with 2-mercaptoethanol, leading to 1-aryl-3-piperidine-4-yl-1-propanone hydrochlorides. The cytotoxicity and carbonic anhydrase inhibitory activities of these new compounds were evaluated. Among the compounds, only one derivative, nitro substituent bearing EU9, showed an effective cytotoxicity, although weak tumor specificity against human oral malignant versus nonmalignant cells. The compound induced apoptosis in HSC-2 oral squamous cell carcinoma cells, but not in human gingival fibroblast. Chemical modifications of this lead are thus necessary to further investigate it as a drug candidate and to obtain compounds with a better activity profile.
27354798	Elimination of the biphasic pharmacodynamics of 15d-PGJ2 by controlling its release from a nanoemulsion.	15-Deoxy-Delta12,14-prostaglandin J2 (15d-PGJ2) has a dual action of stimulating anti-inflammation and anti-proliferation when exogenously administered at high doses. However, at lower doses, it can be toxic inducing opposite actions, ie, stimulation of both inflammation and cell proliferation. This biphasic phenomenon of 15d-PGJ2 is believed to be due to its multitarget behavior. In this study, we provide a strategy for controlling such biphasic pharmacodynamics by separating its dual actions while retaining the beneficial one by using a nanoemulsion (NE). The 15d-PGJ2 was encapsulated in the NE composed of triolein/distearoyl phosphatidylcholine/Tween 80 at a high encapsulation ratio (>83%). Furthermore, NE enhanced drug retention by slowing down its release rate, which was, unconventionally, inversely dependent on the total surface area of the NE system. Next, focusing on the biphasic effect on cell proliferation, we found that the 15d-PGJ2-loaded slow-release NE showed only a dose-dependent inhibition of the viability of a mouse macrophage cell line, RAW264.7, although a fast-release NE as well as free 15d-PGJ2 exerted a biphasic effect. The observed slow-release kinetics are believed to be responsible for elimination of the biphasic pharmacodynamics of 15d-PGJ2 mainly for two reasons: 1) a high proportion of 15d-PGJ2 that is retained in the NE was delivered to the cytosol, where proapoptotic targets are located and 2) 15d-PGJ2 was able to bypass cell membrane-associated targets that lead to the induction of cellular proliferation. Collectively, our strategy of eliminating the 15d-PGJ2-induced biphasic pharmacodynamics was based on the delivery of 15d-PGJ2 to its desired site of action, excluding undesired sites, on a subcellular level.
27008814	DISSOLUTION KINETICS STUDIES OF CLOPIDOGREL FROM SELECTED MULTISOURCE COATED TABLETS WITH APPLICATION OF CAPILLARY ZONE ELECTROPHORESIS METHOD.	Resistance to an anti-platelet agent clopidogrel (CLP) and the growing number of products with the drug cause the need for comparison of their quality to assure patients safe and effective treatment. Therefore, the aim of the study was to compare in vitro dissolution kinetics of CLP immediate-release tablets, commonly used in anti-platelet therapy in Poland. For analysis of CLP in samples obtained from dissolution test a capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE) method was elaborated and validated. Separation of CLP and ticlopidine, used as an internal standard, was performed in silica capillary filled with phosphate buffer of pH 2.5, at the applied voltage of 20 kV. The CZE method fulfilled the validation requirements for determination of drugs in pharmaceutical matrices and was successfully applied for analysis of CLP dissolved from the tablets. Dissolution profiles were prepared for each product and mean dose fractions of CLP dissolved from tablets at 30 min were calculated. Kinetic parameters of the CLP dissolution from the studied products were compared. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) did not reveal differences between CLP fractions dissolved at 30 min time point from the tested drug products. However, ANOVA with Tukey multiple comparison test revealed significant differences in first-order dissolution rate constants and t(0).(5) values (times at which 50% of drug is dissolved) of CLP among tested tablets. It was concluded that the studied CLP products met the acceptance criteria regarding dissolution test but differed with each other in dissolution kinetics.
27477402	Frequency of Calreticulin (CALR) Mutation and Its Clinical Prognostic Significance in Essential Thrombocythemia and Primary Myelofibrosis: A Meta-analysis.	Objective As the calreticulin (CALR) mutation frequency is significantly associated with essential thrombocythemia (ET) and primary myelofibrosis (PMF), this mutation may be an important biomarker in patients with ET and PMF. Methods We performed a literature search until April 2015 and obtained 21 relevant studies. The outcome was pooled as the effect size by using the Stata software program. Results The CALR mutation frequencies in patients with ET and PMF were 19% and 22%, respectively. The CALR mutation ratio in Asian patients with ET was 23% and higher than that in European-American patients (16%). Moreover, the mutation ratio in Asian patients with PMF was lower (21%) than that in European-American patients (23%). A slight trend toward fibrotic transformation was found in ET with CALR mutations, whereas leukemic transformation was not significant in patients with ET or PMF with CALR mutations. Conclusion CALR mutations significantly influence the incident of ET as demonstrated by the meta-analysis.
27148400	Bioactivity-guided isolation of antioxidant and anti-hepatocarcinoma constituents from Veronica ciliata.	BACKGROUND: Veronica ciliata Fisch., widely distributed in western China, has been traditionally used in Tibetan Medicine as a treatment for hepatitis, cholecystitis, rheumatism, and urticaria. However, V. ciliata Fisch. has not been subjected to detailed chemical constitution analysis and the bioactive studies were restricted to its crude extracts. It is necessary to investigate the active chemical components of these extracts and identify their biological effects. RESULTS: Four iridoid glycosides, (veronicoside, cataposide, amphicoside, and verminoside) were isolated from the ethyl acetate fraction. Among these compounds, veronicoside and verminoside were isolated for the first time from this plant. These compounds exhibited strong antioxidant activity and inhibitory activity on HepG2 cell proliferation. The antioxidant activity of verminoside was equal to Vc. Cataposide, amphicoside and verminoside had stronger anti-hepatocarcinoma activity than 5-fluorouracil. CONCLUSIONS: Four iridoid glycosides,(veronicoside, cataposide, amphicoside and verminoside) were isolated from the extract of V. ciliata Fisch. using bioassay-guided screening.Among these compounds, veronicoside and verminoside were isolated for the first time from this plant. The above results indicated that these compounds were the active chemical components responsible for the antioxidant and anti-hepatocarcinoma properties of V. ciliata Fisch. The underlying mechanism of their bioactivity is worthy of further investigation. Graphical abstractBioactivity-guided isolation of antioxidant and anti-hepatocarcinoma constituents from Veronica ciliata.
26832661	Serum Adipsin Levels throughout Normal Pregnancy and Preeclampsia.	Adipsin is a protease produced at high levels by adipose tissue. It is involved in complement activation and metabolic control. The objective of this study was to determine the changes in adipsin levels during different stages of normal pregnancy, and its association with obstetric outcomes, such as preeclampsia. This nested case-control study in a longitudinal cohort included normal pregnant (n = 54) and preeclamptic (n = 18) women, both followed throughout pregnancy. Additionally, some of the normal pregnant women were followed up three months postpartum (n = 18). Healthy non-pregnant women were also studied during their menstrual cycle (n = 20). The results of this study show that in healthy non-pregnant women, adipsin levels did not change significantly during the menstrual cycle. In normal pregnant women, adipsin levels were lower (p < 0.01) when compared with non-pregnant healthy women, but these serum levels increased again during postpartum (p < 0.001). Adipsin levels were significantly elevated in preeclamptic women in late pregnancy (P < 0.01). A significant correlation was not found between leptin and adipsin during the three periods of gestation studied in healthy pregnant and preeclamptic women. Our results suggest that adipsin may be involved in pregnancy-associated metabolic changes. Moreover, the increase of adipsin levels towards late gestation in preeclamptic women could be related to the pathophysiology of this disease.
27188545	A Brief Review of West Nile Virus Biology.	West Nile virus (WNV) is an arbovirus with increased global incidence in the last decade. It is also a major cause of human encephalitis in the USA. WNV is an arthropod-transmitted virus that mainly affects birds but humans become infected as incidental dead-end hosts which can cause outbreaks in naive populations. The main vectors of WNV are mosquitoes of the genus Culex, which preferentially feed on birds. As in many other arboviruses, the characteristics that allow Flaviviruses like WNV to replicate and transmit to different hosts are encrypted in their genome, which also contains information for the production of structural and nonstructural proteins needed for host cell infection. WNV and other Flaviviruses have developed different strategies to establish infection, replication, and successful transmission. Most of these strategies include the diversion of the host's immune responses away from the virus. In this review, we describe the molecular structure and protein function of WNV with emphasis on protein involvement in the modulation of antiviral immune responses.
27746436	Metastatic Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumor that Progressed to Ectopic Adrenocorticotropic Hormone (ACTH) Syndrome with Growth Hormone-releasing Hormone (GHRH) Production.	The patient was a 61-year-old woman who had a well-differentiated pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (PNET) with lymph node metastasis. After 15 months of octreotide treatment, glucose control deteriorated and pigmentation of the tongue and moon face developed, leading to the diagnosis of ectopic adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) syndrome. An abnormal secretion of growth hormone (GH) was identified, and the plasma growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) level was elevated. A tumor biopsy specimen positively immunostained for ACTH and GHRH. Ectopic hormone secretion seems to have evolved along with the progression of the PNET.
27047369	SNAP-25, a Known Presynaptic Protein with Emerging Postsynaptic Functions.	A hallmark of synaptic specializations is their dependence on highly organized complexes of proteins that interact with each other. The loss or modification of key synaptic proteins directly affects the properties of such networks, ultimately impacting synaptic function. SNAP-25 is a component of the SNARE complex, which is central to synaptic vesicle exocytosis, and, by directly interacting with different calcium channels subunits, it negatively modulates neuronal voltage-gated calcium channels, thus regulating intracellular calcium dynamics. The SNAP-25 gene has been associated with distinct brain diseases, including Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, indicating that the protein may act as a shared biological substrate among different "synaptopathies". The mechanisms by which alterations in SNAP-25 may concur to these psychiatric diseases are still undefined, although alterations in neurotransmitter release have been indicated as potential causative processes. This review summarizes recent work showing that SNAP-25 not only controls exo/endocytic processes at the presynaptic terminal, but also regulates postsynaptic receptor trafficking, spine morphogenesis, and plasticity, thus opening the possibility that SNAP-25 defects may contribute to psychiatric diseases by impacting not only presynaptic but also postsynaptic functions.
27738453	Effects of DNA supercoiling on chromatin architecture.	Disruptions in chromatin structure are necessary for the regulation of eukaryotic genomes, from remodelling of nucleosomes at the base pair level through to large-scale chromatin domains that are hundreds of kilobases in size. RNA polymerase is a powerful motor which, prevented from turning with the tight helical pitch of the DNA, generates over-wound DNA ahead of itself and under-wound DNA behind. Mounting evidence supports a central role for transcription-dependent DNA supercoiling in disrupting chromatin structure at all scales. This supercoiling changes the properties of the DNA helix in a manner that substantially alters the binding specificity of DNA binding proteins and complexes, including nucleosomes, polymerases, topoisomerases and transcription factors. For example, transient over-wound DNA destabilises nucleosome core particles ahead of a transcribing polymerase, whereas under-wound DNA facilitates pre-initiation complex formation, transcription factor binding and nucleosome core particle association behind the transcribing polymerase. Importantly, DNA supercoiling can also dissipate through DNA, even in a chromatinised context, to influence both local elements and large chromatin domains. We propose a model in which changes in unconstrained DNA supercoiling influences higher levels of chromatin organisation through the additive effects of DNA supercoiling on both DNA-protein and DNA-nucleosome interactions. This model links small-scale changes in DNA and chromatin to the higher-order fibre and large-scale chromatin structures, providing a mechanism relating gene regulation to chromatin architecture in vivo.
27504461	Soluble Urokinase Receptors in Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis: A Review on the Scientific Point of View.	Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) is one of the primary glomerular disorders in both children and adults which can progress to end-stage renal failure. Although there are genetic and secondary causes, circulating factors have also been regarded as an important factor in the pathogenesis of FSGS, because about 40% of the patients with FSGS have recurrence after renal transplantation. Soluble urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR) is a soluble form of uPAR, which is a membrane-bound protein linked to GPI in various immunologically active cells, including podocytes. It has recently been suggested as a potential circulating factor in FSGS by in vitro podocyte experiments, in vivo mice models, and human studies. However, there have also been controversies on this issue, because subsequent studies showed conflicting results. suPAR levels were also increased in patients with other glomerular diseases and were inversely correlated with estimated glomerular filtration rate. Nevertheless, there has been no balanced review on this issue. In this review, we compare the conflicting data on the involvement of suPAR in the pathogenesis of FSGS and shed light on interpretation by taking into account many points and the potential variables and confounders influencing serum suPAR levels.
27759029	A cross-ethnic survey of CFB and SLC44A4, Indian ulcerative colitis GWAS hits, underscores their potential role in disease susceptibility.	The first ever genome-wide association study (GWAS) of ulcerative colitis in genetically distinct north Indian population identified two novel genes namely CFB and SLC44A4. Considering their biological relevance, we investigated allelic/genetic heterogeneity in these genes among ulcerative colitis cohorts of north Indian, Japanese and Dutch origin using high-density ImmunoChip case-control genotype data. Comparative linkage disequilibrium profiling and test of association were performed. Of the 28 CFB SNPs, similar strength of association was observed for rs4151657 (novel ulcerative colitis GWAS SNP) in north Indians (P=1.73 x 10-10) and Japanese (P=2.02 x 10-12) but not in the Dutch. Further, a three-marker haplotype was shared between north Indians and Japanese (P<10-8), but a different five-marker haplotype was associated (P=2.07 x 10-6) in the Dutch. Of the 22 SLC44A4 SNPs, rs2736428 (novel ulcerative colitis GWAS SNP) was found significantly associated in north Indians (P=4.94 x 10-10) and Japanese (P=3.37 x 10-9), but not among the Dutch. These results suggest (i) apparent allelic heterogeneity in CFB and genetic heterogeneity in SLC44A4 across different ethnic groups; (ii) shared ulcerative colitis genetic etiological factors among Asians; and finally (iii) re-exploration of GWAS findings together with high-density genotyping/sequencing and trans-ethnic fine mapping approaches may help identify shared and population-specific risk variants and enable to explain missing disease heritability.
27192219	Sequential Differentiation of Embryonic Stem Cells into Neural Epithelial-Like Stem Cells and Oligodendrocyte Progenitor Cells.	BACKGROUND: Recent advances in stem cell technology afford an unlimited source of neural progenitors and glial cells for cell based therapy in central nervous system (CNS) disorders. However, current differentiation strategies still need to be improved due to time-consuming processes, poorly defined culture conditions, and low yield of target cell populations. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPLE FINDINGS: This study aimed to provide a precise sequential differentiation to capture two transient stages: neural epithelia-like stem cells (NESCs) and oligodendrocytes progenitor cells (OPCs) derived from mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs). CHIR99021, a glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3) inhibitor, in combination with dual SMAD inhibitors, could induce ESCs to rapidly differentiate into neural rosette-like colonies, which facilitated robust generation of NESCs that had a high self-renewal capability and stable neuronal and glial differentiation potentials. Furthermore, SHH combined with FGF-2 and PDGF-AA could induce NESCs to differentiate into highly expandable OPCs. These OPCs not only robustly differentiated into oligodendrocytes, but also displayed an increased migratory activity in vitro. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We developed a precise and reliable strategy for sequential differentiation to capture NESCs and OPCs derived from ESCs, thus providing unlimited cell source for cell transplantation and drug screening towards CNS repair.
26965759	Conventional MRI for diagnosis of subacute combined degeneration (SCD) of the spinal cord due to vitamin B-12 deficiency.	Subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord (SCD) is often found in vitamin B-12 deficiency and typically shows hyperintensity on T2-weighted images of the lateral and posterior columns. The purpose of the study was to evaluate the use of conventional magnetic resonance examination in diagnosing SCD. Thirty-six patients were clinically confirmed and retrospectively analyzed; conventional spine MRIs were available for all patients and eight of them had contrast enhancement MRIs. 19 out of 36 patients showed abnormal signal intensity on T2 weighted images with a sensitivity of 52.8%, among which 18 in the posterior aspect of the spinal cord and 1 in the anterior horn of the thoracic spinal cord The spinal cord abnormalities were seen at the cervical spine in 12 patients (33.3%) and at the thoracic spine in the other 7 patients (19.4%). Axial T2-weighted images showed symmetric linear T2-hyperintensity as an "inverted V" at the cervical spinal cord in 5 patients, which has been reported as a typical sign of SCD. For patients with thoracic spinal cord abnormalities, the bilateral paired nodular T2-hyperintensity looked like "binoculars" at the thoracic spinal cord. Only one out of the eight patients showed slight enhancement after injection with contrast agent. All the 36 patients reported clinical improvement after appropriate vitamin B-12 treatment. The two follow-up spine MRIs showed a decreased extent of the lesion. Therefore, conventional MRI is useful in the diagnosis and management of SCD caused by vitamin B-12 deficiency.
26965130	Remote Patterning of Transgene Expression Using Near Infrared-Responsive Plasmonic Hydrogels.	The development of noninvasive technologies for remote control of gene expression has received increased attention for their therapeutic potential in clinical scenarios, including cancer, neurological disorders, immunology, tissue engineering, as well as developmental biology research. Near-infrared (NIR) light is a suitable source of energy that can be employed to pattern transgene expression in plasmonic cell constructs. Gold nanoparticles tailored to exhibit a plasmon surface band absorption peaking at NIR wavelengths within the so called tissue optical window (TOW) can be used as fillers in fibrin-based hydrogels. These biocompatible composites can be loaded with cells harboring heat-inducible gene switches. NIR laser irradiation of the resulting plasmonic cell constructs causes the local conversion of NIR photon energy into heat, achieving spatially restricted patterns of transgene expression that faithfully match the illuminated areas of the hydrogels. In combination with cells genetically engineered to harbor gene switches activated by heat and dependent on a small-molecule regulator (SMR), NIR-responsive hydrogels allow reliable and safe control of the spatiotemporal availability of therapeutic biomolecules in target tissues.
27708726	Bisphenol A Release: Survey of the Composition of Dental Composite Resins.	BACKGROUND: Bisphenol A (BPA) is an endocrine disruptor with potential toxicity. Composite resins may not contain pure BPA, but its derivatives are widely used. Several studies found doses of BPA or its derivatives in saliva or urine of patients after composite resin placement. OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study were to establish an exhaustive list of composite resins marketed in Europe and their composition, and to assess the extent of BPA derivatives used. METHODS: A research on manufacturers' websites was performed to reference all composite resins marketed in Europe, then their composition was determined from both material safety data sheets and a standardized questionnaire sent to manufacturers. Manufacturers had to indicate whether their product contained the monomers listed, add other monomers if necessary, or indicate "not disclosed". RESULTS: 160 composite resins were identified from 31 manufacturers and 23 manufacturers (74.2%) responded to the survey. From the survey and websites, the composition of 130 composite resins (81.2%) was: 112 (86.2%) based on BPA derivatives, 97 (74.7%) on bis-GMA, 17 (13.1%) without monomer derived from BPA (UDMA, sometimes with TEGDMA) and 6 (4.6%) with UDMA (only); 1 (0.8%) did not contain a BPA derivative or UDMA or TEGDMA. Pure BPA was never reported. CONCLUSION: This work has established a list of 18 composite resins that contain no BPA derivative. Manufacturers should be required to report the exact composition of their products as it often remains unclear or incomplete.
27616737	Chronic leucine supplementation improves lipid metabolism in C57BL/6J mice fed with a high-fat/cholesterol diet.	BACKGROUND: Leucine supplementation has been reported to improve lipid metabolism. However, lipid metabolism in adipose tissues and liver has not been extensively studied for leucine supplementation in mice fed with a high-fat/cholesterol diet (HFCD). DESIGN: C57BL/6J mice were fed a chow diet, HFCD, HFCD supplemented with 1.5% leucine (HFCD+1.5% Leu group) or 3% leucine (HFCD+3% Leu group) for 24 weeks. The body weight, peritoneal adipose weight, total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride in serum and liver, and serum adipokines were analyzed. In addition, expression levels of proteins associated with hepatic lipogenesis, adipocyte lipolysis, and white adipose tissue (WAT) browning were determined. RESULTS: Mice in the HFCD group developed obesity and deteriorated lipid metabolism. Compared with HFCD, leucine supplementation lowered weight gain and TC levels in circulation and the liver without changing energy intake. The decrease in body fat was supported by histological examination in the WAT and liver. Furthermore, serum levels of proinflammatory adipokines, such as leptin, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha, were significantly decreased by supplemented leucine. At the protein level, leucine potently decreased the hepatic lipogenic enzymes (fatty acid synthase and acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase) and corresponding upstream proteins. In epididymal WAT, the reduced expression levels of two major lipases by HFCD, namely phosphorylated hormone-sensitive lipase and adipose triglyceride lipase, were reversed when leucine was supplemented. Uncoupling protein 1, beta3 adrenergic receptors, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor g coactivator-1alpha, and fibroblast growth factor 21 were involved in the thermogenic program and WAT browning. Leucine additionally upregulated their protein expression in both WAT and interscapular brown adipose tissue. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that chronic leucine supplementation reduced the body weight and improved the lipid profile of mice fed with a HFCD. This beneficial effect was ascribed to hepatic lipogenesis, adipocyte lipolysis, and WAT browning.
26954674	Alteration of Antiviral Signalling by Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) of Mitochondrial Antiviral Signalling Protein (MAVS).	Genetic variation is associated with diseases. As a type of genetic variation occurring with certain regularity and frequency, the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) is attracting more and more attention because of its great value for research and real-life application. Mitochondrial antiviral signalling protein (MAVS) acts as a common adaptor molecule for retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs), which can recognize foreign RNA, including viral RNA, leading to the induction of type I interferons (IFNs). Therefore, MAVS is thought to be a crucial molecule in antiviral innate immunity. We speculated that genetic variation of MAVS may result in susceptibility to infectious diseases. To assess the risk of viral infection based on MAVS variation, we tested the effects of twelve non-synonymous MAVS coding-region SNPs from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database that result in amino acid substitutions. We found that five of these SNPs exhibited functional alterations. Additionally, four resulted in an inhibitory immune response, and one had the opposite effect. In total, 1,032 human genomic samples obtained from a mass examination were genotyped at these five SNPs. However, no homozygous or heterozygous variation was detected. We hypothesized that these five SNPs are not present in the Japanese population and that such MAVS variations may result in serious immune diseases.

27660457	The association of serum gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase level and other laboratory parameters with blood pressure in hypertensive patients under ambulatory blood pressure monitoring.	BACKGROUND: Hypertension is a very important cause of morbidity and mortality. Serum gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) is a biomarker of oxidative stress and associated with increased risk of hypertension and diabetes. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association of serum GGT level, which is an early marker of inflammation and endothelial dysfunction, with the deterioration of the diurnal rhythm of the blood pressure. METHODS: A total of 171 patients with hypertension were included in this study. Patients whose nighttime mean blood pressure, measured via ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, decreased between 10% and 20% compared with the daytime mean blood pressure were defined as "dippers", whereas patients with a nighttime blood pressure decrease lower than 10% were defined as "non-dippers". RESULTS: A total of 99 hypertensive patients (65 females/34 males) were classified as dippers and 72 patients (48 females/24 males) as non-dippers. The mean age of the non-dipper group was significantly greater than the dipper group. Serum GGT, C-reactive protein and uric acid levels were significantly higher among patients in the non-dipper group. Negative correlations were detected between GGT levels and diurnal systolic and diastolic blood pressure decreases. CONCLUSION: Our findings revealed that GGT level was higher in the non-dipper group, and was negatively correlated with the nighttime decrease of diurnal blood pressure. C-reactive protein and uric acid levels were also higher in the non-dipper group. However, future randomized controlled prospective studies with larger patient populations are necessary to confirm our findings.

27457348	Hepatocellular Carcinoma in Alcoholic Liver Disease: Current Management and Recent Advances.	Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) is a major healthcare problem. Almost ninety percent of HCCs develops on cirrhosis due to chronic viral hepatitis, Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH) and alcohol abuse. Alcohol itself is defined a strong human carcinogenic agent. Some genetic polymorphisms in alcohol-metabolizing systems and more recently, some sequence variations within the genes coding for patatin-like phospholipase encoding 3 (PNPLA3) and Transmembrane 6 superfamily 2 (TM6SF2), have been found to promote liver fibrosis in alcohol abuse, until HCC development. The current management of HCC is related to tumor burden and liver function and it does not differ in alcoholics, although in alcoholics the surveillance for HCC could be less effective because socioeconomic context, such as the recall policy, the stage at the diagnosis and the prognosis are not different compared to viral HCCs. On regards of loco-regional treatment options, there have not been significant advances in the last few years, though an increasing role will be probably reserved to radio embolization and irreversible electroporation in the next future. Sorafenib (SOR) is still the only drug approved as systemic therapy in patients with HCC, whereas immunotherapy represents a promising approach for the treatment of HCC.
26953576	Nutritional knowledge, diet quality and breast or lung cancer risk: a case-control study of adults from Warmia and Mazury region in Poland.	BACKGROUND: Knowledge on proper nutrition favours the creation of pro-healthy nutritional behaviours of people. Studies related to the nutritional knowledge of adults, diet quality and incidence of breast or lung cancers are limited. OBJECTIVE: Analysis of the relationship between the level of nutritional knowledge, diet quality and risk of breast cancer in women or lung cancer in men from the Warmia and Mazury region in Poland. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study was carried out in 202 subjects aged 23-80 years, including 107 women (17 cases of breast cancer) and 95 men (54 cases of lung cancer) from the Warmia and Mazury region in Poland. Nutritional knowledge was evaluated with the Questionnaire of Eating Behaviours (QEB), including 25 statements. Based on the frequency of the consumption of 16 food items, two diet quality indices were created: the pro-Healthy-Diet-Index-8 (pHDI-8) and the non-Healthy-Diet-Index-8 (nHDI-8). The values of pHDI-8 and nHDI-8 were calculated on the basis of the sum of the daily frequency of consumption of the selected food items and expressed as times/day. The Odds Ratio (OR) of both breast cancer or lung cancer in relation to the level of nutritional knowledge was calculated based on a logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: The incidence of breast or lung cancer in the bottom, middle and upper tertile of nutritional knowledge was 57.6%, 32.6% and 15.8%, respectively. As nutritional knowledge grew in the subsequent tertiles, pHDI-8 was on the increase (2.63 vs. 3.78 vs. 4.22 times/day) and n-HDI-8 was on the decrease (1.32 vs. 1.21 vs. 0.94 times/day). In the upper tertile of nutritional knowledge, the Odds Ratio for the incidence of breast or lung cancers varied from 0.06 (95% CI: 0.02; 0.17; p<0.05, with adjustment for cancer type and age) to 0.17 (95% CI: 0.04; 0.69; p<0.05, with adjustment for age and sex) when compared to the bottom tertile (OR=1.00). In the middle tertile of nutritional knowledge, the Odds Ratio of both cancers varied from 0.27 (95% CI: 0.12; 0.62, p<0.05, with adjustment for cancer type and age) to 0.35 (95% CI: 0.18; 0.71, p<0.05, variables without adjustment) when compared to the bottom tertile. CONCLUSIONS: A higher level of nutritional knowledge was associated with the higher quality of a pro-healthy diet and lower risk of breast cancer in women or lung cancer in men. In contrast, a lower level of nutritional knowledge was associated with a lower diet quality and a higher risk of both types of cancers.
27335899	Deconvolution of the particle size distribution of ProRoot MTA and MTA Angelus.	Objective Mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) cements contain two types of particles, namely Portland cement (PC) (nominally 80% w/w) and bismuth oxide (BO) (20%). This study aims to determine the particle size distribution (PSD) of PC and BO found in MTA. Materials and methods The PSDs of ProRoot MTA (MTA-P) and MTA Angelus (MTA-A) powder were determined using laser diffraction, and compared to samples of PC (at three different particle sizes) and BO. The non-linear least squares method was used to deconvolute the PSDs into the constituents. MTA-P and MTA-A powders were also assessed with scanning electron microscopy. Results BO showed a near Gaussian distribution for particle size, with a mode distribution peak at 10.48 mum. PC samples milled to differing degrees of fineness had mode distribution peaks from 19.31 down to 4.88 mum. MTA-P had a complex PSD composed of both fine and large PC particles, with BO at an intermediate size, whereas MTA-A had only small BO particles and large PC particles. Conclusions The PSD of MTA cement products is bimodal or more complex, which has implications for understanding how particle size influences the overall properties of the material. Smaller particles may be reactive PC or unreactive radiopaque agent. Manufacturers should disclose particle size information for PC and radiopaque agents to prevent simplistic conclusions being drawn from statements of average particle size for MTA materials.
27386347	Antibacterial activities and structure-activity relationships of a panel of 48 compounds from Kenyan plants against multidrug resistant phenotypes.	In the current study forty eight compounds belonging to anthraquinones, naphthoquinones, benzoquinones, flavonoids (chalcones and polymethoxylated flavones) and diterpenoids (clerodanes and kauranes) were explored for their antimicrobial potential against a panel of sensitive and multi-drug resistant Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) determinations on the tested bacteria were conducted using modified rapid INT colorimetric assay. To evaluate the role of efflux pumps in the susceptibility of Gram-negative bacteria to the most active compounds, they were tested in the presence of phenylalanine arginine beta-naphthylamide (PAbetaN) (at 30 microg/mL) against selected multidrug resistance (MDR) bacteria. The anthraquinone, emodin, naphthaquinone, plumbagin and the benzoquinone, rapanone were active against methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains of bacteria with MIC values ranging from 2 to 128 mug/mL. The structure activity relationships of benzoquinones against the MDR Gram-negative phenotype showed antibacterial activities increasing with increase in side chain length. In the chalcone series the presence of a hydroxyl group at C3' together with a methoxy group and a second hydroxyl group in meta orientation in ring B of the chalcone skeleton appeared to be necessary for minimal activities against MRSA. In most cases, the optimal potential of the active compounds were not attained as they were extruded by bacterial efflux pumps. However, the presence of the PAbetaN significantly increased the antibacterial activities of emodin against Gram-negative MDR E. coli AG102, 100ATet; K. pneumoniae KP55 and KP63 by >4-64 g/mL. The antibacterial activities were substantially enhanced and were higher than those of the standard drug, chloramphenicol. These data clearly demonstrate that the active compounds, having the necessary pharmacophores for antibacterial activities, including some quinones and chalcones are substrates of bacterial efflux pumps and therefore should be combined to efflux pump inhibitors in the fight against MDR bacterial infections.
27142005	Review of Mouse and Human Dendritic Cell Subsets.	Dendritic cells are specialized antigen-presenting cells that initiate and orient immune responses. Numerous studies in mice and humans have shown that dendritic cells are heterogeneous and comprise several subsets that can be distinguished by their surface phenotype, ontogeny, and molecular signature. This review gives an overview of mouse and human dendritic cell subsets and their defining features and summarizes the current knowledge of dendritic cell subsets' functional specialization in terms of antigen presentation.
26949673	Usefulness of Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation to Assess Motor Function in Patients With Parkinsonism.	OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical significance of upper and lower extremity transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)-induced motor evoked potentials (MEPs) in patients with parkinsonism. METHODS: Twenty patients (14 men, 6 women; mean age 70.5+/-9.1 years) suffering from parkinsonism were included in this study. All participants underwent single-pulse TMS session to assess the corticospinal excitability of the upper and lower extremity motor cortex. The resting motor threshold (RMT) was defined as the lowest stimulus intensity able to evoke MEPs of an at least 50 microV peak-to-peak amplitude in 5 of 10 consecutive trials. Five sweeps of MEPs at 120% of the RMT were performed, and the mean amplitude and latency of the MEPs were calculated. Patients were also assessed using the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale part III (UPDRS-III) and the 5-meter Timed Up and Go (5m-TUG) test. RESULTS: There was a significant positive correlation between the RMTs of MEPs in the upper and lower extremities (r=0.612, p=0.004) and between the amplitude of MEPs in the upper and lower extremities (r=0.579, p=0.007). The RMT of upper extremity MEPs showed a significant negative relationship with the UPDRS-III score (r=-0.516, p=0.020). In addition, RMTs of lower extremity MEPs exhibited a negative relationship with the UPDRS-III score, but the association was not statistically significant (r=-406, p=0.075). CONCLUSION: These results indicated that the RMT of MEPs reflect the severity of motor dysfunction in patients with parkinsonism. MEP is a potential quantitative, electrodiagnostic method to assess motor function in patients with parkinsonism.
27076303	Developing Anti-tick Vaccines.	Ticks are responsible for the transmission of viral, bacterial, and protozoal diseases of man and animals and also produce significant economic losses to cattle industry. The use of acaricides constitutes a major component of integrated tick control strategies. However, this is accompanied by the selection of acaricide-resistant ticks and contamination of environment and milk and meat products with drug residues. These issues highlight the need for alternative approaches to control tick infestations and have triggered the search for tick protective antigens for vaccine development. Vaccination as a tick control method has been practiced since the introduction of TickGARD and Gavac that were developed using the midgut glycoprotein Bm86 as antigen. Gavac within integrated tick management systems has proven to reduce the number of acaricidal applications per year that are required to control some strains of R. microplus ticks in different geographical regions. Nevertheless, it has limited or no efficacy against other tick species. These issues have stimulated research for additional tick protective antigens with critical functions in the tick. This chapter presents methodologies for the design and test of molecules as antigens against ticks. Considerations about different methods for the tick control compared to the immunological methods, the desirable characteristics for an anti-tick vaccine and the obstacles encountered for developing this kind of vaccines are discussed. Detailed methodologies for the establishment of a biological model to test new molecules as immunogens against ticks and to perform challenge trials with this model are presented. General considerations in the efficacy calculation for any anti-tick vaccine are also discussed.
26925788	Serum SOX11 promoter methylation is a novel biomarker for the diagnosis of Hepatitis B virus-related hepatocellular carcinoma.	Promoter methylation of tumor suppressor gene SOX11 has been reported to contribute to the diagnosis and prognosis of various cancerous diseases, including gastric cancer, hematopoietic malignancies and nasopharyngeal carcinoma. However, there is no data on the diagnostic potential of serum SOX11 promoter methylation in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This study was therefore aimed to investigate the potential role of serum SOX11 promoter methylation as a noninvasive biomarker in the diagnosis of patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV) associated HCC. A total of 205 subjects were retrospectively included, which consisted of 111 HCC patients, 66 chronic hepatitis B (CHB) and 28 healthy controls (HCs). Methylation of SOX11 promoter was determined by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction. The methylation frequency of serum SOX11 promoter in HCC patients (69.4%, 77/111) was significantly higher than that in CHB patients (13.6%, 9/66; chi2 = 51.467, P<0.001) and HCs (10.7%, 3/28; chi2 = 31.489, P<0.001). There was significant difference of serum SOX11 promoter methylation in HCC patients with vascular invasion (49/58) and those without vascular invasion (28/53; chi2 = 13.058, P<0.001). Furthermore, the sensitivity of 69% was identified for SOX11 methylation in discriminating HCC from CHB, which was significant higher than the sensitivity of 57% for serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) (P<0.05). Notably, SOX11 promoter methylation plus AFP showed a sensitivity of 85% in discriminating HCC from CHB. These results suggested that serum SOX11 promoter methylation might serve as a useful and noninvasive biomarker for the diagnosis of HCC.
26998157	Prognostic factors analysis in EGFR mutation-positive non-small cell lung cancer with brain metastases treated with whole brain-radiotherapy and EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors.	The survival time of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with brain metastases has been previously reported to be 6.5-10.0 months, even with systematic treatment. Patients that possess a certain epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation alongside NSCLC with brain metastases also have a short survival rate, and a reliable prognostic model for these patients demonstrates a strong correlation between the outcome and treatment recommendations. The Cox proportional hazards regression and classification tree models were used to explore the prognostic factors in EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC patients with brain metastases following whole-brain radiation therapy (WBRT) and EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI) treatment. A total of 66 EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC patients with brain metastases were retrospectively reviewed. Univariate and multivariate analyses by Cox proportional hazards regression were then performed. The classification tree model was applied in order to identify prognostic groups of the patients. In the survival analysis, age, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and status of the primary tumor were prognostic factors for progression free survival (P=0.006, 0.014 and 0.005, respectively) and overall survival (P=0.009, 0.013 and 0.009, respectively). The classification tree model was subsequently applied, which revealed 3 patient groups with significantly different survival times: Group I, age <65 years and CEA </=10 microg/ml; Group II, age <65 years and CEA >10 microg/ml or age >/=65 years and CEA </=10 microg/ml; and Group III, age >/=65 years and CEA >10 microg/ml. The major prognostic predictors for EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC patients with brain metastases following WBRT and EGFR-TKI were age and CEA. In addition, primary tumor control may be important for predicting survival.
27872640	Nucleotide Analogue-Related Proximal Renal Tubular Dysfunction during Long-Term Treatment of Chronic Hepatitis B: A Cross-Sectional Study.	Background. There have been few reports of nucleotide analogue-related renal tubular dysfunction (RTD) in CHB patients. We assessed the prevalence and presentation of nucleotide analogue-related proximal RTD. Methods. A cross-sectional study was performed in CHB patients taking nucleotide analogues. Inclusion criteria were patients who were on adefovir or tenofovir as mono- or add-on therapy with lamivudine (LAM) >1 year. Serum and urine were collected. Fractional excretion of phosphate (FEPO4), uric acid (FEUA), and potassium was calculated. Renal losses were defined based on the criteria: protein (24-hour urine protein >150 mg), glucose (glycosuria with normoglycemia), phosphate (FEPO4 >18%), uric acid (FEUA >15%), potassium (renal potassium losses with hypokalemia), and bicarbonate (normal gap acidosis). Subclinical and overt proximal RTD were defined when 2 and >/=3 criteria presented. Results. Ninety-two patients were enrolled. The mean duration of nucleotide analogue taking was 55.1 +/- 29.6 months. Proximal RTD was found in 24 (26.1%) patients (subclinical 15 (16.3%) and overt 9 (9.8%)). The severity of RTD was associated with the duration of nucleotide analogue (P = 0.01). Conclusions. The prevalence of proximal RTD in CHB patients taking nucleotide analogues was 26%. The severity of RTD was associated with the treatment duration. Comprehensive testing is necessary for early detecting nucleotide analogue-related nephrotoxicity.
27046554	Immersive Learning Experiences for Surgical Procedures.	This paper introduces a computer-based system that is designed to record a surgical procedure with multiple depth cameras and reconstruct in three dimensions the dynamic geometry of the actions and events that occur during the procedure. The resulting 3D-plus-time data takes the form of dynamic, textured geometry and can be immersively examined at a later time; equipped with a Virtual Reality headset such as Oculus Rift DK2, a user can walk around the reconstruction of the procedure room while controlling playback of the recorded surgical procedure with simple VCR-like controls (play, pause, rewind, fast forward). The reconstruction can be annotated in space and time to provide more information of the scene to users. We expect such a system to be useful in applications such as training of medical students and nurses.
27252861	Is radioiodine administration in patients with papillary thyroid multifocal microcarcinoma unnecessary?	UNLABELLED: Radioiodine (RAI) has played a crucial role in differentiated thyroid cancer treatment for more than 60years. However, the use of RAI administration in patients with papillary thyroid microcarcinoma (even multifocal) is now being widely discussed and often not recommended. In accordance with European consensus, and contrary to the American Thyroid Association (ATA) guidelines, we recently performed RAI thyroid remnant ablation in a patient with differentiated papillary multifocal microcarcinoma. The post-therapeutic whole-body scan and SPECT/CT revealed the real and unexpected extent of disease, with metastases to upper mediastinal lymph nodes. This finding led to the patient's upstaging from stage I to stage IVa according to the American Joint Committee on Cancer/International Union Against Cancer criteria. LEARNING POINTS: (131)I is a combined beta-gamma emitter, thus allowing not only residual thyroid tissue ablation but also metastatic tissue imaging.RAI remnant ablation omission also means post-treatment whole-body scan omission, which may lead to disease underestimation, due to incorrect nodal and metastatic staging.RAI should be considered also in "low-risk" patients, especially when the lymph node involvement is not reliably documented.Lower administered RAI activity (30mCi, 1.1GBq) may be a workable compromise in low-risk patients, not indicated for RAI remnant ablation according to ATA guidelines.
28163660	The Relationship between Racial Identity and Perceived Significance of the Election of President Barack Obama among African American Mothers.	African American women's racial identity is a major determinant for how they interpret the world around them, yet there is little research examining how specific aspects of racial identity are linked with attitudes about an event that has been highly significant for African-Americans: the election of President Barack Obama. The current study examined the relationship between African American mothers' racial identity and their perceived significance of the election of President Barack Obama as an indicator of reduced systemic and actual racism for African Americans, using a sample of 110 African American mothers residing in a Northeastern metropolitan area. Results revealed that racial centrality and assimilation positively predicted perceived significance of President Obama's election for diminishing racism. Implications and future directions are discussed.
26878455	Spontaneous Resolution of Large Macular Retinoschisis in Enhanced S-Cone Syndrome.	The authors previously reported details on enhanced S-cone syndrome (ESCS) in a 23-year-old male patient with a homozygous NR2E3 mutation (p.Q350X) who developed large bilateral macular retinoschisis. Subsequent optical coherence tomography follow-up showed that although the large bilateral macular retinoschisis remained at the age of 28, there was dramatic improvement in the retinoschisis by the age 32, with bilateral resolution of the macular retinoschisis without any treatment by the age of 34. Although there is no established treatment for macular retinoschisis complicated by ESCS, this case demonstrated that intervention may not be required in some patients with ESCS.
26897155	Prevalence of Hypertension Among School Children in a Rural Area of Tamil Nadu.	A cross-sectional study was conducted to measure the prevalence of hypertension among 310 rural school children in Tamil Nadu. The prevalence of hypertension and pre-hypertension was 10% and 14.2%, respectively. Prevalence was significantly higher among and private school students. We recommend that children should be screened for hypertension for early diagnosis and prevention of complications.
27217787	Difficult-to-heal wounds of mixed arterial/venous and venous etiology: a cost-effectiveness analysis of extracellular matrix.	IMPORTANCE: Difficult-to-heal wounds pose clinical and economic challenges, and cost-effective treatment options are needed. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to determine the cost-effectiveness of extracellular matrix (ECM) relative to standard of care (SC) on wound closure for the treatment of mixed arterial/venous (A/V) or venous leg ulcers (VLUs). DESIGN SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A two-stage Markov model was used to predict the expected costs and outcomes of wound closure for ECM and SC. Outcome data used in the analysis were taken from an 8-week randomized clinical trial that directly compared ECM and SC. Patients were followed up for an additional 6 months to assess wound closure. Forty-eight patients completed the study; 25 for ECM and 23 for SC. SC was defined as a standard moist wound dressing. Transition probabilities for the Markov states were estimated from the clinical trial. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The economic outcome of interest was direct cost per closed-wound week. Resource utilization was based on the treatment regimen used in the clinical trial. Costs were derived from standard cost references. The payer's perspective was taken. RESULTS: ECM-treated wounds closed, on average, after 5.4 weeks of treatment, compared with 8.3 weeks for SC wounds (P=0.02). Furthermore, complete wound closure was significantly higher in patients treated with ECM (P<0.05), with 20 wounds closed in the ECM group (80%) and 15 wounds closed in the SC group (65%). After 8 months, patients treated with ECM had substantially higher closed-wound weeks compared with SC (26.0 weeks versus 22.0 weeks, respectively). Expected direct costs per patient were $2,527 for ECM and $2,540 for SC (a cost savings of $13). CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: ECM yielded better clinical outcomes at a slightly lower cost in patients with mixed A/V and VLUs. ECM is an effective treatment for wound healing and should be considered for use in the management of mixed A/V and VLUs.
27313827	DNA Damage in Chronic Kidney Disease: Evaluation of Clinical Biomarkers.	Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) exhibit an increased cancer risk compared to a healthy control population. To be able to estimate the cancer risk of the patients and to assess the impact of interventional therapies thereon, it is of particular interest to measure the patients' burden of genomic damage. Chromosomal abnormalities, reduced DNA repair, and DNA lesions were found indeed in cells of patients with CKD. Biomarkers for DNA damage measurable in easily accessible cells like peripheral blood lymphocytes are chromosomal aberrations, structural DNA lesions, and oxidatively modified DNA bases. In this review the most common methods quantifying the three parameters mentioned above, the cytokinesis-block micronucleus assay, the comet assay, and the quantification of 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine, are evaluated concerning the feasibility of the analysis and regarding the marker's potential to predict clinical outcomes.
27239913	[Intraperitoneal and retromuscular abdominal wall repair using ultra-light and titanium-containing polypropylene mesh (experimental research)].	AIM: To study experimental possibility of light, ultra-light and titanium-containing endoprostheses implantation for postoperative hernias correction. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Abdominal wall repair was simulated in 72 rabbits. In the first group polypropylene mesh with fibers diameter of 90 microns and surface density of 36 g/m2 was used. In the second group we applied polypropylene mesh with fibers diameter of 65 microns and thin layer of titanium. Their surface density was 16 g/m2. Intraperitoneal onlay mesh (IPOM) and sublay retromuscular (SRM) techniques were used in group 1 and 2 respectively. Animals were taken out from the experiment in 30 and 60 days. Adhesive process in implantation area was evaluated using the method of Egiev V.N. and Lyadov V.K. RESULTS: The most pronounced adhesive process was observed in IPOM series. Type of endoprosthesis and terms of postoperative period did not significant effect adhesive process. SRM method was associated with significantly less pronounced adhesions. Analysis of all data showed that severity of adhesive process was significantly higher in IPOM series compared with SRM technique. CONCLUSION: Our study showed that severity of abdominal adhesive process associated with repair using ultra-light mesh is completely determined by surgical technique and did not depend on type of endoprosthesis and terms of postoperative period. Described implants should be used for retromuscular implantation rather intraperitoneal position.
27122965	A novel start codon mutation of the MERTK gene in a patient with retinitis pigmentosa.	PURPOSE: Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of inherited retinal degenerations characterized by progressive loss of photoreceptor cells and RPE functions. More than 70 causative genes are known to be responsible for RP. This study aimed to identify the causative gene in a patient from a consanguineous family with childhood-onset severe retinal dystrophy. METHODS: To identify the defective gene, whole exome sequencing was performed. Candidate causative variants were selected and validated using Sanger sequencing. Segregation analysis of the causative gene was performed in additional family members. To verify that the mutation has an effect on protein synthesis, an expression vector containing the first ten amino acids of the mutant protein fused with the DsRed2 fluorescent protein was constructed and transfected into HEK293T cells. Expression of the fusion protein in the transfected cells was measured using fluorescence microscopy. RESULTS: By filtering against public variant databases, a novel homozygous missense mutation (c.3G>A) localized in the start codon of the MERTK gene was detected as a potentially pathogenic mutation for autosomal recessive RP. The c.3G>A mutation cosegregated with the disease phenotype in the family. No expression of the first ten amino acids of the MerTK mutant fused with the DsRed2 fluorescent protein was detected in HEK293T cells, indicating that the mutation affects the translation initiation site of the gene that may lead to loss of function of the MerTK signaling pathway. CONCLUSIONS: We report a novel missense mutation (c.3G>A, p.0?) in the MERTK gene that causes severe vision impairment in a patient. Taken together with previous reports, our results expand the spectrum of MERTK mutations and extend our understanding of the role of the MerTK protein in the pathogenesis of retinitis pigmentosa.

27994268	Automated assessment of joint synovitis activity from medical ultrasound and power doppler examinations using image processing and machine learning methods.	OBJECTIVES: Rheumatoid arthritis is the most common rheumatic disease with arthritis, and causes substantial functional disability in approximately 50% patients after 10 years. Accurate measurement of the disease activity is crucial to provide an adequate treatment and care to the patients. The aim of this study is focused on a computer aided diagnostic system that supports an assessment of synovitis severity. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This paper focus on a computer aided diagnostic system that was developed within joint Polish-Norwegian research project related to the automated assessment of the severity of synovitis. Semiquantitative ultrasound with power Doppler is a reliable and widely used method of assessing synovitis. Synovitis is estimated by ultrasound examiner using the scoring system graded from 0 to 3. Activity score is estimated on the basis of the examiner's experience or standardized ultrasound atlases. The method needs trained medical personnel and the result can be affected by a human error. RESULTS: The porotype of a computer-aided diagnostic system and algorithms essential for an analysis of ultrasonic images of finger joints are main scientific output of the MEDUSA project. Medusa Evaluation System prototype uses bone, skin, joint and synovitis area detectors for mutual structural model based evaluation of synovitis. Finally, several algorithms that support the semi-automatic or automatic detection of the bone region were prepared as well as a system that uses the statistical data processing approach in order to automatically localize the regions of interest. CONCLUSIONS: Semiquantitative ultrasound with power Doppler is a reliable and widely used method of assessing synovitis. Activity score is estimated on the basis of the examiner's experience and the result can be affected by a human error. In this paper we presented the MEDUSA project which is focused on a computer aided diagnostic system that supports an assessment of synovitis severity.
27857940	Protocol for Biomarker Ratio Imaging Microscopy with Specific Application to Ductal Carcinoma In situ of the Breast.	This protocol describes the methods and steps involved in performing biomarker ratio imaging microscopy (BRIM) using formalin fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples of human breast tissue. The technique is based on the acquisition of two fluorescence images of the same microscopic field using two biomarkers and immunohistochemical tools. The biomarkers are selected such that one biomarker correlates with breast cancer aggressiveness while the second biomarker anti-correlates with aggressiveness. When the former image is divided by the latter image, a computed ratio image is formed that reflects the aggressiveness of tumor cells while increasing contrast and eliminating path-length and other artifacts from the image. For example, the aggressiveness of epithelial cells may be assessed by computing ratio images of N-cadherin and E-cadherin images or CD44 and CD24 images, which specifically reflect the mesenchymal or stem cell nature of the constituent cells, respectively. This methodology is illustrated for tissue samples of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and invasive breast cancer. This tool should be useful in tissue studies of experimental cancer as well as the management of cancer patients.
27797259	Health-Care Providers' Perspectives towards Childhood Cancer Treatment in Kenya.	BACKGROUND: This study explored perspectives of health-care providers on childhood cancer treatment in Kenya. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A self-administered questionnaire was completed by 104 health-care providers in January and February 2013. RESULTS: Seventy six percent of the health-care providers believed cancer to be curable. More doctors than other health-care providers had this positive opinion (p=0.037). The majority of health-care providers (92%) believed that most children with cancer will not be able to finish their treatment due to financial difficulties. They considered that prosperous highly-educated parents adhere better with treatment (88%) and that doctors adhere better with treatment for prosperous highly-educated parents (79%). According to 74% of health-care providers, quality of care is better for prosperous highly-educated parents (74%). Most health-care providers reported giving more explanation (71%), work with greater accuracy (70%) and use less difficult vocabulary (55%) to prosperous more educated families. Only 34% of health-care providers reported they feel more empathy towards patients from prosperous families. Reasons for non-adherence with the protocol according to health-care providers are: family refuses drugs (85%), inadequate supply of drugs at pharmacy (79%), child looks ill (75%), and financial difficulties of parents (69%). CONCLUSIONS: Health-care providers' health beliefs and attitudes differ for patients with families having high versus low socio-economic backgrounds.
27487076	Outer Membrane Vesicles from the Probiotic Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 and the Commensal ECOR12 Enter Intestinal Epithelial Cells via Clathrin-Dependent Endocytosis and Elicit Differential Effects on DNA Damage.	Interactions between intestinal microbiota and the human host are complex. The gut mucosal surface is covered by a mucin layer that prevents bacteria from accessing the epithelial cells. Thus, the crosstalk between microbiota and the host mainly rely on secreted factors that can go through the mucus layer and reach the epithelium. In this context, vesicles released by commensal strains are seen as key players in signaling processes in the intestinal mucosa. Studies with Gram-negative pathogens showed that outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) are internalized into the host cell by endocytosis, but the entry mechanism for microbiota-derived vesicles is unknown. Escherichia coli strains are found as part of normal human gut microbiota. In this work, we elucidate the pathway that mediate internalization of OMVs from the probiotic E.coli Nissle 1917 (EcN) and the commensal ECOR12 strains in several human intestinal epithelial cell lines. Time course measurement of fluorescence and microscopy analysis performed with rhodamine B-R18-labeled OMVs in the presence of endocytosis inhibitors showed that OMVs from these strains enter epithelial cells via clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Vesicles use the same endocytosis pathway in polarized epithelial monolayers. Internalized OMVs are sorted to lysosomal compartments as shown by their colocalization with clathrin and specific markers of endosomes and lysosomes. OMVs from both strains did not affect cell viability, but reduce proliferation of HT-29 cells. Labeling of 8-oxo-dG adducts in DNA revealed that neither OMVs from EcN nor from ECOR12 promoted oxidative DNA damage. In contrast, flow cytometry analysis of phosphorylated gammaH2AX evidenced that OMVs from the probiotic EcN significantly produced more double strand breaks in DNA than ECOR12 OMVs. The EcN genotoxic effects have been attributed to the synthesis of colibactin. However, it is not known how colibactin is exported and delivered into host cells. Whether colibactin is secreted via OMVs is an open question that needs further study.
26862470	Allogeneic Transplantation of Periodontal Ligament-Derived Multipotent Mesenchymal Stromal Cell Sheets in Canine Critical-Size Supra-Alveolar Periodontal Defect Model.	Periodontitis is a chronic inflammatory disease that induces the destruction of tooth-supporting tissues, followed by tooth loss. Although several approaches have been applied to periodontal regeneration, complete periodontal regeneration has not been accomplished. Tissue engineering using a combination of cells and scaffolds is considered to be a viable alternative strategy. We have shown that autologous transplantation of periodontal ligament-derived multipotent mesenchymal stromal cell (PDL-MSC) sheets regenerates periodontal tissue in canine models. However, the indications for autologous cell transplantation in clinical situations are limited. Therefore, this study evaluated the safety and efficacy of allogeneic transplantation of PDL-MSC sheets using a canine horizontal periodontal defect model. Canine PDL-MSCs were labeled with enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) and were cultured on temperature-responsive dishes. Three-layered cell sheets were transplanted around denuded root surfaces either autologously or allogeneically. A mixture of beta-tricalcium phosphate and collagen gel was placed on the bone defects. Eight weeks after transplantation, dogs were euthanized and subjected to microcomputed tomography and histological analyses. RNA and DNA were extracted from the paraffin sections to verify the presence of EGFP at the transplantation site. Inflammatory markers from peripheral blood sera were quantified using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Periodontal regeneration was observed in both the autologous and the allogeneic transplantation groups. The allogeneic transplantation group showed particularly significant regeneration of newly formed cementum, which is critical for the periodontal regeneration. Serum levels of inflammatory markers from peripheral blood sera showed little difference between the autologous and allogeneic groups. EGFP amplicons were detectable in the paraffin sections of the allogeneic group. These results suggest that allogeneic PDL-MSC sheets promoted periodontal tissue regeneration without side effects. Therefore, allogeneic transplantation of PDL-MSC sheets has a potential to become an alternative strategy for periodontal regeneration.
27536208	A rare case of Addison's disease, hepatitis, thyreoiditis, positive IgG anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies and partial IgA deficiency.	INTRODUCTION: Selective IgA deficiency (IgAD) is the most prevalent type of primary immune deficiencies, but partial IgA deficiency is even more common. Addison's disease is a rare condition associated with primary adrenal insufficiency due to infection or autoimmune destruction of the adrenals. The association between IgA deficiency and Addison's disease is very rare. CASE AND LABORATORY DATA: We observed a 22-year-old male patient with marked darkening of the skin, especially on the palms and areolae, jaundice on the skin and sclera, astheno-adynamia, hypotension (80/50 mm Hg), and pain in the right hypochondrium. The laboratory investigations revealed increased serum levels of total and indirect bilirubin, AST, ALT, GGT and LDH, negative HBsAg, anti-HBc IgM, anti-HCV and anti-HAV IgM, very low serum IgA levels (0.16 g/l) with normal IgG and IgM, negative ANA, ANCA, AMA, LKM-1, anti-GAD-60, anti-IA-2, anti-thyroglobulin antibodies, a mild increase in anti-TPO antibodies titer, a marked increase in IgG anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies, with no typical changes in cellular immunity, negative T-SPOT-TB test, HLA - A*01; B*08; DRB1*03; DQB1*02, karyotype - 46, XY. CONCLUSIONS: We present a rare case of partial IgA deficiency with Addison's disease, hepatitis, thyroiditis and positive anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies. IgAD and some autoimmune disorders share several predisposing HLA genes, thus explaining the increased prevalence of IgAD in certain patient groups.
26926397	Blood Transcriptomic Markers in Patients with Late-Onset Major Depressive Disorder.	We investigated transcriptomic markers of late-onset major depressive disorder (LOD; onset age of first depressive episode >/= 50 years) from the genes expressed in blood cells and identified state-dependent transcriptomic markers in these patients. We assessed the genes expressed in blood cells by microarray and found that the expression levels of 3,066 probes were state-dependently changed in the blood cells of patients with LOD. To select potential candidates from those probes, we assessed the genes expressed in the blood of an animal model of depression, ovariectomized female mice exposed to chronic ultra-mild stress, by microarray and cross-matched the differentially expressed genes between the patients and the model mice. We identified 14 differentially expressed genes that were similarly changed in both patients and the model mice. By assessing statistical significance using real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR), the following 4 genes were selected as candidates: cell death-inducing DFFA-like effector c (CIDEC), ribonuclease 1 (RNASE1), solute carrier family 36 member-1 (SLC36A1), and serine/threonine/tyrosine interacting-like 1 (STYXL1). The discriminating ability of these 4 candidate genes was evaluated in an independent cohort that was validated. Among them, CIDEC showed the greatest discriminant validity (sensitivity 91.3% and specificity 87.5%). Thus, these 4 biomarkers should be helpful for properly diagnosing LOD.
27790616	A Comprehensive Comparison of the Efficacy and Tolerability of Racecadotril with Other Treatments of Acute Diarrhea in Adults.	Racecadotril is a guideline-recommended treatment to alleviate symptoms of acute diarrhea. A systematic review of randomized studies was performed comparing efficacy and safety of treatment with racecadotril to that with placebo or active treatments in adults. In five double-blind studies, racecadotril and placebo had comparable tolerability, but racecadotril was more effective. This was consistent across multiple efficacy parameters including duration of diarrhea, number of diarrheic stools, abdominal pain, and meteorism; it was also consistent across countries in Africa, Asia, and Europe. In six randomized studies in outpatients comparing racecadotril to loperamide, resolution of symptoms occurred with similar speed and efficacy; however, racecadotril treatment was associated with less rebound constipation and less abdominal discomfort. The seventh comparative study performed in geriatric nursing home residents reported a superior efficacy of racecadotril. In direct comparison with Saccharomyces boulardii treatment, racecadotril exhibited similar tolerability but was more efficacious. One study compared racecadotril to octreotide in patients with acute diarrhea requiring hospitalization, rehydration, and antibiotic treatment; in this cohort, octreotide was more efficacious than racecadotril. In conclusion, in adults with acute diarrhea, racecadotril is more efficacious than placebo or S. boulardii, similarly efficacious as loperamide and, in patients with moderate to severe disease as add-on to antibiotics, less than octreotide. The tolerability of racecadotril is similar to that of placebo or S. boulardii and better than that of loperamide, particularly with regard to risk of rebound constipation. Taken together, these data demonstrate that racecadotril is a suitable treatment to alleviate symptoms of acute diarrhea in adults.
26842534	Staphylococcal Scalded Skin Syndrome: A Case Review.	Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome (SSSS) is a rare yet well-known exfoliative skin syndrome. It involves extensive desquamated areas caused by an exfoliative toxin from Staphylococcus aureus. The typical presentation of SSSS allows for early diagnosis and treatment of the disease. Knowing and understanding the prevalence, pathophysiology, risk factors, and diagnosis of SSSS will ensure that infants being treated and cared for by neonatal nurses and neonatal nurse practitioners will receive appropriate, comprehensive, and multidisciplinary care while in the NICU. The purpose of this case review is to inform neonatal nurses and practitioners of the current literature that focuses on the diagnosis and management of SSSS.
28078034	Reactivated astrocytes as a possible source of oligodendrocyte precursors for remyelination in remitting phase of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis rats.	Multiple sclerosis (MS) is ademyelinating disease in the central nervous system (CNS). Majority of the MS patients show relapsing-remitting disease course. Evidences show that oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs), which remain relatively quiescent in normal adult CNS, play a key role in the remitting phase by proliferation and remyelination. In the present study, we found that spinal cord astrocytesco-expressed progenitor cell marker and oligodendroglial lineage markers in the remittance phase in adult rat experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model. We suggest that activated astrocyte could de-differentiate into OPCs and re-differentiate into mature oligodendrocytes, raising the possibility that astrocytes can be a potential source of OPCs in the adult demyelinated spinal cord.
27586291	Mechanism of Inactivation in Voltage-Gated Na(+) Channels.	Voltage-gated Na(+) channels (VGSCs) initiate action potentials thereby giving rise to rapid transmission of electrical signals along cell membranes and between cells. Depolarization of the cell membrane causes VGSCs to open but also gives rise to a nonconducting state termed inactivation. Inactivation of VGSCs serves a critical physiologic function as it determines the extent of excitability of neurons and of muscle cells. Depending on the time course of development and removal of inactivation both "fast-" and "slow"-inactivated states have been described. Evidence from mutagenesis studies suggests that fast inactivation is produced by a block of the internal vestibule by a tethered inactivation particle that has been mapped to the internal linker between domains III and IV. The motion of this linker may be regulated by parts of the internal C-terminus. The molecular mechanism of slow inactivation is less clear. However, aside from a high number of mutagenesis studies, the recent availability of 3D structures of crystallized prokaryotic VGSCs offers insights into the molecular motions associated with slow inactivation. One possible scenario is that slow movements of the voltage sensors are transmitted to the external vestibule giving rise to a conformational change of this region. This molecular rearrangement is transmitted to the S6 segments giving rise to collapse of the internal vestibule.
27323881	The Prevalence of Frailty in Patients Admitted to Hospital with Vertebral Fragility Fractures.	INTRODUCTION: Vertebral fragility fractures are the most common fragility fracture. A significant proportion of patients still present to hospital for treatment due to their underlying older age and frailty syndrome. We aim to describe the prevalence of frailty within a cohort of hospitalised patients with vertebral fragility fracture using clinical frailty scales and comparing this group of patients with those that have a fragility fracture of the hip, a well-recognised frail group of patients. METHOD: As part of a service improvement project, a prospective case series of all patients >/=50years admitted to hospital with a vertebral fragility fracture over a 6 week period (n=24) were screened for frailty. This was done using recognised clinical scales for frailty assessment (PRISMA-7, Groningen Frailty Index(GFI) and Edmonton Frail Scale (EFS)). Data was collected on patients' mobility (timed-up-and-go test), activities of daily living (Barthel Index) and cognition (abbreviated mental test). Secondly, we performed a cross-sectional analysis of patient characteristics of those >/=50years admitted to hospital with a fragility fracture of the hip (n=30) and those with a vertebral fragility fracture using data from our local clinical service registries. RESULTS: In the first study, frailty was identified in 70.8% of vertebral fracture patients using PRISMA-7 tool; 66.7% with the GFI; and 33.3% with the EFS. A further 20.8% were considered vulnerable to frailty on the EFS. Almost 30% were considered frail on all the three scales. Three quarters had a timed-up-and-go of >20seconds. Median Barthel Index was 18 (range 6-20); and the median abbreviated mental test was 9 (range 2-10), which suggests a cohort that is mostly independent with personal activities of daily living with good levels of cognition. In the second study, compared to patients with hip fracture, patients with vertebral fractures were younger; more likely to be living independently; less likely to have fallen in the last year; were taking more medication; and had equal number of co-morbidities as patients with hip fractures Conclusion: Frailty is prevalent in those admitted to hospital with a vertebral fragility fracture. Treatment of their acute fracture will need to include addressing their frailty issues.
26834129	Use of High-Definition Audiovisual Technology in a Gross Anatomy Laboratory: Effect on Dental Students' Learning Outcomes and Satisfaction.	Laboratory cadaver dissection is essential for three-dimensional understanding of anatomical structures and variability, but there are many challenges to teaching gross anatomy in medical and dental schools, including a lack of available space and qualified anatomy faculty. The aim of this study was to determine the efficacy of high-definition audiovisual educational technology in the gross anatomy laboratory in improving dental students' learning outcomes and satisfaction. Exam scores were compared for two classes of first-year students at one U.S. dental school: 2012-13 (no audiovisual technology) and 2013-14 (audiovisual technology), and section exams were used to compare differences between semesters. Additionally, an online survey was used to assess the satisfaction of students who used the technology. All 284 first-year students in the two years (2012-13 N=144; 2013-14 N=140) participated in the exams. Of the 140 students in the 2013-14 class, 63 completed the survey (45% response rate). The results showed that those students who used the technology had higher scores on the laboratory exams than those who did not use it, and students in the winter semester scored higher (90.17+/-0.56) than in the fall semester (82.10+/-0.68). More than 87% of those surveyed strongly agreed or agreed that the audiovisual devices represented anatomical structures clearly in the gross anatomy laboratory. These students reported an improved experience in learning and understanding anatomical structures, found the laboratory to be less overwhelming, and said they were better able to follow dissection instructions and understand details of anatomical structures with the new technology. Based on these results, the study concluded that the ability to provide the students a clear view of anatomical structures and high-quality imaging had improved their learning experience.
27418986	Multidrug-Resistant Bacteroides fragilis Bacteremia in a US Resident: An Emerging Challenge.	We describe a case of Bacteroides fragilis bacteremia associated with paraspinal and psoas abscesses in the United States. Resistance to b-lactam/b-lactamase inhibitors, carbapenems, and metronidazole was encountered despite having a recent travel history to India as the only possible risk factor for multidrug resistance. Microbiological cure was achieved with linezolid, moxifloxacin, and cefoxitin.
27069349	Spectrum of Maternofetal Outcomes during Dengue Infection in Pregnancy: An Insight.	Dengue is a vector transmitted viral infection; tropical and subtropical countries see outbreaks of dengue each year. There is a paucity of literature on effects of dengue infection on pregnancy outcome and this prompted us to undertake a study for better understanding of pregnancy implications with dengue infection. Pregnant women admitted during the seasonal outbreak of dengue between September 2015 and October 2015 were studied and maternal and fetal outcomes in sixteen NS1Ag positive women were analysed. Out of sixteen women diagnosed with dengue fever, three had dengue shock syndrome (DSS) and eight had dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF). The most common obstetric complication seen in 43% of the cases was oligohydramnios. Bleeding manifestations occurred in seven women and there were three maternal deaths. Perinatal complications included three intrauterine deaths, six nursery admissions, and one neonatal death. Thus dengue infection was associated with high maternal and perinatal mortality. In view of poor obstetric outcomes, this viral infection warrants early admission and prompt management.
27182736	Universal Coverage without Universal Access: Institutional Barriers to Health Care among Women Sex Workers in Vancouver, Canada.	BACKGROUND: Access to health care is a crucial determinant of health. Yet, even within settings that purport to provide universal health coverage (UHC), sex workers' experiences reveal systematic, institutionally ingrained barriers to appropriate quality health care. The aim of this study was to assess prevalence and correlates of institutional barriers to care among sex workers in a setting with UHC. METHODS: Data was drawn from an ongoing community-based, prospective cohort of women sex workers in Vancouver, Canada (An Evaluation of Sex Workers' Health Access). Multivariable logistic regression analyses, using generalized estimating equations (GEE), were employed to longitudinally investigate correlates of institutional barriers to care over a 44-month follow-up period (January 2010-August 2013). RESULTS: In total, 723 sex workers were included, contributing to 2506 observations. Over the study period, 509 (70.4%) women reported one or more institutional barriers to care. The most commonly reported institutional barriers to care were long wait times (54.6%), limited hours of operation (36.5%), and perceived disrespect by health care providers (26.1%). In multivariable GEE analyses, recent partner- (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.46, % 95% Confidence Interval [CI] 1.10-1.94), workplace- (AOR = 1.31, 95% CI 1.05-1.63), and community-level violence (AOR = 1.41, 95% CI 1.04-1.92), as well as other markers of vulnerability, such as self-identification as a gender/sexual minority (AOR = 1.32, 95% CI 1.03-1.69), a mental illness diagnosis (AOR = 1.66, 95% CI 1.34-2.06), and lack of provincial health insurance card (AOR = 3.47, 95% CI 1.59-7.57) emerged as independent correlates of institutional barriers to health services. DISCUSSION: Despite Canada's UHC, women sex workers in Vancouver face high prevalence of institutional barriers to care, with highest burden among most marginalized women. These findings underscore the need to explore new models of care, alongside broader policy changes to fulfill sex workers' health and human rights.
26925253	Decreased use of glucocorticoids in biological-experienced patients with rheumatoid arthritis who initiated intravenous abatacept: results from the 2-year ACTION study.	INTRODUCTION: Prolonged glucocorticoid use may increase the risk of adverse safety outcomes, including cardiovascular events. The European League Against Rheumatism and the Canadian Rheumatology Association advise tapering glucocorticoid dose as rapidly as clinically feasible. There is a paucity of published data on RA that adequately describe concomitant treatment patterns. METHODS: ACTION (AbataCepT In rOutiNe clinical practice) is a non-interventional cohort study of patients from Europe and Canada that investigated the long-term retention of intravenous abatacept in clinical practice. We assessed concomitant glucocorticoids in patients with established RA who had participated in ACTION and received >/=1 biological agent prior to abatacept initiation. RESULTS: The analysis included 1009 patients. Glucocorticoids were prescribed at abatacept initiation in 734 (72.7%) patients at a median 7.5 mg/day dose (n=692). Of the patients who remained on abatacept at 24 months, 40.7% were able to decrease their dose of glucocorticoids, including 26.9% who decreased their dose from >5 mg/day to </=5 mg/day. CONCLUSION: Reduction and/or cessation of glucocorticoid therapy is possible with intravenous abatacept in clinical practice.
27171471	Evaluating the Utility of Single-Locus DNA Barcoding for the Identification of Ribbon Worms (Phylum Nemertea).	Whereas many nemerteans (ribbon worms; phylum Nemertea) can be identified from external characters if observed alive, many are still problematic. When it comes to preserved specimens (as in e.g. marine inventories), there is a particular need for specimen identifier alternatives. Here, we evaluate the utility of COI (cytochrome c oxidase subunit I) as a single-locus barcoding gene. We sequenced, data mined, and compared gene fragments of COI for 915 individuals representing 161 unique taxonomic labels for 71 genera, and subjected different constellations of these to both distance-based and character-based DNA barcoding approaches, as well as species delimitation analyses. We searched for the presence or absence of a barcoding gap at different taxonomic levels (phylum, subclass, family and genus) in an attempt to understand at what level a putative barcoding gap presents itself. This was performed both using the taxonomic labels as species predictors and using objectively inferred species boundaries recovered from our species delimitation analyses. Our data suggest that COI works as a species identifier for most groups within the phylum, but also that COI data are obscured by misidentifications in sequence databases. Further, our results suggest that the number of predicted species within the dataset is (in some cases substantially) higher than the number of unique taxonomic labels-this highlights the presence of several cryptic lineages within well-established taxa and underscores the urgency of an updated taxonomic backbone for the phylum.
26986421	Convection-driven kinematic dynamos at low Rossby and magnetic Prandtl numbers: Single mode solutions.	The onset of dynamo action is investigated within the context of a newly developed low Rossby, low magnetic Prandtl number, convection-driven dynamo model. This multiscale model represents an asymptotically exact form of an alpha^{2} mean field dynamo model in which the small-scale convection is represented explicitly by finite amplitude, single mode solutions. Both steady and oscillatory convection are considered for a variety of horizontal planforms. The kinetic helicity is observed to be a monotonically increasing function of the Rayleigh number. As a result, very small magnetic Prandtl number dynamos can be found for sufficiently large Rayleigh numbers. All dynamos are found to be oscillatory with an oscillation frequency that increases as the strength of the convection is increased and the magnetic Prandtl number is reduced. Kinematic dynamo action is strongly controlled by the profile of the helicity; single mode solutions which exhibit boundary layer behavior in the helicity show a decrease in the efficiency of dynamo action due to the enhancement of magnetic diffusion in the boundary layer regions. For a given value of the Rayleigh number, lower magnetic Prandtl number dynamos are excited for the case of oscillatory convection in comparison to steady convection. With regard to planetary dynamos, these results suggest that the low magnetic Prandtl number dynamos typical of liquid metals are more easily driven by thermal convection than by compositional convection.
28018388	Coronatine Inhibits Stomatal Closure through Guard Cell-Specific Inhibition of NADPH Oxidase-Dependent ROS Production.	Microbes trigger stomatal closure through microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs). The bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato (Pst) synthesizes the polyketide toxin coronatine, which inhibits stomatal closure by MAMPs and by the hormone abscisic acid (ABA). The mechanism by which coronatine, a jasmonic acid-isoleucine analog, achieves this effect is not completely clear. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are essential second messengers in stomatal immunity, therefore we investigated the possible effect of coronatine on their production. We found that coronatine inhibits NADPH oxidase-dependent ROS production induced by ABA, and by the flagellin-derived peptide flg22. This toxin also inhibited NADPH oxidase-dependent stomatal closure induced by darkness, however, it failed to prevent stomatal closure by exogenously applied H2O2 or by salicylic acid, which induces ROS production through peroxidases. Contrary to what was observed on stomata, coronatine did not affect the oxidative burst induced by flg22 in leaf disks. Additionally, we observed that in NADPH oxidase mutants atrbohd and atrbohd/f, as well as in guard cell ABA responsive but flg22 insensitive mutants mpk3, mpk6, npr1-3, and lecrk-VI.2-1, the inhibition of ABA stomatal responses by both coronatine and the NADPH oxidase inhibitor diphenylene iodonium was markedly reduced. Interestingly, coronatine still impaired ABA-induced ROS synthesis in mpk3, mpk6, npr1-3, and lecrk-VI.2-1, suggesting a possible feedback regulation of ROS on other guard cell ABA signaling elements in these mutants. Altogether our results show that inhibition of NADPH oxidase-dependent ROS synthesis in guard cells plays an important role during endophytic colonization by Pst through stomata.
