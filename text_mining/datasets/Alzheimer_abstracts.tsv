28422821	How the cognitive reserve interacts with beta-amyloid deposition in mitigating FDG metabolism: An observational study.	This observational study had the aim to assess the interaction between cognitive reserve (CR) and cerebrospinal fluid beta-amyloid1-42 (Abeta1-42) in modulating brain [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) metabolism in patients with moderate Alzheimer disease (AD).Twenty-seven patients with probable AD and 25 neurological normal subjects (NNS) entered the study. All participants had an FDG-PET scan, and AD patients also received a lumbar puncture to measure Abeta1-42, 181p-tau, and Tau concentrations. Based on years of formal education, AD patients were classified as highly educated-AD (years of formal education >5) or less educated-AD (years of formal education <5). By using a voxel-wise approach, we first investigated differences in the cerebral glucose uptake between AD and NNS, then we assessed the interaction between level of education (a proxy of CR) and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers on FDG-PET metabolism in the patient groups.Significantly lower glucose uptake was observed in the posterior cingulate gyrus, in the precuneus, in the inferior and medial temporal gyrus, and in the inferior parietal lobule of AD patients compared with NNS. A significant interaction was found between CR and Abeta1-42 values on brain metabolism in the inferior and medial temporal gyrus bilaterally.The AD patients with higher CR level and marked signs of neuropathology showed glucose hypometabolism in regions typically targeted by AD pathology. This finding supports the hypothesis that CR partially compensates for the effect of Abeta plaques on cognitive impairment, helps in patients' clinical staging, and opens new possibilities for the development of nonpharmacological interventions.
28421897	Negative Bias in the Perception and Memory of Emotional Information in Alzheimer Disease.	BACKGROUND: There is some controversy about the ability of patients with Alzheimer disease (AD) to experience and remember emotional stimuli. This study aims to assess the emotional experience of patients with AD and the existence of emotional enhancement of memory. We also investigated the influence of affective state on these processes. METHODS: Sixty pictures from the International Affective Picture System were administered to 106 participants (72 patients with AD and 54 controls). Participants performed immediate free recall and recognition tasks. Positive and Negative Affect Schedule was used to assess the participants' current affect. RESULTS: Patients identified the valence of unpleasant pictures better than of others pictures and experienced them as more arousing. Patients and controls recalled and recognized higher number of emotional pictures than of neutral ones. Patients discriminated better the unpleasant pictures. A mood congruent effect was observed on emotional experience but not on memory. Positive affect was associated with better immediate recall and with a more liberal response bias. CONCLUSION: Patients with AD can identify the emotional content of the stimuli, especially of the unpleasant ones, and the emotional enhancement of memory is preserved. Affective state does not explain the differences in the processing and memory of emotional items between patients and controls.
28421896	Anosognosia and Its Relation to Psychiatric Symptoms in Early-Onset Alzheimer Disease.	BACKGROUND: We investigated differences in the prevalence of anosognosia and neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPSs) characteristics according to disease severity in patients with early-onset Alzheimer disease (EOAD). METHODS: We recruited 616 patients with EOAD. We subdivided participants into 2 groups based on the presence or absence of anosognosia and then again by Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scale. We compared the differences in the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) scores according to anosognosia and disease severity. RESULTS: The percentage of patients with anosognosia in each CDR group steadily increased as the CDR rating increased (CDR 0.5 8.6% vs CDR 1 13.6% vs CDR 2 26.2%). The NPI total score was significantly higher in patients with anosognosia in the CDR 0.5 and 1 groups; by contrast, it had no association in the CDR 2 group. Frontal lobe functions were associated with anosognosia only in the CDR 0.5 and 1 groups. After stratification by CDR, in the CDR 0.5 group, the prevalence of agitation ( P = .040) and appetite ( P = .013) was significantly higher in patients with anosognosia. In the CDR 1 group, patients with anosognosia had a significantly higher prevalence of delusions ( P = .032), hallucinations ( P = .048), and sleep disturbances ( P = .047). In the CDR 2 group, we found no statistical difference in the frequency of symptoms between patients with and without anosognosia. CONCLUSION: These results confirm that the prevalence of anosognosia as well as the individual NPS and cognitive functions associated with it differ according to EOAD severity.
28413778	Family history and APOE4 risk for Alzheimer's disease impact the neural correlates of episodic memory by early midlife.	Episodic memory impairment is a consistent, pronounced deficit in pre-clinical stages of late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD). Individuals with risk factors for AD exhibit altered brain function several decades prior to the onset of AD-related symptoms. In the current event-related fMRI study of spatial context memory we tested the hypothesis that middle-aged adults (MA; 40-58 yrs) with a family history of late onset AD (MA+ FH), or a combined + FH and apolipoprotein E epsilon4 allele risk factors for AD (MA+ FH + APOE4), will exhibit differences in encoding and retrieval-related brain activity, compared to - FH - APOE4 MA controls. We also hypothesized that the two at-risk MA groups will exhibit distinct patterns of correlation between brain activity and memory performance, compared to controls. To test these hypotheses we conducted multivariate task, and behavior, partial least squares analysis of fMRI data obtained during successful context encoding and retrieval. Our results indicate that even though there were no significant group differences in context memory performance, there were significant differences in brain activity and brain-behavior correlations involving the hippocampus, inferior parietal cortex, cingulate, and precuneus cortex in MA with AD risk factors, compared to controls. In addition, we observed that brain activity and brain-behavior correlations in anterior-medial PFC and in ventral visual cortex differentiated the two MA risk groups from each other, and from MAcontrols. Our results indicate that functional differences in episodic memory-related regions are present by early midlife in adults with + FH and + APOE-4 risk factors for late onset AD, compared to middle-aged controls.
28413716	Data-driven regions of interest for longitudinal change in three variants of frontotemporal lobar degeneration.	INTRODUCTION: Longitudinal imaging of neurodegenerative disorders is a potentially powerful biomarker for use in clinical trials. In Alzheimer's disease, studies have demonstrated that empirically derived regions of interest (ROIs) can provide more reliable measurement of disease progression compared with anatomically defined ROIs. METHODS: We set out to derive ROIs with optimal effect size for quantifying longitudinal change in a hypothetical clinical trial by comparing atrophy rates in 44 patients with behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD), 30 with the semantic variant primary progressive aphasia (svPPA), and 26 with the nonfluent variant PPA (nfvPPA) to atrophy in 97 cognitively healthy controls. RESULTS: The regions identified for each variant were generally what would be expected from prior studies of frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). Sample size estimates for detecting a 40% reduction in annual rate of ROI atrophy varied substantially across groups, being 103 per arm in bvFTD, 31 in nfvPPA, and 10 in svPPA, but in all groups were less than those estimated for a priori ROIs and clinical measures. The variability in location of peak regions of atrophy across individuals was highest in bvFTD and lowest in svPPA, likely relating to the differences in effect size. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that, while cross-validated maps of change can improve sensitivity to change in FTLD compared with a priori regions, the reliability of these maps differs considerably across syndromes. Future studies can utilize these maps to design clinical trials, and should try to identify factors accounting for the variability in patterns of atrophy across individuals, particularly those with bvFTD.
28413709	Awareness, apathy, and depression in Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment.	INTRODUCTION: Results from studies on awareness disorders in Alzheimer's disease (AD) are controversial because the methodologies, the "objects" of awareness, and the patients' pathologic stage all vary. Our study aimed to compare scores and correlates of awareness according to the stage of the disease and the assessment method. METHODS: We compared 20 mild AD patients to 20 mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients, using the Patient Competency Rating Scale (PCRS; patient vs. caregiver report) and the Self-Consciousness Scale (rating scale). All patients underwent cognitive, psycho-affective and behavioral assessments (global cognition, executive functions, episodic memory, anxiety-depression, and apathy measures). RESULTS: Groups were matched for age, education, and gender. They were comparable on the depression, anxiety, apathy and awareness scales (ps > .05), and differed for all cognitive variables (p < .05). Using the median split approach, greater apathy and lower depression were associated with poorer awareness on the Self-Consciousness Scale (respectively: odds ratio [OR] = 4.8, p = .03; OR = 4.84, p = .04), and the PCRS (only apathy: OR = 9.3, p = .003). Greater apathy plus lower depression were associated with poorer awareness in both scales (PCRS: OR = 40.5, p = .005; Self-consciousness scale: OR = 28, p = .012). CONCLUSION: These results evidence comparable awareness between AD and MCI patients. The correlates were more affective and behavioral than cognitive, independently from assessment method.
28413194	Dual role of cellular prion protein in normal host and Alzheimer's disease.	Using PrPC-knockout cell lines, it has been shown that the inhibition of apoptosis through STI1 is mediated by PrPC-dependent SOD activation. Antioxidant PrPC may contribute to suppression of inflammasome activation. PrPC is functionally involved in copper metabolism, signal transduction, neuroprotection, and cell maturation. Recently several reports have shown that PrPC participates in trans-membrane signaling processes associated with hematopoietic stem cell replication and neuronal differentiation. In another role, PrPC also tends to function as a neurotoxic protein. Abeta oligomer, which is associated with neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease (AD), has also been reported to act as a ligand of PrPC. However, the physiological role of PrPC as an Abeta42-binding protein is not clear. Actually, PrPC is critical in Abeta42-mediated autophagy in neurons. PrPC shows a beneficial role in lipid rafts to promote autophagy. Further search for PrPC-interaction molecules using Prnp-/- mice and various types of Prnp-/- cell lines under various conditions may elucidate other important PrPC important functions.
28410662	Lewy Body Disorders.	Dementia syndromes associated with Lewy bodies are subdivided into dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), an underdiagnosed cause of dementia in the elderly, and Parkinson disease with dementia (PDD), cognitive impairment appearing in people diagnosed with Parkinson disease. Their neuropathologic substrates are the widespread distribution of aggregates of the protein alpha-synuclein in neurons in cortical brain regions, accompanied by variable Alzheimer pathology. Clinical features of DLB and PDD include distinctive changes in cognition, behavior, movement, sleep, and autonomic function. Diagnostic criteria for DLB and PDD incorporate these features. Current treatment options for DLB and PDD are symptomatic.
28410660	Late-Onset Alzheimer Disease.	The oldest-old represent the fastest growing segment of society, and the risk of developing dementia continues to increase with advancing age into the 9th and 10th decades of life. The most common form of dementia in the oldest-old is Alzheimer disease (AD), although there are often mixed pathologies contributing to dementia in addition to amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. Diagnosing AD in the oldest-old is challenging due to cognitive and physical changes associated with aging. Treatment remains supportive, with current approved medications able to provide modest symptomatic benefit but unable to slow the progression of disease.
28410659	Early-Onset Alzheimer Disease.	Early-onset Alzheimer disease (EOAD), with onset in individuals younger than 65 years, although overshadowed by the more common late-onset AD (LOAD), differs significantly from LOAD. EOAD comprises approximately 5% of AD and is associated with delays in diagnosis, aggressive course, and age-related psychosocial needs. One source of confusion is that a substantial percentage of EOAD are phenotypic variants that differ from the usual memory-disordered presentation of typical AD. The management of EOAD is similar to that for LOAD, but special emphasis should be placed on targeting the specific cognitive areas involved and more age-appropriate psychosocial support and education.
28410658	The Role of Neuroimaging in the Assessment of the Cognitively Impaired Elderly.	This article reviews the current diagnostic tools that are available for structural, functional, and molecular imaging of the brain, summarizing some of the key findings that have been reported in individuals diagnosed with Alzheimer disease, mild cognitive impairment, prodromal AD, or other prevalent dementias. Given recent advances in the development of amyloid PET tracers, current guidelines for the use of amyloid PET imaging in patients with cognitive complaints are reviewed. In addition, data addressing the potential value of amyloid PET imaging in the clinical setting are highlighted.
28410655	Tau Spread, Apolipoprotein E, Inflammation, and More: Rapidly Evolving Basic Science in Alzheimer Disease.	To date, Alzheimer disease drug candidates have produced negative results in human trials, and progress in moving new targets out of the laboratory and into trials has been slow. However, based on 3 decades of previous work, there is reason to hope that amyloid-based and other novel therapies will move at a faster pace toward successful clinical trials. This article highlights selected preclinical research topics that are rapidly advancing in the laboratory.
28410654	Update on Alzheimer's and the Dementias: Introduction.	Though the numbers of dementia cases are rising worldwide, there is evidence that incidence rates are decreasing. We now know that the neuropathological changes of Alzheimer's disease (AD) precede overt clinical signs by 15 to 20 years and we have biochemical and imaging markers that enable us to identify them. The genetic complexity of AD suggests it is not a single entity but rather represents a group of related diseases. The amyloid cascade hypothesis has led to the development of putative disease-modifying interventions but these have not yet been demonstrated to be substantively effective and additional approaches are warranted.
28409032	Distinct Pattern of Microgliosis in the Olfactory Bulb of Neurodegenerative Proteinopathies.	The olfactory bulb (OB) shows early neuropathological hallmarks in numerous neurodegenerative diseases, for example, in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). The glomerular and granular cell layer of the OB is characterized by preserved cellular plasticity in the adult brain. In turn, alterations of this cellular plasticity are related to neuroinflammation such as microglia activation, implicated in the pathogenesis of AD and PD, as well as frontotemporal lobe degeneration (FTLD). To determine microglia proliferation and activation we analyzed ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1 (Iba1) expressing microglia in the glomerular and granular cell layer, and the olfactory tract of the OB from patients with AD, PD dementia/dementia with Lewy bodies (PDD/DLB), and FTLD compared to age-matched controls. The number of Iba1 and CD68 positive microglia associated with enlarged amoeboid microglia was increased particularly in AD, to a lesser extent in FTLD and PDD/DLB as well, while the proportion of proliferating microglia was not altered. In addition, cells expressing the immature neuronal marker polysialylated neural cell adhesion molecule (PSA-NCAM) were increased in the glomerular layer of PDD/DLB and FTLD cases only. These findings provide novel and detailed insights into differential levels of microglia activation in the OB of neurodegenerative diseases.
28406978	Combined assessment of serum folate and hemoglobin as biomarkers of brain amyloid beta accumulation.	A relationship between Alzheimer's disease (AD) and folate has been reported. Amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) is currently one of the most reliable biomarkers for AD. We investigated the correlation between serum folate levels and amyloid imaging to clarify whether serum folate could be a biomarker for AD. We also examined the usefulness of a combined assessment of serum folate levels and red blood cell hemoglobin content. Apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene polymorphisms were also assessed. Serum folate levels and hemoglobin content were evaluated by receiver operating characteristic analysis for their diagnostic capability as AD biomarkers relating to brain amyloid beta accumulation. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) for serum folate was 0.136 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.000-0.312; p = 0.016). The AUC for hemoglobin content was 0.848 (95% CI: 0.661-1.000; p = 0.021). Therefore, the folate deficiency with low folate levels or the non-anaemia with high hemoglobin content levels were found to have a high probability of also testing positive for amyloid. Furthermore, eight patients were found to be folate deficiency and non-anaemia, those who were consist of 7 amyloid positive patients (87.5%), and only one of the amyloid negative patients (12.5%). These results suggest that a deficiency of serum folate and high hemoglobin levels may reflect an increased risk of amyloid beta accumulation in the brain. Additionally, we demonstrated that these biomarkers could enhance the effectiveness of APOE as an AD biomarker. This study reveals that the combined assessment of serum folate levels and red blood cell hemoglobin content may be a useful biomarker for amyloid beta accumulation in the brain. We also found that the combination of serum folate levels and hemoglobin content is a more specific and sensitive blood biomarker for AD than APOE or folate alone. These findings may be used to support clinical diagnosis of AD using a simple blood test.
28403222	Comorbidity and dementia: A nationwide survey in Taiwan.	BACKGROUND: Comorbid medical diseases are highly prevalent in the geriatric population, imposing hardship on healthcare services for demented individuals. Dementia also complicates clinical care for other co-existing medical conditions. This study investigated the comorbidities associated with dementia in the elderly population aged 65 years and over in Taiwan. METHODS: We conducted a nationwide, population-based, cross-sectional survey; participants were selected by computerized random sampling from all 19 Taiwan counties between December 2011 and March 2013. After exclusion of incomplete or erroneous data, 8,456 subjects were enrolled. Of them, 6,183 were cognitively normal (control group), 1,576 had mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 697 had dementia. We collected information about types of comorbidities (i.e., vascular risk factors, lung diseases, liver diseases, gastrointestinal diseases, and cancers), Charlson comorbidity index score, and demographic variables to compare subjects with normal cognition, MCI, and dementia. RESULTS: Regardless of the cognitive condition, over 60% of the individuals in each group had at least one comorbid disease. The proportion of subjects possessing at least three comorbidities was higher in those with cognitive impairment (MCI 20.9%, dementia 27.3%) than in control group (15%). Hypertension and diabetes mellitus were the most common comorbidities. The mean number of comorbidities and Charlson comorbidity index score were greater in MCI and dementia groups than in control group. Logistic regression demonstrated that the comorbidities significantly associated with MCI and dementia were cerebrovascular disease (OR 3.35, CI 2.62-4.28), cirrhosis (OR 3.29, CI 1.29-8.41), asthma (OR 1.56, CI 1.07-2.27), and diabetes mellitus (OR 1.24, CI 1.07-1.44). CONCLUSION: Multiple medical comorbid diseases are common in older adults, especially in those with cognitive impairment. Cerebrovascular disease, cirrhosis, asthma, and diabetes mellitus are important contributors to cognitive deterioration in the elderly. Efforts to lower cumulative medical burden in the geriatric population may benefit cognitive function.
28396874	Frequency Specific Effects of ApoE epsilon4 Allele on Resting-State Networks in Nondemented Elders.	We applied resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine the Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) epsilon4 allele effects on functional connectivity of the default mode network (DMN) and the salience network (SN). Considering the frequency specific effects of functional connectivity, we decomposed the brain network time courses into two bands: 0.01-0.027 Hz and 0.027-0.08 Hz. All scans were acquired by the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroscience Initiative (ADNI). Thirty-two nondemented subjects were divided into two groups based on the presence (n = 16) or absence (n = 16) of the ApoE epsilon4 allele. We explored the frequency specific effects of ApoE epsilon4 allele on the default mode network (DMN) and the salience network (SN) functional connectivity. Compared to epsilon4 noncarriers, the DMN functional connectivity of epsilon4 carriers was significantly decreased while the SN functional connectivity of epsilon4 carriers was significantly increased. Many functional connectivities showed significant differences at the lower frequency band of 0.01-0.027 Hz or the higher frequency band of 0.027-0.08 Hz instead of the typical range of 0.01-0.08 Hz. The results indicated a frequency dependent effect of resting-state signals when investigating RSNs functional connectivity.
28396328	Risk of pneumonia associated with incident benzodiazepine use among community-dwelling adults with Alzheimer disease.	BACKGROUND: Knowledge regarding whether benzodiazepines and similarly acting non-benzodiazepines (Z-drugs) are associated with an increased risk of pneumonia among older adults is lacking. We sought to investigate this association among community-dwelling adults with Alzheimer disease, a condition in which both sedative/hypnotic use and pneumonia are common. METHODS: We obtained data on all community-dwelling adults with a recent diagnosis of Alzheimer disease in Finland (2005-2011) from the Medication use and Alzheimer disease (MEDALZ) cohort, which incorporates national registry data on prescriptions, reimbursement, hospital discharges and causes of death. Incident users of benzodiazepines and Z-drugs were identified using a 1-year washout period and matched with nonusers using propensity scores. The association with hospital admission or death due to pneumonia was analyzed with the Cox proportional hazards model and adjusted for use of other psychotropic drugs in a time-dependent manner. RESULTS: Among 49 484 eligible participants with Alzheimer disease, 5232 taking benzodiazepines and 3269 taking Z-drugs were matched 1:1 with those not taking these drugs. Collectively, use of benzodiazepines and Z-drugs was associated with an increased risk of pneumonia (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 1.22, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.05-1.42). When analyzed separately, benzodiazepine use was significantly associated with an increased risk of pneumonia (adjusted HR 1.28, 95% CI 1.07-1.54), whereas Z-drug use was not (adjusted HR 1.10, 95% CI 0.84-1.44). The risk of pneumonia was greatest within the first 30 days of benzodiazepine use (HR 2.09, 95% CI 1.26-3.48). INTERPRETATION: Benzodiazepine use was associated with an increased risk of pneumonia among patients with Alzheimer disease. Risk of pneumonia should be considered when weighing the benefits and risks of benzodiazepines in this population.
28386764	Roles of tau protein in health and disease.	Tau is well established as a microtubule-associated protein in neurons. However, under pathological conditions, aberrant assembly of tau into insoluble aggregates is accompanied by synaptic dysfunction and neural cell death in a range of neurodegenerative disorders, collectively referred to as tauopathies. Recent advances in our understanding of the multiple functions and different locations of tau inside and outside neurons have revealed novel insights into its importance in a diverse range of molecular pathways including cell signalling, synaptic plasticity, and regulation of genomic stability. The present review describes the physiological and pathophysiological properties of tau and how these relate to its distribution and functions in neurons. We highlight the post-translational modifications of tau, which are pivotal in defining and modulating tau localisation and its roles in health and disease. We include discussion of other pathologically relevant changes in tau, including mutation and aggregation, and how these aspects impinge on the propensity of tau to propagate, and potentially drive neuronal loss, in diseased brain. Finally, we describe the cascade of pathological events that may be driven by tau dysfunction, including impaired axonal transport, alterations in synapse and mitochondrial function, activation of the unfolded protein response and defective protein degradation. It is important to fully understand the range of neuronal functions attributed to tau, since this will provide vital information on its involvement in the development and pathogenesis of disease. Such knowledge will enable determination of which critical molecular pathways should be targeted by potential therapeutic agents developed for the treatment of tauopathies.
28386548	Role of Gasotransmitters in Oxidative Stresses, Neuroinflammation, and Neuronal Repair.	To date, three main gasotransmitters, that is, hydrogen sulfide (H2S), carbon monoxide (CO), and nitric oxide (NO), have been discovered to play major bodily physiological roles. These gasotransmitters have multiple functional roles in the body including physiologic and pathologic functions with respect to the cellular or tissue quantities of these gases. Gasotransmitters were originally known to have only detrimental and noxious effects in the body but that notion has much changed with years; vast studies demonstrated that these gasotransmitters are precisely involved in the normal physiological functioning of the body. From neuromodulation, oxidative stress subjugation, and cardiovascular tone regulation to immunomodulation, these gases perform critical roles, which, should they deviate from the norm, can trigger the genesis of a number of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). The purpose of this review is to discuss at great length physical and chemical properties and physiological actions of H2S, NO, and CO as well as shedding light on recently researched molecular targets. We particularly put emphasis on the roles in neuronal inflammation and neurodegeneration and neuronal repair.
28360418	Not just amyloid: physiological functions of the amyloid precursor protein family.	Amyloid precursor protein (APP) gives rise to the amyloid-beta peptide and thus has a key role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease. By contrast, the physiological functions of APP and the closely related APP-like proteins (APLPs) remain less well understood. Studying these physiological functions has been challenging and has required a careful long-term strategy, including the analysis of different App-knockout and Aplp-knockout mice. In this Review, we summarize these findings, focusing on the in vivo roles of APP family members and their processing products for CNS development, synapse formation and function, brain injury and neuroprotection, as well as ageing. In addition, we discuss the implications of APP physiology for therapeutic approaches.
28359749	Effect of long-term omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acid supplementation with or without multidomain intervention on cognitive function in elderly adults with memory complaints (MAPT): a randomised, placebo-controlled trial.	BACKGROUND: No large trials have been done to investigate the efficacy of an intervention combining a specific compound and several lifestyle interventions compared with placebo for the prevention of cognitive decline. We tested the effect of omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acid supplementation and a multidomain intervention (physical activity, cognitive training, and nutritional advice), alone or in combination, compared with placebo, on cognitive decline. METHODS: The Multidomain Alzheimer Preventive Trial was a 3-year, multicentre, randomised, placebo-controlled superiority trial with four parallel groups at 13 memory centres in France and Monaco. Participants were non-demented, aged 70 years or older, and community-dwelling, and had either relayed a spontaneous memory complaint to their physician, limitations in one instrumental activity of daily living, or slow gait speed. They were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1) to either the multidomain intervention (43 group sessions integrating cognitive training, physical activity, and nutrition, and three preventive consultations) plus omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (ie, two capsules a day providing a total daily dose of 800 mg docosahexaenoic acid and 225 mg eicosapentaenoic acid), the multidomain intervention plus placebo, omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids alone, or placebo alone. A computer-generated randomisation procedure was used to stratify patients by centre. All participants and study staff were blinded to polyunsaturated fatty acid or placebo assignment, but were unblinded to the multidomain intervention component. Assessment of cognitive outcomes was done by independent neuropsychologists blinded to group assignment. The primary outcome was change from baseline to 36 months on a composite Z score combining four cognitive tests (free and total recall of the Free and Cued Selective Reminding test, ten Mini-Mental State Examination orientation items, Digit Symbol Substitution Test, and Category Naming Test) in the modified intention-to-treat population. The trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT00672685). FINDINGS: 1680 participants were enrolled and randomly allocated between May 30, 2008, and Feb 24, 2011. In the modified intention-to-treat population (n=1525), there were no significant differences in 3-year cognitive decline between any of the three intervention groups and the placebo group. Between-group differences compared with placebo were 0.093 (95% CI 0.001 to 0.184; adjusted p=0.142) for the combined intervention group, 0.079 (-0.012 to 0.170; 0.179) for the multidomain intervention plus placebo group, and 0.011 (-0.081 to 0.103; 0.812) for the omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids group. 146 (36%) participants in the multidomain plus polyunsaturated fatty acids group, 142 (34%) in the multidomain plus placebo group, 134 (33%) in the polyunsaturated fatty acids group, and 133 (32%) in the placebo group had at least one serious emerging adverse event. Four treatment-related deaths were recorded (two in the multidomain plus placebo group and two in the placebo group). The interventions did not raise any safety concerns and there were no differences between groups in serious or other adverse events. INTERPRETATION: The multidomain intervention and polyunsaturated fatty acids, either alone or in combination, had no significant effects on cognitive decline over 3 years in elderly people with memory complaints. An effective multidomain intervention strategy to prevent or delay cognitive impairment and the target population remain to be determined, particularly in real-world settings.

28351199	Pharmacological Management of Psychiatric Symptoms in Frontotemporal Dementia: A Systematic Review.	Psychiatric symptoms in patients with frontotemporal dementia (FTD) are highly prevalent and may complicate clinical management of these patients. Purpose of the present article is to present and discuss available data about the pharmacological treatment of psychiatric symptoms in patients with FTD. A research in the main database sources has been conducted to obtain an overview of the pharmacological management of psychiatric symptoms in patients with FTD. The search strategy included the following terms-"FTD and psychiatry," "FTD and behavioural disturbances," and "FTD and treatment". Pathophysiology of psychiatric symptoms in FTD is different from other types of dementia. Although drugs for Alzheimer disease appear to be ineffective for the treatment of psychiatric symptoms of FTD, preliminary evidence supports a possible usefulness of serotonergic antidepressants for these patients. Data are too scanty to draw definitive conclusions, but antidepressant treatment, particularly with serotonergic compounds, may improve psychiatric symptoms in patients with FTD. Large observational studies are needed to confirm this preliminary evidence, and a lot of effort and collaboration between neurologists and psychiatrists will be definitely crucial for future research of effective treatments for FTD.
28351177	Direct and indirect cost of managing alzheimer's disease and related dementias in the United States.	INTRODUCTION: Care of individuals with Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) poses special challenges. As the disease progresses, individuals with ADRD require increasing levels of medical care, caregiver support, and long-term care which can lead to substantial economic burden. Areas covered: In this expert review, we synthesized findings from studies of costs of ADRD in the United States that were published between January 2006 and February 2017, highlighted major sources of variation in costs, identified knowledge gaps and briefly outlined directions for future research and implications for policy and program planning. Expert commentary: A consistent finding of all studies comparing individuals with and without ADRD is that the average medical, non-medical, and indirect costs of individuals with ADRD are higher than those without ADRD, despite the differences in the methods of identifying ADRD, duration of the study, payer type and settings of study population. The economic burden of ADRD may be underestimated because many components such as direct non-medical costs for home safety modifications and adult day care services and indirect costs due to the adverse impact of ADRD on caregivers' health and productivity are not included in cost estimates.
28348458	Vascular Cognitive Impairment through the Looking Glass of Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation.	In the last years, there has been a significant growth in the literature exploiting transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) with the aim at gaining further insights into the electrophysiological and neurochemical basis underlying vascular cognitive impairment (VCI). Overall, TMS points at enhanced brain cortical excitability and synaptic plasticity in VCI, especially in patients with overt dementia, and neurophysiological changes seem to correlate with disease process and progress. These findings have been interpreted as part of a glutamate-mediated compensatory effect in response to vascular lesions. Although a single TMS parameter owns low specificity, a panel of measures can support the VCI diagnosis, predict progression, and possibly identify early markers of "brain at risk" for future dementia, thus making VCI a potentially preventable cause of both vascular and degenerative dementia in late life. Moreover, TMS can be also exploited to select and evaluate the responders to specific drugs, as well as to become an innovative rehabilitative tool in the attempt to restore impaired neural plasticity. The present review provides a perspective of the different TMS techniques by further understanding the cortical electrophysiology and the role of distinctive neurotransmission pathways and networks involved in the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of VCI and its subtypes.
28342649	The prognosis of dementia with Lewy bodies.	Dementia with Lewy bodies is the second most common form of neurodegenerative dementia, yet scarce evidence is available about its prognosis and natural history, which are crucial to inform clinical practice and research. Patients with dementia with Lewy bodies might have a less favourable prognosis, with accelerated cognitive decline, shorter lifespan, and increased admission to residential care than patients with Alzheimer's disease. Health-care costs and, importantly, caregiver burden, are also reported to be higher in dementia with Lewy bodies than in Alzheimer's disease. It is probable that causative factors for this less favourable prognosis are the increased prevalence and early emergence of neuropsychiatric symptoms in patients with dementia with Lewy bodies, and the challenge of accurate diagnosis. Evidence concerning quality of life and hospital admission rates is limited, despite their clinical and economic relevance.
28341999	Immunological memory to hyperphosphorylated tau in asymptomatic individuals.	Several reports have described the presence of antibodies against Alzheimer's disease-associated hyperphosphorylated forms of tau in serum of healthy individuals. To characterize the specificities that can be found, we interrogated peripheral IgG+ memory B cells from asymptomatic blood donors for reactivity to a panel of phosphorylated tau peptides using a single-cell screening assay. Antibody sequences were recovered, cloned, and expressed as full-length IgGs. In total, 52 somatically mutated tau-binding antibodies were identified, corresponding to 35 unique clonal families. Forty-one of these antibodies recognize epitopes in the proline-rich and C-terminal domains, and binding of 26 of these antibodies is strictly phosphorylation dependent. Thirteen antibodies showed inhibitory activity in a P301S lysate seeded in vitro tau aggregation assay. Two such antibodies, CBTAU-7.1 and CBTAU-22.1, which bind to the proline-rich and C-terminal regions of tau, respectively, were characterized in more detail. CBTAU-7.1 recognizes an epitope that is similar to that of murine anti-PHF antibody AT8, but has different phospho requirements. Both CBTAU-7.1 and CBTAU-22.1 detect pathological tau deposits in post-mortem brain tissue. CBTAU-7.1 reveals a similar IHC distribution pattern as AT8, immunostaining (pre)tangles, threads, and neuritic plaques. CBTAU-22.1 shows selective detection of neurofibrillary changes by IHC. Taken together, these results suggest the presence of an ongoing antigen-driven immune response against tau in healthy individuals. The wide range of specificities to tau suggests that the human immune repertoire may contain antibodies that can serve as biomarkers or be exploited for therapy.
28336296	Serotonin and dopamine transporter PET changes in the premotor phase of LRRK2 parkinsonism: cross-sectional studies.	BACKGROUND: People with Parkinson's disease can show premotor neurochemical changes in the dopaminergic and non-dopaminergic systems. Using PET, we assessed whether dopaminergic and serotonin transporter changes are similar in LRRK2 mutation carriers with Parkinson's disease and individuals with sporadic Parkinson's disease, and whether LRRK2 mutation carriers without motor symptoms show PET changes. METHODS: We did two cross-sectional PET studies at the Pacific Parkinson's Research Centre in Vancouver, BC, Canada. We included LRRK2 mutation carriers with or without manifest Parkinson's disease, people with sporadic Parkinson's disease, and age-matched healthy controls, all aged 18 years or older. People with Parkinson's disease were diagnosed by a neurologist with movement disorder training, in accordance with the UK Parkinson's Disease Society Brain Bank criteria. LRRK2 carrier status was confirmed by bidirectional Sanger sequencing. In the first study, LRRK2 mutation carriers with or without manifest Parkinson's disease who were referred for investigation between July, 1999, and January, 2012, were scanned with PET tracers for the membrane dopamine transporter, and dopamine synthesis and storage (18F-6-fluoro-L-dopa; 18F-FDOPA). We compared findings with those in people with sporadic Parkinson's disease and age-matched healthy controls. In the second study, distinct groups of LRRK2 mutation carriers, individuals with sporadic Parkinson's disease, and age-matched healthy controls seen from November, 2012, to May, 2016, were studied with tracers for the serotonin transporter and vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2). Striatal dopamine transporter binding, VMAT2 binding, 18F-FDOPA uptake, and serotonin transporter binding in multiple brain regions were compared by ANCOVA, adjusted for age. FINDINGS: Between January, 1997, and January, 2012, we obtained data for our first study from 40 LRRK2 mutation carriers, 63 individuals with sporadic Parkinson's disease, and 35 healthy controls. We identified significant group differences in striatal dopamine transporter binding (all age ranges in caudate and putamen, p<0.0001) and 18F-FDOPA uptake (in caudate: age </=50 years, p=0.0002; all other age ranges, p<0.0001; in putamen: all age ranges, p<0.0001). LRRK2 mutation carriers with manifest Parkinson's disease (n=15) had reduced striatal dopamine transporter binding and 18F-FDOPA uptake, comparable with amounts seen in individuals with sporadic Parkinson's disease of similar duration. LRRK2 mutation carriers without manifest Parkinson's disease (n=25) had greater 18F-FDOPA uptake and dopamine transporter binding than did individuals with sporadic Parkinson's disease, with 18F-FDOPA uptake comparable with controls and dopamine transporter binding lower than in controls. Between November, 2012, and May, 2016, we obtained data for our second study from 16 LRRK2 mutation carriers, 13 individuals with sporadic Parkinson's disease, and nine healthy controls. Nine LRRK2 mutation carriers without manifest Parkinson's disease had significantly elevated serotonin transporter binding in the hypothalamus (compared with controls, individuals with LRRK2 Parkinson's disease, and people with sporadic Parkinson's disease, p<0.0001), striatum (compared with people with sporadic Parkinson's disease, p=0.02), and brainstem (compared with LRRK2 mutation carriers with manifest Parkinson's disease, p=0.01), after adjustment for age. Serotonin transporter binding in the cortex did not differ significantly between groups after age adjustment. Striatal VMAT2 binding was reduced in all individuals with manifest Parkinson's disease and reduced asymmetrically in one LRRK2 mutation carrier without manifest disease. INTERPRETATION: Dopaminergic and serotonergic changes progress in a similar fashion in LRRK2 mutation carriers with manifest Parkinson's disease and individuals with sporadic Parkinson's disease, but LRRK2 mutation carriers without manifest Parkinson's disease show increased serotonin transporter binding in the striatum, brainstem, and hypothalamus, possibly reflecting compensatory changes in serotonergic innervation preceding the motor onset of Parkinson's disease. Increased serotonergic innervation might contribute to clinical differences in LRRK2 Parkinson's disease, including the emergence of non-motor symptoms and, potentially, differences in the long-term response to levodopa.

28335021	MRI-visible perivascular space location is associated with Alzheimer's disease independently of amyloid burden.	Perivascular spaces that are visible on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are a neuroimaging marker of cerebral small vessel disease. Their location may relate to the type of underlying small vessel pathology: those in the white matter centrum semi-ovale have been associated with cerebral amyloid angiopathy, while those in the basal ganglia have been associated with deep perforating artery arteriolosclerosis. As cerebral amyloid angiopathy is an almost invariable pathological finding in Alzheimer's disease, we hypothesized that MRI-visible perivascular spaces in the centrum semi-ovale would be associated with a clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease, whereas those in the basal ganglia would be associated with subcortical vascular cognitive impairment. We also hypothesized that MRI-visible perivascular spaces in the centrum semi-ovale would be associated with brain amyloid burden, as detected by amyloid positron emission tomography using 11C-Pittsburgh B compound (PiB-PET). Two hundred and twenty-six patients (Alzheimer's disease n = 110; subcortical vascular cognitive impairment n = 116) with standardized MRI and PiB-PET imaging were included. MRI-visible perivascular spaces were rated using a validated 4-point visual rating scale, and then categorized by severity ('none/mild', 'moderate' or 'frequent/severe'). Univariable and multivariable regression analyses were performed. Those with Alzheimer's disease-related cognitive impairment were younger, more likely to have a positive PiB-PET scan and carry at least one apolipoprotein E varepsilon4 allele; those with subcortical vascular cognitive impairment were more likely to have hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidaemia, prior stroke, lacunes, deep microbleeds, and carry the apolipoprotein E varepsilon3 allele. In adjusted analyses, the severity of MRI-visible perivascular spaces in the centrum semi-ovale was independently associated with clinically diagnosed Alzheimer's disease (frequent/severe grade odds ratio 6.26, 95% confidence interval 1.66-23.58; P = 0.017, compared with none/mild grade), whereas the severity of MRI-visible perivascular spaces in the basal ganglia was associated with clinically diagnosed subcortical vascular cognitive impairment and negatively predicted Alzheimer's disease (frequent/severe grade odds ratio 0.03, 95% confidence interval 0.00-0.44; P = 0.009, compared with none/mild grade). MRI-visible perivascular space severity in either location did not predict PiB-PET. These findings provide further evidence that the anatomical distribution of MRI-visible perivascular spaces may reflect the underlying cerebral small vessel disease. Using MRI-visible perivascular space location and severity together with other imaging markers may improve the diagnostic value of neuroimaging in memory clinic populations, in particular in differentiating between clinically diagnosed Alzheimer's and subcortical vascular cognitive impairment.
28334978	Therapeutic window of dopamine D2/3 receptor occupancy to treat psychosis in Alzheimer's disease.	See Caravaggio and Graff-Guerrero (doi:10.1093/awx023) for a scientific commentary on this article.Antipsychotic drugs, originally developed to treat schizophrenia, are used to treat psychosis, agitation and aggression in Alzheimer's disease. In the absence of dopamine D2/3 receptor occupancy data to inform antipsychotic prescribing for psychosis in Alzheimer's disease, the mechanisms underpinning antipsychotic efficacy and side effects are poorly understood. This study used a population approach to investigate the relationship between amisulpride blood concentration and central D2/3 occupancy in older people with Alzheimer's disease by combining: (i) pharmacokinetic data (280 venous samples) from a phase I single (50 mg) dose study in healthy older people (n = 20, 65-79 years); (ii) pharmacokinetic, 18F-fallypride D2/3 receptor imaging and clinical outcome data on patients with Alzheimer's disease who were prescribed amisulpride (25-75 mg daily) to treat psychosis as part of an open study (n = 28; 69-92 years; 41 blood samples, five pretreatment scans, 19 post-treatment scans); and (iii) 18F-fallypride imaging of an antipsychotic free Alzheimer's disease control group (n = 10, 78-92 years), to provide additional pretreatment data. Non-linear mixed effects modelling was used to describe pharmacokinetic-occupancy curves in caudate, putamen and thalamus. Model outputs were used to estimate threshold steady state blood concentration and occupancy required to elicit a clinically relevant response (>25% reduction in scores on delusions, hallucinations and agitation domains of the Neuropsychiatric Inventory) and extrapyramidal side effects (Simpson Angus Scale scores > 3). Average steady state blood levels were low (71 +/- 30 ng/ml), and associated with high D2/3 occupancies (65 +/- 8%, caudate; 67 +/- 11%, thalamus; 52 +/- 11%, putamen). Antipsychotic clinical response occurred at a threshold concentration of 20 ng/ml and D2/3 occupancies of 43% (caudate), 25% (putamen), 43% (thalamus). Extrapyramidal side effects (n = 7) emerged at a threshold concentration of 60 ng/ml, and D2/3 occupancies of 61% (caudate), 49% (putamen) and 69% (thalamus). This study has established that, as in schizophrenia, there is a therapeutic window of D2/3 receptor occupancy for optimal treatment of psychosis in Alzheimer's disease. We have also shown that occupancies within and beyond this window are achieved at very low amisulpride doses in Alzheimer's disease due to higher than anticipated occupancies for a given blood drug concentration. Our findings support a central pharmacokinetic contribution to antipsychotic sensitivity in Alzheimer's disease and implicate the blood-brain barrier, which controls central drug access. Whether high D2/3 receptor occupancies are primarily accounted for by age- or disease-specific blood-brain barrier disruption is unclear, and this is an important future area of future investigation, as it has implications beyond antipsychotic prescribing.
28334857	Co-cultures with stem cell-derived human sensory neurons reveal regulators of peripheral myelination.	See Saporta and Shy (doi:10.1093/awx048) for a scientific commentary on this article.Effective bidirectional signalling between axons and Schwann cells is essential for both the development and maintenance of peripheral nerve function. We have established conditions by which human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived sensory neurons can be cultured with rat Schwann cells, and have produced for the first time long-term and stable myelinating co-cultures with human neurons. These cultures contain the specialized domains formed by axonal interaction with myelinating Schwann cells, such as clustered voltage-gated sodium channels at the node of Ranvier and Shaker-type potassium channel (Kv1.2) at the juxtaparanode. Expression of type III neuregulin-1 (TIIINRG1) in induced pluripotent stem cell-derived sensory neurons strongly enhances myelination, while conversely pharmacological blockade of the NRG1-ErbB pathway prevents myelination, providing direct evidence for the ability of this pathway to promote the myelination of human sensory axons. The beta-secretase, BACE1 is a protease needed to generate active NRG1 from the full-length form. Due to the fact that it also cleaves amyloid precursor protein, BACE1 is a therapeutic target in Alzheimer's disease, however, consistent with its role in NRG1 processing we find that BACE1 inhibition significantly impairs myelination in our co-culture system. In order to exploit co-cultures to address other clinically relevant problems, they were exposed to anti-disialosyl ganglioside antibodies, including those derived from a patient with a sensory predominant, inflammatory neuropathy with mixed axonal and demyelinating electrophysiology. The co-cultures reveal that both mouse and human disialosyl antibodies target the nodal axolemma, induce acute axonal degeneration in the presence of complement, and impair myelination. The human, neuropathy-associated IgM antibody is also shown to induce complement-independent demyelination. Myelinating co-cultures using human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived sensory neurons thus provide insights into the cellular and molecular specialization of axoglial signalling, how pharmacological agents may promote or impede such signalling and the pathogenic effects of ganglioside antibodies.awx012media15372351982001.
28334843	A152T tau allele causes neurodegeneration that can be ameliorated in a zebrafish model by autophagy induction.	Mutations in the gene encoding tau (MAPT) cause frontotemporal dementia spectrum disorders. A rare tau variant p.A152T was reported as a risk factor for frontotemporal dementia spectrum and Alzheimer's disease in an initial case-control study. Such findings need replication in an independent cohort. We analysed an independent multinational cohort comprising 3100 patients with neurodegenerative disease and 4351 healthy control subjects and found p.A152T associated with significantly higher risk for clinically defined frontotemporal dementia and progressive supranuclear palsy syndrome. To assess the functional and biochemical consequences of this variant, we generated transgenic zebrafish models expressing wild-type or A152T-tau, where A152T caused neurodegeneration and proteasome compromise. Impaired proteasome activity may also enhance accumulation of other proteins associated with this variant. We increased A152T clearance kinetics by both pharmacological and genetic upregulation of autophagy and ameliorated the disease pathology observed in A152T-tau fish. Thus, autophagy-upregulating therapies may be a strategy for the treatment for tauopathies.
28328855	Head-to-head comparison of 11C-PiB and 18F-FC119S for Abeta imaging in healthy subjects, mild cognitive impairment patients, and Alzheimer's disease patients.	As a new beta amyloid (Abeta) positron emission tomography (PET) tracer, F-FC119S has shown higher cortical uptake in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) than that in healthy control subjects without adverse effects in a previous preliminary study. The aim of this study was to compare F-FC119S PET and C-PiB PET in healthy control (HC) subjects, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients, and AD patients.A total of 48 subjects, including 28 HC subjects, 10 MCI patients, and 10 AD patients, underwent static F-FC119S PET (30 minutes after intravenous [i.v.] injection) and C-PiB PET (40 minutes after i.v. injection) on the same day. Both PET images were visually and quantitatively assessed. Standardized uptake value ratios (SUVRs) were calculated for each brain region using the cerebellar cortex as a reference region.None (0%) of the 28 HC subjects and 4 (40%) of 10 MCI patients had positive scans on both PET images. Of the 10 AD patients, 7 (70%) had positive scans on C-PiB PET while 6 (60%) had positive scans on F-FC119S PET. Overall, 47 (98%) of 48 participants showed identical results based on visual analysis. Cortical SUVR of F-FC119S was higher in AD patients (1.38 +/- 0.16), followed by that in MCI patients (1.24 +/- 0.10) and in HC subjects (1.14 +/- 0.05). Compared with C-PiB PET, F-FC119S PET yielded a higher effect size (d = 2.02 vs. 1.67) in AD patients and a slightly lower effect size (d = 1.26 vs. 1.38) in MCI patients. In HC subjects, the nonspecific binding of F-FC119S to white matter (with the frontal cortex-to-white matter SUV ratio of 0.76) was slightly lower than that of C-PiB (ratio of 0.73). There was a significant linear correlation (slope = 0.41, r = 0.78, P < 0.001) between C-PiB and F-FC119S cortical SUVR.We could safely obtain images similar to C-PiB PET imaging Abeta in the brain using F-FC119S PET. Therefore, F-FC119S might be suitable for imaging Abeta deposition.
28320296	Biological Basis for Amyloidogenesis in Alzheimer's Disease.	Certain cellular proteins normally soluble in the living organism under certain conditions form aggregates with a specific cross-beta sheet structure called amyloid. These intra- or extracellular insoluble aggregates (fibers or plaques) are hallmarks of many neurodegenerative pathologies including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease, prion disease, and other progressive neurological diseases that develop in the aging human central nervous system. Amyloid diseases (amyloidoses) are widespread in the elderly human population, a rapidly expanding demographic in many global populations. Increasing age is the most significant risk factor for neurodegenerative diseases associated with amyloid plaques. To date, nearly three dozen different misfolded proteins targeting brain and other organs have been identified in amyloid diseases and AD, the most prevalent neurodegenerative amyloid disease affecting over 15 million people worldwide. Here we (i) highlight the latest data on mechanisms of amyloid formation and further discuss a hypothesis on the amyloid cascade as a primary mechanism of AD pathogenesis and (ii) review the evolutionary aspects of amyloidosis, which allow new insight on human-specific mechanisms of dementia development.
28320270	Role of Nerve Growth Factor in Plasticity of Forebrain Cholinergic Neurons.	Neuronal plastic rearrangements during the development and functioning of neurons are largely regulated by trophic factors, including nerve growth factor (NGF). NGF is also involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. In the brain, NGF is produced in structures innervated by basal forebrain cholinergic neurons and retrogradely transported along the axons to the bodies of cholinergic neurons. NGF is essential for normal development and functioning of the basal forebrain; it affects formation of the dendritic tree and modulates the activities of choline acetyltransferase and acetylcholinesterase in basal forebrain neurons. The trophic effect of NGF is mediated through its interactions with TrkA and p75 receptors. Experimental and clinical studies have shown that brain levels of NGF are altered in various pathologies. However, the therapeutic use of NGF is limited by its poor ability to penetrate the blood-brain barrier, adverse side effects that are due to the pleiotropic action of this factor, and the possibility of immune response to NGF. For this reason, the development of gene therapy methods for treating NGF deficit-associated pathologies is of particular interest. Another approach is creation of low molecular weight NGF mimetics that would interact with the corresponding receptors and display high biological activity but be free of the unfavorable effects of NGF.
28315356	The effect of angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor, sacubitril/valsartan, on central nervous system amyloid-beta concentrations and clearance in the cynomolgus monkey.	Sacubitril/valsartan (LCZ696) is the first angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor approved to reduce cardiovascular mortality and hospitalization in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. As neprilysin (NEP) is one of several enzymes known to degrade amyloid-beta (Abeta), there is a theoretical risk of Abeta accumulation following long-term NEP inhibition. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the potential effects of sacubitril/valsartan on central nervous system clearance of Abeta isoforms in cynomolgus monkeys using the sensitive Stable Isotope Labeling Kinetics (SILK)-Abeta methodology. The in vitro selectivity of valsartan, sacubitril, and its active metabolite sacubitrilat was established; sacubitrilat did not inhibit other human Abeta-degrading metalloproteases. In a 2-week study, sacubitril/valsartan (50mg/kg/day) or vehicle was orally administered to female cynomolgus monkeys in conjunction with SILK-Abeta. Despite low cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and brain penetration, CSF exposure to sacubitril was sufficient to inhibit NEP and resulted in an increase in the elimination half-life of Abeta1-42 (65.3%; p=0.026), Abeta1-40 (35.2%; p=0.04) and Abetatotal (29.8%; p=0.04) acutely; this returned to normal as expected with repeated dosing for 15days. CSF concentrations of newly generated Abeta (AUC(0-24h)) indicated elevations in the more aggregable form Abeta1-42 on day 1 (20.4%; p=0.039) and day 15 (34.7%; p=0.0003) and in shorter forms Abeta1-40 (23.4%; p=0.009), Abeta1-38 (64.1%; p=0.0001) and Abetatotal (50.45%; p=0.00002) on day 15. However, there were no elevations in any Abeta isoforms in the brains of these monkeys on day 16. In a second study cynomolgus monkeys were administered sacubitril/valsartan (300mg/kg) or vehicle control for 39weeks; no microscopic brain changes or Abeta deposition, as assessed by immunohistochemical staining, were present. Further clinical studies are planned to address the relevance of these findings.
28314821	Phases of Hyperconnectivity and Hypoconnectivity in the Default Mode and Salience Networks Track with Amyloid and Tau in Clinically Normal Individuals.	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by two hallmark molecular pathologies: amyloid abeta1-42 and Tau neurofibrillary tangles. To date, studies of functional connectivity MRI (fcMRI) in individuals with preclinical AD have relied on associations with in vivo measures of amyloid pathology. With the recent advent of in vivo Tau-PET tracers it is now possible to extend investigations on fcMRI in a sample of cognitively normal elderly humans to regional measures of Tau. We modeled fcMRI measures across four major cortical association networks [default-mode network (DMN), salience network (SAL), dorsal attention network, and frontoparietal control network] as a function of global cortical amyloid [Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB)-PET] and regional Tau (AV1451-PET) in entorhinal, inferior temporal (IT), and inferior parietal cortex. Results showed that the interaction term between PiB and IT AV1451 was significantly associated with connectivity in the DMN and salience. The interaction revealed that amyloid-positive (abeta+) individuals show increased connectivity in the DMN and salience when neocortical Tau levels are low, whereas abeta+ individuals demonstrate decreased connectivity in these networks as a function of elevated Tau-PET signal. This pattern suggests a hyperconnectivity phase followed by a hypoconnectivity phase in the course of preclinical AD.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT This article offers a first look at the relationship between Tau-PET imaging with F18-AV1451 and functional connectivity MRI (fcMRI) in the context of amyloid-PET imaging. The results suggest a nonlinear relationship between fcMRI and both Tau-PET and amyloid-PET imaging. The pattern supports recent conjecture that the AD fcMRI trajectory is characterized by periods of both hyperconnectivity and hypoconnectivity. Furthermore, this nonlinear pattern can account for the sometimes conflicting reports of associations between amyloid and fcMRI in individuals with preclinical Alzheimer's disease.
28314276	Evodiamine Induces Cell Growth Arrest, Apoptosis and Suppresses Tumorigenesis in Human Urothelial Cell Carcinoma Cells.	BACKGROUND/AIM: Evodiamine, an indole alkaloid derived from Evodia rutaecarpa, exhibits pharmacological activities including vasodilatation, analgesia, anti-cardiovascular disease, anti-Alzheimer's disease, anti-inflammation, and anti-tumor activity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study analyzes the anti-tumor effects of evodiamine on cellular growth, tumorigenesis, cell cycle and apoptosis induction of human urothelial cell carcinoma (UCC) cells. RESULTS: The present study showed that evodiamine significantly inhibited the proliferation of UCC cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Also, evodiamine suppressed the tumorigenesis of UCC cells in vitro. Moreover, evodiamine caused G2/M cell-cycle arrest and induced caspase-dependent apoptosis in UCC cells. Finally, we demonstrated that evodiamine exhibits better cytotoxic than 5-fluorouracil, a clinical chemotherapeutic drug, for UCC cells. CONCLUSION: Evodiamine induces growth inhibition, tumorigenesis suppression, cell-cycle arrest, and apoptosis induction in human UCC cells. Therefore, this agent displays a therapeutic potential for treating human UCC cells and is worthy for further investigation.
28300462	An update on the advancements in the treatment of agitation in Alzheimer's disease.	INTRODUCTION: Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) in Alzheimer's disease (AD) are associated with significant negative outcomes for patients and their caregivers. Agitation, one of the most distressing NPS, lacks safe and effective long term interventions. Nonpharmacological interventions are suggested as first-line treatment, but aren't effective for every patient, resulting in pharmacological interventions for some patients, consisting of off-label use of antipsychotics, sedative/hypnotics, anxiolytics, acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, memantine, and antidepressants; where efficacy doesn't necessarily outweigh associated risks. Areas covered: Gains in understanding neurobiological mechanisms underlying agitation have fueled several recent clinical trials. This article updates our review published in 2014. Comprehensive literature search for published articles from January 2014 to December 2016 evaluating pharmacologic interventions for agitation in AD was done. A review of several clinical trials was completed: dextromethorphan/quinidine, scyllo-inositol, brexpiprazole, prazosin, cannabinoids, citalopram, escitalopram, pimavanserin, ITI-007, ORM-12741 show promise in treating agitation. Expert opinion: Neurobiological findings, innovative trials designs, statistical approaches, and preliminary paths for regulatory agency acceptance have re-ignited the area of pharmacological treatment of NPS. Though further research is needed to fully determine the safety, tolerability and efficacy of these treatments, the mission to find effective treatments for neuropsychiatric symptoms such as agitation in patients with dementia is well underway.
28293793	Ultrasensitive and selective detection of 3-repeat tau seeding activity in Pick disease brain and cerebrospinal fluid.	The diagnosis and treatment of diseases involving tau-based pathology such as Alzheimer disease and certain frontotemporal dementias is hampered by the inability to detect pathological forms of tau with sufficient sensitivity, specificity and practicality. In these neurodegenerative diseases, tau accumulates in self-seeding filaments. For example, Pick disease (PiD) is associated with frontotemporal degeneration and accumulation of 3-repeat (3R) tau isoforms in filaments constituting Pick bodies. Exploiting the self-seeding activity of tau deposits, and using a 3R tau fragment as a substrate, we have developed an assay (tau RT-QuIC) that can detect tau seeds in 2 microl aliquots of PiD brain dilutions down to 10-7-10-9. PiD seeding activities were 100-fold higher in frontal and temporal lobes compared to cerebellar cortex. Strikingly, this test was 103- to 105-fold less responsive when seeded with brain containing predominant 4-repeat (4R) tau aggregates from cases of corticobasal degeneration, argyrophilic grain disease, and progressive supranuclear palsy. Alzheimer disease brain, with 3R + 4R tau deposits, also gave much weaker responses than PiD brain. When applied to cerebrospinal fluid samples (5 microl), tau RT-QuIC analyses discriminated PiD from non-PiD cases. These findings demonstrate that abnormal tau aggregates can be detected with high sensitivity and disease-specificity in crude tissue and fluid samples. Accordingly, this tau RT-QuIC assay exemplifies a new approach to diagnosing tauopathies and monitoring therapeutic trials using aggregated tau itself as a biomarker.
28293644	T Lymphocytes and Inflammatory Mediators in the Interplay between Brain and Blood in Alzheimer's Disease: Potential Pools of New Biomarkers.	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disorder and the main cause of dementia. The disease is among the leading medical concerns of the modern world, because only symptomatic therapies are available, and no reliable, easily accessible biomarkers exist for AD detection and monitoring. Therefore extensive research is conducted to elucidate the mechanisms of AD pathogenesis, which seems to be heterogeneous and multifactorial. Recently much attention has been given to the neuroinflammation and activation of glial cells in the AD brain. Reports also highlighted the proinflammatory role of T lymphocytes infiltrating the AD brain. However, in AD molecular and cellular alterations involving T cells and immune mediators occur not only in the brain, but also in the blood and the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Here we review alterations concerning T lymphocytes and related immune mediators in the AD brain, CSF, and blood and the mechanisms by which peripheral T cells cross the blood brain barrier and the blood-CSF barrier. This knowledge is relevant for better AD therapies and for identification of novel biomarkers for improved AD diagnostics in the blood and the CSF. The data will be reviewed with the special emphasis on possibilities for development of AD biomarkers.
28292831	Reduction of Ether-Type Glycerophospholipids, Plasmalogens, by NF-kappaB Signal Leading to Microglial Activation.	Neuroinflammation characterized by activation of glial cells is observed in various neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although the reduction of ether-type glycerophospholipids, plasmalogens (Pls), in the brain is reported in AD patients, the mechanism of the reduction and its impact on neuroinflammation remained elusive. In the present study, we found for the first time that various inflammatory stimuli reduced Pls levels in murine glial cells via NF-kappaB activation, which then downregulated a Pls-synthesizing enzyme, glycerone phosphate O-acyltransferase (Gnpat) through increased c-Myc recruitment onto the Gnpat promoter. We also found that systemic injection of lipopolysaccharide, aging, and chronic restraint stress reduced brain Pls contents that were associated with glial NF-kappaB activation, an increase in c-Myc expression, and downregulation of Gnpat in the mouse cortex and hippocampus. More interestingly, the reduction of Pls contents in the murine cortex itself could increase the activated phenotype of microglial cells and the expression of proinflammatory cytokines, suggesting further acceleration of neuroinflammation by reduction of brain Pls. A similar mechanism of Gnpat reduction was also found in human cell lines, triple-transgenic AD mouse brain, and postmortem human AD brain tissues. These findings suggest a novel mechanism of neuroinflammation that may explain prolonged progression of AD and help us to explore preventive and therapeutic strategies to treat neurodegenerative diseases.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Ether-type glycerophospholipids, plasmalogens (Pls), are reduced in the brain of Alzheimer disease (AD) patients. We found that inflammatory stimuli reduced Pls contents by downregulation of the Pls-synthesizing enzyme glycerone phosphate O-acyltransferase (Gnpat) through NF-kappaB-mediated recruitment of c-Myc onto the Gnpat promoter in both murine and human cell lines. Murine brains after systemic lipopolysaccharide, chronic stress, and aging, as well as triple-transgenic AD mice and postmortem human AD brain tissues all showed increased c-Myc and reduced Gnpat expression. Interestingly, knockdown of Gnpat itself activated NF-kappaB in glial cell lines and microglia in mouse cortex. Our findings provide a new insight into the mechanism of neuroinflammation and may help to develop a novel therapeutic approach for neurodegenerative diseases such as AD.
28286989	A Precision Medicine Initiative for Alzheimer's disease: the road ahead to biomarker-guided integrative disease modeling.	After intense scientific exploration and more than a decade of failed trials, Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains a fatal global epidemic. A traditional research and drug development paradigm continues to target heterogeneous late-stage clinically phenotyped patients with single 'magic bullet' drugs. Here, we propose that it is time for a paradigm shift towards the implementation of precision medicine (PM) for enhanced risk screening, detection, treatment, and prevention of AD. The overarching structure of how PM for AD can be achieved will be provided through the convergence of breakthrough technological advances, including big data science, systems biology, genomic sequencing, blood-based biomarkers, integrated disease modeling and P4 medicine. It is hypothesized that deconstructing AD into multiple genetic and biological subsets existing within this heterogeneous target population will provide an effective PM strategy for treating individual patients with the specific agent(s) that are likely to work best based on the specific individual biological make-up. The Alzheimer's Precision Medicine Initiative (APMI) is an international collaboration of leading interdisciplinary clinicians and scientists devoted towards the implementation of PM in Neurology, Psychiatry and Neuroscience. It is hypothesized that successful realization of PM in AD and other neurodegenerative diseases will result in breakthrough therapies, such as in oncology, with optimized safety profiles, better responder rates and treatment responses, particularly through biomarker-guided early preclinical disease-stage clinical trials.
28284429	Pharmacology of mangostins and their derivatives: A comprehensive review.	Mangosteen (Garcinia mangostana Linn.) is a well-known tropical tree indigenous to Southeast Asia. Its fruit's pericarp abounds with a class of isoprenylated xanthones which are referred as mangostins. Numerous in vitro and in vivo studies have shown that mangostins and their derivatives possess diverse pharmacological activities, such as antibacterial, antifungal, antimalarial, anticarcinogenic, antiatherogenic activities as well as neuroprotective properties in Alzheimer's disease (AD). This review article provides a comprehensive review of the pharmacological activities of mangostins and their derivatives to reveal their promising utilities in the treatment of certain important diseases, mainly focusing on the discussions of the underlying molecular targets/pathways, modes of action, and relevant structure-activity relationships (SARs). Meanwhile, the pharmacokinetics (PK) profile and recent toxicological studies of mangostins are also described for further druggability exploration in the future.
28282924	Autophagy and Microglia: Novel Partners in Neurodegeneration and Aging.	Autophagy is emerging as a core regulator of Central Nervous System (CNS) aging and neurodegeneration. In the brain, it has mostly been studied in neurons, where the delivery of toxic molecules and organelles to the lysosome by autophagy is crucial for neuronal health and survival. However, we propose that the (dys)regulation of autophagy in microglia also affects innate immune functions such as phagocytosis and inflammation, which in turn contribute to the pathophysiology of aging and neurodegenerative diseases. Herein, we first describe the basic concepts of autophagy and its regulation, discuss key aspects for its accurate monitoring at the experimental level, and summarize the evidence linking autophagy impairment to CNS senescence and disease. We focus on acute, chronic, and autoimmunity-mediated neurodegeneration, including ischemia/stroke, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's diseases, and multiple sclerosis. Next, we describe the actual and potential impact of autophagy on microglial phagocytic and inflammatory function. Thus, we provide evidence of how autophagy may affect microglial phagocytosis of apoptotic cells, amyloid-beta, synaptic material, and myelin debris, and regulate the progression of age-associated neurodegenerative diseases. We also discuss data linking autophagy to the regulation of the microglial inflammatory phenotype, which is known to contribute to age-related brain dysfunction. Overall, we update the current knowledge of autophagy and microglia, and highlight as yet unexplored mechanisms whereby autophagy in microglia may contribute to CNS disease and senescence.
28282917	Potential Neuroprotective Effects of Adiponectin in Alzheimer's Disease.	The adipocyte-secreted protein adiponectin (APN) has several protective functions in the peripheral tissues including insulin sensitizing, anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative effects that may benefit neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). In addition, dysregulation of cerebral insulin sensitivities and signaling activities have been implicated in AD. Emerging insights into the mechanistic roles of adiponectin and AD highlight the potential therapeutic effects for AD through insulin signaling.
28282613	Design, synthesis and evaluation of novel feruloyl-donepezil hybrids as potential multitarget drugs for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.	A novel series of feruloyl-donepezil hybrid compounds were designed, synthesized and evaluated as multitarget drug candidates for the treatment of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). In vitro results revealed potent acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitory activity for some of these compounds and all of them showed moderate antioxidant properties. Compounds 12a, 12b and 12c were the most potent AChE inhibitors, highlighting 12a with IC50 = 0.46 muM. In addition, these three most promising compounds exhibited significant in vivo anti-inflammatory activity in the mice paw edema, pleurisy and formalin-induced hyperalgesy models, in vitro metal chelator activity for Cu2+ and Fe2+, and neuroprotection of human neuronal cells against oxidative damage. Molecular docking studies corroborated the in vitro inhibitory mode of interaction of these active compounds on AChE. Based on these data, compound 12a was identified as a novel promising drug prototype candidate for the treatment of AD with innovative structural feature and multitarget effects.
28281392	Lack of association between MTHFR A1298C variant and Alzheimer's disease: evidence from a systematic review and cumulative meta-analysis.	OBJECTIVES: Previous studies have investigated the association between MTHFR A1298C (rs1801131) polymorphism and susceptibility to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Nevertheless, an ultimate conclusion remains obscure. We then executed this meta-analysis to estimate this association more precisely. METHODS: Related studies were systematically searched on PubMed, Embase, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Google scholar, and AlzGene databases. The association was evaluated by reviewing the odds ratios (ORs) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Publication bias, sensitivity analysis, and cumulative meta-analysis were performed to help draw a more definite conclusion. RESULTS: Ten eligible studies were finally enrolled in this meta-analysis. Lack of association between MTHFR A1298C polymorphism and AD risk was observed in five genetic models (allelic: OR = 1.17, 95% CI: 0.88-1.56; homozygous: OR = 1.15, 95% CI: 0.87-1.53; heterozygous: OR = 1.19, 95% CI: 0.76-1.86; dominant: OR = 1.23, 95% CI: 0.81-1.87; recessive: OR = 1.16, 95% CI: 0.89-1.52). The result of cumulative meta-analysis sorted by publication year was also detected a dynamic tendency of no correlation between MTHFR A1298C polymorphism and AD. CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis reveals that MTHFR A1298C polymorphism may not be associated with AD risk.
28279845	Design, synthesis and evaluation of novel ferulic acid-O-alkylamine derivatives as potential multifunctional agents for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.	A series of novel ferulic acid-O-alkylamines derivatives were designed, synthesized, and evaluated as multitarget-directed ligands against Alzheimer's disease. In vitro studies displayed that all the synthesized target compounds showed impressive inhibitory activity against butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE), significant inhibition/disaggregation of self-induced beta-amyloid (Abeta) aggregation and acted as potential antioxidants. Particularly, compound 7f, one of the most potent BuChE inhibitor (IC50 value of 0.021 muM for equine serum BuChE, 8.63 muM for ratBuChE and 0.07 muM for human serum BuChE), was found to be a good acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitor (IC50 = 2.13 muM for electric eel AChE, 1.8 muM for ratAChE and 3.82 muM for human erythrocytes AChE), and the result of molecular docking provided an explanation for its selective BuChE inhibitory activity. Compound 7f also had noteworthy inhibitory effects on self-induced Abeta1-42 aggregation (50.8 +/- 0.82%) and was found to disaggregate self-induced Abeta1-42 aggregation (38.7 +/- 0.65%), which was further elucidated by the transmission electron microscopy. Meanwhile, compound 7f showed the modest antioxidant activity (0.55 eq of Trolox), good protective effect against H2O2-induced PC12 cell injury, with low toxicity. Moreover, compound 7f could cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in vitro. Significantly, compound 7f did not exhibit any acute toxicity in mice at doses up to 1000 mg/kg, and the step-down passive avoidance test showed this compound significantly reversed scopolamine-induced memory deficit in mice. Taken together, the results indicated that compound 7f is a very promising multifunctional agent in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, particularly the advanced stages of AD.
28276775	Cannabinoids therapeutic use: what is our current understanding following the introduction of THC, THC:CBD oromucosal spray and others?	INTRODUCTION: The complexity of the endocannabinoid (eCB) system is becoming better understood and new drivers of eCB signaling are emerging. Modulation of the activities of the eCB system can be therapeutic in a number of diseases. Research into the eCB system has been paralleled by the development of agents that interact with cannabinoid receptors. In this regard it should be remembered that herbal cannabis contains a myriad of active ingredients, and the individual cannabinoids have quite distinct biological activities requiring independent studies. Areas covered: This article reviews the most important current data involving the eCB system in relation to human diseases, to reflect the present (based mainly on the most used prescription cannabinoid medicine, THC/CBD oromucosal spray) and potential future uses of cannabinoid-based therapy. Expert commentary: From the different therapeutic possibilities, THC/CBD oromucosal spray has been in clinical use for approximately five years in numerous countries world-wide for the management of multiple sclerosis (MS)-related moderate to severe resistant spasticity. Clinical trials have confirmed its efficacy and tolerability. Other diseases in which different cannabinoids are currently being investigated include various pain states, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease and epilepsy. The continued characterization of individual cannabinoids in different diseases remains important.
28275161	Astrocytic LRP1 Mediates Brain Abeta Clearance and Impacts Amyloid Deposition.	Accumulation and deposition of amyloid-beta (Abeta) in the brain represent an early and perhaps necessary step in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Abeta accumulation leads to the formation of Abeta aggregates, which may directly and indirectly lead to eventual neurodegeneration. While Abeta production is accelerated in many familial forms of early-onset AD, increasing evidence indicates that impaired clearance of Abeta is more evident in late-onset AD. To uncover the mechanisms underlying impaired Abeta clearance in AD, we examined the role of low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) in astrocytes. Although LRP1 has been shown to play critical roles in brain Abeta metabolism in neurons and vascular mural cells, its role in astrocytes, the most abundant cell type in the brain responsible for maintaining neuronal homeostasis, remains unclear. Here, we show that astrocytic LRP1 plays a critical role in brain Abeta clearance. LRP1 knockdown in primary astrocytes resulted in decreased cellular Abeta uptake and degradation. In addition, silencing of LRP1 in astrocytes led to downregulation of several major Abeta-degrading enzymes, including matrix metalloproteases MMP2, MMP9, and insulin-degrading enzyme. More important, conditional knock-out of the Lrp1 gene in astrocytes in the background of APP/PS1 mice impaired brain Abeta clearance, exacerbated Abeta accumulation, and accelerated amyloid plaque deposition without affecting its production. Together, our results demonstrate that astrocytic LRP1 plays an important role in Abeta metabolism and that restoring LRP1 expression and function in the brain could be an effective strategy to facilitate Abeta clearance and counter amyloid pathology in AD.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Astrocytes represent a major cell type regulating brain homeostasis; however, their roles in brain clearance of amyloid-beta (Abeta) and underlying mechanism are not clear. In this study, we used both cellular models and conditional knock-out mouse models to address the role of a critical Abeta receptor, the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) in astrocytes. We found that LRP1 in astrocytes plays a critical role in brain Abeta clearance by modulating several Abeta-degrading enzymes and cellular degradation pathways. Our results establish a critical role of astrocytic LRP1 in brain Abeta clearance and shed light on specific Abeta clearance pathways that may help to establish new targets for AD prevention and therapy.
28274328	Risk of Alzheimer's disease among users of postmenopausal hormone therapy: A nationwide case-control study.	OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between postmenopausal hormone therapy (HT) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHODS: Medicine and Alzheimer's disease (MEDALZ) is a nested case-control study of the entire Finnish population with clinically verified AD from 2005 to 2011 and up to 4 matched controls per case. This study comprises 230,580 women (46,117 cases and 184,463 controls). Data on HT use from 1995 to 2011 was extracted from the national prescription register using following ATC codes: G03C (estrogen), G03D (progestogen) and G03F (estrogen and progestogen in combination). Only systemic HT (oral or transdermal) was considered. RESULTS: Use of systemic estrogen and progestogen was associated with an increased risk of AD, with ORs (95% CI) of 1.10 (1.06-1.12) and 1.13 (1.10-1.17) respectively, but use of systemic estrogen HT for >10years (OR, 95% CI: 0.91, 0.84-0.99) was protective against AD. Long-term (>10years) use of progestogen and combination HT was not related to AD risk (OR, 95% CI: 1.0, 0.90-1.2). CONCLUSION: Our findings do not suggest HT is an important determinant of AD risk.
28274325	Consent for the diagnosis of preclinical dementia states: A review.	It is now possible to detect the pathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) many years before symptoms and signs otherwise become manifest. Biomarkers of disease include evidence of amyloid and tau in the cerebrospinal fluid and neuroimaging which (for instance) allows amyloid in the brain to be visualized. There is, thus, a preclinical state in which it is possible to identify Alzheimer's pathology long before there is clinical evidence of disease. Much research focuses on this preclinical state because it seems likely that treatments will be more effective before the disease is established. This means that researchers can discover Alzheimer's pathology some years before the person is at risk of developing the condition. In memory clinics, too, people may present with early (prodromal) symptoms which do not yet amount to a dementia syndrome (e.g. mild cognitive impairment), yet biomarker evidence that dementia is highly likely to develop. This is problematic because people will be required to consent to the disclosure of findings that indicate an uncertain risk of an alarming disease. We carried out a scoping review of the issues that arise in connection with a "diagnosis" of preclinical dementia. We identified four themes in the literature: stigma; ethical issues; psychological burden; and language. We shall discuss these themes and related issues that emerge to do with meaning, medicalization, virtues and values. More research is now required to understand these issues in detail, where the emphasis should be on the breadth of research, which must be biopsychosocial and ethical.
28273860	Microglial Function across the Spectrum of Age and Gender.	Microglia constitute the resident immunocompetent cells of the central nervous system. Although much work has focused on their ability to mount an inflammatory response in reaction to pathology, recent studies have delved into their role in maintaining homeostasis in the healthy brain. It is important to note that the function of these cells is more complex than originally conceived, as there is increasing evidence that microglial responses can vary greatly among individuals. Here, this review will describe the changing behavior of microglia from development and birth through to the aged brain. Further, it is not only age that impacts the state of the neuroimmune milieu, as microglia have been shown to play a central role in the sexual differentiation of the brain. Finally, this review will discuss the implications this has for the differences in the incidence of neurodegenerative disorders between males and females, and between the young and old.
28273839	Parkinson's Disease: From Pathogenesis to Pharmacogenomics.	Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most important age-related neurodegenerative disorder in developed societies, after Alzheimer's disease, with a prevalence ranging from 41 per 100,000 in the fourth decade of life to over 1900 per 100,000 in people over 80 years of age. As a movement disorder, the PD phenotype is characterized by rigidity, resting tremor, and bradykinesia. Parkinson's disease -related neurodegeneration is likely to occur several decades before the onset of the motor symptoms. Potential risk factors include environmental toxins, drugs, pesticides, brain microtrauma, focal cerebrovascular damage, and genomic defects. Parkinson's disease neuropathology is characterized by a selective loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta, with widespread involvement of other central nervous system (CNS) structures and peripheral tissues. Pathogenic mechanisms associated with genomic, epigenetic and environmental factors lead to conformational changes and deposits of key proteins due to abnormalities in the ubiquitin-proteasome system together with dysregulation of mitochondrial function and oxidative stress. Conventional pharmacological treatments for PD are dopamine precursors (levodopa, l-DOPA, l-3,4 dihidroxifenilalanina), and other symptomatic treatments including dopamine agonists (amantadine, apomorphine, bromocriptine, cabergoline, lisuride, pergolide, pramipexole, ropinirole, rotigotine), monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (selegiline, rasagiline), and catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitors (entacapone, tolcapone). The chronic administration of antiparkinsonian drugs currently induces the "wearing-off phenomenon", with additional psychomotor and autonomic complications. In order to minimize these clinical complications, novel compounds have been developed. Novel drugs and bioproducts for the treatment of PD should address dopaminergic neuroprotection to reduce premature neurodegeneration in addition to enhancing dopaminergic neurotransmission. Since biochemical changes and therapeutic outcomes are highly dependent upon the genomic profiles of PD patients, personalized treatments should rely on pharmacogenetic procedures to optimize therapeutics.
28272880	Nitration of Tyrosine Residue Y10 of Abeta1-42 Significantly Inhibits Its Aggregation and Cytotoxicity.	Amyloid-beta plaques and oxidative stress are the major hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease. Our previous study found that the heme-Abeta complex enhanced the catalytic effect of free heme on protein tyrosine nitration in the presence of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and nitrite (NO2-). Y10 in Abeta could be the first target to be nitrated. We also found that nitration of Abeta1-40 significantly decreased its aggregation. However, a contrary report showed that nitration of Abeta1-42 by peroxynitrite enhanced its aggregation. To rule out the interference of peroxynitrite caused Abeta oxidation, we used synthetic Y10 nitrated Abeta1-42 to study the influence of Y10 nitration on Abeta1-42's aggregation and cytotoxicity in this study. We confirmed that Abeta1-42 could be nitrated in the presence of H2O2, NO2-, and heme by dot blotting. CD spectroscopy showed an increase of beta-sheet structure of Abeta1-42 and its mutants. The thioflavin T (ThT) flourescence assay revealed that both nitration and chlorination significantly inhibited Abeta1-42 fibril formation. TEM and AFM observations of Abeta peptide aggregates further confirmed that Y10 modification inhibited Abeta1-42 fibril formation. The cytotoxicity study of native and modified Abeta peptides on SH-SY5Y cells revealed that nitration of Abeta1-42 remarkably decreased the neurotoxicity of Abeta1-42. On the basis of these results, we hypothesized that nitration of Y10 may block the pi-pi stacking interactions of Abeta1-42 so that it inhibit its aggregation and neurotoxicity. More importantly, considerable evidence suggested that the levels of nitrite plus nitrate significantly decreased in the brain of AD patients. Thus, we believe that these findings would be helpful for further understanding the function of Abeta in AD.
28271072	Impact of Physical Activity on Cognitive Decline, Dementia, and Its Subtypes: Meta-Analysis of Prospective Studies.	The association of physical activity with dementia and its subtypes has remained controversial in the literature and has continued to be a subject of debate among researchers. A systematic review and meta-analysis of longitudinal studies on the relationship between physical activity and the risk of cognitive decline, all-cause dementia, Alzheimer's disease, and vascular dementia among nondemented subjects are considered. A comprehensive literature search in all available databases was conducted up until April 2016. Well-defined inclusion and exclusion criteria were developed with focus on prospective studies >/= 12 months. The overall sample from all studies is 117410 with the highest follow-up of 28 years. The analyses are performed with both Bayesian parametric and nonparametric models. Our analysis reveals a protective effect for high physical activity on all-cause dementia, odds ratio of 0.79, 95% CI (0.69, 0.88), a higher and better protective effect for Alzheimer's disease, odds ratio of 0.62, 95% CI (0.49, 0.75), cognitive decline odds ratio of 0.67, 95% CI (0.55, 0.78), and a nonprotective effect for vascular dementia of 0.92, 95% CI (0.62, 1.30). Our findings suggest that physical activity is more protective against Alzheimer's disease than it is for all-cause dementia, vascular dementia, and cognitive decline.
28267610	Vitamin B12 offers neuronal cell protection by inhibiting Abeta-42 amyloid fibrillation.	Protein misfolding and aggregation has been implicated as the cause of more than 20 diseases in humans such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's and systemic amyloidosis. Retardation of Abeta- 42 aggregation is considered as a promising and challenging strategy for developing effective therapeutics against Alzheimer's disease. Herein, we demonstrated the effect of vitamin B12 (VB) on inhibiting amyloid formation by employing ThT fluorescence assay, circular dichroism, ANS fluorescence assay, dynamic light scattering measurements and transmission electron microscopy and cell viability assay. Our results demonstrate that vitamin B12 (VB), inhibits Abeta- 42 aggregation in a concentration dependent manner. Further VB also provide protection against amyloid induced cytotoxicity in human neuronal cell line. This study points towards a promising strategy to combat Abeta- 42 aggregation and may have broader implication for targeting other neurological disorders whose distinct hallmark is also amyloid formation.
28265571	Validation of the Italian Version of the Caregiver Abuse Screen among Family Caregivers of Older People with Alzheimer's Disease.	Introduction. Elder abuse is often a hidden phenomenon and, in many cases, screening practices are difficult to implement among older people with dementia. The Caregiver Abuse Screen (CASE) is a useful tool which is administered to family caregivers for detecting their potential abusive behavior. Objectives. To validate the Italian version of the CASE tool in the context of family caregiving of older people with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and to identify risk factors for elder abuse in Italy. Methods. The CASE test was administered to 438 caregivers, recruited in the Up-Tech study. Validity and reliability were evaluated using Spearman's correlation coefficients, principal-component analysis, and Cronbach's alphas. The association between the CASE and other variables potentially associated with elder abuse was also analyzed. Results. The factor analysis suggested the presence of a single factor, with a strong internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0.86). CASE score was strongly correlated with well-known risk factors of abuse. At multivariate level, main factors associated with CASE total score were caregiver burden and AD-related behavioral disturbances. Conclusions. The Italian version of the CASE is a reliable and consistent screening tool for tackling the risk of being or becoming perpetrators of abuse by family caregivers of people with AD.
28265338	The Neuroprotective Effects of Brazilian Green Propolis on Neurodegenerative Damage in Human Neuronal SH-SY5Y Cells.	Oxidative stress and synapse dysfunction are the major neurodegenerative damage correlated to cognitive impairment in Alzheimer's disease (AD). We have found that Brazilian green propolis (propolis) improves the cognitive functions of mild cognitive impairment patients living at high altitude; however, mechanism underlying the effects of propolis is unknown. In the present study, we investigated the effects of propolis on oxidative stress, expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein (Arc), the critical factors of synapse efficacy, using human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. Pretreatment with propolis significantly ameliorated the hydrogen peroxide- (H2O2-) induced cytotoxicity in SH-SY5Y cells. Furthermore, propolis significantly reduced the H2O2-generated reactive oxygen species (ROS) derived from mitochondria and 8-oxo-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-oxo-dG, the DNA oxidative damage marker) but significantly reversed the fibrillar beta-amyloid and IL-1beta-impaired BDNF-induced Arc expression in SH-SY5Y cells. Furthermore, propolis significantly upregulated BDNF mRNA expression in time- and dose-dependent manners. In addition, propolis induced Arc mRNA and protein expression via phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K). These observations strongly suggest that propolis protects from the neurodegenerative damage in neurons through the properties of various antioxidants. The present study provides a potential molecular mechanism of Brazilian green propolis in prevention of cognitive impairment in AD as well as aging.
28261376	Amino Acid Catabolism in Alzheimer's Disease Brain: Friend or Foe?	There is a dire need to discover new targets for Alzheimer's disease (AD) drug development. Decreased neuronal glucose metabolism that occurs in AD brain could play a central role in disease progression. Little is known about the compensatory neuronal changes that occur to attempt to maintain energy homeostasis. In this review using the PubMed literature database, we summarize evidence that amino acid oxidation can temporarily compensate for the decreased glucose metabolism, but eventually altered amino acid and amino acid catabolite levels likely lead to toxicities contributing to AD progression. Because amino acids are involved in so many cellular metabolic and signaling pathways, the effects of altered amino acid metabolism in AD brain are far-reaching. Possible pathological results from changes in the levels of several important amino acids are discussed. Urea cycle function may be induced in endothelial cells of AD patient brains, possibly to remove excess ammonia produced from increased amino acid catabolism. Studying AD from a metabolic perspective provides new insights into AD pathogenesis and may lead to the discovery of dietary metabolite supplements that can partially compensate for alterations of enzymatic function to delay AD or alleviate some of the suffering caused by the disease.
28259590	Efficacy and Blood Plasmalogen Changes by Oral Administration of Plasmalogen in Patients with Mild Alzheimer's Disease and Mild Cognitive Impairment: A Multicenter, Randomized, Double-blind, Placebo-controlled Trial.	BACKGROUND: Plasmalogens (Pls) reportedly decreased in postmortem brain and in the blood of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recently we showed that intraperitoneal administration of Pls improved cognitive function in experimental animals. In the present trial, we tested the efficacy of oral administration of scallop-derived purified Pls with respect to cognitive function and blood Pls changes in patients with mild AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). METHODS: The study was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 24weeks. Participants were 328 patients aged 60 to 85years who had 20 to 27 points in Mini Mental State Examination-Japanese (MMSE-J) score and five or less points in Geriatric Depression Scale-Short Version-Japanese (GDS-S-J). They were randomized to receive either 1mg/day of Pls purified from scallop or placebo. The patients and study physicians were masked to the assignment. The primary outcome was MMSE-J. The secondary outcomes included Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised (WMS-R), GDS-S-J and concentration of phosphatidyl ethanolamine plasmalogens (PlsPE) in erythrocyte membrane and plasma. This trial is registered with the University Hospital Medical Information Network, number UMIN000014945. FINDINGS: Of 328 patients enrolled, 276 patients completed the trial (140 in the treatment group and 136 in the placebo group). In an intention-to-treat analysis including both mild AD (20</=MMSE-J</=23) and MCI (24</=MMSE-J</=27), no significant difference was shown between the treatment and placebo groups in the primary and secondary outcomes, with no severe adverse events in either group. In mild AD patients, WMS-R improved significantly in the treatment group, and the between group difference was nearly significant (P=0.067). In a subgroup analysis of mild AD patients, WMS-R significantly improved among females and those aged below 77years in the treatment group, and the between-group differences were statistically significant in females (P=0.017) and in those aged below 77years (P=0.029). Patients with mild AD showed a significantly greater decrease in plasma PlsPE in the placebo group than in the treatment group. INTERPRETATION: Oral administration of scallop-derived purified Pls may improve cognitive functions of mild AD. FUNDING: The Japanese Plasmalogen Society.
28255200	Optimizing Neuropsychological Assessments for Cognitive, Behavioral, and Functional Impairment Classification: A Machine Learning Study.	Subjects with Alzheimer's disease (AD) show loss of cognitive functions and change in behavioral and functional state affecting the quality of their daily life and that of their families and caregivers. A neuropsychological assessment plays a crucial role in detecting such changes from normal conditions. However, despite the existence of clinical measures that are used to classify and diagnose AD, a large amount of subjectivity continues to exist. Our aim was to assess the potential of machine learning in quantifying this process and optimizing or even reducing the amount of neuropsychological tests used to classify AD patients, also at an early stage of impairment. We investigated the role of twelve state-of-the-art neuropsychological tests in the automatic classification of subjects with none, mild, or severe impairment as measured by the clinical dementia rating (CDR). Data were obtained from the ADNI database. In the groups of measures used as features, we included measures of both cognitive domains and subdomains. Our findings show that some tests are more frequently best predictors for the automatic classification, namely, LM, ADAS-Cog, AVLT, and FAQ, with a major role of the ADAS-Cog measures of delayed and immediate memory and the FAQ measure of financial competency.
28250274	Neprilysin Is Suppressed by Dual-Specificity Tyrosine-Phosphorylation Regulated Kinase 1A (DYRK1A) in Down-Syndrome-Derived Fibroblasts.	Amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) accumulation is a triggering event leading to the Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathological cascade. Almost all familial AD-linked gene mutations increase Abeta production and accelerate the onset of AD. The Swedish mutation of amyloid precursor protein (APP) affects beta-secretase activity and increases Abeta production up to ca. 6-fold in cultured cells; the onset age is around 50. Down syndrome (DS) patients with chromosome 21 trisomy present AD-like pathologies at earlier ages (40s) compared with sporadic AD patients, because APP gene expression is 1.5-fold higher than that in healthy people, thus causing a 1.5-fold increase in Abeta production. However, when comparing the causal relationship of Abeta accumulation with the onset age between the above two populations, early DS pathogenesis does not appear to be accounted for by the increased Abeta production alone. In this study, we found that neprilysin, a major Abeta-degrading enzyme, was downregulated in DS patient-derived fibroblasts, compared with healthy people-derived fibroblasts. Treatment with harmine, an inhibitor of dual-specificity tyrosine phosphorylation-regulated kinase 1A (DYRK1A), which is located in the DS critical region of chromosome 21, and gene knockdown of DYRK1A, upregulated neprilysin in fibroblasts. These results suggest that a decrease in the Abeta catabolic rate may be, at least in part, one of the causes for accelerated AD-like pathogenesis in DS patients if a similar event occurs in the brains, and that neprilysin activity may be regulated directly or indirectly by DYRK1A-mediated phosphorylation. DYRK1A inhibition may be a promising disease-modifying therapy for AD via neprilysin upregulation.
28247064	Genome-wide association study identifies four novel loci associated with Alzheimer's endophenotypes and disease modifiers.	More than 20 genetic loci have been associated with risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD), but reported genome-wide significant loci do not account for all the estimated heritability and provide little information about underlying biological mechanisms. Genetic studies using intermediate quantitative traits such as biomarkers, or endophenotypes, benefit from increased statistical power to identify variants that may not pass the stringent multiple test correction in case-control studies. Endophenotypes also contain additional information helpful for identifying variants and genes associated with other aspects of disease, such as rate of progression or onset, and provide context to interpret the results from genome-wide association studies (GWAS). We conducted GWAS of amyloid beta (Abeta42), tau, and phosphorylated tau (ptau181) levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from 3146 participants across nine studies to identify novel variants associated with AD. Five genome-wide significant loci (two novel) were associated with ptau181, including loci that have also been associated with AD risk or brain-related phenotypes. Two novel loci associated with Abeta42 near GLIS1 on 1p32.3 (beta = -0.059, P = 2.08 x 10-8) and within SERPINB1 on 6p25 (beta = -0.025, P = 1.72 x 10-8) were also associated with AD risk (GLIS1: OR = 1.105, P = 3.43 x 10-2), disease progression (GLIS1: beta = 0.277, P = 1.92 x 10-2), and age at onset (SERPINB1: beta = 0.043, P = 4.62 x 10-3). Bioinformatics indicate that the intronic SERPINB1 variant (rs316341) affects expression of SERPINB1 in various tissues, including the hippocampus, suggesting that SERPINB1 influences AD through an Abeta-associated mechanism. Analyses of known AD risk loci suggest CLU and FERMT2 may influence CSF Abeta42 (P = 0.001 and P = 0.009, respectively) and the INPP5D locus may affect ptau181 levels (P = 0.009); larger studies are necessary to verify these results. Together the findings from this study can be used to inform future AD studies.
28242552	Enzymatic and solid-phase synthesis of new donepezil-based L- and d-glutamic acid derivatives and their pharmacological evaluation in models related to Alzheimer's disease and cerebral ischemia.	Previously, we have described N-Bz-L-Glu[NH-2-(1-benzylpiperidin-4-yl)ethyl]-O-nHex (IQM9.21, L-1) as an interesting multifunctional neuroprotective compound for the potential treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we describe new derivatives and different synthetic routes, such as chemoenzymatic and solid-phase synthesis, aiming to improve the previously described route in solution. The lipase-catalysed amidation of L- and D-Glu diesters with N-benzyl-4-(2-aminoethyl)piperidine has been studied, using Candida antarctica and Mucor miehei lipases. In all cases, the alpha-amidated compound was obtained as the main product, pointing out that regioselectivity was independent of the reacting Glu enantiomer and the nature of the lipase. An efficient solid-phase route has been used to produce new donepezil-based L- and D-Glu derivatives, resulting in good yield. At micromolar concentrations, the new compounds inhibited human cholinesterases and protected neurons against toxic insults related to Alzheimer's disease and cerebral ischemia. The CNS-permeable compounds N-Cbz-L-Glu(OEt)-[NH-2-(1-benzylpiperidin-4-yl)ethyl] (L-3) and L-1 blocked the voltage-dependent calcium channels and L-3 protected rat hippocampal slices against oxygen-glucose deprivation, becoming promising anti-Alzheimer and anti-stroke lead compounds.
28242549	Design, synthesis and evaluation of 2-arylethenyl-N-methylquinolinium derivatives as effective multifunctional agents for Alzheimer's disease treatment.	A series of 2-arylethenyl-N-methylquinolinium derivatives were designed and synthesized based on our previous research of 2-arylethenylquinoline analogues as multifunctional agents for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD) (Eur. J. Med. Chem. 2015, 89, 349-361). The results of in vitro biological activity evaluation, including beta-amyloid (Abeta) aggregation inhibition, cholinesterase inhibition, and antioxidant activity, showed that introduction of N-methyl in quinoline ring significantly improved the anti-AD potential of compounds. The optimal compound, compound a12, dramatically attenuated the cell death of glutamate-induced HT22 cells by preventing the generation of ROS and increasing the level of GSH. Most importantly, intragastric administration of a12*HAc was well tolerated at doses up to 2000 mg/kg and could traverse blood-brain barrier.
28231822	Cilostazol as an add-on therapy for patients with Alzheimer's disease in Taiwan: a case control study.	BACKGROUND: Combination therapy using acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs) and cilostazol is of unknown efficacy for patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHODS: We explored the therapeutic responses by using a case-control study, which was conducted in Taiwan. We enrolled 30 participants with stable AD who were receiving cilostazol (50 mg) twice per day as an add-on therapy combined with AChEIs, and 30 participants as controls who were not receiving cilostazol as an add-on therapy. The therapeutic responses were measured using neuropsychological assessments and analyzed in relation to cilostazol use, apolipoprotein E genotype, and demographic characteristics. Mini-mental state examination (MMSE) and clinical dementia rating sum of boxes (CDR-SB) were administered at the outset of the study and 12 months later. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to estimate the association between the therapeutic response and cilostazol use. RESULTS: For the therapeutic indicator of cognition, Cilostazol use (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 0.17, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.03-0.80), initial CDR-SB score (aOR = 2.06, 95% CI = 1.31-3.72), and initial MMSE score (aOR = 1.41, 95% CI = 1.11-1.90), but not age, sex, education, or ApoE epsilon4 status, were significantly associated with poor therapeutic outcomes. For the therapeutic indicator of global status, no significant association was observed between the covariates and poor therapeutic outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Cilostazol may reduce the decline of cognitive function in stable AD patients when applied as an add-on therapy.
28231054	Alzheimer's disease as an inflammatory disease.	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative condition characterized by the formation of amyloid-beta plaques, aggregated and hyperphosphorylated tau protein, activated microglia and neuronal cell death, ultimately leading to progressive dementia. In this short review, we focus on neuroinflammation in AD. Specifically, we describe the participation of microglia, as well as other factors that may contribute to inflammation, in neurodegeneration.
28225582	Bib Pharma Monopoly: Why Consumers Keep Landing on "Park Place" and How the Game is Rigged.	Now, more than ever before, pharmacologists are contributing medical advances to confront ravaging disease. They are developing drugs to mitigate the effects of Alzheimer's, HIV, multiple sclerosis, and various forms of cancer. To capitalize on the opportunity, brand-name pharmaceutical firms are patenting these drugs, consequently guarding formulas and, with it, profits. Patents grant brand-name firms market exclusivity, which essentially allows them to set their own prices. Even though brand-name firms are investing some of their capital to cultivate new drugs, they also are enjoying gigantic revenue streams, absurd profit margins, and seemingly unfettered control of their respective markets. Consequently, sick patients are unable to afford their medication; high prices are bankrupting consumers in the absence of reasonably-priced generic alternatives. Despite the fact that generic drugs contain identical ingredients, cure the same symptoms, and cost 70% less, brand-name drugs persistently dominate their generic counterparts. Indeed, brand-name firms are improperly preventing generic market entry. Without generic competition, no watchdog exists to curb big pharma's prohibitive prices. Despite the Supreme Court's fleeting fix in FTC v. Actavis, which condemned reverse payment settlements that precluded competition, brand-name firms are employing other tactics predatorily to extend their market exclusivity and charge consumers unaffordable prices. To prevent brand-name abuse and help infirm patients afford their medication, this Comment proposes that courts apply federal antitrust law to brand-name firms that attempt to monopolize a pharmaceutical market through anticompetitive means, particularly by abusing Risk Evaluation & Mitigation Strategies (REMS) and by "product hopping." To combat exclusionary conduct, courts should mirror the "rule of reason" framework set forth in Actavis and apply an "enhanced" version specifically tailored to the pharmaceutical industry, giving stronger credence to generic challengers. In addition to finding brand-name tactics exclusionary, this Comment also proposes that courts adopt a bright-line rule prohibiting brand-name firms from exploiting the "legitimate business" defense to immunize their destructive conduct. The current framework perpetuates abuse and grants brand-name firms ostensibly indefinite monopolies. Analyzing brand-name defensive tactics under federal antitrust law would facilitate generic market entry and consequently moderate drug prices. Even after sacrificing their entire financial portfolios, patients are still unable to afford their medication. This Comment interprets Actavis as prohibiting the "legitimate business" defense and provides a remedy to deserving consumers by preventing REMS abuse and product hopping, fostering generic competition, and tempering excessive drug prices.
28220365	Binding of 11C-Pittsburgh compound-B correlated with white matter injury in hypertensive small vessel disease.	OBJECTIVE: 11C-Pittsburgh compound-B (11C-PIB) positron emission tomography (PET) is used to visualize and quantify amyloid deposition in the brain cortex in pathological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Intense 11C-PIB retention is also observed in the white matter (WM) of both healthy individuals and AD patients. However, the clinical implications of this retention in brain WM have not been clarified. We investigated the relationship between the extent of white matter lesions (WMLs) and the binding potential of 11C-PIB (BPND) in the WM in patients with hypertensive small vessel disease. We further examined the relationship between the extent of WMLs and BPND in WML and in normal-appearing white matter (NAWM). METHODS: Twenty-one hypertensive vasculopathy patients, without AD and major cerebral arterial stenosis and/or occlusion, were enrolled (9 women, 68 +/- 7 years). Regions of WML and NAWM were extracted using magnetization-prepared rapid gradient-echo and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery of magnetic resonance images. Volumes of interest (VOIs) were set in the cortex-subcortex, basal ganglia, and centrum semiovale (CS). BPND in the cortex-subcortex, basal ganglia, CS, WML, and NAWM were estimated on 11C-PIB PET using Logan graphical analysis with cerebellar regions as references. The relationships between WML volume and BPND in each region were examined by linear regression analysis. RESULTS: BPND was higher in the CS and basal ganglia than in the cortex-subcortex regions. WML volume had a significant inverse correlation with BPND in the CS (Slope = -0.0042, R 2 = 0.44, P < 0.01). For intra WM comparison, BPND in NAWM was significantly higher than that in WML. In addition, although there were no correlations between WML volume and BPND in WML, WML volume was significantly correlated inversely with BPND in NAWM (Slope = -0.0017, R 2 = 0.26, P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: 11C-PIB could be a marker of not only cortical amyloid-beta deposition but also WM injury accompanying the development of WMLs in hypertensive small vessel disease.
28219828	Treating cognitive impairment with transcranial low level laser therapy.	This report examines the potential of low level laser therapy (LLLT) to alter brain cell function and neurometabolic pathways using red or near infrared (NIR) wavelengths transcranially for the prevention and treatment of cognitive impairment. Although laser therapy on human tissue has been used for a number of medical conditions since the late 1960s, it is only recently that several clinical studies have shown its value in raising neurometabolic energy levels that can improve cerebral hemodynamics and cognitive abilities in humans. The rationale for this approach, as indicated in this report, is supported by growing evidence that neurodegenerative damage and cognitive impairment during advanced aging is accelerated or triggered by a neuronal energy crisis generated by brain hypoperfusion. We have previously proposed that chronic brain hypoperfusion in the elderly can worsen in the presence of one or more vascular risk factors, including hypertension, cardiac disease, atherosclerosis and diabetes type 2. Although many unanswered questions remain, boosting neurometabolic activity through non-invasive transcranial laser biostimulation of neuronal mitochondria may be a valuable tool in preventing or delaying age-related cognitive decline that can lead to dementia, including its two major subtypes, Alzheimer's and vascular dementia. The technology to achieve significant improvement of cognitive dysfunction using LLLT or variations of this technique is moving fast and may signal a new chapter in the treatment and prevention of neurocognitive disorders.
28218780	MicroRNA-139 modulates Alzheimer's-associated pathogenesis in SAMP8 mice by targeting cannabinoid receptor type 2.	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder, and is the most common type of dementia in the elderly population. Growing evidence indicates that microRNAs (miRNAs) play a crucial role in neuroinflammation associated with AD progression. In this study, we analyzed the expression of microRNA-139 (miR-139) as well as the learning and memory function in AD. We observed that the miR-139 expression was significantly higher in the hippocampus of aged senescence accelerated mouse prone 8 (SAMP8) mice (2.92 +/- 0.13) than in the control mice (1.49 +/- 0.08). Likewise, the overexpression of miR-139 by means of hippocampal injection impaired the hippocampus-dependent learning and memory formation. In contrast, the downregulation of miR-139 in mice improved learning and memory function in the mice. The level of cannabinoid receptor type 2 (CB2), a potential target gene of miR-139, was inversely correlated with the miR-139 expression in primary hippocampal cells. Furthermore, we demonstrated that miR-139 inversely modulated the responses to proinflammatory stimuli. Together, our findings demonstrate that miR-139 exerts a pathogenic effect in AD by modulating CB2-meditated neuroinflammatory processes.
28215757	'In this together' or 'Going it alone': Spousal dyad approaches to Alzheimer's.	Spouses provide the majority of care for individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD). The qualitative literature suggests that couples adopt one of two perspectives in their accounts of AD: a We/Us approach where couples describe experiences as a composite whole or an I/Me approach where couples describe themselves as experiencing the impact of AD separately. Little is known about how these perspectives relate to the individual characteristics of either affected party. This study investigated the experiences of dyads taking both approaches. Eleven spousal dyads were divided into I/Me (n=5) and We/Us (n=6) groupings based on qualitative analyses completed as part of a larger project. Diagnosed individuals were given measures of cognitive and functional ability and caregivers completed anxiety, depression, burden, relationship satisfaction, and positive aspects of caregiving measures. We found no significant differences between groups on patient cognitive or functional ability, or caregiver anxiety, depression, burden, or relationship satisfaction. However, We/Us caregivers expressed more positive aspects of caregiving than I/Me caregivers. These findings suggest the I/Me approach is not associated with differences in variables of patient cognitive status or functional ability or caregiver emotional health, perceived burden, or relationship satisfaction. Caregivers taking a We/Us approach, however, were able to identify more positive aspects of caregiving. This may be related to mutual compassion, a characteristic of the We/Us approach, which may be protective.
28214632	Synthesis of new heterocyclic compounds based on pyrazolopyridine scaffold and evaluation of their neuroprotective potential in MPP+-induced neurodegeneration.	Neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's disease affect millions of people in the world. Thus several new approaches to treat brain disorders are under development. The aim of the present study is to synthesize potential neuroprotective heterocyclic compounds based on pyrazolopyridine derivatives and then to evaluate their effects in MPP+-induced neurodegeneration in human neuroblastoma cell line (SH-SY5Y cells). The effects of the compounds on cell viability were measured by MTT assay and the changes in apoptosis-related proteins including bax, Bcl-2, Bcl-xl and caspase-3 were investigated by western blot technique. Based on the cell viability results obtained by MTT assay, the percentage of neuroprotection-induced by compounds against MPP+-induced neurotoxicity in SH-SY5Y cells was between 20% and 30% at 5 muM concentrations of all synthesized compounds. Moreover, the downregulation in pro-apoptotic proteins including bax and caspase-3 were found following the novel synthesized compounds treatments and these effects were observed in a dose-dependent manner. Our results provide an evidence that these heterocyclic compounds based on pyrazolopyridine derivatives may have a role on dopaminergic neuroprotection via antiapoptotic pathways.
28214529	Role of human GKN1 on APP processing in gastric cancer.	Gastrokine 1 (GKN1) is highly expressed in gastric tissue and is secreted into the stomach but is not expressed in gastric cancer. GKN1 belongs to the BRICHOS domain family and plays a major role in maintaining gastric mucosa integrity. We previously demonstrated that a recombinant human GKN1 protein was able to interact with the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and was endowed with an anti-amyloidogenic property because it inhibited polymerization of the Abeta(1-40) peptide released from APP upon its partial hydrolysis. Here, we report that GKN1 can act as a physiological suppressor of Abeta production in gastric cancer cells. GKN1 blocked the access of gamma-secretase to APP, thereby facilitating the cleavage of APP by alpha- and beta-secretases. GKN1 directly interacted with APP C-terminal fragments, C83 and C99. In addition, it did not affect gamma-secretase activity in gastric cancer cells because it did not alter Notch1 processing. GKN1-mediated inhibition of APP processing might represent a new approach for the prevention and therapy of Alzheimer's disease (AD).
28211253	Comparison of neurotoxicity of different aggregated forms of Abeta40, Abeta42 and Abeta43 in cell cultures.	The abnormal deposition of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides in the brain is the main neuropathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Amyloid deposits are formed by a heterogeneous mixture of Abeta peptides, among which the most studied are Abeta40 and Abeta42. Abeta40 is abundantly produced in the human brain, but the level of Abeta42 is remarkably increased in the brain of AD patients. Aside from Abeta40 and Abeta42, recent data have raised the possibility that Abeta43 peptides may be instrumental in AD pathogenesis. Besides its length, whether the Abeta aggregated form accounts for the neurotoxicity is also particularly controversial. Abeta fibrils are generally considered as key pathogenic substances in AD pathogenesis. Nevertheless, recent data implicated soluble Abeta oligomers as the main cause of synaptic dysfunction and memory loss in AD. To further address this uncertainty, we analyzed the neurotoxicity of different Abeta species and Abeta forms at the cellular level. The results showed that Abeta42 could form oligomers significantly faster than Abeta40 and Abeta43 and Abeta42 oligomers showed the greatest level of neurotoxicity. Regardless of the length of Abeta peptides, Abeta oligomers induced significantly higher cytotoxicity compared with the other two Abeta forms. Surprisingly, the neurotoxicity of fibrils in PC12 cells was only marginally but not significantly stronger than monomers, contrary to previous reports. Altogether, our findings demonstrate the high pathogenicity of Abeta42 among the three Abeta species and support the idea that Abeta42 oligomers contribute to the pathological events leading to neurodegeneration in AD.

28208745	Astrocytic Pathological Calcium Homeostasis and Impaired Vesicle Trafficking in Neurodegeneration.	Although the central nervous system (CNS) consists of highly heterogeneous populations of neurones and glial cells, clustered into diverse anatomical regions with specific functions, there are some conditions, including alertness, awareness and attention that require simultaneous, coordinated and spatially homogeneous activity within a large area of the brain. During such events, the brain, representing only about two percent of body mass, but consuming one fifth of body glucose at rest, needs additional energy to be produced. How simultaneous energy procurement in a relatively extended area of the brain takes place is poorly understood. This mechanism is likely to be impaired in neurodegeneration, for example in Alzheimer's disease, the hallmark of which is brain hypometabolism. Astrocytes, the main neural cell type producing and storing glycogen, a form of energy in the brain, also hold the key to metabolic and homeostatic support in the central nervous system and are impaired in neurodegeneration, contributing to the slow decline of excitation-energy coupling in the brain. Many mechanisms are affected, including cell-to-cell signalling. An important question is how changes in cellular signalling, a process taking place in a rather short time domain, contribute to the neurodegeneration that develops over decades. In this review we focus initially on the slow dynamics of Alzheimer's disease, and on the activity of locus coeruleus, a brainstem nucleus involved in arousal. Subsequently, we overview much faster processes of vesicle traffic and cytosolic calcium dynamics, both of which shape the signalling landscape of astrocyte-neurone communication in health and neurodegeneration.
28202372	Gut microbiota: Implications in Parkinson's disease.	Gut microbiota (GM) can influence various neurological outcomes, like cognition, learning, and memory. Commensal GM modulates brain development and behavior and has been implicated in several neurological disorders like Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, anxiety, stress and much more. A recent study has shown that Parkinson's disease patients suffer from GM dysbiosis, but whether it is a cause or an effect is yet to be understood. In this review, we try to connect the dots between GM and PD pathology using direct and indirect evidence.
28194907	Hematite-Based Photoelectrode Materials for Photoelectrocatalytic Inhibition of Alzheimer's beta-Amyloid Self-Assembly.	A visible light-active, hematite-based photoelectrode platform for suppressing beta-amyloid (Abeta) self-assembly in vitro is reported. Upon illumination of a light-emitting diode with an anodic bias, the hematite photoanode generates reactive radical species, such as superoxide ions and hydroxyl radicals, via photoelectrocatalytic process. According to our analyses, the hematite photoanode exhibited a strong inhibitory effect on Abeta aggregation under visible light illumination and anodic bias. We found that hole-derived radicals played a significant role of oxidizing Abeta peptides, which effectively blocked further aggregation. The efficacy of photoelectrocatalytic inhibition on Abeta aggregation was enhanced by introducing cobalt phosphate (Co-Pi) as a co-catalyst on the hematite photoanode, which facilitated the separation of electron-hole pairs. We verified that both bare and Co-Pi@hematite photoanodes are biocompatible and effective in reducing Abeta aggregation-induced cytotoxicity.
28192749	Ascorbic acid ameliorates behavioural deficits and neuropathological alterations in rat model of Alzheimer's disease.	Exploring the links between neural pathobiology and behavioural deficits in Alzheimer's disease (AD), and investigating substances with known therapeutic advantages over subcellular mechanisms underlying these dysfunctions could advance the development of potent therapeutic molecules for AD treatment. Here we investigated the efficacy of ascorbic acid (AA) in reversing aluminium chloride (AlCl3)-induced behavioural deficits and neurotoxic cascades within prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus of rats. A group of rats administered oral AlCl3 (100mg/kg) daily for 15days showed degenerative changes characterised by significant weight loss, reduced exploratory/working memory, frontal-dependent motor deficits, cognitive decline, memory dysfunction and anxiety during behavioural assessments compared to control. Subsequent analysis showed that oxidative impairment-indicated by depleted superoxide dismutase and lipid peroxidation (related to glutathione-S-transferase activity), cholinergic deficits seen by increased neural acetylcholinesterase (AChE) expression and elevated lactate dehydrogenase underlie behavioural alterations. Furthermore, evidences of proteolysis were seen by reduced Nissl profiles in neuronal axons and dendrites which correspond to apoptotic changes observed in H&E staining of PFC and hippocampal sections. Interestingly, AA (100mg/kg daily for 15days) significantly attenuated behavioural deficits in rats through inhibition of molecular and cellular stressor proteins activated by AlCl3. Our results showed that the primary mechanisms underlying AA therapeutic advantages relates closely with its abilities to scavenge free radicals, prevent membrane lipid peroxidation, modulate neuronal bioenergetics, act as AChE inhibitor and through its anti-proteolytic properties. These findings suggest that supplementing endogenous AA capacity through its pharmacological intake may inhibit progression of AD-related neurodegenerative processes and behavioural alterations.
28189905	New tacrine-derived AChE/BuChE inhibitors: Synthesis and biological evaluation of 5-amino-2-phenyl-4H-pyrano[2,3-b]quinoline-3-carboxylates.	A series of poly-functionalized tacrine-derived compounds namely 5-amino-2-phenyl-4H-pyrano[2,3-b]quinoline-3-carboxylates were designed and synthesized as cholinesterases inhibitors. The in vitro inhibition assay against AChE and BuChE demonstrated that most of compounds had potent AChE inhibitory with reserving potential of BuChE inhibition. Among them, compound 6i bearing a 4-(3-bromophenyl) moiety showed the most potent activity against AChE/BuChE (IC50s values of 0.069 and 1.35 muM, respectively). The anti-AChE activity of 6i was five times more than that of tacrine. The SAR study revealed that chloro/bromo substituent at ortho or meta position of the 4-phenyl ring can improve the anticholinesterase activity.
28188659	Hippocampal subfields at ultra high field MRI: An overview of segmentation and measurement methods.	The hippocampus is one of the most interesting and studied brain regions because of its involvement in memory functions and its vulnerability in pathological conditions, such as neurodegenerative processes. In the recent years, the increasing availability of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scanners that operate at ultra-high field (UHF), that is, with static magnetic field strength >/=7T, has opened new research perspectives. Compared to conventional high-field scanners, these systems can provide new contrasts, increased signal-to-noise ratio and higher spatial resolution, thus they may improve the visualization of very small structures of the brain, such as the hippocampal subfields. Studying the morphometry of the hippocampus is crucial in neuroimaging research because changes in volume and thickness of hippocampal subregions may be relevant in the early assessment of pathological cognitive decline and Alzheimer's Disease (AD). The present review provides an overview of the manual, semi-automated and fully automated methods that allow the assessment of hippocampal subfield morphometry at UHF MRI, focusing on the different hippocampal segmentation produced.

28181118	Brain uptake and safety of Flutemetamol F 18 injection in Japanese subjects with probable Alzheimer's disease, subjects with amnestic mild cognitive impairment and healthy volunteers.	OBJECTIVE: This Phase 2 study assessed the performance of positron emission tomography (PET) brain images made with Flutemetamol F 18 Injection in detecting beta-amyloid neuritic plaques in Japanese subjects. METHODS: Seventy subjects (25 with probable Alzheimer's disease (pAD), 20 with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), and 25 cognitively normal healthy volunteers[HVs]) underwent PET brain imaging after intravenous Flutemetamol F 18 Injection (185 MBq). Images were interpreted as normal or abnormal for neuritic plaque density by each of five non-Japanese and five Japanese readers who were blinded to clinical data. The primary efficacy analysis (based on HV and pAD data) was the agreement of the non-Japanese readers' image interpretations with the clinical diagnosis, resulting in estimates of positive percent agreement (PPA; based on AD subjects; similar to sensitivity) and negative percent agreement (NPA; based on HVs; similar to specificity). Secondary analyses included PPA and NPA for the Japanese readers; inter-reader agreement (IRA); intra-reader reproducibility (IRR); quantitative image interpretations (standardized uptake value ratios [SUVRs]) by diagnostic subgroup; test-retest variability in five pAD subjects; and safety. RESULTS: PPA was 92% for all non-Japanese readers and ranged from 88 to 92% for the Japanese readers. NPA ranged from 96 to 100% for both the non-Japanese readers and the Japanese readers. The majority image interpretations (the interpretations made independently by >/=3 of 5 readers) resulted in PPA values of 92 and 92% and NPA values of 100 and 96% for the non-Japanese and Japanese readers, respectively. IRA and IRR were strong. Composite SUVR values (mean of multiple regional values) allowed clear differentiation between pAD subjects and HVs. Test-retest variability ranged from 1.14 to 2.27%, and test-retest agreement of the blinded visual interpretations was 100% for all readers. Flutemetamol F 18 Injection was generally well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: The detection of brain neuritic plaques in Japanese subjects using [18F]Flutemetamol PET images gave results highly consistent with clinical diagnosis, with non-Japanese and Japanese readers giving similar results. Inter-reader agreement and intra-reader reproducibility were high for both sets of readers. Visual delineation of abnormal and normal scans was corroborated by quantitative assessment, with low test-retest variability. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.gov registration number NCT02813070.
28168012	Nutrition and AGE-ing: Focusing on Alzheimer's Disease.	Recently, the role of food and nutrition in preventing or delaying chronic disability in the elderly population has received great attention. Thanks to their ability to influence biochemical and biological processes, bioactive nutrients are considered modifiable factors capable of preserving a healthy brain status. A diet rich in vitamins and polyphenols and poor in saturated fatty acids has been recommended. In the prospective of a healthy diet, cooking methods should be also considered. In fact, cooking procedures can modify the original dietary content, contributing not only to the loss of healthy nutrients, but also to the formation of toxins, including advanced glycation end products (AGEs). These harmful compounds are adsorbed at intestinal levels and can contribute to the ageing process. The accumulation of AGEs in ageing ("AGE-ing") is further involved in the exacerbation of neurodegenerative and many other chronic diseases. In this review, we discuss food's dual role as both source of bioactive nutrients and reservoir for potential toxic compounds-paying particular attention to the importance of proper nutrition in preventing/delaying Alzheimer's disease. In addition, we focus on the importance of a good education in processing food in order to benefit from the nutritional properties of an optimal diet.
28161090	Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation combined with cognitive training for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.	OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy of a combination of cognitive training (COG) and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), on cognitive performance, locomotor activity, apathy, caregiver burden and dependence of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHODS: A combination of COG and rTMS was performed in 10 patients with AD (NeuroAD procedure) for a period of 5weeks (one session per day, 5days a week), without maintenance sessions. Patients were evaluated at the end of the treatment (D45) and 6months later (M6) by the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), the Alzheimer disease assessment scale - cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog), various neuropsychological tests and clinical scores specific for locomotor activity, apathy, caregiver burden, and dependence, recorded before the study (baseline). RESULTS: The primary endpoint was the improvement of the ADAS-Cog score at D45, which was reached. Six months after the end of the treatment, the ADAS-Cog score returned to baseline value, except for the best responders who remained significantly improved. The other main result was the improvement of apathy and dependence scores at both D45 and M6 for the entire series of patients. No serious adverse events occurred and all patients completed the study. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this open-label study confirm the feasibility of the rTMS-COG procedure in AD patients, and suggest that these patients can benefit from the procedure, in terms of cognitive performances, apathy and dependence, even in the long term. These promising results remain to be confirmed in controlled studies based on a larger population size, which could also help identify the prognostic factors associated with good outcome, in order to optimize patient selection.
28160067	Tau aggregation influences cognition and hippocampal atrophy in the absence of beta-amyloid: a clinico-imaging-pathological study of primary age-related tauopathy (PART).	We investigate whether there is any association between the Braak neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) stage and clinical and MRI features in definite primary age-related tauopathy (PART). We analysed 52 cases with a Braak NFT tangle stage >0 and </=IV, and a Thal phase of 0 (no beta-amyloid present). Twenty-nine (56%) were female. Median age at death was 88 years (IQR 82-92 years). Fifteen (29%) were TDP-positive (75% TDP stage I), 16 (31%) had argyrophilic grain disease and three (6%) had alpha-synuclein-positive Lewy bodies. TDP-43 inclusion when present were rare and predominantly perivascular. Of the 15 with TDP-43, three showed a moderate number of inclusions and also had hippocampal sclerosis, neuronal intranuclear inclusions and fine neurites of the CA1 region of the hippocampus. Four cases (8%) had an apolipoprotein epsilon 4 (APOE4) allele. There was a significant correlation between age at death and Braak NFT stage (r = 0.32, p = 0.02). After accounting for age at clinical examination, there were significant associations between Braak NFT stage, and WAIS-R Block Design and Trail Making Tests A and B, with higher Braak stage associated with poorer performances. Thirty of the 52 cases had completed an antemortem volumetric head MRI. Two separate MRI analyses revealed an association between higher Braak NFT stage and grey matter atrophy in the head of the left hippocampus. There were no significant clinical or radiologic associations with TDP-43. Findings from this study demonstrate that aggregated tau distribution is associated with poorer cognitive performance, as well as atrophy, in the absence of beta-amyloid. These findings support the parcellation of definite PART as a useful construct. The relatively low frequencies of APOE4, TDP-43, Lewy bodies, and hippocampal sclerosis, and the rarity and morphology of TDP-43 lesions are noted contrasts to what is typically observed in Alzheimer's disease of the old.
28154265	Inhibitory Activities of Antioxidant Flavonoids from Tamarix gallica on Amyloid Aggregation Related to Alzheimer's and Type 2 Diabetes Diseases.	The prevention of amyloid aggregation is promising for the treatment of age-related diseases such as Alzheimer's (AD) and type 2 diabetes (T2D). Ten antioxidant flavonoids isolated from the medicinal halophyte Tamarix gallica were tested for their amyloid aggregation inhibition potential. Glucuronosylated flavonoids show relatively strong inhibitory activity of Amyloid beta (Abeta) and human islet amyloid polypeptide (hIAPP) aggregation compared to their aglycone analogs. Structure-activity relationship of the flavonoids suggests that the catechol moiety is important for amyloid aggregation inhibition, while the methylation of the carboxyl group in the glucuronide moiety and of the hydroxyl group in the aglycone flavonoids decreased it.
28153449	A capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry based method for the screening of beta-secretase inhibitors as potential Alzheimer's disease therapeutics.	In this work a novel capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry (CE-MS) based method was developed and validated for the assay of beta-secretase (BACE1) activity as a potential target for Alzheimer's disease (AD) treatment. In contrast with the typically used Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) assays, an unlabelled decapeptide derived from the amyloid precursor protein BACE1 site with the "Swedish mutation" was used as the substrate. The CE usage enabled the enzymatic reaction to be carried out in as small a volume as 100muL in 60min with sufficient yields of proteolytic product, which was subsequently separated in a bare fused silica capillary using 12.5% acetic acid as a background electrolyte and detected by MS. The limits of detection and quantitation were estimated using the signal to noise ratio to be 5nM (S/N=3) and 15nM (S/N=10), respectively, both being well below the working range for kinetic and inhibition studies. Its applicability for the kinetic study of BACE1 was demonstrated using optimized enzyme assay conditions and the estimated kinetic parameter values were confirmed by classic CE-UV analyses. The method was finally used for the main purpose for which it was developed - to screen BACE1 inhibitors as potential AD therapeutics. The resulting kinetic and inhibition parameters values were compared to those published in the literature, which were almost exclusively obtained by FRET based assays. These comparisons brought up several issues that are further discussed below and favour the application of an unlabelled substrate. The proposed CE-MS based method offers a high-throughput capability for new drug development.
28150445	Molecular design and synthesis of novel peptides from amphibians skin acting as inhibitors of cholinesterase enzymes.	Cholinesterases are a family of enzymes that catalyze the hydrolysis of neurotransmitter acetylcholine. There are two types of cholinesterases, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), which differ in their distribution in the body. Currently, cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEI) represent the treatment of choice for Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this paper, we report the synthesis and inhibitory effect on both enzymes of four new peptides structurally related to P1-Hp-1971 (amphibian skin peptide found in our previous work. Sequence: TKPTLLGLPLGAGPAAGPGKR-NH2 ). The bioassay data and cytotoxicity test show that some of the compounds possess a significant AChE and BChE inhibition and no toxic effect. The present work demonstrates that diminution of the size of the original peptide could potentially result in new compounds with significant cholinesterase inhibition activity, although it appears that there is an optimal size for the sequence. We also conducted an exhaustive molecular modeling study to better understand the mechanism of action of these compounds by combining docking techniques with molecular dynamics simulations on BChE. This is the first report about amphibian peptides and the second one of natural peptides with ChE inhibitory activity. Copyright (c) 2017 European Peptide Society and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
28134846	Neurogenic Traditional Chinese Medicine as a Promising Strategy for the Treatment of Alzheimer's Disease.	Hippocampal neurogenesis plays a critical role in the formation of new neurons during learning and memory development. Attenuation of neurogenesis in the brain is one of the primary causes of dementia in Alzheimer's disease (AD), and, conversely, modulating the process of hippocampal neurogenesis benefit patients with AD. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), particularly herbal medicine, has been in use for thousands of years in Asia and many regions of the world for the treatment of cancer, cardiovascular diseases and neurodegenerative diseases. In this review, we summarize the role of neurotrophic factors, signal transducing factors, epigenetic modulators and neurotransmitters in neurogenesis, and we also discuss the functions of several Chinese herbs and their active molecules in activating multiple pathways involved in neurogenesis. TCM herbs target pathways such as Notch, Wnt, Sonic Hedgehog and receptor tyrosine kinase pathway, leading to activation of a signaling cascade that ultimately enhances the transcription of several important genes necessary for neurogenesis. Given these pathway activating effects, the use of TCM herbs could be an effective therapeutic strategy for the treatment of AD.
28132910	B-973, a novel piperazine positive allosteric modulator of the alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor.	The alpha7 (alpha7) nicotinic acetylcholine receptor is a therapeutic target for cognitive disorders. Here we describe 3-(3,4-difluorophenyl)-N-(1-(6-(4-(pyridin-2-yl)piperazin-1-yl)pyrazin-2-yl)ethyl )propanamide (B-973), a novel piperazine-containing molecule that acts as a positive allosteric modulator of the alpha7 receptor. We characterize the action of B-973 on the alpha7 receptor using electrophysiology and radioligand binding. At 0.1mM acetylcholine, 1muM B-973 potentiated peak acetylcholine-induced currents 6-fold relative to maximal acetylcholine (3mM) and slowed channel desensitization, resulting in a 6900-fold increase in charge transfer. The EC50 of B-973 was approximately 0.3muM at acetylcholine concentrations ranging from 0.03 to 3mM. At a concentration of 1muM, B-973 shifted the acetylcholine EC50 of peak currents from 0.30mM in control to 0.007mM. B-973 slowed channel deactivation upon acetylcholine removal (tau=50s) and increased the affinity of the alpha7 agonist [3H]A-585539. In the absence of exogenously added acetylcholine, application of B-973 at concentrations >1muM induced large methyllycaconitine-sensitive currents, suggesting B-973 can function as an Ago-PAM at high concentrations. B-973 will be a useful probe for investigating the biological consequences of increasing alpha7 receptor activity through allosteric modulation.
28129140	Committing to Memory: Memory Prosthetics Show Promise in Helping Those with Neurodegenerative Disorders.	Cell phone chimes, sticky notes, even the proverbial string around a finger-these timehonored external cues help guard against our inevitable memory lapses. But some internal help to the brain itself may be on the way in the form of what's being called memory prosthetics. Once considered to be on the fringes of neuroscience, the idea of adding hardware to the brain to help with memory has gathered steam. In 2014, the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) made a US$30 million investment in memory prosthetic research as part of the Obama administration's Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies initiative. In August 2016, Kernel, a startup based in Los Angeles, California, announced its goal to develop a clinical memory device for those debilitated by neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease.
28128435	Vitamin E for Alzheimer's dementia and mild cognitive impairment.	BACKGROUND: Vitamin E occurs naturally in the diet. It has several biological activities, including functioning as an antioxidant to scavenge toxic free radicals. Evidence that free radicals may contribute to the pathological processes behind cognitive impairment has led to interest in the use of vitamin E supplements to treat mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2000, and previously updated in 2006 and 2012. OBJECTIVES: To assess the efficacy of vitamin E in the treatment of MCI and dementia due to AD. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group (ALOIS), the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS as well as many trials databases and grey literature sources on 22 April 2016 using the terms: "Vitamin E", vitamin-E, alpha-tocopherol. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included all double-blind, randomised trials in which treatment with any dose of vitamin E was compared with placebo in people with AD or MCI. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used standard methodological procedures according to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. We rated the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach. Where appropriate we attempted to contact authors to obtain missing information. MAIN RESULTS: Four trials met the inclusion criteria, but we could only extract outcome data in accordance with our protocol from two trials, one in an AD population (n = 304) and one in an MCI population (n = 516). Both trials had an overall low to unclear risk of bias. It was not possible to pool data across studies owing to a lack of comparable outcome measures.In people with AD, we found no evidence of any clinically important effect of vitamin E on cognition, measured with change from baseline in the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale - Cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog) over six to 48 months (mean difference (MD) -1.81, 95% confidence interval (CI) -3.75 to 0.13, P = 0.07, 1 study, n = 272; moderate quality evidence). There was no evidence of a difference between vitamin E and placebo groups in the risk of experiencing at least one serious adverse event over six to 48 months (risk ratio (RR) 0.86, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.05, P = 0.13, 1 study, n = 304; moderate quality evidence), or in the risk of death (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.34, P = 0.46, 1 study, n = 304; moderate quality evidence). People with AD receiving vitamin E showed less functional decline on the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study/Activities of Daily Living Inventory than people receiving placebo at six to 48 months (mean difference (MD) 3.15, 95% CI 0.07 to 6.23, P = 0.04, 1 study, n = 280; moderate quality evidence). There was no evidence of any clinically important effect on neuropsychiatric symptoms measured with the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (MD -1.47, 95% CI -4.26 to 1.32, P = 0.30, 1 study, n = 280; moderate quality evidence).We found no evidence that vitamin E affected the probability of progression from MCI to probable dementia due to AD over 36 months (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.35, P = 0.81, 1 study, n = 516; moderate quality evidence). Five deaths occurred in each of the vitamin E and placebo groups over the 36 months (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.30 to 3.44, P = 0.99, 1 study, n = 516; moderate quality evidence). We were unable to extract data in accordance with the review protocol for other outcomes. However, the study authors found no evidence that vitamin E differed from placebo in its effect on cognitive function, global severity or activities of daily living . There was also no evidence of a difference between groups in the more commonly reported adverse events. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We found no evidence that the alpha-tocopherol form of vitamin E given to people with MCI prevents progression to dementia, or that it improves cognitive function in people with MCI or dementia due to AD. However, there is moderate quality evidence from a single study that it may slow functional decline in AD. Vitamin E was not associated with an increased risk of serious adverse events or mortality in the trials in this review. These conclusions have changed since the previous update, however they are still based on small numbers of trials and participants and further research is quite likely to affect the results.
28126681	Nose-to-brain delivery of BACE1 siRNA loaded in solid lipid nanoparticles for Alzheimer's therapy.	We designed a delivery system to obtain an efficient and optimal nose-to-brain transport of BACE1 siRNA, potentially useful in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. We selected a cell-penetrating peptide, the short peptide derived from rabies virus glycoprotein known as RVG-9R, to increase the transcellular pathway in neuronal cells. The optimal molar ratio between RVG-9R and BACE1 siRNA was elucidated. The complex between the two was then encapsulated. We propose chitosan-coated and uncoated solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) as a nasal delivery system capable of exploiting both olfactory and trigeminal nerve pathways. The coating process had an effect on the zeta potential, obtaining positively-charged nanoparticles, and on siRNA protection. The positive charge of the coating formulation ensured mucoadhesiveness to the particles and also prolonged residence time in the nasal cavity. We studied the cellular transport of siRNA released from the SLNs using Caco-2 as a model of epithelial-like phenotypes. We found that siRNA permeates the monolayer to a greater extent when released from any of the studied formulations than from bare siRNA, and primarily from chitosan-coated SLNs.
28122766	Cognitive Correlates of Perseverations in Individuals with Memory Impairment.	OBJECTIVE: This study examines which cognitive measure best accounts for perseverations in individuals with memory impairment. METHOD: The sample included 85 individuals, of whom 21 had subjective memory concerns, 27 had mild cognitive impairment, and 37 had Alzheimer's disease. Participants produced responses on a semantic category fluency task and on the ideational fluency (IF) task from the Cambridge Cognitive Examination-Revised. Measures of word finding, working memory, and abstract thinking were also assessed. RESULTS: Significant group differences in percentage of perseverations emerged on both tasks. No cognitive measure accounted for the percentage of perseverations on the semantic fluency task. A measure of abstract thinking was the best predictor of the percentage of perseverations on the IF task, followed by a measure of working memory. CONCLUSIONS: The underlying cognitive mechanisms that lead to perseverations differ across tasks, with perseverations on the IF task reflecting both conceptual deficits and working memory limitations.
28122626	Developing a dementia-specific health state classification system for a new preference-based instrument AD-5D.	BACKGROUND: With an ageing population, the number of people with dementia is rising. The economic impact on the health care system is considerable and new treatment methods and approaches to dementia care must be cost effective. Economic evaluation requires valid patient reported outcome measures, and this study aims to develop a dementia-specific health state classification system based on the Quality of Life for Alzheimer's disease (QOL-AD) instrument (nursing home version). This classification system will subsequently be valued to generate a preference-based measure for use in the economic evaluation of interventions for people with dementia. METHODS: We assessed the dimensionality of the QOL-AD to develop a new classification system. This was done using exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis and further assessment of the structure of the measure to ensure coverage of the key areas of quality of life. Secondly, we used Rasch analysis to test the psychometric performance of the items, and select item(s) to describe each dimension. This was done on 13 items of the QOL-AD (excluding two general health items) using a sample of 284 residents living in long-term care facilities in Australia who had a diagnosis of dementia. RESULTS: A five dimension classification system is proposed resulting from the three factor structure (defined as 'interpersonal environment', 'physical health' and 'self-functioning') derived from the factor analysis and two factors ('memory' and 'mood') from the accompanying review. For the first three dimensions, Rasch analysis selected three questions of the QOL-AD ('living situation', 'physical health', and 'do fun things') with memory and mood questions representing their own dimensions. The resulting classification system (AD-5D) includes many of the health-related quality of life dimensions considered important to people with dementia, including mood, global function and skill in daily living. CONCLUSIONS: The development of the AD-5D classification system is an important step in the future application of the widely used QOL-AD in economic evaluations. Future valuation studies will enable this tool to be used to calculate quality adjusted life years to evaluate treatments and interventions for people diagnosed with mild to moderate dementia.
28122529	Monetary costs of Alzheimer's disease in China: protocol for a cluster-randomised observational study.	BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia. International multilateral cost-of-illness (COI) studies have revealed that the cost of treating this disease is huge, which places a significant burden on patients' families and their healthcare systems. However, no such studies have been conducted in China. This study estimates the monetary costs of patients with AD in mainland China. METHODS: This study planned to start in October 2015 and to finish in March 2016. It covered 30 provincial, municipal, and autonomous regions in mainland China. The sites and research centres in each region were selected randomly. The participating sites include Tier 3 hospitals, psychiatric hospitals, geriatric hospitals, nursing homes, and residences. More than 2500 patients with AD and their caregivers from all of the 81 research centres will be enrolled to fulfil the calculated sample size. The monetary costs of AD, which include direct medical costs, direct non-medical costs, and indirect costs, are being collected using the electronic medical record system and residence health system at each site; face-to-face interviews are being performed when necessary. Descriptive statistics will be used to summarise the patient characteristics and generalised linear models will be developed to calculate the costs. RESULTS: The main findings will include national and per patient annual monetary costs of AD in China. CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first large-scale cluster-randomized observational study to estimate the economic burden of AD in Chinese patients. The methodology used was based on China's current healthcare system and is suitable for the purpose of the study. Because the burden of AD on patients, families, healthcare providers, and society is substantial and increasing, it is important and necessary to understand the economic burden caused by this disease. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Our trial was retrospectively registered on ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02694445 , registered on 02/26/2016.
28116038	The Role of Reactive Oxygen Species in the Pathogenesis of Alzheimer's Disease, Parkinson's Disease, and Huntington's Disease: A Mini Review.	Neurodegenerative diseases affect not only the life quality of aging populations, but also their life spans. All forms of neurodegenerative diseases have a massive impact on the elderly. The major threat of these brain diseases includes progressive loss of memory, Alzheimer's disease (AD), impairments in the movement, Parkinson's disease (PD), and the inability to walk, talk, and think, Huntington's disease (HD). Oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction are highlighted as a central feature of brain degenerative diseases. Oxidative stress, a condition that occurs due to imbalance in oxidant and antioxidant status, has been known to play a vital role in the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases including AD, PD, and HD. A large number of studies have utilized oxidative stress biomarkers to investigate the severity of these neurodegenerative diseases and medications are available, but these only treat the symptoms. In traditional medicine, a large number of medicinal plants have been used to treat the symptoms of these neurodegenerative diseases. Extensive studies scientifically validated the beneficial effect of natural products against neurodegenerative diseases using suitable animal models. This short review focuses the role of oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of AD, PD, and HD and the protective efficacy of natural products against these diseases.
28115436	A patient's experience in dementia care: Using the "lived experience" to improve care.	OBJECTIVE: To give FPs an understanding of the "lived experience" of dementia via the words of a person with dementia (PWD)- Faye Forbes, a 64-year-old Anglican priest with Alzheimer disease who provides her perspectives on living with dementia-and to use these thoughts to improve care and outcomes. SOURCES OF INFORMATION: Ovid MEDLINE was searched from January 2005 to February 2015 using subject headings for dementia, caregiver, perspectives, and quality of health care. Articles geared toward FPs were selected. Relevant review articles and original research articles were used when appropriate and if they were applicable to PWDs and their caregivers. MAIN MESSAGE: There are several frameworks that organize the main experiences described by patients and caregivers. We used a review of the qualitative literature to provide the framework to summarize Faye's experience under the following headings: seeking a diagnosis, accessing supports and services, information needs, disease management, and communication and attitudes. CONCLUSION: Physicians should consider these themes when developing a management plan for PWDs. Trying to understand the experiences and perspectives of PWDs and their caregivers is important in providing optimal care.
28111296	Management of Alzheimer's disease-An insight of the enzymatic and other novel potential targets.	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a well-known cause of memory loss and dementia in elderly people all across the world. It is pathophysiologically characterized by the extracellular deposition of amyloid beta (Abeta) proteins and retention of intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) of hyperphosphorylated tau proteins. Several enzymes, such as lipoxygenases, acetylcholinesterases, secretases, glycogen synthase kinase 3, caspases, sirtuins have been reported to actively participate in the pathogenesis of AD. Due to the limited drug for the management of AD till now (only memantine and four other acetylcholinesterase inhibitors), there is an urgent need to find out the novel inhibitors that could specifically act against these enzymes or therapeutically important targets, and barricade or decelerate AD progression. In this current review, we aim to unravel various enzymes and their potential inhibitors that could be exploited against AD pathogenesis. We have also covered several other important miscellaneous targets which could be used as AD therapeutics.
28111291	CD36 gene polymorphism is associated with Alzheimer's disease.	CD36 gene encodes a membrane glycoprotein (type B scavenger receptor) present on the surface of many types of cells and having multiple cellular functions ranging from angiogenesis to gustatory perception of fatty acids. Using a case control genetic association approach we have analyzed selected single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP's) in a total of 859 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and controls and have identified the allele A in rs3211892 polymorphism of CD36 gene as significantly increasing the risk of AD. Additionally we have investigated, in the same sample of control subjects and patients, SNP's in ApoE gene and confirmed that the previously identified AD-associated SNP's indeed increased the risk and decreased the age of onset of AD as reported by others earlier. Based on the current knowledge of CD36 biochemistry we propose that the AD risk-imparting variants of CD36 alter cholesterol homeostasis, oxidation stress or induce pathological inflammatory cascades. The SNP rs3211892 has previously been associated with heart disease and other conditions but the present study is the first to identify a significant association between variations in CD36 gene and the risk of Alzheimer's disease.
28110736	Alzheimer's disease detection via automatic 3D caudate nucleus segmentation using coupled dictionary learning with level set formulation.	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: This paper presents a novel method for Alzheimer's disease classification via an automatic 3D caudate nucleus segmentation. METHODS: The proposed method consists of segmentation and classification steps. In the segmentation step, we propose a novel level set cost function. The proposed cost function is constrained by a sparse representation of local image features using a dictionary learning method. We present coupled dictionaries: a feature dictionary of a grayscale brain image and a label dictionary of a caudate nucleus label image. Using online dictionary learning, the coupled dictionaries are learned from the training data. The learned coupled dictionaries are embedded into a level set function. In the classification step, a region-based feature dictionary is built. The region-based feature dictionary is learned from shape features of the caudate nucleus in the training data. The classification is based on the measure of the similarity between the sparse representation of region-based shape features of the segmented caudate in the test image and the region-based feature dictionary. RESULTS: The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method over the state-of-the-art methods by achieving a high segmentation (91.5%) and classification (92.5%) accuracy. CONCLUSIONS: In this paper, we find that the study of the caudate nucleus atrophy gives an advantage over the study of whole brain structure atrophy to detect Alzheimer's disease.
28110723	Structural MRI-based detection of Alzheimer's disease using feature ranking and classification error.	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: This paper presents an automatic computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system based on feature ranking for detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD) using structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) data. METHODS: The proposed CAD system is composed of four systematic stages. First, global and local differences in the gray matter (GM) of AD patients compared to the GM of healthy controls (HCs) are analyzed using a voxel-based morphometry technique. The aim is to identify significant local differences in the volume of GM as volumes of interests (VOIs). Second, the voxel intensity values of the VOIs are extracted as raw features. Third, the raw features are ranked using a seven-feature ranking method, namely, statistical dependency (SD), mutual information (MI), information gain (IG), Pearson's correlation coefficient (PCC), t-test score (TS), Fisher's criterion (FC), and the Gini index (GI). The features with higher scores are more discriminative. To determine the number of top features, the estimated classification error based on training set made up of the AD and HC groups is calculated, with the vector size that minimized this error selected as the top discriminative feature. Fourth, the classification is performed using a support vector machine (SVM). In addition, a data fusion approach among feature ranking methods is introduced to improve the classification performance. RESULTS: The proposed method is evaluated using a data-set from ADNI (130 AD and 130 HC) with 10-fold cross-validation. The classification accuracy of the proposed automatic system for the diagnosis of AD is up to 92.48% using the sMRI data. CONCLUSIONS: An automatic CAD system for the classification of AD based on feature-ranking method and classification errors is proposed. In this regard, seven-feature ranking methods (i.e., SD, MI, IG, PCC, TS, FC, and GI) are evaluated. The optimal size of top discriminative features is determined by the classification error estimation in the training phase. The experimental results indicate that the performance of the proposed system is comparative to that of state-of-the-art classification models.
28109809	Potent inhibition of monoamine oxidase A by decursin from Angelica gigas Nakai and by wogonin from Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi.	During the ongoing search for new monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, five coumarin derivatives and eight flavonoids were isolated from the roots of Angelica gigas Nakai and Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi, respectively. Of the phytochemicals, decursin (4) was found to potently and selectively inhibit human MAO-A (IC50=1.89muM). The IC50 value of 4 for MAO-A belonged to the lowest group in herbal sources and was similar to that of toloxatone (1.78muM), a marketed drug. Wogonin (11) effectively inhibited MAO-A and MAO-B (IC50=6.35 and 20.8muM, respectively). Furthermore, compounds 5 (decursinol angelate) and 10 (baicalein) were observed to selectively and moderately inhibit MAO-A. In addition, compound 4 reversibly and competitively inhibited MAO-A with a Ki of 0.17muM. Compound 11 also competitively inhibited MAO-A and MAO-B (Ki=0.56 and 1.96muM, respectively). Molecular docking simulation revealed that 4 interacts with Asn181 residue of MAO-A or Asn116 residue of MAO-B by formation of hydrogen bond. The findings suggest compounds 4 and 11 be considered as new potent and reversible MAO-A inhibitors or useful lead compounds for the developments of MAO inhibitors for the treatment of disorders like depression, Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer disease.
28109287	How useful is the EQ-5D in assessing the impact of caring for people with Alzheimer's disease?	BACKGROUND: The impact on informal caregivers of caring for people with Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia can be substantial, but it remains unclear which measures(s) best assess such impact. Our objective was to use data from the GERAS study to assess the ability of the EuroQol 5-dimension questionnaire (EQ-5D) to measure the impact on caregivers of caring for people with AD dementia and to examine correlations between EQ-5D and caregiver burden. METHODS: GERAS was a prospective, non-interventional cohort study in community-dwelling patients with AD dementia and their informal caregivers. The EQ-5D and Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI) were used to measure health-related quality of life and caregiver burden, respectively. Resource-use data collected included caregiver time spent with the patient on activities of daily living (ADL). Spearman correlations were computed between EQ-5D scores, ZBI scores, and time spent on instrumental ADL (T-IADL) at baseline, 18 months, and for 18-month change scores. T-IADL and ZBI change scores were summarized by EQ-5D domain change category (better/stable/worse). RESULTS: At baseline, 1495 caregivers had mean EQ-5D index scores of 0.86, 0.85, and 0.82, and ZBI total scores of 24.6, 29.4, and 34.1 for patients with mild, moderate, and moderately severe/severe AD dementia, respectively. Change in T-IADL showed a stronger correlation with change in ZBI (0.12; P < 0.001) than with change in EQ-5D index score (0.02; P = 0.546) although both correlations were very weak. Worsening within EQ-5D domains was associated with increases in ZBI scores, although 68%-90% of caregivers remained stable within each EQ-5D domain. There was no clear pattern for change in T-IADL by change in EQ-5D domain. CONCLUSIONS: EQ-5D may not be the optimum measure of the impact of caring for people with AD dementia due to its focus on physical health. Alternative measures need further investigation.
28107809	Plasma protein profiling for potential biomarkers in the early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.	OBJECTIVES: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia in elderly persons. Since the pathology of AD develops slowly from a preclinical or early phase into a fully expressed clinical syndrome, at the time of diagnosis the disease has been progressing for many years. To facilitate the early diagnosis of AD, we performed protein profiling of blood in patients with mild AD as defined by the Functional Assessment Staging (FAST) scale. METHODS: Plasma samples from mild AD patients and healthy controls were analyzed using two-dimensional differential gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) combined with matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF/TOF/MS) followed by peptide mass fingerprinting. RESULTS: Three downregulated proteins were identified: apolipoprotein A-1, alpha-2-HS-glycoprotein, and afamin. Two proteins, including apolipoprotein A-4 and fibrinogen gamma chain, were upregulated in mild AD patients. DISCUSSION: Our results suggest that altered expression levels of these proteins in plasma may yield candidate biomarkers for the early diagnosis of AD.

28098452	A Perspective on Crocus sativus L. (Saffron) Constituent Crocin: A Potent Water-Soluble Antioxidant and Potential Therapy for Alzheimer's Disease.	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia, in which the death of brain cells causes memory loss and cognitive decline. Several factors are thought to play roles in the development and course of AD. Existing medical therapies only modestly alleviate and delay cognitive symptoms. Current research has been focused on developing antibodies to remove the aggregates of amyloid-beta (Abeta) and tau protein. This approach has achieved removal of Abeta; however, no cognitive improvement in AD patients has been reported. The biological properties of saffron, the dry stigma of the plant Crocus sativus L., and particularly its main constituent crocin, have been studied extensively for many conditions including dementia and traumatic brain injury. Crocin is a unique antioxidant because it is a water-soluble carotenoid. Crocin has shown potential to improve learning and memory as well as protect brain cells. A search of the studies on saffron and crocin that have been published in recent years for their impact on AD as well as crocin's effects on Abeta and tau protein has been conducted. This review demonstrates that crocin exhibits multifunctional protective activities in the brain and could be a promising agent applied as a supplement or drug for prevention or treatment of AD.
28097354	Global Burden of Hypertension and Systolic Blood Pressure of at Least 110 to 115 mm Hg, 1990-2015.	Importance: Elevated systolic blood (SBP) pressure is a leading global health risk. Quantifying the levels of SBP is important to guide prevention policies and interventions. Objective: To estimate the association between SBP of at least 110 to 115 mm Hg and SBP of 140 mm Hg or higher and the burden of different causes of death and disability by age and sex for 195 countries and territories, 1990-2015. Design: A comparative risk assessment of health loss related to SBP. Estimated distribution of SBP was based on 844 studies from 154 countries (published 1980-2015) of 8.69 million participants. Spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression was used to generate estimates of mean SBP and adjusted variance for each age, sex, country, and year. Diseases with sufficient evidence for a causal relationship with high SBP (eg, ischemic heart disease, ischemic stroke, and hemorrhagic stroke) were included in the primary analysis. Main Outcomes and Measures: Mean SBP level, cause-specific deaths, and health burden related to SBP (>/=110-115 mm Hg and also >/=140 mm Hg) by age, sex, country, and year. Results: Between 1990-2015, the rate of SBP of at least 110 to 115 mm Hg increased from 73119 (95% uncertainty interval [UI], 67949-78241) to 81373 (95% UI, 76814-85770) per 100000, and SBP of 140 mm Hg or higher increased from 17307 (95% UI, 17117-17492) to 20526 (95% UI, 20283-20746) per 100000. The estimated annual death rate per 100000 associated with SBP of at least 110 to 115 mm Hg increased from 135.6 (95% UI, 122.4-148.1) to 145.2 (95% UI 130.3-159.9) and the rate for SBP of 140 mm Hg or higher increased from 97.9 (95% UI, 87.5-108.1) to 106.3 (95% UI, 94.6-118.1). For loss of DALYs associated with systolic blood pressure of 140 mm Hg or higher, the loss increased from 95.9 million (95% uncertainty interval [UI], 87.0-104.9 million) to 143.0 million (95% UI, 130.2-157.0 million) [corrected], and for SBP of 140 mm Hg or higher, the loss increased from 5.2 million (95% UI, 4.6-5.7 million) to 7.8 million (95% UI, 7.0-8.7 million). The largest numbers of SBP-related deaths were caused by ischemic heart disease (4.9 million [95% UI, 4.0-5.7 million]; 54.5%), hemorrhagic stroke (2.0 million [95% UI, 1.6-2.3 million]; 58.3%), and ischemic stroke (1.5 million [95% UI, 1.2-1.8 million]; 50.0%). In 2015, China, India, Russia, Indonesia, and the United States accounted for more than half of the global DALYs related to SBP of at least 110 to 115 mm Hg. Conclusions and Relevance: In international surveys, although there is uncertainty in some estimates, the rate of elevated SBP (>/=110-115 and >/=140 mm Hg) increased substantially between 1990 and 2015, and DALYs and deaths associated with elevated SBP also increased. Projections based on this sample suggest that in 2015, an estimated 3.5 billion adults had SBP of at least 110 to 115 mm Hg and 874 million adults had SBP of 140 mm Hg or higher.
28096943	Nitric Oxide: Exploring the Contextual Link with Alzheimer's Disease.	Neuronal inflammation is a systematically organized physiological step often triggered to counteract an invading pathogen or to rid the body of damaged and/or dead cellular debris. At the crux of this inflammatory response is the deployment of nonneuronal cells: microglia, astrocytes, and blood-derived macrophages. Glial cells secrete a host of bioactive molecules, which include proinflammatory factors and nitric oxide (NO). From immunomodulation to neuromodulation, NO is a renowned modulator of vast physiological systems. It essentially mediates these physiological effects by interacting with cyclic GMP (cGMP) leading to the regulation of intracellular calcium ions. NO regulates the release of proinflammatory molecules, interacts with ROS leading to the formation of reactive nitrogen species (RNS), and targets vital organelles such as mitochondria, ultimately causing cellular death, a hallmark of many neurodegenerative diseases. AD is an enervating neurodegenerative disorder with an obscure etiology. Because of accumulating experimental data continually highlighting the role of NO in neuroinflammation and AD progression, we explore the most recent data to highlight in detail newly investigated molecular mechanisms in which NO becomes relevant in neuronal inflammation and oxidative stress-associated neurodegeneration in the CNS as well as lay down up-to-date knowledge regarding therapeutic approaches targeting NO.
28095729	Impact of reactive oxygen species generation on Helicobacter pylori-related extragastric diseases: a hypothesis.	Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) induces reactive oxygen species (ROS) production that contribute to pathogenesis of a variety of H. pylori-related gastric diseases, as shown in animal and human studies. Helicobacter pylori infection is also associated with variety of systemic extragastric diseases in which H. pylori-related ROS production might also be involved in the pathogenesis of these systemic conditions. We proposed that Hp-related ROS may play a crucial role in the pathophysiology of Hp-related systemic diseases including Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, glaucoma and other relative neurodegenerative diseases, thereby suggesting introduction of relative ROS scavengers as therapeutic strategies against these diseases which are among the leading causes of disability and are associated with a large public health global burden. Moreover, we postulated that H. pylori-related ROS might also be involved in the pathogenesis of extragastric common malignancies, thereby suggesting that H. pylori eradication might inhibit the development or delay the progression of aforementioned diseases. However, large-scale future studies are warranted to elucidate the proposed pathophysiological mechanisms, including H. pylori-related ROS, involved in H. pylori-associated systemic and malignant conditions.
28095679	Non-Naturally Occurring Small Molecule Microtubule-Stabilizing Agents: A Potential Tactic for CNS-Directed Therapies.	Several independent studies indicate that microtubule (MT)-stabilizing agents hold considerable promise as candidate therapeutics for a wide spectrum of conditions of the central nervous system (CNS), from brain tumors to spinal cord injury, as well as a number of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal lobar degeneration, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Although the identification and development of candidate compounds for CNS-directed MT-stabilizing therapies has been a challenge in drug discovery for many years, a growing number of molecules have now been identified that exhibit both MT-stabilizing activity and brain penetration. In this Viewpoint, we will highlight the potential utility of MT-active triazolopyrimidines, phenylpyrimidines, and related classes of non-naturally occurring small molecules that exhibit favorable druglike properties, including brain penetration and oral bioavailability. The mode of action of these small molecules has not as yet been fully elucidated at the molecular level. However, based on all available data, compounds from these classes appear to act on MTs in a potentially unique manner. Further characterization of these molecules may have important ramifications for drug discovery, especially in the area of CNS diseases.
28094840	Hypertensive disorders in pregnancy and later dementia: a Swedish National Register Study.	INTRODUCTION: Our aim was to investigate the rate of vascular dementia and dementia in women with previous hypertensive disorders in pregnancy, since white matter lesions of the brain and cardiovascular disease are linked both to dementia and hypertensive disorders in pregnancy. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Prospective population-based registry study on all women giving birth in Sweden between 1973 and 1975 (284 598). Women with and without hypertensive disorders in pregnancy were identified by means of the Swedish Medical Birth Register and linked to the National Patient Register, where data on somatic disease later in life were obtained. International classification of disease was used. The Cox proportional hazard model was used to calculate hazard ratios for both groups and adjusted for possible confounders. Main outcome measures were in-hospital diagnosis of cardiovascular disease, vascular dementia and dementia. RESULTS: No increased risks were seen for vascular dementia or dementia after any hypertensive disorders in pregnancy. If broken down in specific diagnoses for hypertensive disease in pregnancy, adjusted risks for vascular dementia after hypertension and proteinuria during pregnancy the hazard ratio was 6.27 (95% CI 1.65-27.44). Higher risks for cardiovascular disease were confirmed. CONCLUSIONS: Because of the very low absolute risk, the wide confidence interval and risk of misclassification, our results on vascular dementia could be questioned. Considering the pathophysiology of preeclampsia, the findings of brain lesions and the increased risk for cardiovascular disease, the possibly increased risk for all kinds of dementia must be investigated in larger and more well-defined cohorts.
28094820	The effect of network template from normal subjects in the detection of network impairment.	This study aimed to provide a simple way to approach group differences by independent component analysis when researching functional connectivity changes of resting-state network in brain disorders. We used baseline resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging from the Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative dataset and performed independent component analysis based on different kinds of subject selection, by including two downloaded templates and single-subject independent component analysis method. All conditions were used to calculate the functional connectivity of the default mode network, and to test group differences and evaluate correlation with cognitive measurements and hippocampal volume. The default mode network functional connectivity results most fitting clinical evaluations were from templates based on young healthy subjects and the worst results were from heterogeneous or more severe disease groups or single-subject independent component analysis method. Using independent component analysis network maps derived from normal young subjects to extract all individual functional connectivities provides significant correlations with clinical evaluations.
28094819	Age-dependent concomitant changes in synaptic dysfunction and GABAergic pathway in the APP/PS1 mouse model.	Synaptic dysfunction is a well-documented manifestation in animal models of Alzheimer's disease pathology. In this context, numerous studies have documented reduction in the functionality of synapses in various models. In addition, recent research has shed more light on increased excitability and its link to seizures and seizure-like activities in AD patients as well as in mouse models. These reports of hyperexcitability contradict the observed reduction in synaptic function and have been suggested to be as a result of the interplay between inhibitory and excitatory neuronal mechanism. The present study therefore investigates functional deficiency in the inhibitory system as complementary to the identified alterations in the glutamate excitatory pathway in AD. Since synaptic function deficit in AD is typically linked to progression/pathology of the disease, it is important to determine whether the deficits in the GABAergic system are functional and can be directly linked to the pattern of the disruption documented in the glutamate system. To build on previous research in this field, experiments were designed to determine if previously documented synaptic dysfunction in AD models is concomitantly observed with excitation/inhibition imbalance as suggested by observation of seizure and seizure-like pathology in such models. We report changes in synaptic function in aged APPPS1 mice not observable in the younger cohort. These changes in synaptic function are furthermore accompanied by alteration in the GABAergic neurotransmission. Thus, age-dependent alteration in the inhibitory/excitatory balance might underpin the symptomatic changes observed with the progression of Alzheimer's disease pathology including sleep disturbance and epileptic events.
28093855	Typical and atypical appearance of early-onset Alzheimer's disease: A clinical, neuroimaging and neuropathological study.	The International Working Group (IWG) has classified Alzheimer's disease (AD) as two different types, the typical form and the atypical form, but clinicopathological studies of atypical AD are limited. Because atypical AD cases usually present with early-onset dementia, we investigated 12 patients with early-onset AD, including two patients with typical AD and 10 patients with atypical AD. Of these patients, six had the posterior variant, three had the frontal variant and one had the logopenic variant mixed with semantic dementia. We reported MRI, single-photon emission CT and neuropathological findings in six representative cases. We also described a "left temporal variant" of AD presenting with transcortical cortical sensory aphasia, which has not been reported previously and is another subtype of the posterior variant of AD. We found a significant correlation between regional cerebral blood flow and counts of NFTs in the cerebral cortices. An atypical presentation with focal neuropsychological symptoms roughly correlated with the density of NFTs in the cerebral cortex and more directly related to spongiform changes in the superficial layers of these areas. In contrast, the distribution of amyloid depositions was diffuse and did not necessarily correlate with focal neuropsychological symptoms. Braak staging or ABC score is not necessarily appropriate to evaluate atypical AD, and instead, spongiform changes in addition to tau pathology in the association cortices better explain the diversity of atypical AD. Interestingly, another patient with a posterior variant of AD had a novel type of atypical plaque, which we referred to as "lucent plaque". They were recognizable with HE staining in the circumference and dystrophic neurites were abundant with Gallyas-Braak staining. These plaques demonstrated intense immunoreactivity to both tau AT-8 and amyloid beta (Abeta), suggesting a peculiar coexistence pattern of amyloid and tau in these plaques. Clinicopathological studies of atypical AD will provide a new understanding of the pathophysiology of AD.
28088029	An updated meta-analysis of cohort studies: Diabetes and risk of Alzheimer's disease.	BACKGROUND: In recently, several large longitudinal population-based studies have shown that the rate of cognitive decline is accelerated in elderly people with diabetes mellitus. But the relation between diabetes and AD is still an area of controversy. The objective of this review was to update the evidence for or against diabetes as a risk factor of AD. METHODS: We searched the literature from their inception to May 2016 without restriction of language. We included all longitudinal population-based studies examining the association between diabetes and risk of AD. The meta-analysis was conducted using Stata software. RESULTS: A total of 17 studies involving 1,746,777 individuals were included. After pooling these 17 studies, subjects with diabetes had significant higher incidence of AD than those without diabetes (RR: 1.53, 95% CI: 1.42-1.63). When stratified by ethnicity, five cohorts were identified as Eastern populations, twelve were identified as Western populations. The Relative risk of AD in Western populations and Eastern populations were 1.36(1.18-1.53) and 1.62(1.49-1.75). CONCLUSION: The risk of AD is higher among people with diabetes than in the general population, especially in Eastern populations. So the necessary treatment measures should be taken in order to decrease the risk of AD.
28087373	Chronoinflammaging in Alzheimer; A systematic review on the roles of toll like receptor 2.	Aging is associated with a range of chronic low-grade inflammation (Chronoinflammaging) which may play a significant role in some chronic inflammatory based diseases, such as Alzheimer disease (AD). However, the events which lead to the induction of chronoinflammaging in AD are yet to be clarified. It has been proposed that the recognition of endogenous ligands by pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs) may be involved in the induction of chronoinflammaging. Toll like receptors (TLRs) are a family of PRRs which recognize endogenous damage associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) and subsequently induce inflammation. Therefore, TLRs are worthy of investigation to elucidate their roles in chronoinflammaging associated AD. This review article explores the main roles played by TLR2 in the pathogenesis of chronoinflammaging in patients suffering from AD.
28083634	Tau interactome mapping based identification of Otub1 as Tau deubiquitinase involved in accumulation of pathological Tau forms in vitro and in vivo.	Dysregulated proteostasis is a key feature of a variety of neurodegenerative disorders. In Alzheimer's disease (AD), progression of symptoms closely correlates with spatiotemporal progression of Tau aggregation, with "early" oligomeric Tau forms rather than mature neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) considered to be pathogenetic culprits. The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) controls degradation of soluble normal and abnormally folded cytosolic proteins. The UPS is affected in AD and is identified by genomewide association study (GWAS) as a risk pathway for AD. The UPS is determined by balanced regulation of ubiquitination and deubiquitination. In this work, we performed isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ)-based Tau interactome mapping to gain unbiased insight into Tau pathophysiology and to identify novel Tau-directed therapeutic targets. Focusing on Tau deubiquitination, we here identify Otub1 as a Tau-deubiquitinating enzyme. Otub1 directly affected Lys48-linked Tau deubiquitination, impairing Tau degradation, dependent on its catalytically active cysteine, but independent of its noncanonical pathway modulated by its N-terminal domain in primary neurons. Otub1 strongly increased AT8-positive Tau and oligomeric Tau forms and increased Tau-seeded Tau aggregation in primary neurons. Finally, we demonstrated that expression of Otub1 but not its catalytically inactive form induced pathological Tau forms after 2 months in Tau transgenic mice in vivo, including AT8-positive Tau and oligomeric Tau forms. Taken together, we here identified Otub1 as a Tau deubiquitinase in vitro and in vivo, involved in formation of pathological Tau forms, including small soluble oligomeric forms. Otub1 and particularly Otub1 inhibitors, currently under development for cancer therapies, may therefore yield interesting novel therapeutic avenues for Tauopathies and AD.
28075620	Diagnostic Efficacy of Structural MRI in Patients With Mild-to-Moderate Alzheimer Disease: Automated Volumetric Assessment Versus Visual Assessment.	OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to compare the diagnostic efficacies of an automated volumetric assessment tool and visual assessment in the evaluation of medial temporal lobar atrophy in mild-to-moderate Alzheimer disease (AD). MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study included 30 patients with mild-to-moderate AD and 25 age-matched healthy control subjects undergoing MRI with a 3D fast spoiled gradient recalled-echo sequence at 3 T. The images were processed with fully automated volumetric analysis software. To assess medial temporal lobe (MTL) atrophy, two MTL indexes, which took into account the volumes of the hippocampus and the inferior lateral ventricle, were calculated with the automated volumetric assessment software. In addition, two neuroradiologists assessed MTL atrophy visually using the Scheltens scale. ROC curve analysis was used to compare the diagnostic performances of the two methods. The weighted kappa statistic was used to assess the intrarater and interrater reliability of visual inspection. RESULTS: The automated volumetric assessment tool had moderate sensitivity (63.3%) and high specificity (100%) in differentiating patients with mild-to-moderate AD from control subjects. Visual inspection showed sensitivity of 63.3% and specificity of 92.0%. The diagnostic performance was not significantly different between the two methods (p = 0.536-0.906). Intraobserver reliability for visual inspection was 0.858 and 0.902 for the two reviewers, and interobserver reliability was 0.692-0.780. CONCLUSION: Both the automated volumetric assessment tool and visual inspection can be used to evaluate MTL atrophy and differentiate patients with AD from healthy individuals with good diagnostic accuracy. Thus, the automated tool can be a useful and efficient adjunct in clinical practice for evaluating MTL atrophy in the diagnosis of AD.
28074090	Application of Machine Learning in Postural Control Kinematics for the Diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease.	The use of wearable devices to study gait and postural control is a growing field on neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this paper, we investigate if machine-learning classifiers offer the discriminative power for the diagnosis of AD based on postural control kinematics. We compared Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Multiple Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), Radial Basis Function Neural Networks (RBNs), and Deep Belief Networks (DBNs) on 72 participants (36 AD patients and 36 healthy subjects) exposed to seven increasingly difficult postural tasks. The decisional space was composed of 18 kinematic variables (adjusted for age, education, height, and weight), with or without neuropsychological evaluation (Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA) score), top ranked in an error incremental analysis. Classification results were based on threefold cross validation of 50 independent and randomized runs sets: training (50%), test (40%), and validation (10%). Having a decisional space relying solely on postural kinematics, accuracy of AD diagnosis ranged from 71.7 to 86.1%. Adding the MoCA variable, the accuracy ranged between 91 and 96.6%. MLP classifier achieved top performance in both decisional spaces. Having comprehended the interdynamic interaction between postural stability and cognitive performance, our results endorse machine-learning models as a useful tool for computer-aided diagnosis of AD based on postural control kinematics.
28072381	Magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography in the diagnosis of neurodegenerative dementias.	Neuroimaging, both with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET), has gained a pivotal role in the diagnosis of primary neurodegenerative diseases. These two techniques are used as biomarkers of both pathology and progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and to differentiate AD from other neurodegenerative diseases. MRI is able to identify structural changes including patterns of atrophy characterizing neurodegenerative diseases, and to distinguish these from other causes of cognitive impairment, e.g. infarcts, space-occupying lesions and hydrocephalus. PET is widely used to identify regional patterns of glucose utilization, since distinct patterns of distribution of cerebral glucose metabolism are related to different subtypes of neurodegenerative dementia. The use of PET in mild cognitive impairment, though controversial, is deemed helpful for predicting conversion to dementia and the dementia clinical subtype. Recently, new radiopharmaceuticals for the in vivo imaging of amyloid burden have been licensed and more tracers are being developed for the assessment of tauopathies and inflammatory processes, which may underlie the onset of the amyloid cascade. At present, the cerebral amyloid burden, imaged with PET, may help to exclude the presence of AD as well as forecast its possible onset. Finally PET imaging may be particularly useful in ongoing clinical trials for the development of dementia treatments. In the near future, the use of the above methods, in accordance with specific guidelines, along with the use of effective treatments will likely lead to more timely and successful treatment of neurodegenerative dementias.
28072380	Network functional connectivity and whole-brain functional connectomics to investigate cognitive decline in neurodegenerative conditions.	Non-invasive mapping of brain functional connectivity (FC) has played a fundamental role in neuroscience, and numerous scientists have been fascinated by its ability to reveal the brain's intricate morphology and functional properties. In recent years, two different techniques have been developed that are able to explore FC in pathophysiological conditions and to provide simple and non-invasive biomarkers for the detection of disease onset, severity and progression. These techniques are independent component analysis, which allows a network-based functional exploration of the brain, and graph theory, which provides a quantitative characterization of the whole-brain FC. In this paper we provide an overview of these two techniques and some examples of their clinical applications in the most common neurodegenerative disorders associated with cognitive decline, including mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, dementia with Lewy Bodies and behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia.
28071980	Metabolic syndrome, hypertension, and nervous system injury: Epidemiological correlates.	Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a common and complex disorder combining hypertension, obesity, dyslipidemia, and insulin resistance. MetS represents a risk factor for changes in cognitive functions in older age, and several studies have suggested that MetS may be linked to dementia. This article reviews the main evidences about the relationship between MetS and neurodegenerative disease. Starting from an epidemiological point of view, the article analyzes medico-social aspects related to MetS, considering the reduction of work capacity and the condition of disability that it involves. Some authors affirm that on the basis of current Italian legislation, it is possible to consider the syndrome as a disability. This is because all the diseases that make up MetS are high-risk clinical pathological conditions. For these reasons, a joint action is required to contain the incidence of MetS, the high social costs, and the loss of productivity related to the syndrome. In conclusion, healthcare initiatives could be adopted in order to increase the understanding of the pathogenic contributions of each element on MetS and how they can be modified. These actions will be useful to reduce healthcare costs and can lead to more effective prevention of metabolic disease, thus promoting good health.

28070672	Opposing effects of progranulin deficiency on amyloid and tau pathologies via microglial TYROBP network.	Progranulin (PGRN) is implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD) as well as frontotemporal lobar degeneration. Genetic studies demonstrate an association of the common GRN rs5848 variant that results in reduced PGRN levels with increased risk for AD. However, the mechanisms by which PGRN reduction from the GRN AD risk variant or mutation exacerbates AD pathophysiology remain ill defined. Here, we show that the GRN AD risk variant has no significant effects on florbetapir positron emission tomographic amyloid imaging and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Abeta levels, whereas it is associated with increased CSF tau levels in human subjects of the Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative studies. Consistent with the human data, subsequent analyses using the APPswe/PS1DeltaE9 (APP/PS1) mouse model of cerebral amyloidosis show that PGRN deficiency has no exacerbating effects on Abeta pathology. In contrast and unexpectedly, PGRN deficiency significantly reduces diffuse Abeta plaque growth in these APP/PS1 mice. This protective effect is due, at least in part, to enhanced microglial Abeta phagocytosis caused by PGRN deficiency-induced expression of TYROBP network genes (TNG) including an AD risk factor Trem2. PGRN-deficient APP/PS1 mice also exhibit less severe axonal dystrophy and partially improved behavior phenotypes. While PGRN deficiency reduces these amyloidosis-related phenotypes, other neuronal injury mechanisms are increased by loss of PGRN, revealing a multidimensional interaction of GRN with AD. For example, C1q complement deposition at synapses is enhanced in APP/PS1 mice lacking PGRN. Moreover, PGRN deficiency increases tau AT8 and AT180 pathologies in human P301L tau-expressing mice. These human and rodent data suggest that global PGRN reduction induces microglial TNG expression and increases AD risk by exacerbating neuronal injury and tau pathology, rather than by accelerating Abeta pathology.
28069007	The Benzopyrone Biochanin-A as a reversible, competitive, and selective monoamine oxidase B inhibitor.	BACKGROUND: Monoamine oxidase-B (MAO-B) inhibitors are widely used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. They increase vital monoamine neurotransmitters in the brain. However, there is a need for safer natural reversible MAO inhibitors with MAO-B selectivity. Our previous studies showed that Psoralea corylifolia seeds (PCS) extract contains compounds that inhibit monoamine oxidase-B. METHODS: In this study, six of PCS constituents sharing a benzopyrone structure were investigated. The compounds Biochanin-A (BIO-A), isopsoralen, 6-prenylnaringenin, neobavaisoflavone, psoralen, and psoralidin, were tested for their ability to inhibit recombinant human MAO-A and B (hMAO-A and hMAO-B) isozymes. The ability of these compounds to inhibit MAO-A and MAO-B were compared to that of PCS ethanolic extract (PCSEE) using spectrophotometric assays and confirmed by luminescence assays. The highly potent and selective MAO-B inhibitor, BIO-A, was further investigated for both isozymes reversibility and enzyme kinetics. Molecular docking studies were used to predict the bioactive conformation and molecular interactions of BIO-A with both isozymes. RESULTS: The data obtained indicate that benzopyrones inhibited hMAO-A and hMAO-B with different degrees as confirmed with the luminescence assay. BIO-A inhibited hMAO-B with high potency and selectivity in the present study (IC50 = 0.003 mug/mL) and showing 38-fold more selectivity than PCSEE (hMAO-B IC50 = 3.03 mug/mL, 17-fold selectivity) without affecting hydrogen peroxide. Furthermore, BIO-A reversibly and competitively inhibited both hMAOs with significantly lower inhibitory constant (Ki) in hMAO-B (3.8 nM) than hMAO-A (99.3 nM). Our docking studies indicated that the H-bonds and hydrophobic interactions at the human MAO-A and MAO-B active sites contributed to the reversibility and selectivity of BIO-A. CONCLUSIONS: The data obtained indicate that BIO-A is a potent, reversible and selective MAO-B inhibitor and may be recommended for further investigation in its possible use in the therapeutic management of Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases.
28067736	Alzheimer's Disease and Exercise: A Literature Review.	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that impairs memory and cognitive judgment. It is the leading cause of dementia in late adult life and is associated with a significant social burden and increased morbidity and mortality in the elderly. Because of mixed effectiveness of medications, exercise has been considered as a treatment for pre-clinical AD, late stage AD, and as a prevention strategy. Exercise appears to improve brain blood flow, increase hippocampal volume, and improve neurogenesis. Prospective studies indicate that physical inactivity is one of the most common preventable risk factors for developing AD and that higher physical activity levels are associated with a reduced risk of development of disease. Exercise as a treatment for AD shows improvement in cognitive function, decreased neuropsychiatric symptoms, and a slower decline in activities of daily living (ADL). Exercise has been shown to have fewer side effects and better adherence compared to medications.
28064343	Quantitation of PET signal as an adjunct to visual interpretation of florbetapir imaging.	PURPOSE: This study examined the feasibility of using quantitation to augment interpretation of florbetapir PET amyloid imaging. METHODS: A total of 80 physician readers were trained on quantitation of florbetapir PET images and the principles for using quantitation to augment a visual read. On day 1, the readers completed a visual read of 96 scans (46 autopsy-verified and 50 from patients seeking a diagnosis). On day 2, 69 of the readers reinterpreted the 96 scans augmenting their interpretation with quantitation (VisQ method) using one of three commercial software packages. A subset of 11 readers reinterpreted all scans on day 2 based on a visual read only (VisVis control). For the autopsy-verified scans, the neuropathologist's modified CERAD plaque score was used as the truth standard for interpretation accuracy. Because an autopsy truth standard was not available for scans from patients seeking a diagnosis, the majority VisQ interpretation of the three readers with the best accuracy in interpreting autopsy-verified scans was used as the reference standard. RESULTS: Day 1 visual read accuracy was high for both the autopsy-verified scans (90%) and the scans from patients seeking a diagnosis (87.3%). Accuracy improved from the visual read to the VisQ read (from 90.1% to 93.1%, p < 0.0001). Importantly, access to quantitative information did not decrease interpretation accuracy of the above-average readers (>90% on day 1). Accuracy in interpreting the autopsy-verified scans also increased from the first to the second visual read (VisVis group). However, agreement with the reference standard (best readers) for scans from patients seeking a diagnosis did not improve with a second visual read, and in this cohort the VisQ group was significantly improved relative to the VisVis group (change 5.4% vs. -1.1%, p < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: These results indicate that augmentation of visual interpretation of florbetapir PET amyloid images with quantitative information obtained using commercially available software packages did not reduce the accuracy of readers who were already performing with above average accuracy on the visual read and may improve the accuracy and confidence of some readers in clinically relevant cases.
28064323	[Heat-shock protein HSP70 reduces the secretion of TNFalpha by neuroblastoma cells and human monocytes induced with beta-amyloid peptides].	The progress of neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease is closely associated with inflammatory processes in the brain tissues induced by beta-amyloid peptides (Abeta). In this paper, we showed that Abeta(1-42) and isoAbeta(1-42) in human neuroblastoma cells SK-N-SH and promonocyte THP-1 activated the production of tumor necrosis factor (TNFalpha). Notably, isoAbeta(1-42) had the strongest effect on the increase in the level of TNFalpha. The addition of recombinant heat-shock protein HSP70 reduces TNFalpha production induced by Abeta, which leads to a decrease in neuronal cell damage at the organism level.
28064322	[Zinc-induced interactions of the metal-binding domain of beta-amyloid with nucleic acids and glycosaminoglycans].	Zinc ions form complexes with beta-amyloid peptides and play an important role in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis. It has been demonstrated by turbidimetry and correlation spectroscopy that synthetic peptide Abeta16 representing the metal-binding domain of beta-amyloid is able to interact with nucleic acids, chondroitin polysulfate, and dextran sulfates in the presence of zinc ions. The amino acid D7H substitution enhanced the peptide binding to polyanions, whereas the H6R and H6A-H13A substitutions abolished this interaction. It is suggested that the metal-binding domain may serve as a zinc-dependent site of beta-amyloid interaction with biological polyanions including DNA, RNA, and glycosaminoglycans.
28064079	Tacrine-resveratrol fused hybrids as multi-target-directed ligands against Alzheimer's disease.	Multi-target drug discovery is one of the most followed approaches in the active central nervous system (CNS) therapeutic area, especially in the search for new drugs against Alzheimer's disease (AD). This is because innovative multi-target-directed ligands (MTDLs) could more adequately address the complexity of this pathological condition. In a continuation of our efforts aimed at a new series of anti-AD MTDLs, we combined the structural features of the cholinesterase inhibitor drug tacrine with that of resveratrol, which is known for its purported antioxidant and anti-neuroinflammatory activities. The most interesting hybrid compounds (5, 8, 9 and 12) inhibited human acetylcholinesterase at micromolar concentrations and effectively modulated Abeta self-aggregation in vitro. In addition, 12 showed intriguing anti-inflammatory and immuno-modulatory properties in neuronal and glial AD cell models. Importantly, the MTDL profile is accompanied by high-predicted blood-brain barrier permeability, and low cytotoxicity on primary neurons.
28056430	The effects of sitagliptin, a DPP-4 inhibitor, on cognitive functions in elderly diabetic patients with or without Alzheimer's disease.	AIMS: The present study aimed to evaluate effect of sitagliptin, a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor (DPP-4I), on cognitive functions in elderly diabetic patients with and without cognitive impairment. METHODS: 253 elderly patients with type 2DM, were enrolled in this prospective and observational study. After comprehensive geriatric assessment, the patients were divided into either sitagliptin or non-sitagliptin group. RESULTS: A total of 205 patients who completed the study (52 with Alzheimer's Disease (AD)) were re-evaluated 6months later. Sixth-month evaluation revealed no difference between sitagliptin and non-sitagliptin groups in terms of weight, body mass index, and HbA1c (p>0.05). However, the number of patients that required reduced insulin dose was significantly higher in the sitagliptin group (p=0.01). Sitagliptin therapy was associated with an increase in the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores (p=0.034); patients without AD receiving only sitagliptin or insulin showed higher MMSE scores as compared to the patients receiving metformin alone (p=0.024). Likewise, the change in MMSE scores in AD patients receiving sitagliptin was significant and indicated improvement as compared to the patients receiving metformin (p=0.047). CONCLUSION: Besides its effects similar to those of insulin and metformin in glycemic control and in reducing need for insulin, 6-month sitagliptin therapy may also associated with improvement of cognitive function in elderly diabetic patients with and without AD. Further randomized controlled trials are needed to support these results.
28054724	Learning-based 3T brain MRI segmentation with guidance from 7T MRI labeling.	PURPOSE: Segmentation of brain magnetic resonance (MR) images into white matter (WM), gray matter (GM), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is crucial for brain structural measurement and disease diagnosis. Learning-based segmentation methods depend largely on the availability of good training ground truth. However, the commonly used 3T MR images are of insufficient image quality and often exhibit poor intensity contrast between WM, GM, and CSF. Therefore, they are not ideal for providing good ground truth label data for training learning-based methods. Recent advances in ultrahigh field 7T imaging make it possible to acquire images with excellent intensity contrast and signal-to-noise ratio. METHODS: In this paper, the authors propose an algorithm based on random forest for segmenting 3T MR images by training a series of classifiers based on reliable labels obtained semiautomatically from 7T MR images. The proposed algorithm iteratively refines the probability maps of WM, GM, and CSF via a cascade of random forest classifiers for improved tissue segmentation. RESULTS: The proposed method was validated on two datasets, i.e., 10 subjects collected at their institution and 797 3T MR images from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset. Specifically, for the mean Dice ratio of all 10 subjects, the proposed method achieved 94.52% +/- 0.9%, 89.49% +/- 1.83%, and 79.97% +/- 4.32% for WM, GM, and CSF, respectively, which are significantly better than the state-of-the-art methods (p-values < 0.021). For the ADNI dataset, the group difference comparisons indicate that the proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art segmentation methods. CONCLUSIONS: The authors have developed and validated a novel fully automated method for 3T brain MR image segmentation.
28053144	Excess APP O-glycosylation by GalNAc-T6 decreases Abeta production.	Alterations of the structure and/or amount of glycans present on proteins are associated with many diseases. We previously demonstrated that changes in N-glycans alter Abeta production. In the present study, we focused on the relationship between Alzheimer's disease (AD) and O-glycan, another type of glycan. The UDP-N-acetylgalactosamine:polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase (GalNAc-T) family functions in the first step of mucin-type O-glycan synthesis. Analysis of the expression of GalNAc-Ts in the human brain using real-time PCR revealed that the expression of several GalNAc-Ts was altered with sporadic AD progression. Three of these GalNAc-Ts (GalNAc-T1, GalNAc-T4 and GalNAc-T6) were transfected into HEK293T cells to examine their impact on Abeta production. Transfection of GalNAc-T6 significantly reduced both Abeta1-40 and Abeta1-42 generation, but GalNAc-T1 and GalNAc-T4 only reduced Abeta1-40 generation. Although these three GalNAc-Ts exhibited enzymatic activities on soluble amyloid precursor protein (APP), the GalNAc transferase activity of GalNAc-T6 to APP was most prominent. The expression of alpha-secretase and beta-secretase was slightly altered in the transfected cells, but the activities of alpha-secretase and beta-secretase were not significantly altered. These data suggest that excess O-glycosylation on APP by GalNAc-T6 inhibits Abeta production.
28052060	Structural variation in amyloid-beta fibrils from Alzheimer's disease clinical subtypes.	Aggregation of amyloid-beta peptides into fibrils or other self-assembled states is central to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Fibrils formed in vitro by 40- and 42-residue amyloid-beta peptides (Abeta40 and Abeta42) are polymorphic, with variations in molecular structure that depend on fibril growth conditions. Recent experiments suggest that variations in amyloid-beta fibril structure in vivo may correlate with variations in Alzheimer's disease phenotype, in analogy to distinct prion strains that are associated with different clinical and pathological phenotypes. Here we investigate correlations between structural variation and Alzheimer's disease phenotype using solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (ssNMR) measurements on Abeta40 and Abeta42 fibrils prepared by seeded growth from extracts of Alzheimer's disease brain cortex. We compared two atypical Alzheimer's disease clinical subtypes-the rapidly progressive form (r-AD) and the posterior cortical atrophy variant (PCA-AD)-with a typical prolonged-duration form (t-AD). On the basis of ssNMR data from 37 cortical tissue samples from 18 individuals, we find that a single Abeta40 fibril structure is most abundant in samples from patients with t-AD and PCA-AD, whereas Abeta40 fibrils from r-AD samples exhibit a significantly greater proportion of additional structures. Data for Abeta42 fibrils indicate structural heterogeneity in most samples from all patient categories, with at least two prevalent structures. These results demonstrate the existence of a specific predominant Abeta40 fibril structure in t-AD and PCA-AD, suggest that r-AD may relate to additional fibril structures and indicate that there is a qualitative difference between Abeta40 and Abeta42 aggregates in the brain tissue of patients with Alzheimer's disease.
28049055	Synergistic effects of negatively charged hydrophobic nanoparticles and (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate on inhibiting amyloid beta-protein aggregation.	Fibrillogenesis of amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) in human brain has been implicated as the main cause of Alzheimer's disease. A few small molecules from natural sources have been discovered for their inhibition effects on Abeta fibrillation, of which (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) is one of the most broadly investigated compounds for its potent inhibitory activity. However, in vivo applicability of the inhibitors is largely limited by their low transmembrane efficiency. Hence, it is of great significance to develop inhibition systems that function at low concentrations. In this work, a dual-inhibitor system containing EGCG and negatively charged polymeric nanoparticles (NP10), which was also demonstrated effective on the inhibition of Abeta aggregation, was developed and comprehensively studied by extensive biophysical and biological assays. It was found that the dual-inhibitor system at low concentrations was more effective on the inhibition and detoxification of Abeta (Abeta42 and Abeta40) fibrillation than the additive effects of these two agents working individually. Namely, there was a synergistic effect of the two inhibitors. The synergism factor reached 1.25 with 5muM EGCG and 5mug/mL NP10. Kinetic studies with Abeta40 revealed that the two inhibitors functioned in different Abeta assembling stages: NP10 mainly inhibited primary nucleation, while EGCG suppressed fibril elongation and changed the fibril structure to make it show less seeding activities in the secondary nucleation. NP10 might also help EGCG binding to Abeta, leading to its enhanced inhibitory effects on fibril elongation and secondary nucleation. The synergistic effect observed in the dual-inhibitor system offered new insight into the development of potent inhibitor systems against amyloid neurotoxicity.
28045857	Quantitative EEG After Brain Stimulation and Cognitive Training in Alzheimer Disease.	PURPOSE: Medications are the currently accepted symptomatic treatment of Alzheimer disease (AD), but their impact on delaying the progression of cognitive deficits and functional impairment is limited. The authors aimed to explore long-term electrophysiological effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation interlaced with cognitive training on quantitative electroencephalography (EEG) in patients with AD. METHODS: Quantitative EEG was assessed on non-repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation interlaced with cognitive training treatment days before treatment and after each treatment phase in seven patients with mild AD. RESULTS: After 4.5 months (54 sessions) of treatment, a significant increase of delta activity over the temporal region was found compared with pretreatment values. Nonsignificant increases of the log EEG power were found for alpha band over the frontal and temporal regions, beta band over the frontal region, theta band over the frontal, temporal, and parieto-occipital regions, and delta band over the frontal and parieto-occipital regions. Nonsignificant decreases were found for alpha over the parieto-occipital region, and for beta over the temporal and parieto-occipital regions. A positive correlation was found between log alpha power over the frontal and temporal regions at 6 weeks and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores at 6 weeks and 4.5 months, and between log alpha power over the parieto-occipital regions and MMSE scores at 6 weeks. A negative correlation was found between log alpha power over the frontal and temporal regions at 6 weeks and baseline Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale scores. CONCLUSIONS: Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation interlaced with cognitive training has long-term effects on quantitative EEG in patients with mild AD. Further research on the quantitative EEG long-term effects of transcranial magnetic stimulation interlaced with cognitive training is required to confirm the authors' data.
28044308	Expression of Monomeric C-Reactive Protein in Infarcted Brain Tissue from Patients with Alzheimer's Disease.	OBJECTIVE: We have previously shown that monomeric-C-reactive protein is deposited in significant quantities within the brain parenchyma after stroke. Since we have recently identified a possible role of this protein in supporting neurodegeneration and aberrant vascular development we identified a small group of post-mortem brain samples from individuals who had Alzheimer's disease and evidence of tissue infarction/ micro-infarction on histological examination. MATERIAL AND METHOD: We used immunohistochemistry staining to identify the monomeric-C-reactive protein expressed in the infarcted brain tissues. RESULTS: We showed that monomeric-C-reactive protein deposition was highest in those regions affected by stroke or vascular disruption, and that within those same areas, there was more interaction and co-localization between major classical proteins of neurodegeneration (beta-amyloid and tau). CONCLUSION: We hypothesise that vascular disruption and concomitant release of monomeric-C-reactive protein within the brain tissue could exacerbate ongoing neurological damage via stimulation of neuro-inflammation and from direct consequences of its action on both neuronal and vascular cells.
28044092	Comparative Analysis of the Interaction between Different Flavonoids and PDIA3.	Flavonoids, plant secondary metabolites present in fruits, vegetables, and products such as tea and red wine, show antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antithrombotic, antiviral, and antitumor activity. PDIA3 is a member of the protein disulfide isomerase family mainly involved in the correct folding of newly synthetized glycoproteins. PDIA3 is associated with different human pathologies such as cancer, prion disorders, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's diseases and it has the potential to be a pharmacological target. The interaction of different flavonoids with PDIA3 was investigated by quenching fluorescence analysis and the effects on protein activity were evaluated. A higher affinity was observed for eupatorin-5-methyl ether and eupatorin which also inhibit reductase activity of PDIA3 but do not significantly affect its DNA binding activity. The use of several flavonoids differing in chemical structure and functional groups allows us to make some consideration about the relationship between ligand structure and the affinity for PDIA3. The specific flavone backbone conformation and the degree of polarity seem to play an important role for the interaction with PDIA3. The binding site is probably similar but not equivalent to that of green tea catechins, which, as previously demonstrated, can bind to PDIA3 and prevent its interaction with DNA.
28042572	Lamotrigine Reduces Inflammatory Response and Ameliorates Executive Function Deterioration in an Alzheimer's-Like Mouse Model.	Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been described in the literature, to be associated with impairment of executive function which develops early in the course of disease, and an effective treatment for this clinical feature remains elusive. Preclinical studies have implied that lamotrigine, an antiepileptic agent, could be a potential treatment for executive dysfunction in AD patients. Although there have been promising results in previous studies with lamotrigine, executive function has never been measured using animal models. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of lamotrigine on executive function and determine whether lamotrigine can attenuate inflammatory response in an AD mouse model. Nontransgenic and transgenic mice were treated with lamotrigine (0 or 30 mg/kg/day) in a standard laboratory chow diet starting at 3 months of age. After 6 months of continuous lamotrigine administration, there was a marked improvement in executive function and a significant attenuation in the expression of proinflammatory cytokines. These results suggest that lamotrigine could ameliorate executive dysfunction and brain inflammatory response in the mouse model of AD and early lamotrigine intervention may be a promising therapeutic strategy for AD.
28039523	High-sensitivity cardiac troponin I and NT-proBNP as predictors of incident dementia and Alzheimer's disease: the FINRISK Study.	Cardiac troponin and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) are known to associate with incident dementia. The purpose of our study was to examine whether high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I (hs-TnI) and NT-proBNP are associated with incident dementia and Alzheimer's disease (AD) independently of each other. Our study was a part of the national population-based health examination survey, FINRISK 1997, with a total sample of 7114 subjects, including 407 incident dementia cases and 319 AD cases during the follow-up time of 18 years. Using multivariate Cox regression analyses, we calculated the hazard ratios (HR) for hs-TnI and NT-proBNP. Analyses were adjusted for the previously known dementia/AD risk factors, including the apoE genotype. NT-proBNP was independently associated with incident dementia (HR 1.32, 95% CI 1.17-1.49) and AD (HR 1.30, 95% CI 1.13-1.5). Hs-TnI was also associated with incident dementia (HR 1.12, 95% CI 1.02-1.23), but not independent of NT-proBNP (HR 1.10, 95% CI 0.99-1.21). Hs-TnI was not associated with incident AD. The results remained similar in cause-specific Cox regression models and among subjects over 40 years of age. NT-proBNP and hs-TnI improved the reclassification of dementia risk in 10 years follow-up, and hs-TNI also in 18 years of follow-up. Neither hs-TnI nor NT-proBNP was able to outperform each other in risk reclassification of dementia. Both cardiovascular biomarkers, NT-proBNP and hs-TnI, were associated with incident dementia independently of traditional dementia risk factors including the apoE genotype. NT-proBNP was also associated with AD. Both markers offered a better dementia risk reclassification compared with traditional risk factors.
28034760	Insulin resistance in Alzheimer's disease.	The links between systemic insulin resistance (IR), brain-specific IR, and Alzheimer's disease (AD) have been an extremely productive area of current research. This review will cover the fundamentals and pathways leading to IR, its connection to AD via cellular mechanisms, the most prominent methods and models used to examine it, an introduction to the role of extracellular vesicles (EVs) as a source of biomarkers for IR and AD, and an overview of modern clinical studies on the subject. To provide additional context, we also present a novel analysis of the spatial correlation of gene expression in the brain with the aid of Allen Human Brain Atlas data. Ultimately, examining the relation between IR and AD can be seen as a means of advancing the understanding of both disease states, with IR being a promising target for therapeutic strategies in AD treatment. In conclusion, we highlight the therapeutic potential of targeting brain IR in AD and the main strategies to pursue this goal.
28033691	Memantine Enhances the Effect of Olanzapine in Patients With Schizophrenia: A Randomized, Placebo-Controlled Study.	Glutamate dysregulation may be involved in the neuropathology of schizophrenia. Memantine, a drug approved by the FDA for the treatment of moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease, acts as a partial uncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonist. The aim of this study was to examine the efficacy of memantine as an adjunctive treatment to olanzapine in patients with schizophrenia. In this double-blind, placebo-controlled studies, patients with schizophrenia according to DSM-IV clinical criteria were selected. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either memantine (week 1:10 mg/day; weeks 2-6:20 mg/day) plus olanzapine (15-20 mg/day) or olanzapine plus placebo. At baseline, no statistically significant difference regarding the mean total PANSS scores between treatment groups was found. Results showed that memantine significantly improved the positive and negative PANSS score in patients maintained on olanzapine after six weeks compared to olanzapine alone (P<0.001). Furthermore, female patients showed significantly better response than males, especially in positive PANSS score. No significant changes in extrapyramidal symptoms were observed.These findings indicate that olanzapine efficacy might be augmented with memantine. Furthermore, this effect is more remarkable in female patients with schizophrenia.
28026818	[The effect of neuroprotector isatin on binding of some model proteins with beta-amyloid peptide: a biosensor study].	The amyloid-beta peptide 1-42 formed during proteolytic processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) plays a key role in the development or progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other pathologies associated with formation of protein aggregates in the central nervous system. Recent proteomic profiling of mouse and rat brain preparations by means of beta-amyloid peptide immobilized on Affigel-10 revealed a large group of amyloid-binding proteins (n>80). Many (about 25%) of these proteins were previously identified as isatin-binding proteins. The aim of this study was to validate direct interaction between beta-amyloid peptide and highly purified intact and oxidized peroxiredoxin, M-type pyruvate kinase, alpha-enolase, and the effect of isatin on this interaction. The study performed using SPR-based Biacore 3000 and Biacore X100 biosensors has shown that all the proteins form molecular complexes with immobilized beta-amyloid peptide. The Kd values for these complexes varied from 8.36small ha, Cyrillic10-8 M (peroxiredoxin) to 1.97small ha, Cyrillic10-6 M (alpha-enolase). Oxidative modification of investigated proteins caused opposite effects on complexes of these peptides with beta-amyloid. The endogenous neuroprotector isatin increased dissociation of complexes formed by beta-amyloid peptide with both intact proteins (peroxiredoxin, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) and/or oxidized proteins (peroxiredoxin, pyruvate kinase) used in this study.
28025562	Cannabidiol Modulates the Expression of Alzheimer's Disease-Related Genes in Mesenchymal Stem Cells.	Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have emerged as a promising tool for the treatment of several neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). The main neuropathological hallmarks of AD are senile plaques, composed of amyloid beta (Abeta), and neurofibrillary tangles, formed by hyperphosphorylated tau. However, current therapies for AD have shown limited efficacy. In this study, we evaluated whether pre-treatment with cannabidiol (CBD), at 5 muM concentration, modulated the transcriptional profile of MSCs derived from gingiva (GMSCs) in order to improve their therapeutic potential, by performing a transcriptomic analysis by the next-generation sequencing (NGS) platform. By comparing the expression profiles between GMSCs treated with CBD (CBD-GMSCs) and control GMSCs (CTR-GMSCs), we found that CBD led to the downregulation of genes linked to AD, including genes coding for the kinases responsible of tau phosphorylation and for the secretases involved in Abeta generation. In parallel, immunocytochemistry analysis has shown that CBD inhibited the expression of GSK3beta, a central player in AD pathogenesis, by promoting PI3K/Akt signalling. In order to understand through which receptor CBD exerted these effects, we have performed pre-treatments with receptor antagonists for the cannabinoid receptors (SR141716A and AM630) or for the vanilloid receptor 1 (TRPVI). Here, we have proved that TRPV1 was able to mediate the modulatory effect of CBD on the PI3K/Akt/GSK3beta axis. In conclusion, we have found that pre-treatment with CBD prevented the expression of proteins potentially involved in tau phosphorylation and Abeta production in GMSCs. Therefore, we suggested that GMSCs preconditioned with CBD possess a molecular profile that might be more beneficial for the treatment of AD.
28025519	Development and Structural Modification of BACE1 Inhibitors.	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder which usually occurs in the elderly. The accumulation of beta-amyloid and the formation of neurofibrillary tangles are considered as the main pathogenies of AD. Research suggests that beta-secretase 1 (BACE1) plays an important role in the formation of beta-amyloid. Discovery of new BACE1 inhibitors has become a significant method to slow down the progression of AD or even cure this kind of disease. This review summarizes the different types and the structural modification of these new BACE1 inhibitors.
28009247	The Legal Implications of Detecting Alzheimer's Disease Earlier.	Early detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD) raises a number of challenging legal questions. In this essay, we explore some of those questions, such as: Is a neurological indicator of increased risk for AD a legally relevant brain state before there are any outward behavioral manifestations? How should courts address evidentiary challenges to the admissibility of AD-related neuroimaging? How should the government regulate the marketing of neuroimaging diagnostic tools? How should insurance coverage for the use of these new tools be optimized? We suggest that many voices and multidisciplinary perspectives are needed to answer these questions and ensure that legal responses are swift, efficient, and equitable.
28008255	Rescuing cholinergic neurons from apoptotic degeneration by targeting of serotonin modulator-and apolipoprotein E-conjugated liposomes to the hippocampus.	beta-Amyloid (Abeta)-targeting liposomes (LIP) with surface serotonin modulator (SM) and apolipoprotein E (ApoE) were utilized to facilitate the delivery of nerve growth factor (NGF) across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) for neuroprotection in the hippocampus. The therapeutic efficacy of SM- and ApoE-grafted LIP carrying NGF (NGF-SM-ApoE-LIP) was assessed by an in vitro Alzheimer's disease (AD) model of degenerated SK-N-MC cells and an in vivo AD model of Abeta-insulted Wistar rats. The experimental evidences revealed that the modified SM and ApoE on the surface of LIP increased the permeation of NGF across the BBB without serious damage to structural integrity of tight junction. When compared with free NGF, NGF-SM-ApoE-LIP upregulated the expression of phosphorylated neurotrophic tyrosine kinase receptor type 1 on cholinergic neurons and significantly improved their survival. In addition, NGF-SM-ApoE-LIP could reduce the secretion of acetylcholinesterase and malondialdehyde and rescue hippocampal neurons from apoptosis in rat brains. The synergistic effect of SM and ApoE is promising in the induction of NGF to inhibit the neurotoxicity of Abeta and NGF-SM-ApoE-LIP can be a potent antiapoptotic pharmacotherapy for clinical care of patients with AD.
28008242	A genetic screen of the mutations in the Korean patients with early-onset Alzheimer's disease.	Early-onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD) has distinct clinical characteristics in comparison to late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD). The genetic contribution is suggested to be more potent in EOAD. However, the frequency of causative mutations in EOAD could be variable depending on studies. Moreover, no mutation screening study has been performed yet employing large population in Korea. Previously, we reported that the rate of family history of dementia in EOAD patients was 18.7% in a nationwide hospital-based cohort study, the Clinical Research Center for Dementia of South Korea (CREDOS) study. This rate is much lower than in other countries and is even comparable to the frequency of LOAD patients in our country. To understand the genetic characteristics of EOAD in Korea, we screened the common Alzheimer's disease (AD) mutations in the consecutive EOAD subjects from the CREDOS study from April 2012 to February 2014. We checked the sequence of APP (exons 16-17), PSEN1 (exons 3-12), and PSEN2 (exons 3-12) genes. We identified different causative or probable pathogenic AD mutations, PSEN1 T116I, PSEN1 L226F, and PSEN2 V214L, employing 24 EOAD subjects with a family history and 80 without a family history of dementia. PSEN1 T116I case demonstrated autosomal dominant trait of inheritance, with at least 11 affected individuals over 2 generations. However, there was no family history of dementia within first-degree relation in PSEN1 L226F and PSEN2 V214L cases. Approximately, 55.7% of the EOAD subjects had APOE epsilon4 allele, while none of the mutation-carrying subjects had the allele. The frequency of genetic mutation in this study is lower compared to the studies from other countries. The study design that was based on nationwide cohort, which minimizes selection bias, is thought to be one of the contributors to the lower frequency of genetic mutation. However, the possibility of the greater likeliness of earlier onset of sporadic AD in Korea cannot be excluded. We suggest early AD onset and not carrying APOE epsilon4 allele are more reliable factors for predicting an induced genetic mutation than the presence of the family history in Korean EOAD population.
28004107	Humulus japonicus inhibits the progression of Alzheimer's disease in a APP/PS1 transgenic mouse model.	Humulus japonicus Siebold & Zucc. (HJ) has traditionally been administered to patients with pulmonary disease, skin disease and hypertension in Korea, and it is considered to exert anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antimicrobial and antimycobacterial effects. However, its effects against Alzheimer's disease (AD) have yet to be explored. Thus, this study was carried out to investigate whether HJ has a beneficial effect on the progression of AD in an animal model. A methanolic extract of HJ (500 mg/kg/day) was intragastrically administered to 5-month-old APP/PS1 transgenic (Tg-APP/PS1) mice for 2.5 months. Novel object recognition and Y-maze alteration tests were used to assess cognitive function, and an immunohistochemical assay was performed to assess amyloid beta (Abeta)deposition, tau phosphorylation and gliosis. An in vitro assay using a microglial cell line was also performed to investigate the anti-inflammatory effects of HJ. Our results revealed that HJ significantly decreased the mRNA and protein expression levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha), interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6 and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) induced by lipopolysaccharide in the microglial cell line. The administration of HJ for 2 months improved the cognitive function of Tg-APP/PS1 mice. HJ notably reduced the area occupied by Abeta and neurofibrillary tangles, and the number of activated astrocytes and microglia in the cortex of Tg-APP/PS1 mice. The findings of our study suggest that HJ has the therapeutic potential to inhibit the progression of AD and to improve cognitive deterioration in Tg-APP/PS1 mice.
28003035	The Ontario Neurodegenerative Disease Research Initiative (ONDRI).	Because individuals develop dementia as a manifestation of neurodegenerative or neurovascular disorder, there is a need to develop reliable approaches to their identification. We are undertaking an observational study (Ontario Neurodegenerative Disease Research Initiative [ONDRI]) that includes genomics, neuroimaging, and assessments of cognition as well as language, speech, gait, retinal imaging, and eye tracking. Disorders studied include Alzheimer's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, frontotemporal dementia, Parkinson's disease, and vascular cognitive impairment. Data from ONDRI will be collected into the Brain-CODE database to facilitate correlative analysis. ONDRI will provide a repertoire of endophenotyped individuals that will be a unique, publicly available resource.
27999413	Neuroprotection via Reduction in Stress: Altered Menstrual Patterns as a Marker for Stress and Implications for Long-Term Neurologic Health in Women.	Individuals under chronic psychological stress can be difficult to identify clinically. There is often no outwardly visible phenotype. Chronic stress of sufficient magnitude not only impacts reproductive function, but also concomitantly elicits a constellation of neuroendocrine changes that may accelerate aging in general and brain aging in particular. Functional hypothalamic amenorrhea, a phenotypically recognizable form of stress, is due to stress-induced suppression of endogenous gonadotropin-releasing hormone secretion. Reversal of functional hypothalamic amenorrhea includes restoration of ovulatory ovarian function and fertility and amelioration of hypercortisolism and hypothyroidism. Taken together, recovery from functional hypothalamic amenorrhea putatively offers neuroprotection and ameliorates stress-induced premature brain aging and possibly syndromic Alzheimer's disease. Amenorrhea may be viewed as a sentinel indicator of stress. Hypothalamic hypogonadism is less clinically evident in men and the diagnosis is difficult to establish. Whether there are other sex differences in the impact of stress on brain aging remains to be better investigated, but it is likely that both low estradiol from stress-induced anovulation and low testosterone from stress-induced hypogonadism compromise brain health.
27999408	Cyclodextrins as Emerging Therapeutic Tools in the Treatment of Cholesterol-Associated Vascular and Neurodegenerative Diseases.	Cardiovascular diseases, like atherosclerosis, and neurodegenerative diseases affecting the central nervous system (CNS) are closely linked to alterations of cholesterol metabolism. Therefore, innovative pharmacological approaches aiming at counteracting cholesterol imbalance display promising therapeutic potential. However, these approaches need to take into account the existence of biological barriers such as intestinal and blood-brain barriers which participate in the organ homeostasis and are major defense systems against xenobiotics. Interest in cyclodextrins (CDs) as medicinal agents has increased continuously based on their ability to actively extract lipids from cell membranes and to provide suitable carrier system for drug delivery. Many novel CD derivatives are constantly generated with the objective to improve CD bioavailability, biocompatibility and therapeutic outcomes. Newly designed drug formulation complexes incorporating CDs as drug carriers have demonstrated better efficiency in treating cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases. CD-based therapies as cholesterol-sequestrating agent have recently demonstrated promising advances with KLEPTOSE(R) CRYSMEB in atherosclerosis as well as with the 2-hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin (HPbetaCD) in clinical trials for Niemann-Pick type C disease. Based on this success, many investigations evaluating the therapeutical beneficial of CDs in Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Huntington's diseases are currently on-going.
27999380	Meta-Analysis of Milk Consumption and the Risk of Cognitive Disorders.	The association between milk intake and cognitive disorders has been investigated in several epidemiological studies, but the findings are still conflicting. No quantitative assessment has been performed to evaluate the potential relationship of milk intake and cognitive disorders. From the inception to October 2016, the PubMed and the Embase databases were searched for observational studies reporting the association of milk consumption and cognitive disorders (Alzheimer's disease, dementia, and cognitive decline/impairment). A generic inverse-variance random-effects method was used to pool the Odds Ratios (ORs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the highest compared with the lowest level of milk intake. Subgroup and meta-regression analyses were used to assess the heterogeneity between subgroups. We identified seven articles involving a total of 10,941 participants. The highest level of milk consumption was significantly associated with a decreased risk of cognitive disorders, and the pooled OR (95% CI) was 0.72 (0.56, 0.93), with evidence of significant heterogeneity (I(2) = 64%, p = 0.001). Subgroup analysis indicated that the association was more pronounced in ischemic stroke patients based on a single study. Furthermore, the inverse association between milk intake and cognitive disorders was limited to Asian subjects, and the African populations showed an intermediate non-significant trend. Although we have obtained a significant association, an established relationship cannot be drawn due to the study limitation. Large prospective studies are needed to quantify the potential dose-response patterns of milk intake and to explore the association in populations with different characteristics.
27999310	Effect of Estradiol on Neurotrophin Receptors in Basal Forebrain Cholinergic Neurons: Relevance for Alzheimer's Disease.	The basal forebrain is home to the largest population of cholinergic neurons in the brain. These neurons are involved in a number of cognitive functions including attention, learning and memory. Basal forebrain cholinergic neurons (BFCNs) are particularly vulnerable in a number of neurological diseases with the most notable being Alzheimer's disease, with evidence for a link between decreasing cholinergic markers and the degree of cognitive impairment. The neurotrophin growth factor system is present on these BFCNs and has been shown to promote survival and differentiation on these neurons. Clinical and animal model studies have demonstrated the neuroprotective effects of 17beta-estradiol (E2) on neurodegeneration in BFCNs. It is believed that E2 interacts with neurotrophin signaling on cholinergic neurons to mediate these beneficial effects. Evidence presented in our recent study confirms that altering the levels of circulating E2 levels via ovariectomy and E2 replacement significantly affects the expression of the neurotrophin receptors on BFCN. However, we also showed that E2 differentially regulates neurotrophin receptor expression on BFCNs with effects depending on neurotrophin receptor type and neuroanatomical location. In this review, we aim to survey the current literature to understand the influence of E2 on the neurotrophin system, and the receptors and signaling pathways it mediates on BFCN. In addition, we summarize the physiological and pathophysiological significance of E2 actions on the neurotrophin system in BFCN, especially focusing on changes related to Alzheimer's disease.
27999295	Special Issue: "Molecules against Alzheimer".	This Special Issue, entitled "Molecules against Alzheimer", gathers a number of original articles, short communications, and review articles on recent research efforts toward the development of novel drug candidates, diagnostic agents and therapeutic approaches for Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder and a leading cause of death worldwide. This Special Issue contains many interesting examples describing the design, synthesis, and pharmacological profiling of novel compounds that hit one or several key biological targets, such as cholinesterases, beta-amyloid formation or aggregation, monoamine oxidase B, oxidative stress, biometal dyshomeostasis, mitochondrial dysfunction, serotonin and/or melatonin systems, the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway, sigma receptors, nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase, or nuclear erythroid 2-related factor. The development of novel AD diagnostic agents based on tau protein imaging and the use of lithium or intranasal insulin for the prevention or the symptomatic treatment of AD is also covered in some articles of the Special Issue.
27988430	Kinin receptors: Key regulators of autoimmunity.	The central function of the immune system is to protect the host from environmental agents such as microbes or chemicals, thereby preserving the integrity of the body, and preventing the onset of illness and infection. Moreover, the immune system is constantly challenged to discriminate self vs. non-self and mediate the correct response, a phenomenon called self-tolerance. The failure of mechanisms responsible for self-tolerance and induction of an immune response against components of the self, induces autoimmunity and culminates however, in several autoimmune diseases. The precise etiology of autoimmune diseases is not known, although the classic sign of an autoimmune disease is inflammation. In this context, kinins are a family of peptides involved in different physiological and pathological states, comprising inflammatory, vascular and pain processes, and are highly relevant as well as to a variety of diseases including hypertension, kidney diseases, Alzheimer's disease, cancer, obesity, epilepsy and traumatic injuries. These kinin effects are mediated by two related G-protein-coupled receptors named the bradykinin receptors (BKRs), B1 and B2. The kallikrein-kinin system (KKS) and their receptors appear to be involved in both the development and progression of autoimmune diseases, suggesting that modulators of BKRs, administered in monotherapy or in combination with existing therapies, may represent a potential new venue for an effective autoimmune disease treatment. This review article highlights historical and recent progress in understanding the role of BKRs as potential therapeutics for a number of autoimmune diseases, including multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, type I diabetes mellitus, inflammatory bowel diseases, and others.
27986224	Altered blood-brain barrier transport in neuro-inflammatory disorders.	During neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory disorders of the central nervous system (CNS), such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and multiple sclerosis (MS), the protective function of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) may be severely impaired. The general neuro-inflammatory response, ranging from activation of glial cells to immune cell infiltration that is frequently associated with such brain diseases may underlie the loss of the integrity and function of the BBB. Consequentially, the delivery and disposition of drugs to the brain will be altered and may influence the treatment efficiency of such diseases. Altered BBB transport of drugs into the CNS during diseases may be the result of changes in both specific transport and non-specific transport pathways. Potential alterations in transport routes like adsorptive mediated endocytosis and receptor-mediated endocytosis may affect drug delivery to the brain. As such, drugs that normally are unable to traverse the BBB may reach their target in the diseased brain due to increased permeability. In contrast, the delivery of (targeted) drugs could be hampered during inflammatory conditions due to disturbed transport mechanisms. Therefore, the inventory of the neuro-inflammatory status of the neurovasculature (or recovery thereof) is of utmost importance in choosing and designing an adequate drug targeting strategy under disease conditions. Within this review we will briefly discuss how the function of the BBB can be affected during disease and how this may influence the delivery of drugs into the diseased CNS.
27983596	Estrogenic Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals Influencing NRF1 Regulated Gene Networks in the Development of Complex Human Brain Diseases.	During the development of an individual from a single cell to prenatal stages to adolescence to adulthood and through the complete life span, humans are exposed to countless environmental and stochastic factors, including estrogenic endocrine disrupting chemicals. Brain cells and neural circuits are likely to be influenced by estrogenic endocrine disruptors (EEDs) because they strongly dependent on estrogens. In this review, we discuss both environmental, epidemiological, and experimental evidence on brain health with exposure to oral contraceptives, hormonal therapy, and EEDs such as bisphenol-A (BPA), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), phthalates, and metalloestrogens, such as, arsenic, cadmium, and manganese. Also we discuss the brain health effects associated from exposure to EEDs including the promotion of neurodegeneration, protection against neurodegeneration, and involvement in various neurological deficits; changes in rearing behavior, locomotion, anxiety, learning difficulties, memory issues, and neuronal abnormalities. The effects of EEDs on the brain are varied during the entire life span and far-reaching with many different mechanisms. To understand endocrine disrupting chemicals mechanisms, we use bioinformatics, molecular, and epidemiologic approaches. Through those approaches, we learn how the effects of EEDs on the brain go beyond known mechanism to disrupt the circulatory and neural estrogen function and estrogen-mediated signaling. Effects on EEDs-modified estrogen and nuclear respiratory factor 1 (NRF1) signaling genes with exposure to natural estrogen, pharmacological estrogen-ethinyl estradiol, PCBs, phthalates, BPA, and metalloestrogens are presented here. Bioinformatics analysis of gene-EEDs interactions and brain disease associations identified hundreds of genes that were altered by exposure to estrogen, phthalate, PCBs, BPA or metalloestrogens. Many genes modified by EEDs are common targets of both 17 beta-estradiol (E2) and NRF1. Some of these genes are involved with brain diseases, such as Alzheimer's Disease (AD), Parkinson's Disease, Huntington's Disease, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, Autism Spectrum Disorder, and Brain Neoplasms. For example, the search of enriched pathways showed that top ten E2 interacting genes in AD-APOE, APP, ATP5A1, CALM1, CASP3, GSK3B, IL1B, MAPT, PSEN2 and TNF-underlie the enrichment of the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) AD pathway. With AD, the six E2-responsive genes are NRF1 target genes: APBB2, DPYSL2, EIF2S1, ENO1, MAPT, and PAXIP1. These genes are also responsive to the following EEDs: ethinyl estradiol (APBB2, DPYSL2, EIF2S1, ENO1, MAPT, and PAXIP1), BPA (APBB2, EIF2S1, ENO1, MAPT, and PAXIP1), dibutyl phthalate (DPYSL2, EIF2S1, and ENO1), diethylhexyl phthalate (DPYSL2 and MAPT). To validate findings from Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD) curated data, we used Bayesian network (BN) analysis on microarray data of AD patients. We observed that both gender and NRF1 were associated with AD. The female NRF1 gene network is completely different from male human AD patients. AD-associated NRF1 target genes-APLP1, APP, GRIN1, GRIN2B, MAPT, PSEN2, PEN2, and IDE-are also regulated by E2. NRF1 regulates targets genes with diverse functions, including cell growth, apoptosis/autophagy, mitochondrial biogenesis, genomic instability, neurogenesis, neuroplasticity, synaptogenesis, and senescence. By activating or repressing the genes involved in cell proliferation, growth suppression, DNA damage/repair, apoptosis/autophagy, angiogenesis, estrogen signaling, neurogenesis, synaptogenesis, and senescence, and inducing a wide range of DNA damage, genomic instability and DNA methylation and transcriptional repression, NRF1 may act as a major regulator of EEDs-induced brain health deficits. In summary, estrogenic endocrine disrupting chemicals-modified genes in brain health deficits are part of both estrogen and NRF1 signaling pathways. Our findings suggest that in addition to estrogen signaling, EEDs influencing NRF1 regulated communities of genes across genomic and epigenomic multiple networks may contribute in the development of complex chronic human brain health disorders.
27981914	Serum Testosterone and Cognitive Function in Ageing Male: Updating the Evidence.	BACKGROUND: Testosterone (T) deficit, either in prepubertal or postpubertal form of hypogonadism, seems to play a key role in impairing cognitive function, including memory, attention, language and visuospatial abilities, especially in elderly men. OBJECTIVE: Several studies have recently showed the association between low serum T levels and important cognitive dysfunctions in ageing male as well as in subjects suffering from Alzheimer's disease (AD), mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and even depression, suggesting that T could exert an active neuroprotective role. METHODS: By searching PubMed and recent patents (ranging from 2010 to 2015), we identified several observational and intervention studies dealing with T and cognitive function in adult and ageing men. Findings were reviewed, thoroughly examined and, finally, summarized herein. RESULTS: Although a large number of studies have been carried out so far, conclusive evidence cannot be drawn, in particular, for cognitive disorders in males. Conversely, T supplementation has been suggested for depressive syndrome in young and ageing men. To date, no clinical data have been carried out on cognitive dysfunctions employing the quoted patents in men. CONCLUSIONS: Studies aiming to evaluate the role of serum T and its supplementation in adult and ageing men with T deficiency syndrome need to be encouraged, given that subjects affected by overt hypogonadism, either in prepubertal (i.e. Klinefelter syndrome) or postpubertal forms (chemical castration in subjects affected by prostate cancer), often complain of cognitive dysfunction, and seem to considerably benefit from T replacement therapy.
27981677	Provoked and spontaneous confabulations in Alzheimer's disease: An examination of their prevalence and relation with general cognitive and executive functioning.	AIM: A dissociation can be made between confabulations that are produced when the subject is directly questioned (i.e., provoked confabulations) and context-free, unprovoked confabulations (i.e., spontaneous confabulations). Unlike provoked confabulations, there is a paucity of research on spontaneous confabulations in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Our paper assessed this issue by assessing both types of confabulation in participants with mild to moderate AD and controls. METHODS: Provoked confabulations were evaluated with questions probing personal and general knowledge, whereas spontaneous confabulations were rated by nursing and medical staff. RESULTS: Findings showed more provoked confabulations in AD participants than in controls. Only occasional appearance of spontaneous confabulations was observed in the AD participants. Further, spontaneous confabulations in AD participants were significantly correlated with general cognitive functioning, but not with executive functioning. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that spontaneous confabulations in AD are relatively rare, at least in the mild to moderate stage of the disease.
27973419	Potential Links between Impaired One-Carbon Metabolism Due to Polymorphisms, Inadequate B-Vitamin Status, and the Development of Alzheimer's Disease.	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the major cause of dementia and no preventive or effective treatment has been established to date. The etiology of AD is poorly understood, but genetic and environmental factors seem to play a role in its onset and progression. In particular, factors affecting the one-carbon metabolism (OCM) are thought to be important and elevated homocysteine (Hcy) levels, indicating impaired OCM, have been associated with AD. We aimed at evaluating the role of polymorphisms of key OCM enzymes in the etiology of AD, particularly when intakes of relevant B-vitamins are inadequate. Our review indicates that a range of compensatory mechanisms exist to maintain a metabolic balance. However, these become overwhelmed if the activity of more than one enzyme is reduced due to genetic factors or insufficient folate, riboflavin, vitamin B6 and/or vitamin B12 levels. Consequences include increased Hcy levels and reduced capacity to synthetize, methylate and repair DNA, and/or modulated neurotransmission. This seems to favor the development of hallmarks of AD particularly when combined with increased oxidative stress e.g., in apolipoprotein E (ApoE) epsilon4 carriers. However, as these effects can be compensated at least partially by adequate intakes of B-vitamins, achieving optimal B-vitamin status for the general population should be a public health priority.
27967267	Recent advances in acetylcholinesterase Inhibitors and Reactivators: an update on the patent literature (2012-2015).	INTRODUCTION: Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is the major enzyme that hydrolyzes acetylcholine, a key neurotransmitter for synaptic transmission, into acetic acid and choline. Mild inhibition of AChE has been shown to have therapeutic relevance in Alzheimer's disease (AD), myasthenia gravis, and glaucoma among others. In contrast, strong inhibition of AChE can lead to cholinergic poisoning. To combat this, AChE reactivators have to be developed to remove the offending AChE inhibitor, restoring acetylcholine levels to normal. Areas covered: This article covers recent advances in the development of acetylcholinesterase modulators, including both inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase for the efforts in development of new chemical entities for treatment of AD, as well as re-activators for resurrection of organophosphate bound acetylcholinesterase. Expert opinion: Over the past three years, research efforts have continued to identify novel small molecules as AChE inhibitors for both CNS and peripheral diseases. The more recent patent activity has focused on three AChE ligand design areas: derivatives of known AChE ligands, natural product based scaffolds and multifunctional ligands, all of which have produced some unique chemical matter with AChE inhibition activities in the mid picomolar to low micromolar ranges. New AChE inhibitors with polypharmacology or dual inhibitory activity have also emerged as highlighted by new AChE inhibitors with dual activity at L-type calcium channels, GSK-3, BACE1 and H3, although most only show low micromolar activity, thus further research is warranted. New small molecule reactivators of organophosphate-inhibited AChE have also been disclosed, which focused on the design of neutral ligands with improved pharmaceutical properties and blood-brain barrier (BBB) penetration. Gratifyingly, some research in this area is moving away from the traditional quaternary pyridinium oximes AChE reactivators, while still employing the necessary reactivation group (oximes). However, selectivity over inhibition of native AChE enzyme, effectiveness of reactivation, broad-spectrum reactivation against multiple organophosphates and reactivation of aged-enzyme continue to be hurdles for this area of research.
27966045	Inter-rater variability of visual interpretation and comparison with quantitative evaluation of 11C-PiB PET amyloid images of the Japanese Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (J-ADNI) multicenter study.	PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to assess the inter-rater variability of the visual interpretation of 11C-PiB PET images regarding the positivity/negativity of amyloid deposition that were obtained in a multicenter clinical research project, Japanese Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (J-ADNI). The results of visual interpretation were also compared with a semi-automatic quantitative analysis using mean cortical standardized uptake value ratio to the cerebellar cortex (mcSUVR). METHODS: A total of 162 11C-PiB PET scans, including 45 mild Alzheimer's disease, 60 mild cognitive impairment, and 57 normal cognitive control cases that had been acquired as J-ADNI baseline scans were analyzed. Based on visual interpretation by three independent raters followed by consensus read, each case was classified into positive, equivocal, and negative deposition (ternary criteria) and further dichotomized by merging the former two (binary criteria). RESULTS: Complete agreement of visual interpretation by the three raters was observed for 91.3% of the cases (Cohen kappa = 0.88 on average) in ternary criteria and for 92.3% (kappa = 0.89) in binary criteria. Cases that were interpreted as visually positive in the consensus read showed significantly higher mcSUVR than those visually negative (2.21 +/- 0.37 vs. 1.27 +/- 0.09, p < 0.001), and positive or negative decision by visual interpretation was dichotomized by a cut-off value of mcSUVR = 1.5. Significant positive/negative associations were observed between mcSUVR and the number of raters who evaluated as positive (rho = 0.87, p < 0.0001) and negative (rho = -0.85, p < 0.0001) interpretation. Cases of disagreement among raters showed generally low mcSUVR. CONCLUSIONS: Inter-rater agreement was almost perfect in 11C-PiB PET scans. Positive or negative decision by visual interpretation was dichotomized by a cut-off value of mcSUVR = 1.5. As some cases of disagreement among raters tended to show low mcSUVR, referring to quantitative method may facilitate correct diagnosis when evaluating images of low amyloid deposition.
27959440	kappacarrageenanderived pentasaccharide attenuates Abeta2535induced apoptosis in SHSY5Y cells via suppression of the JNK signaling pathway.	beta-amyloid (Abeta)-mediated neuronal apoptosis is an important pathological feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Inhibiting apoptosis induced by Abeta may lead to the development of a potential therapeutic target for AD treatment. kappacarrageenanderived pentasaccharide (KCP) extracted from marine red algae is involved in a variety of biological activities and may be an effective in the treatment of AD. The present study aimed to investigate the neuroprotective effect of KCP against Abeta2535induced neurotoxicity in SHSY5Y cells, and to examine the potential underlying mechanisms. The results of the present study revealed that pretreatment with KCP significantly attenuated Abeta2535induced loss of cell viability and apoptosis, as evaluated by MTT assays and annexin V/propidium iodide staining, respectively, in a dosedependent manner. Furthermore, KCP downregulated the protein expression levels of Abeta2535induced cleavage caspase 3 by inhibiting the overactivation of the JNK signaling pathway. The results of the present study indicated that KCP attenuated Abeta2535induced neuroblastoma cell cytotoxicity, suggesting that KCP may be a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of AD.
27951490	2,4-Disubstituted quinazolines as amyloid-beta aggregation inhibitors with dual cholinesterase inhibition and antioxidant properties: Development and structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies.	A library of fifty-seven 2,4-disubstituted quinazoline derivatives were designed, synthesized and evaluated as a novel class of multi-targeting agents to treat Alzheimer's disease (AD). The biological assay results demonstrate the ability of several quinazoline derivatives to inhibit both acetyl and butyrylcholinesterase (AChE and BuChE) enzymes (IC50 range = 1.6-30.5 muM), prevent beta-amyloid (Abeta) aggregation (IC50 range 270 nM-16.7 muM) and exhibit antioxidant properties (34-63.4% inhibition at 50 muM). Compound 9 (N2-(1-benzylpiperidin-4-yl)-N4-(3,4-dimethoxybenzyl)quinazoline-2,4-diamine) was identified as a dual inhibitor of cholinesterases (AChE IC50 = 2.1 muM; BuChE IC50 = 8.3 muM) and exhibited good inhibition of Abeta aggregation (Abeta40 IC50 = 2.3 muM). Compound 15b (4-(benzylamino)quinazolin-2-ol) was the most potent Abeta aggregation inhibitor (Abeta40 IC50 = 270 nM) and was approximately 4 and 1.4-fold more potent compared to the reference agents curcumin and resveratrol. These comprehensive structure activity-relationship (SAR) studies demonstrate the application of a 2,4-disubstituted quinazoline ring as a suitable template to develop multi-targeting agents to treat AD.
27951485	Aurone Mannich base derivatives as promising multifunctional agents with acetylcholinesterase inhibition, anti-beta-amyloid aggragation and neuroprotective properties for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.	A series of aurone Mannich base derivatives were designed, synthesized and evaluated as multifunctional agents for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. In vitro assays demonstrated that most of the derivatives were selective AChE inhibitors with good multifunctional properties. Among them, compound 7d exhibited outstanding inhibitory activity for RatAChE, EeAChE and HuAChE (IC50 = 0.00878 +/- 0.0002 muM, 0.0212 +/- 0.006 muM and 0.0371 +/- 0.004 muM, respectively). Moreover, 7d displayed high antioxidant activity and could confer significant neuroprotective effect against H2O2-induced PC-12 cell injury. In addition, 7d also showed biometal chelating abilities, good self- and Cu2+-induced Abeta1-42 aggregation inhibitory potency and high BBB permeability. These multifunctional properties highlight 7d as promising candidate for further studies directed to the development of novel drugs against AD.
27943459	Protective roles of melatonin in central nervous system diseases by regulation of neural stem cells.	Neural stem cells (NSCs) are immature precursors of the central nervous system (CNS), with self-renewal and multipotential differentiation abilities. Their proliferation and differentiation are dynamically regulated by hormonal and local factors. Alteration in neurogenesis is associated with many neurological disorders. Increasing evidence suggests that modulation of NSCs can be a promising therapeutic approach for neural injury and neurodegenerative disorders. Melatonin, a pineal gland-derived hormone, regulates the neuroimmuno-endocrine axis and is functionally important to the circadian rhythm, tumour suppression and immunity. In the CNS, melatonin exerts neuroprotective effects in many diseases, such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease and ischaemic brain injury. Emerging evidence suggests that it might also mediate such protective action by influencing proliferation and differentiation of NSCs. In this article, we review the current literature concerned with effects of melatonin on NSCs in different physiological and pathological conditions.
27943027	FTY720 Attenuates 6-OHDA-Associated Dopaminergic Degeneration in Cellular and Mouse Parkinsonian Models.	FTY720 (fingolimod) is the first oral drug approved for treating relapsing-remitting forms of multiple sclerosis. It is also protective in other neurological models including ischemia, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington disease and Rett syndrome. However, whether it might protect in a 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) mouse model associated with the dopaminergic pathology of Parkinson's disease (PD), has not been explored. Therefore, in the present study, we investigated the effects of FTY720 on 6-OHDA-induced neurotoxicity in cell cultures and mice. Here we show that FTY720 protected against 6-OHDA cytotoxicity and apoptosis in SH-SY5Y cells. We also show that prior administration of FTY720 to 6-OHDA lesioned mice ameliorated both motor deficits and nigral dopaminergic neurotoxicity, while also reducing 6-OHDA-associated inflammation. The protective effects of FTY720 were associated with activation of AKT and ERK1/2 pro-survival pathways and an increase in brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression in vitro and in vivo. These findings suggest that FTY720 holds promise as a PD therapeutic acting, at least in part, through AKT/ERK1/2/P-CREB-associated BDNF expression.
27941618	Aquaporins in the Spinal Cord.	Aquaporins (AQPs) are water channel proteins robustly expressed in the central nervous system (CNS). A number of previous studies described the cellular expression sites and investigated their major roles and function in the brain and spinal cord. Among thirteen different mammalian AQPs, AQP1 and AQP4 have been mainly studied in the CNS and evidence has been presented that they play important roles in the pathogenesis of CNS injury, edema and multiple diseases such as multiple sclerosis, neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, glioblastoma multiforme, Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. The objective of this review is to highlight the current knowledge about AQPs in the spinal cord and their proposed roles in pathophysiology and pathogenesis related to spinal cord lesions and injury.
27941373	Added Value of Combined Semi-Quantitative and Visual [123I]FP-CIT SPECT Analyses for the Diagnosis of Dementia With Lewy Bodies.	PURPOSE OF THE REPORT: To assess the validity of a semi-quantitative I-FP-CIT SPECT method, compared to the commonly used visual analysis, in patients with probable dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). We also studied DLB specific uptake impairment pattern and correlation of uptake in the presence or absence of parkinsonism. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Among 1202 scans performed at our center from 2003 to 2015, we identified 93 subjects with probable DLB (mean age 76.9 +/- 6.8 years, 37% women) and 18 with AD (mean age 76.9 +/- 8.1 years, 50% women). Independent visual and semi-quantitative assessments based on previously established on-site reference values (including volumes-of-interest uptake, caudate-to-putamen ratio and striatal asymmetry index) were performed and compared between both groups. RESULTS: Visual staging was considered abnormal in 96.8% of DLB patients, whereas 97.8% of subjects had an abnormal semi-quantitative assessment. Combining both methods yielded a 100% sensitivity. Patients with DLB exhibited a more pronounced impairment of putaminal uptake when associated with parkinsonism, whereas a more diffuse pattern and significantly higher uptake values were observed in the subgroup of DLB patients without parkinsonism (resp. striatal uptake 1.61 +/- 0.66 vs. 2.28 +/- 0.52, P = 0.01). A minority of AD subjects show minimal alterations of presynaptic dopaminergic transport (striatal uptake 3.07 +/- 0.41), values being always significantly higher than those from DLB patients, irrespective of the presence of parkinsonism (P < 0.0001) or not (P = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: Additional use of semi-quantitative analysis allows a higher discrimination of DLB from AD and demonstrates a specific pattern of degeneration in DLB patients according to their motor phenotype.
27940419	Novel CLK1 inhibitors based on N-aryloxazol-2-amine skeleton - A possible way to dual VEGFR2 TK/CLK ligands.	BACKGROUND: Inhibitors of CLK protein kinases suppress cell growth and induce apoptosis by modulating pre-mRNA splicing in cancer. CLK family kinases are also involved in alternative splicing and RNA processing in Duchenne muscular dystrophy, Alzheimer's disease, HIV-1, and influenza virus. Small inhibitors are valuable tools for better understanding the molecular mechanisms of splicing and may serve as seeds for a novel class of therapeutics. ACHIEVEMENTS: Here we describe a discovery of four novel CLK1 inhibitors possessing N-aryloxazol-2-amine skeleton. Their activity against CLK1 (IC50: 20, 30, 40 and 80 nM) and some other CMGC kinases, predicted CLK binding poses, synthesis and physico-chemical characteristics are also stated. Additionally analysis of all PDB available CLK structures and interactions of their ligands was performed. There are only few powerful dual CLK/VEGFR inhibitors known in the literature. We proposed that our inhibitors have similar binding places and interactions in CLK1, 3 and VEGFR2 TK mostly due to the joint N-aryloxazol-2-amine pharmacophoric fragment. One of our N-aryloxazol-2-amines already proved a good activity against both VEGFR2 and CLK1 enzymes (23/80 nM, resp). We proposed that the presented class of compounds has a potential to be developed in dual VEGFR2/CLK clinical compounds with prospective synergy to treat cancer.
27938491	Regulator of Cell Cycle (RGCC) Expression During the Progression of Alzheimer's Disease.	Unscheduled cell cycle reentry of postmitotic neurons has been described in cases of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) and may form a basis for selective neuronal vulnerability during disease progression. In this regard, the multifunctional protein regulator of cell cycle (RGCC) has been implicated in driving G1/S and G2/M phase transitions through its interactions with cdc/cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (cdk1) and is induced by p53, which mediates apoptosis in neurons. We tested whether RGCC levels were dysregulated in frontal cortex samples obtained postmortem from subjects who died with a clinical diagnosis of no cognitive impairment (NCI), MCI, or AD. RGCC mRNA and protein levels were upregulated by approximately 50%-60% in MCI and AD compared to NCI, and RGCC protein levels were associated with poorer antemortem global cognitive performance in the subjects examined. To test whether RGCC might regulate neuronal cell cycle reentry and apoptosis, we differentiated neuronotypic PC12 cultures with nerve growth factor (NGF) followed by NGF withdrawal to induce abortive cell cycle activation and cell death. Experimental reduction of RGCC levels increased cell survival and reduced levels of the cdk1 target cyclin B1. RGCC may be a candidate cell cycle target for neuroprotection during the onset of AD.
27936965	AVP-786 for the treatment of agitation in dementia of the Alzheimer's type.	INTRODUCTION: Agitation is common and distressing in patients with Alzheimer-type dementia, but safe, effective treatments remain elusive. Psychological treatments are first-line options, but they have limited efficacy. Off-label psychotropic medications are frequently used, but they also have limited effectiveness, and their use may have harmful side effects, including death. Areas covered: This review discusses the history leading to the conception of AVP-786 (deuterated (d6)-dextromethorphan/quinidine), its pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles and safety issues, together with an overview of recent clinical trials. Data were found in the medical literature, in US and EU clinical trial registries and in information provided by the manufacturer. Expert opinion: AVP-786 is one of six investigational compounds in recent phase III clinical development for agitation in Alzheimer disease (AD). Quinidine and deuteration appear to prolong dextromethorphan's plasma half-life and facilitate brain penetration. The FDA granted fast-track designation to AVP-786 and allowed use of data generated on dextromethorphan-quinidine (AVP-923, Nuedexta(R)) for regulatory filings. AVP-923 reduced agitation in AD and was well tolerated in a phase II RCT that included more than 200 patients. A phase III clinical development program of AVP-786 for AD agitation was recently initiated. This program is expected to start generating results in July 2018.
27936842	Comprendre le stade compensatoire de la maladie d'Alzheimer et agir pour promouvoir la cognition et la plasticite cerebrale.	Alzheimer's disease begins with a phase of mild cognitive impairment (MCI), characterized by the presence of minor symptoms that have little or no impact on functional independence. The study of patients with MCI has led to spectacular advances in understanding the prodrome of the disease. It has also produced a typical cognitive profile: an impairment of episodic memory, especially delayed recall and associative memory, deficit in executive functions or working memory and certain semantic problems. Recent studies have also examined compensatory processes that take place during the early phase of the disease. Functional magnetic resonance imagery indicates that the brain is more active in persons with MCI than in normal people. Some researchers have interpreted this hyperactivity as playing a compensatory role. Intervention studies have relied on cognitive training programs to promote adaptation and compensatory plasticity processes. These studies have shown that the memory and well-being of people with MCI could be improved by such programs. They have also revealed changes in the level of cerebral activation among persons with MCI who received this type of intervention. In Summary, studies in neuropsychology and in cognitive neuroscience have greatly contributed to characterizing this critical phase of Alzheimer's disease and offer avenues for intervention that could increase adaptation and improve the quality of life of people suffering from the disease.

27932344	Using Robust Normative Data to Investigate the Neuropsychology of Cognitive Aging.	Objective: The extent to which increasing age is associated with impairment in cognitive function, termed cognitive aging, may have been overestimated in prior studies. The inclusion of individuals with severe or uncontrolled systemic medical illness or prodromal neurodegenerative disease in normal aging samples is likely to bias estimates toward lower cognitive performance and inflate estimates of variability. Method: Unbiased estimates of cognitive aging in 658 adults aged 60-84, who underwent rigorous screening to ensure their general and cognitive health, were computed. The first study screened the psychometric properties of a battery of neuropsychological tests in order to identify those with optimal properties to evaluate cognitive aging. The second study used the selected tests to compare baseline performance within 5-year age bands from 60 to 84. Results: The first study identified a battery of 12 tests that provided reliable measures of memory, psychomotor speed, attention, and executive function and were appropriate for investigating age-related cognitive changes. The second study observed moderate to large age-related impairment for performance on tests of complex psychomotor function, category fluency, verbal learning, and verbal and visual memory. No, or only small, age effects were observed for working memory, phonemic fluency, learning of visual information, and reaction time. Conclusions: These data suggested that while increasing age is associated with impairment in cognitive function, this impairment is less severe and is evident only on more complex neuropsychological tests than estimated previously in samples selected using less rigorous criteria to ensure cognitive health.
27931218	Scutellaria barbata flavonoids alleviate memory deficits and neuronal injuries induced by composited Abeta in rats.	BACKGROUND: The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of Scutellaria barbata flavonoids (SBF) on memory impairment and neuronal injury induced by amyloid beta protein 25-35 in combination with aluminum trichloride (AlCl3) and recombinant human transforming growth factor-beta1 (RHTGF-beta1) (composited Abeta) in rats. METHODS: The composited Abeta-treated model of Alzheimer's disease (AD)-like memory impairment and neuronal injury was established in male rats by right intracerebroventricular injection of composited Abeta, and the effects of SBF were assessed using this rat model. Spatial learning and memory of rats were assessed in the Morris water maze, and neuronal injury was assessed by light and electron microscopy with hematoxylin-eosin or uranyl acetate and lead nitrate-sodium citrate staining, respectively. RESULTS: In the Morris water maze, memory impairment was observed in 94.7% of the composited Abeta-treated rats. The composited Abeta-treated rats took longer than sham-operated rats to find the hidden platform during position navigation and reversal learning trials. They also spent less time swimming in the target quadrant in the probe trial. Optical and electron microscopic observations showed significant neuropathological changes including neuron loss or pyknosis in hippocampus, typical colliquative necrosis in cerebral cortex, mitochondrial swelling and cristae fragmentation and a large number of lipofuscin deposits in the cytoplasm. Treatment with SBF (35-140 mg/kg) reduced the memory impairment and neuronal injury induced by composited Abeta. CONCLUSION: SBF-mediated improvement of composited Abeta-induced memory impairment and neuronal injury in rats provides an appropriate rationale for evaluating SBF as a promising agent for treatment of AD.
27930990	Cigarette smoke and related risk factors in neurological disorders: An update.	Cigarette smoking is known to be harmful to health, and is considered the main cause of death worldwide, especially in India. Among the well-distinguished diseases related to smoking are, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, oral and peripheral cancers, and cardiovascular complications. However, the impact of cigarette smoking on neurocognitive and neuropathological effects, including anxiety, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, ischemic stroke, and blood-brain barrier dysfunction, still remains unclear. Cigarette smoke consists of more than 4500 toxic chemicals that combine to form free radicals, which lead to oxidative stress-associated neurological disorders. Herein, we discuss the role of antioxidant agents in delaying or attenuating disease complications. In addition, in this review, we discuss the neuropathological effect of cigarette smoke and its interference in neurodegeneration.
27930593	Usefulness of 3-dimensional stereotactic surface projection FDG PET images for the diagnosis of dementia.	To compare diagnostic performance and confidence of a standard visual reading and combined 3-dimensional stereotactic surface projection (3D-SSP) results to discriminate between Alzheimer disease (AD)/mild cognitive impairment (MCI), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and frontotemporal dementia (FTD).[F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET brain images were obtained from 120 patients (64 AD/MCI, 38 DLB, and 18 FTD) who were clinically confirmed over 2 years follow-up. Three nuclear medicine physicians performed the diagnosis and rated diagnostic confidence twice; once by standard visual methods, and once by adding of 3D-SSP. Diagnostic performance and confidence were compared between the 2 methods.3D-SSP showed higher sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive, and negative predictive values to discriminate different types of dementia compared with the visual method alone, except for AD/MCI specificity and FTD sensitivity. Correction of misdiagnosis after adding 3D-SSP images was greatest for AD/MCI (56%), followed by DLB (13%) and FTD (11%). Diagnostic confidence also increased in DLB (visual: 3.2; 3D-SSP: 4.1; P < 0.001), followed by AD/MCI (visual: 3.1; 3D-SSP: 3.8; P = 0.002) and FTD (visual: 3.5; 3D-SSP: 4.2; P = 0.022). Overall, 154/360 (43%) cases had a corrected misdiagnosis or improved diagnostic confidence for the correct diagnosis.The addition of 3D-SSP images to visual analysis helped to discriminate different types of dementia in FDG PET scans, by correcting misdiagnoses and enhancing diagnostic confidence in the correct diagnosis. Improvement of diagnostic accuracy and confidence by 3D-SSP images might help to determine the cause of dementia and appropriate treatment.
27927775	Memantine-induced chorea and dystonia.	Memantine is an uncompetitive N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonist and probably also has an indirect dopaminergic action at high concentrations. We describe a person with Alzheimer's disease who developed chorea and dystonia after inadvertently doubling of her daily dose by taking extended-release (XR) memantine twice daily, rather than once daily (planned dose memantine XR, 21 mg once daily), after the drug was switched from immediate release (IR, 10 mg twice daily). Memantine is rarely associated with movement disorders, but this case emphasises the need for awareness of potential problems when switching from memantine IR to XR.

27922867	The Value of 99mTc ECD SPECT With Statistical Image Analysis on Enhancing the Early Diagnosis of Primary Progressive Aphasia.	A 64-year-old woman with poor short-term memory was first suspected as early Alzheimer disease. Tc ECD brain SPECT was arranged for differential diagnosis. A small area of mild hypoperfusion was noted in the left temporal lobe on conventional display. Further statistical analysis of SPECT with an easy Z-score imaging system showed large areas of distinct hypoperfusion in left precentral and perisylvian cortical areas, compatible with typical pictures of nonfluent variant primary progressive aphasia (PPA), but no involvement in areas characteristic for Alzheimer disease. Further detailed neuropsychological examination and 6 months of clinical follow-up confirmed the final diagnosis of PPA.
27921460	Direct infusion mass spectrometry for metabolomic phenotyping of diseases.	Metabolomics based on direct mass spectrometry (MS) analysis, either by direct infusion or flow injection of crude sample extracts, shows a great potential for metabolic fingerprinting because of its high-throughput screening capability, wide metabolite coverage and reduced time of analysis. Considering that numerous metabolic pathways are significantly perturbed during the initiation and progression of diseases, these metabolomic tools can be used to get a deeper understanding about disease pathogenesis and discover potential biomarkers for early diagnosis. In this work, we describe the most common metabolomic platforms used in biomedical research, with special focus on strategies based on direct MS analysis. Then, a comprehensive review on the application of direct MS fingerprinting in clinical issues is provided.
27918993	Tetrahydropyranodiquinolin-8-amines as new, non hepatotoxic, antioxidant, and acetylcholinesterase inhibitors for Alzheimer's disease therapy.	Herein we report an efficient two step synthesis and biological assessment of 12 racemic tetrahydropyranodiquinolin-8-amines derivatives as antioxidant, cholinesterase inhibitors and non-hepatotoxic agents. Based on the results of the primary screening, we identified 7-(3-methoxyphenyl)-9,10,11,12-tetrahydro-7H-pyrano[2,3-b:5,6-h']diquinolin-8-ami ne (2h) as a particularly interesting non-hepatotoxic compound that shows moderate antioxidant activity (1.83 equiv Trolox in the ORAC assay), a non competitive inhibition of hAChE (IC50 = 0.75 +/- 0.01 muM), and brain permeable as determined by the PAMPA-Blood Brain Barrier assay.
27913818	[Amyloid positron-emission-tomography with [18 F]-florbetaben in the diagnostic workup of dementia patients].	BACKGROUND: To this day the definite diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease still relies on post-mortem histopathological detection of neurofibrillary tangles and beta-amyloid deposits. Amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) is a new diagnostic tool that enables the in vivo quantification of pathological beta-amyloid deposits. The aim of the current study was to evaluate to what extent 18F-florbetaben-PET (FBB-PET) influences the diagnosis of patients with dementia. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Imaging with FBB-PET was performed on 33 patients from our outpatient department for cognitive neurology. Beforehand all patients underwent a comprehensive clinical, neuropsychiatric and laboratory examination as well as imaging by means of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and fluorodeoxyglucose-PET. The working diagnoses before and after FBB-PET imaging were compared. RESULTS: 17 out of 33 patients were scored as FBB-PET positive. In four cases the initial diagnosis had to be changed to Alzheimer's disease (three cases) and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (one case) due to the positive FBB-PET scan. 16 patients showed a negative FBB-PET scan. In three patients the initial diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease could be ruled out due to the negative FBB-PET scan. Overall, in 7 out of 33 examined patients the initial diagnosis had to be changed because of the findings of the FBB-PET scan. In 24 patients the initial diagnosis was confirmed by the results of the FBB-PET scan. CONCLUSION: Amyloid-PET is currently no standard procedure in the diagnosis of dementia; however, it can be a helpful additional diagnostic tool when used according to the "Appropriate Use Criteria" and the S3 guidelines on dementia in cases of unclear clinical presentation, atypically early age of onset as well as in patients with persistent or progressive unexplained mild cognitive impairment. By facilitating early diagnosis amyloid-PET imaging allows patient selection for therapeutic drug trials.
27911071	Severe Brain Injury in Massachusetts: Assessing the Continuum of Care.	Acquired brain injury (ABI) is a major public health problem in Massachusetts (Hackman et al, 2014) and includes traumatic brain injury (TBI), stroke, ABI-related infectious diseases, metabolic disorders affecting the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord), and brain tumor. Advances in emergency medical care and neurosurgery mean that more people are surviving severe traumatic brain injury (Trexler et al, 2014). Yet many patients with severe TBI in particular, are not receiving inpatient services after initial treatment (Hackman et al, 2014; CDC, 2014) or later that are known to be effective (Malec & Kean, 2015; Lewis & Horn, 2015; BI Commission, 2011; Kolakowsky-Hayner et al, 2000; Interviews). These services include post-acute rehabilitation, case management, and brain injury-specific community programming (CDC, 2014; BI Commission, 2011; Interviews). Governance and data for decision-making are also major gaps in the continuum of care for severe brain injury in MA (Interviews; NASHIA, 2005). The last two decades saw a surge in interest in the brain, with advances in neuroscience, diagnosis and measurement of brain injury, rehabilitation services, and brain theory (Boyle, 2001). Severe brain injury however is the new "hidden epidemic" in our society. For many, an injury to the brain is not a short-term event that can be "cured" but the beginning of a life-long disability (CDC, 2014; Langlois et al, 2006). Fortunately, even after a severe brain injury, when the right rehabilitation is provided at the right time, the "rest of life" journey can be a positive one for many (Marquez de la Plata, 2015; Langlois et al, 2006). Severe brain injury can lead to a "new normal" as patients regain skills, find new meaning and in life, and take on new family, volunteer, and work roles. Throughout this brief, the term "severe brain injury" refers to "severe acquired brain injury," or any injury to the brain that occurs after birth. This definition does not include neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's Disease, Multiple Sclerosis, and Parkinson's Disease which do not usually result in an acute hospital admission. Clinically, severe TBI is defined as resulting in loss of consciousness for 6 to 24 hours or more (Corrigan et al, 2010; CDC, 2014). Yet even a "mild" TBI can result in long-term functional impairments (Corrigan et al, 2010) for an estimated 15 to 30% of people (Lewine et al, 2007; Cajigal, 2007). In the chronic phase of acquired brain injury from any cause, lifelong disabilities may affect the ability to work, perform activities of daily living (dressing, paying bills), participate in community life, and/or fulfill a family role.
27908444	Clinical application of apparent diffusion coefficient mapping in voxel-based morphometry in the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.	AIM: To evaluate the performance of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) mapping compared with voxel-based morphometry and to demonstrate the clinical usefulness of ADC mapping in the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study population comprised 31 patients with AD (group A) and 24 patients without dementia (group B) who underwent three-dimensional (3D) T1-weighted imaging (WI) and two-dimensional (2D) echo-planar diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) at 3 T. The volume and ADC of the regional grey matter (GM) in the bilateral hippocampi, precunei, and the anterior and posterior cingulate gyri were calculated using a voxel-based method for automatic segmentation of brain structures. The significance of intergroup differences in each volume and ADC of all regional GM was tested using analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Bonferroni correction. Intergroup regional GM differences in each volume and ADC were evaluated using statistical parametric mapping (SPM). RESULTS: In group A, the volumes of the precunei (mean value: group A/B=18.93/21.48 cm3) and the anterior cingulate gyri (mean value: group A/B=6.1/7.81 cm3) were significantly less than in group B (p<0.05). The ADC in group A was significantly larger than that in group B in the bilateral hippocampi (mean value: group A/B=right 1020.79x10-6/877.23x10-6 mm2/s; left 1072.89x10-6/900.2x10-6 mm2/s) and posterior cingulate gyri (mean value: group A/B=1006.77x10-6/876.88x10-6 mm2/s; p<0.05). SPM showed that the areas of increased ADC were more extensive than the areas of decreased volume in the bilateral hippocampi, precunei, and posterior cingulate gyri in group A, compared with those in group B (p<0.001). CONCLUSION: Evaluation of ADC mapping can quantify changes in brain water diffusivity and may improve the performance of automatic morphometric diagnosis of AD.
27908403	Trace metal concentrations in hair and nails from Alzheimer's disease patients: Relations with clinical severity.	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Metals, especially transition metals, seem to be important in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease. This study aims to determine the relationship of trace metal elements to the pathogenesis and/or course of Alzheimer Disease in terms of clinical severity. METHODS: The hair and nail trace metal levels of 62 Alzheimer Disease patients at different clinical stages (21 mild, 20 moderate, 21 severe) and 60 healthy control subjects were measured by using inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry. The statistical comparisons were performed with regards to the study groups, clinical stages, disease duration and age. RESULTS: The patient and control groups were significantly different from each other in regards to Mn, Fe, Cu, Cd, Hg (p<0.001), Zn (p<0.01) in nail concentrations and, Na, Al, Pb, Co (p<0.001), Fe, Mn (p=0.001), Hg, Cu, Cd, K in hair concentrations (p<0.01). No difference was detected in the levels of Mg and Ca. Nail Na level showed differences among different clinical stages of the disease (p<0.01). In comparing the mild degree Alzheimer patients to the control group; significant differences were detected in nail Mn, Fe, Cu, Co (p<0.001), Hg, Zn (p<0.01) and, hair Pb, Al (p<0.001), Na, K levels (p<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Our results have shown that transition and posttransition metals are especially important metals for the disease process. The relation of nail Na level with clinical stages of AD is an interesting new finding, making someone to think that alkali metals may be important in the progression of the disease.
27908163	Learning-based 3T brain MRI segmentation with guidance from 7T MRI labeling.	PURPOSE: Segmentation of brain magnetic resonance (MR) images into white matter (WM), gray matter (GM), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is crucial for brain structural measurement and disease diagnosis. Learning-based segmentation methods depend largely on the availability of good training ground truth. However, the commonly used 3T MR images are of insufficient image quality and often exhibit poor intensity contrast between WM, GM, and CSF. Therefore, they are not ideal for providing good ground truth label data for training learning-based methods. Recent advances in ultrahigh field 7T imaging make it possible to acquire images with excellent intensity contrast and signal-to-noise ratio. METHODS: In this paper, the authors propose an algorithm based on random forest for segmenting 3T MR images by training a series of classifiers based on reliable labels obtained semiautomatically from 7T MR images. The proposed algorithm iteratively refines the probability maps of WM, GM, and CSF via a cascade of random forest classifiers for improved tissue segmentation. RESULTS: The proposed method was validated on two datasets, i.e., 10 subjects collected at their institution and 797 3T MR images from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset. Specifically, for the mean Dice ratio of all 10 subjects, the proposed method achieved 94.52% +/- 0.9%, 89.49% +/- 1.83%, and 79.97% +/- 4.32% for WM, GM, and CSF, respectively, which are significantly better than the state-of-the-art methods (p-values < 0.021). For the ADNI dataset, the group difference comparisons indicate that the proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art segmentation methods. CONCLUSIONS: The authors have developed and validated a novel fully automated method for 3T brain MR image segmentation.
27902677	Perception of Fechner Illusory Colors in Alzheimer Disease Patients.	BACKGROUND Alzheimer disease (AD) primarily affects cognition. A variety of visual disorders was established in AD. Fechner illusory colors are produced by a rotating disk with a black and white pattern. The purpose of our research was to explore the perception of illusory colors in AD. MATERIAL AND METHODS W recruited 40 AD patients (MMSE >/=14) and 40 normal controls (CG group) matched by age, education, gender in this prospective, cross-sectional, case-control study. An achromatic Benham's disk attached to a device to control the speed and direction of rotation was used to produce illusory colors. Primary, secondary, and tertiary RGB system colors were used for matching of illusory and physical colors. RESULTS Subjects in the AD group perceived less illusory colors in 5 arcs (p<0.05) of the 8 arcs assessed. The biggest difference was found between AD and CG groups for pure blue (chi(2)=26.87, p<0.001 clockwise, chi(2)=22.75, p<0.001 counter-clockwise). Groups did not differ in perception of pure yellow opponent colors (p>0.05). Mixed colors of the blue-yellow axis were perceived less often in AD, but more frequently than pure blue (#0000FF). The sequence of colors on Benham's disk followed a complex pattern, different from the order of physical spectral colors and opponent processes-based colors. CONCLUSIONS AD patients retained reduced perception of illusory colors. The perception of pure blue illusory color is almost absent in AD. The asymmetrical shift to the yellow opponent is observed in AD with red prevailing over green constituent. This may indicate cortical rather than retinal impairment.
27896493	Hearing impairment and risk of Alzheimer's disease: a meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies.	Observational studies suggested an association between hearing impairment and cognitive disorders. However, whether hearing impairment is an independent risk factor or a harbinger of Alzheimer's disease remains controversial. Our goal was to assess the association between hearing impairment (HI) and the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) by conducting a meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies. We comprehensively searched the PubMed, Embase, Web of Science and Cochrane Library databases on January 19, 2016 to incorporate all the prospective cohort studies meeting the inclusion criteria to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis. Four prospective cohort studies with comparison between hearing impairment and normal hearing were incorporated, with 7461 participants. The outcomes of three studies were the incidence of Alzheimer's disease and the outcome of the fourth study was the incidence of mild cognitive impairment. The overall combined relative risk of people with hearing impairment to develop Alzheimer's disease was 4.87 (95% CI 0.90-26.35; p = 0.066), compared with the control group. Since both Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment are cognitive disorders, we incorporated all the four studies and the overall combined relative risk was 2.82 (95% CI 1.47-5.42; p = 0.002), indicating that the difference was significant. This meta-analysis suggests that hearing impairment significantly increases the risk of cognitive disorders and future well-designed prospective cohort studies are awaited to confirm the association between hearing impairment and risk of Alzheimer's disease.
27896492	Hemianopic line bisection error in a patient with Alzheimer's disease.	Visual symptoms are frequently observed in posterior cortical atrophy compared to typical amnestic Alzheimer's disease (AD). We report the case of a patient with amnestic AD with long-lasting homonymous hemianopia. A 62-year-old woman, who was diagnosed in amnestic AD, complained of visual disturbance. She had left homonymous hemianopia in the perimetry test and left tactile extinction. Regardless of posture, retinotopically leftward error was observed on 21 cm line bisection test. Brain single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) showed bilateral temporoparietal hypoperfusion, which was more severe to the right than left side. This case suggested that long-lasting hemianopia could occur in the patient with amnestic AD and that hemianopic line bisection error might be compensatory mechanism.
27894594	Alterations of Golgi organization in Alzheimer's disease: A cause or a consequence?	The Golgi apparatus is a central organelle of the secretory pathway involved in the post-translational modification and sorting of lipids and proteins. In mammalian cells, the Golgi apparatus is composed of stacks of cisternae organized in polarized manner, which are interconnected by membrane tubules to constitute the Golgi ribbon, located in the proximity of the centrosome. Besides the processing and transport of cargo, the Golgi complex is actively involved in the regulation of mitotic entry, cytoskeleton organization and dynamics, calcium homeostasis, and apoptosis, representing a signalling platform for the control of several cellular functions, including signalling initiated by receptors located at the plasma membrane. Alterations of the conventional Golgi organization are associated to many disorders, such as cancer or different neurodegenerative diseases. In this review, we examine the functional implications of modifications of Golgi structure in neurodegenerative disorders, with a focus on the role of Golgi fragmentation in the development of Alzheimer's disease. The comprehension of the mechanism that induces Golgi fragmentation and of its downstream effects on neuronal function have the potential to contribute to the development of more effective therapies to treat or prevent some of these disorders.
27893966	Vaccination via Chloroplast Genetics: Affordable Protein Drugs for the Prevention and Treatment of Inherited or Infectious Human Diseases.	Plastid-made biopharmaceuticals treat major metabolic or genetic disorders, including Alzheimer's, diabetes, hypertension, hemophilia, and retinopathy. Booster vaccines made in chloroplasts prevent global infectious diseases, such as tuberculosis, malaria, cholera, and polio, and biological threats, such as anthrax and plague. Recent advances in this field include commercial-scale production of human therapeutic proteins in FDA-approved cGMP facilities, development of tags to deliver protein drugs to targeted human cells or tissues, methods to deliver precise doses, and long-term stability of protein drugs at ambient temperature, maintaining their efficacy. Codon optimization utilizing valuable information from sequenced chloroplast genomes enhanced expression of eukaryotic human or viral genes in chloroplasts and offered unique insights into translation in chloroplasts. Support from major biopharmaceutical companies, development of hydroponic production systems, and evaluation by regulatory agencies, including the CDC, FDA, and USDA, augur well for advancing this novel concept to the clinic and revolutionizing affordable healthcare.
27893962	Proteopathic Strains and the Heterogeneity of Neurodegenerative Diseases.	Most age-related neurodegenerative diseases are associated with the misfolding and aberrant accumulation of specific proteins in the nervous system. The proteins self-assemble and spread by a prion-like process of corruptive molecular templating, whereby abnormally folded proteins induce the misfolding and aggregation of like proteins into characteristic lesions. Despite the apparent simplicity of this process at the molecular level, diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Creutzfeldt-Jakob, and others display remarkable phenotypic heterogeneity, both clinically and pathologically. Evidence is growing that this variability is mediated, at least in part, by the acquisition of diverse molecular architectures by the misfolded proteins, variants referred to as proteopathic strains. The structural and functional diversity of the assemblies is influenced by genetic, epigenetic, and local contextual factors. Insights into proteopathic strains gleaned from the classical prion diseases can be profitably incorporated into research on other neurodegenerative diseases. Their potentially wide-ranging influence on disease phenotype also suggests that proteopathic strains should be considered in the design and interpretation of diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to these disorders.
27893282	Plant Food Supplements with Antioxidant Properties for the Treatment of Chronic and Neurodegenerative Diseases: Benefits or Risks?	Wine by-products, in particular grape pomace, can be an important source of polyphenols and dietary fibers and are increasingly being used as a starting material in the industrial production of plant food supplements, such as other matrices containing biomolecules, with antioxidant properties. The risk associated with the consumption of these products was recently analyzed through a study of potential genotoxic and carcinogenic compounds that can be found in the marketed products. In particular, occurrence data about contamination with the mycotoxin ochratoxin A were also reported. This short review aims at giving an overview about the quality and benefits of these kinds of food supplements, and also about risks of incorrect use, focusing on the emerging need for stricter European regulations.
27890431	Neuroprotective mechanisms of plant extracts against MPTP induced neurotoxicity: Future applications in Parkinson's disease.	Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease after Alzheimer's disease, affecting about seven to 10 million patients worldwide. The major pathological features of PD are loss of dopaminergic neurons in the nigrostriatal pathway and accumulation of alpha-synuclein molecules, forming Lewy bodies. Until now, there is no effective cure for PD, and investigators are searching for neuroprotective strategies to stop or slow the disease progression. The MPTP (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine) induced neurotoxicity of the nigrostriatal pathway has been used to initiate PD in animal models. Multiple experimental studies showed the ability of several plant extracts to protect against MPTP induced neurotoxicity through activation of catalase, superoxide dismutase, and glutathione reductase enzymes, which reduce the cellular concentration of free radicals, preventing intracellular Ca++ release and subsequent apoptosis signaling. Other neuroprotective mechanisms of plant extracts include promoting autophagy of alpha-synuclein molecules and exerting an antiapoptotic activity via inhibition of proteolytic poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase and preventing caspase cleavage. The variety of neuroprotective mechanisms of natural plant extracts may allow researchers to target PD progression in different pathological stages and may be through multiple pathways. Further investigations are required to translate these neuroprotective mechanisms into safe and effective treatments for PD.
27889432	Decrease of high voltage Ca2+ currents in the dentate gyrus granule cells by entorhinal amyloidopathy is reversed by calcium channel blockade.	In the Alzheimer's disease (AD), entorhinal-hippocampal circuit is one of the earliest affected networks. There are some evidences indicating abnormal neuronal excitability and impaired synaptic plasticity in the dentate gyrus (DG) of AD animal model. However, the underlying mechanism leading to DG dysfunction particularly in the early phase of AD is not known. Since calcium dyshomeostasis has a critical role in the etiology of AD, it is possible that this phenomenon precedes electrophysiological alteration in the DG. Here, the effect of the amyloid pathogenesis in the entorhinal cortex (EC) on high activated Ca2+ currents in the DG granule cells was investigated. One week after bilaterally injection of amyloid beta (Abeta) 1-42 into the EC, Ca2+ currents in the DG granule cells were assessed by whole cell patch clamp. Voltage clamp recording showed the amplitude of high voltage calcium currents in the DG granule cells was decreased following EC amyloidopathy. However, the Ca2+ current decay was slower than control. Double-pulse recording revealed that Ca2+-dependent inactivation of calcium current (CDI) was more pronounced in the EC-Abeta group compared to the control group. However, chronic treatment by calcium channel blocker (CCBs), isradipine or nimodipine, reverse the Ca2+ currents toward the control level. On the other hand, there was no significant difference in the calbindin level in the DG of different groups. In conclusion, our results suggest that Abeta in the EC independent of calbindin level triggers a decreased Ca2+ currents along with increased CDI in the DG granule cells which may lead to further electrophysiological alterations in these cells, and treatment by CCBs could preserve normal calcium current and may ultimately normal function against the Abeta toxicity.
27889245	Selagintriflavonoids with BACE1 inhibitory activity from the fern Selaginella doederleinii.	Eight triflavonoids, selagintriflavonoids A-H, were isolated from whole herbs of Selaginella doederleinii. The structures of compounds selagintriflavonoids A-C consisted of three naringenin units, whereas those of selagintriflavonoids D-H consisted of apigenin and two naringenin moieties. The structures and absolute configurations of the compounds were determined based on NMR, HRESIMS, and experimental and calculated electronic circular dichroism (ECD) data. The ability of the compounds to inhibit beta-secretase (BACE1) was also evaluated. All compounds exhibited BACE1 inhibition with IC50 values ranging from 0.75 to 46.99 muM. Selagintriflavonoid A exhibited the strongest inhibition (0.75 muM) and is thus a promising compound for treating Alzheimer's disease.
27886714	Classification of CT brain images based on deep learning networks.	While computerised tomography (CT) may have been the first imaging tool to study human brain, it has not yet been implemented into clinical decision making process for diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). On the other hand, with the nature of being prevalent, inexpensive and non-invasive, CT does present diagnostic features of AD to a great extent. This study explores the significance and impact on the application of the burgeoning deep learning techniques to the task of classification of CT brain images, in particular utilising convolutional neural network (CNN), aiming at providing supplementary information for the early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. Towards this end, three categories of CT images (N = 285) are clustered into three groups, which are AD, lesion (e.g. tumour) and normal ageing. In addition, considering the characteristics of this collection with larger thickness along the direction of depth (z) (~3-5 mm), an advanced CNN architecture is established integrating both 2D and 3D CNN networks. The fusion of the two CNN networks is subsequently coordinated based on the average of Softmax scores obtained from both networks consolidating 2D images along spatial axial directions and 3D segmented blocks respectively. As a result, the classification accuracy rates rendered by this elaborated CNN architecture are 85.2%, 80% and 95.3% for classes of AD, lesion and normal respectively with an average of 87.6%. Additionally, this improved CNN network appears to outperform the others when in comparison with 2D version only of CNN network as well as a number of state of the art hand-crafted approaches. As a result, these approaches deliver accuracy rates in percentage of 86.3, 85.6 +/- 1.10, 86.3 +/- 1.04, 85.2 +/- 1.60, 83.1 +/- 0.35 for 2D CNN, 2D SIFT, 2D KAZE, 3D SIFT and 3D KAZE respectively. The two major contributions of the paper constitute a new 3-D approach while applying deep learning technique to extract signature information rooted in both 2D slices and 3D blocks of CT images and an elaborated hand-crated approach of 3D KAZE.
27886711	EEG epochs with less alpha rhythm improve discrimination of mild Alzheimer's.	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Eyes-closed-awake electroencephalogram (EEG) is a useful tool in the diagnosis of Alzheimer's. However, there is eyes-closed-awake EEG with dominant or rare alpha rhythm. In this paper, we show that random selection of EEG epochs disregarding the alpha rhythm will lead to bias concerning EEG-based Alzheimer's Disease diagnosis. METHODS: We compared EEG epochs with more than 30% and with less than 30% alpha rhythm of mild Alzheimer's Disease patients and healthy elderly. We classified epochs as dominant alpha scenario and rare alpha scenario according to alpha rhythm (8-13 Hz) percentage in O1, O2 and Oz channels. Accordingly, we divided the probands into four groups: 17 dominant alpha scenario controls, 15 mild Alzheimer's patients with dominant alpha scenario epochs, 12 rare alpha scenario healthy elderly and 15 mild Alzheimer's Disease patients with rare alpha scenario epochs. We looked for group differences using one-way ANOVA tests followed by post-hoc multiple comparisons (p < 0.05) over normalized energy values (%) on the other four well-known frequency bands (delta, theta, beta and gamma) using two different electrode configurations (parieto-occipital and central). RESULTS: After carrying out post-hoc multiple comparisons, for both electrode configurations we found significant differences between mild Alzheimer's patients and healthy elderly on beta- and theta-energy (%) only for the rare alpha scenario. No differences were found for the dominant alpha scenario in any of the five frequency bands. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study of Alzheimer's awake-EEG reporting the influence of alpha rhythm on epoch selection, where our results revealed that, contrarily to what was most likely expected, less synchronized EEG epochs (rare alpha scenario) better discriminated mild Alzheimer's than those presenting abundant alpha (dominant alpha scenario). In addition, we find out that epoch selection is a very sensitive issue in qEEG research. Consequently, for Alzheimer's studies dealing with resting state EEG, we propose that epoch selection strategies should always be cautiously designed and thoroughly explained.
27886629	Transient Epileptic Amnesia over twenty years: Long-term follow-up of a case series with three detailed reports.	PURPOSE: Transient Epileptic Amnesia (TEA) is a form of adult onset temporal lobe epilepsy characterised by ictal amnesia. The amnesic seizures are often accompanied by interical memory disturbance, involving autobiographical amnesia and accelerated long-term forgetting. Short-term follow-up studies suggest a relatively stable cognitive profile once treated, but recent case reports raise concerns regarding the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD). The current study reports clinical and cognitive outcome in TEA patients over a 20-year period. METHODS: A cohort of ten TEA patients first reported in 1998 were followed up at two time intervals, each 10 years apart. Information regarding clinical outcomes and subjective reports of memory functioning was gained via GP records and clinical interview. Objective memory function was determined at each time point via a comprehensive neuropsychological assessment, where possible. RESULTS: Information was obtained for nine of the original 10 participants. Over the 20-year period, 4 participants died, with no indication of dementia prior to death. One participant was diagnosed with Vascular Dementia. Seizures were generally well controlled. Subjective reports of memory varied, including no concerns, stable memory difficulties, and worsening memory. Neuropsychological assessment at 10 years showed stable performances across most measures. At the 20-year follow up, there was no evidence of a general cognitive decline. Participants showed stability on some measures, with reductions on others. Performance was not consistent with AD. CONCLUSIONS: No elevated risk of dementia was evident from this TEA series. Although memory difficulties persist over time, the prognosis of TEA appears generally benign.
27885860	Pioglitazone for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.	INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia in the elderly. Pharmacological treatment of AD includes Anticholinesterase Inhibitors (AChEIs) for mild-moderate AD, and memantine for severe AD. These drugs provide mainly symptomatic short-term benefits without clearly influencing the progression of the disease. Pioglitazone (AD4833) is an insulin sensitizer of the thiazolidinedione class of nuclear Peroxisome-Proliferator Activated Receptor gamma (PPARgamma) agonists. It binds to PPARgamma, affecting gene transcription and reducing inflammation. Areas covered: This review discusses the history of Pioglitazone, its pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics profile, and safety issues, together with an overview of clinical trials carried out so far. A literature search was made in Pubmed for pioglitazone, AD, trial, and on the ClinicalTrials.gov site for clinical trials with Pioglitazone. Expert opinion: A Phase II study in AD, and its previous indication for diabetes, showed that Pioglitazone is safe and well tolerated. So far, two large Phase III trials are ongoing, but there are no preliminary results yet on a possible beneficial effect on cognition in patients with AD.
27884130	A profile of The Clinical Course of Cognition and Comorbidity in Mild Cognitive Impairment and Dementia Study (The 4C study): two complementary longitudinal, clinical cohorts in the Netherlands.	BACKGROUND: Heterogeneous disease trajectories of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia are frequently encountered in clinical practice, but there is still insufficient knowledge to understand the reasons and mechanisms causing this heterogeneity. In addition to correlates of the disorder, patient characteristics such as their health status, social environment, comorbidities and frailty may contribute to variability in trajectories over time. The current paper outlines the study design and the study population of and provides an overview of the data collected in the Clinical Course of Cognition and Comorbidity in Mild Cognitive Impairment (4C-MCI cohort, n = 315) and Dementia (4C-Dementia cohort, n = 331) Study. METHODS: The two complementary longitudinal cohorts part of the 4C study began enrolment in March 2010. Participants were prospectively recruited from three collaborating Dutch Alzheimer Centers, with three annual follow-up assessments after baseline. Extensive neuropsychological assessments, and detailed profiling of comorbidities, health and frailty at each follow up were the key features of the 4C study. As such, the 4C study was designed to study if and how patients' comorbidities and frailty are associated with the course of MCI and dementia measured with a comprehensive and multidimensional set of outcomes including cognition, daily functioning, quality of life, behavioral disturbances, caregiver burden, institutionalization and death and whether the effects of medical health and frailty differ between MCI and dementia stages of cognitive disorders. CONCLUSION: Sampled in a clinical setting, the 4C study complements population-based studies on neurodegenerative disorders in terms of the type of assessment (e.g. comorbidity, frailty, and functional status were repeatedly assessed). The 4C study complements available clinical cohorts of MCI and dementia patients, because the exclusion criteria were kept to a minimum, to obtain a sample that is representative for the average patient visiting a memory clinic.
27876467	A review on tacrine-based scaffolds as multi-target drugs (MTDLs) for Alzheimer's disease.	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a multifactorial neurological disorder among elderly people and combinatorial factors such as genetic, lifestyle, and environmental are involved in onset and disease progression. It has been demonstrated that loss of cholinergic transmission is one of the most significant causes of AD. One strategy currently being investigated for the development of new therapeutics relates to the enhancement of cholinergic system through several ways. At this juncture, anticholinesterase inhibitors have absorbed lots of attention and different marketed drugs such as donepezil, rivastigmine, tacrine, and galantamine have been developed. 9-Amino-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroacridine known as tacrine was introduced in 1945 as an efficient anticholinesterase agent. The mechanism of action of tacrine was proved to inhibit the metabolism of acetylcholine and therefore extending its activity and raising levels in the cerebral cortex. However, extensive use of tacrine was limited since it showed various side effects and toxicity. Thus, lots of efforts were carried out to prepare tacrine analogues to overcome the related adverse effects. This review describes differently synthesized tacrine-based scaffolds as cholinesterase inhibitors to manage Alzheimer's disease (AD).
27875990	Inverse relationship between Alzheimer's disease and cancer, and other factors contributing to Alzheimer's disease: a systematic review.	BACKGROUND: The AD etiology is yet not properly known. Interactions among environmental factors, multiple susceptibility genes and aging, contribute to AD. This study investigates the factors that play role in causing AD and how changes in cellular pathways contribute to AD. METHODS: PUBMED database, MEDLINE database and Google Scholar were searched with no date restrictions for published articles involving cellular pathways with roles in cancers, cell survival, growth, proliferation, development, aging, and also contributing to Alzheimer's disease. This research explores inverse relationship between AD and cancer, also investigates other factors behind AD using several already published research literature to find the etiology of AD. RESULTS: Cancer and Alzheimer's disease have inverse relationship in many aspects such as P53, estrogen, neurotrophins and growth factors, growth and proliferation, cAMP, EGFR, Bcl-2, apoptosis pathways, IGF-1, HSV, TDP-43, APOE variants, notch signals and presenilins, NCAM, TNF alpha, PI3K/AKT/MTOR pathway, telomerase, ROS, ACE levels. AD occurs when brain neurons have weakened growth, cell survival responses, maintenance mechanisms, weakened anti-stress responses such as Vimentin, Carbonic anhydrases, HSPs, SAPK. In cancer, these responses are upregulated and maintained. Evolutionarily conserved responses and maintenance mechanisms such as FOXO are impaired in AD. Countermeasures or compensatory mechanisms by AD affected neurons such as Tau, Beta Amyloid, S100, are last attempts for survival which may be protective for certain time, or can speed up AD in Alzheimer's microenvironment via C-ABL activation, GSK3, neuro-inflammation. CONCLUSIONS: Alzheimer's disease and Cancer have inverse relationship; many factors that are upregulated in any cancer to sustain growth and survival are downregulated in Alzheimer's disease contributing to neuro-degeneration. When aged neurons or genetically susceptible neurons have weakened growth, cell survival and anti-stress responses, age related gene expression changes, altered regulation of cell death and maintenance mechanisms, they contribute to Alzheimer's disease. Countermeasures by AD neurons such as Beta Amyloid Plaques, NFTs, S100, are last attempts for survival and this provides neuroprotection for certain time and ultimately may become pathological and speed up AD. This study may contribute in developing new potential diagnostic tests, interventions and treatments.
27871923	Omics analysis of mouse brain models of human diseases.	The identification of common gene/protein profiles related to brain alterations, if they exist, may indicate the convergence of the pathogenic mechanisms driving brain disorders. Six genetically engineered mouse lines modelling neurodegenerative diseases and neuropsychiatric disorders were considered. Omics approaches, including transcriptomic and proteomic methods, were used. The gene/protein lists were used for inter-disease comparisons and further functional and network investigations. When the inter-disease comparison was performed using the gene symbol identifiers, the number of genes/proteins involved in multiple diseases decreased rapidly. Thus, no genes/proteins were shared by all 6 mouse models. Only one gene/protein (Gfap) was shared among 4 disorders, providing strong evidence that a common molecular signature does not exist among brain diseases. The inter-disease comparison of functional processes showed the involvement of a few major biological processes indicating that brain diseases of diverse aetiologies might utilize common biological pathways in the nervous system, without necessarily involving similar molecules.
27871212	Contributions of triggering-receptor-expressed-on-myeloid-cells-2 to neurological diseases.	Recent laboratory and gene sequencing data suggest that variations in receptors called the "triggering-receptors-expressed-on-myeloid-cells" (TREMs) are implicated in Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, and frontotemporal lobar degeneration. TREM receptors are thought to play a critical role in regulating the immune system, inflammation, and certain cellular functions. One TREM, in particular, TREM2, is highly expressed on cells of the myeloid lineage. The binding of TREM2 to the adapter protein, DNAX activating protein of 12 kD (DAP12), in microglial cells has been shown to modulate phagocytosis within the nervous system. This review highlights the role of TREM2 in neurological diseases. Moreover, here we consider potential contributions of TREM2 and mechanisms underlying TREM2 activity as contributing to neurodegeneration. These findings may provide novel insights and opportunities to consider, especially for clinicians, as they diagnose and treat certain neurological diseases.
27871175	Epigenetic Changes in Neurodegenerative Diseases.	Afflicted neurons in various neurodegenerative diseases generally display diverse and complex pathological features before catastrophic occurrence of massive neuronal loss at the late stages of the diseases. This complex nature of neuronal pathophysiology inevitably implicates systemwide changes in basic cellular activities such as transcriptional controls and signal cascades, and so on, as a cause. Recently, as one of these systemwide cellular changes associated with neurodegenerative diseases, epigenetic changes caused by protein toxicity have begun to be highlighted. Notably, recent advances in related techniques including next-generation sequencing (NGS) and mass spectrometry enable us to monitor changes in the post-translational modifications (PTMs) of histone proteins and to link these changes in histone PTMs to the specific transcriptional changes. Indeed, epigenetic alterations and consequent changes in neuronal transcriptome are now begun to be extensively studied in neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this review, we will discuss details of our current understandings on epigenetic changes associated with two representative neurodegenerative diseases [AD and polyglutamine (polyQ) diseases] and further discuss possible future development of pharmaceutical treatment of the diseases through modulating these epigenetic changes.
27871037	Design, synthesis and SAR analysis of potent BACE1 inhibitors: Possible lead drug candidates for Alzheimer's disease.	We have identified potent isophthalic acid derivatives armed with imidazol and indolyl groups as potent beta-secretase inhibitors. The most effective analogs demonstrated low nano-molar potency for the BACE1 (beta-secretase cleaving enzyme) as measured by FRET (Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer) and cell-based (ELISA) assays. Our design strategy followed a traditional SAR approach and was supported by molecular modeling studies based on previously reported hydroxyethylene transition state inhibitor derived from isophthalic acid I. In the FRET assay, the most potent compound, 10a, displayed an IC50 value for BACE1 of 75 nM, and exhibited cellular activity with an EC50 value of 0.81 muM. On the other hand, compound 11b was found to be the most potent compound in the cell-based assay with an EC50 value of 0.29 muM.
27866729	Molecular imaging in the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease and related disorders.	INTRODUCTION: The diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its related disorders rely on clinical criteria. There is, however, a large clinical overlap between the different neurodegenerative diseases affecting cognition and, frequently, there are diagnostic uncertainties with atypical clinical presentations. Current clinical practices can now regularly use positron emission tomography (PET) and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) molecular imaging to help resolve such uncertainties. The Neurology Group of the French Society of Nuclear Medicine and Federations of Memory, Resources and Research Centers have collaborated to establish clinical guidelines to determine which molecular imaging techniques to use when seeking a differential diagnosis between AD and other neurodegenerative disorders affecting cognition. STATE OF KNOWLEDGE: According to the current medical literature, the potential usefulness of molecular imaging to address the typical clinical criteria in common forms of AD remains modest, as typical AD presentations rarely raise questions of differential diagnoses with other neurodegenerative disorders. However, molecular imaging could be of significant value in the diagnosis of atypical neurodegenerative disorders, including early onset, rapid cognitive decline, prominent non-amnestic presentations involving language, visuospatial, behavioral/executive and/or non-cognitive symptoms in AD, or prominent amnestic presentations in other non-AD dementias. CONCLUSION AND PERSPECTIVE: The clinical use of molecular imaging should be recommended for assessing cognitive disturbances particularly in patients with early clinical onset (before age 65) and atypical presentations. However, diagnostic tools should always be part of the global clinical approach, as an isolated positive result cannot adequately establish a diagnosis of any neurodegenerative disorder.
27866512	Age-related epigenetic regulation in the brain and its role in neuronal diseases.	Accumulating evidence indicates many brain functions are mediated by epigenetic regulation of neural genes, and their dysregulations result in neuronal disorders. Experiences such as learning and recall, as well as physical exercise, induce neuronal activation through epigenetic modifications and by changing the noncoding RNA profiles. Animal models, brain samples from patients, and the development of diverse analytical methods have broadened our understanding of epigenetic regulation in the brain. Diverse and specific epigenetic changes are suggested to correlate with neuronal development, learning and memory, aging and age-related neuronal diseases. Although the results show some discrepancies, a careful comparison of the data (including methods, regions and conditions examined) would clarify the problems confronted in understanding epigenetic regulation in the brain. [BMB Reports 2016; 49(12): 671-680].
27865707	A comprehensive database of published tDCS clinical trials (2005-2016).	Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a technique of noninvasive cortical stimulation allowing significant modification of brain functions. Clinical application of this technique was reported for the first time in March 2005. This paper presents a detailed list of the 340 articles (excluding single case reports) which have assessed the clinical effect of tDCS in patients, at least when delivered to cortical targets. The reviewed conditions were: pain syndromes, Parkinson's disease, dystonia, cerebral palsy, post-stroke limb motor impairment, post-stroke neglect, post-stroke dysphagia, post-stroke aphasia, primary progressive aphasia, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, consciousness disorders, Alzheimer's disease and other types of dementia, tinnitus, depression, auditory hallucinations and negative symptoms of schizophrenia, addiction and craving, autism, and attention disorders. The following data were collected: (i) clinical condition; (ii) study design; (iii) sample size; (iv) anode and cathode locations; (v) stimulation intensity and electrode area; (vi) number and duration of sessions; (vii) clinical outcome measures and results. This article does not include any meta-analysis and aims simply at providing a comprehensive overview of the raw data reported in this field to date, as an aid to researchers.
27863563	Molecular Imaging and Precision Medicine in Dementia and Movement Disorders.	Precision medicine (PM) has been defined as "prevention and treatment strategies that take individual variability into account." Molecular imaging (MI) is an ideally suited tool for PM approaches to neurodegenerative dementia and movement disorders (MD). Here we review PM approaches and discuss how they may be applied to other associated neurodegenerative dementia and MD. With ongoing major therapeutic research initiatives that include the use of molecular imaging, we look forward to established interventions targeted to specific molecular pathophysiology and expect the potential benefit of MI PM approaches in neurodegenerative dementia and MD will only increase.
27863370	Novel tacrine-1,2,3-triazole hybrids: In vitro, in vivo biological evaluation and docking study of cholinesterase inhibitors.	A new series of tacrine-1,2,3-triazole hybrids were designed, synthesized, and evaluated as potent dual cholinesterase inhibitors. Most of synthesized compounds showed good in vitro inhibitory activities toward both acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE). Among them, 7-chloro-N-((1-(4-methoxybenzyl)-1H-1,2,3-triazol-4-yl)methyl)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro acridin-9-amine (5l) was found to be the most potent anti-AChE derivative (IC50 = 0.521 muM) and N-((1-(4-methoxybenzyl)-1H-1,2,3-triazol-4-yl)methyl)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroacridin-9 -amine (5j) demonstrated the best anti-BChE activity (IC50 = 0.055 muM). In vivo studies of compound 5l in Morris water maze task confirmed memory improvement in scopolamine-induced impairment. Also, molecular modeling and kinetic studies showed that compounds 5l and 5j bound simultaneously to the peripheral anionic site (PAS) and catalytic sites (CS) of the AChE and BChE.
27861395	Flashbulb memories of Paris attacks: Recall of these events and subjective reliving of these memories in a case with Alzheimer disease.	RATIONALE: Flashbulb memories are detailed and vivid memories of attributes of the reception context of surprising and emotionally arousing public events. PATIENT CONCERNS AND DIAGNOSIS: This paper offers a fine-grained view of flashbulb memories in a patient with mild Alzheimer's disease (AD). INTERVENTIONS: The patient underwent a directed interview about the 13 November 2015 attacks in Paris. OUTCOMES: Unlike her memory about the date and month of the attacks, the patient provided accurate information about the year, time and places they occurred. The patient also provided accurate information about how she first became aware of the attacks, where she was, with whom, what she was doing, and what time it was when she learned about them. As for the affective characteristics of these memories, she tended to have high ratings of vividness and rehearsal. Negative emotional states and great surprise and novelty were also reported. LESSONS: By assessing the impact of flashbulb memories in this patient with AD, this paper offers a unique view into how such memories may trigger a considerable recall of context as well much subjective reliving.
27855483	Prediction of Relapse After Discontinuation of Antipsychotic Treatment in Alzheimer's Disease: The Role of Hallucinations.	OBJECTIVE: In Alzheimer's disease, antipsychotic medications are often used for a period, with relief of symptoms, and then discontinued, after which relapse may occur. The authors sought to determine which neuropsychiatric symptoms predict relapse. METHOD: In the Antipsychotic Discontinuation in Alzheimer's Disease trial, 180 patients with Alzheimer's disease and symptoms of agitation or psychosis were treated with risperidone for 16 weeks, after which patients who responded (N=110) were randomly assigned to continue risperidone for 32 weeks, to continue risperidone for 16 weeks followed by switch to placebo for 16 weeks, or to receive placebo for 32 weeks. As reported previously, discontinuation of risperidone was associated with a two- to fourfold increased risk of relapse over 16-32 weeks. In planned post hoc analyses, the authors examined associations between the 12 symptom domains in the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) and relapse in the first 16-week phase after randomization. RESULTS: Compared with patients with mild hallucinations or no hallucinations, patients with severe hallucinations as a presenting symptom at baseline had a higher likelihood of relapse (hazard ratio=2.96, 95% CI=1.52, 5.76). This effect was present for the subgroup with auditory hallucinations, but not the subgroup with visual hallucinations. Among patients with baseline hallucinations, 13 of 17 (76.5%) who discontinued risperidone relapsed, compared with 10 of 26 (38.5%) who continued risperidone (p<0.02). This group difference remained significant for severe (77.8%) compared with mild (36%) hallucinations. NPI domain scores after the initial open-treatment phase were not associated with relapse. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with severe baseline hallucinations were more likely to relapse after randomization, and the presence of baseline hallucinations was associated with a higher risk of relapse after discontinuation of risperidone compared with continued risperidone treatment. For patients with hallucinations, particularly auditory hallucinations, antipsychotic discontinuation should be approached cautiously because of high relapse risk.
27855361	Alzheimer's disease amyloid beta peptides in vitro electrochemical oxidation.	The oxidative behaviour of the human amyloid beta (Abeta1-40 and Abeta1-42) peptides and a group of similar peptides: control inverse (Abeta40-1 and Abeta42-1), mutants (Abeta1-40Phe10 and Abeta1-40Nle35), rat Abeta1-40Rat, and fragments (Abeta1-28, Abeta1-16, Abeta10-20, Abeta12-28, and Abeta17-42), in solution or adsorbed, at a glassy carbon electrode, by cyclic and differential pulse voltammetry, were investigated and compared. Structurally the Abeta1-40 and Abeta1-42 sequences contain five electroactive amino acid residues, one tyrosine (Tyr10), three histidines (His6, His13 and His14) and one methionine (Met35). The Abeta peptide 3D structure influenced the exposure of the redox residues to the electrode surface and their oxidation peak currents. Depending on the amino acid sequence length and content, the Abeta peptides gave one or two oxidation peaks. The first electron transfer reaction corresponded to the tyrosine amino acid residue oxidation, and the second to both histidines and methionine amino acid residues. The highest contribution to the second oxidation peak current was from His13, followed by His14 and His6 residues, and Met35 residue had the lowest contribution. The Abeta peptides electron transfer depended on peptide hydrophobicity and 3D structure, the redox residues position in the sequence, the redox residues close to N-termini giving the highest oxidation peak currents.
27855360	Benzyloxynitrostyrene analogues - A novel class of selective and highly potent inhibitors of monoamine oxidase B.	This study examines a series of novel 3-benzyloxy-beta-nitrostyrene analogues as a novel class of inhibitors of the monoamine oxidase (MAO) enzymes. MAO inhibitors are considered useful for the treatment of depression and Parkinson's disease, and have recently attracted attention as potential therapeutic agents for a range of disorders including Alzheimer's disease, prostate cancer and certain cardiomyopathies. This study shows that the 3-benzyloxy-beta-nitrostyrene analogues are potent inhibitors of the MAO-B isoform with IC50 values in the nanomolar range (39-565 nM). Significantly, effectiveness towards MAO-B inhibition seems to be governed by the introduction of a 4''-fluoro-substituent on the benzyloxy ring, with compound 2b exhibiting the highest degree of MAO-B inhibition potency (IC50 = 0.039 muM) and selectivity (SI = 166) among the compounds investigated. Since some of the 3-benzyloxy-beta-nitrostyrene analogues possess potencies that are comparable to that of the reversible inhibitor, safinamide (IC50 = 0.080 muM), it may be concluded that this class may be promising leads for the development of reversible and selective MAO-B inhibitors, that may be useful for the management of Parkinson's disease.
27855359	Discovery of benzimidazole derivatives as modulators of mitochondrial function: A potential treatment for Alzheimer's disease.	In this study, we designed a library of compounds based on the structures of well-known ligands of the 18 kDa translocator protein (TSPO), one of the putative components of the mPTP. We performed diverse mitochondrial functional assays to assess their ability to restore cells from Abeta-induced toxicity in vitro and in vivo. Among tested compounds, compound 25 effectively improved cognitive function in animal models of AD. Given the excellent in vitro and in vivo activity and a favorable pharmacokinetic profile of compound 25, we believe that it can serve as a promising lead compound for a potential treatment option for AD.
27851868	Pharmacotherapies for sleep disturbances in dementia.	BACKGROUND: Sleep disturbances, including reduced nocturnal sleep time, sleep fragmentation, nocturnal wandering, and daytime sleepiness are common clinical problems in dementia, and are associated with significant caregiver distress, increased healthcare costs, and institutionalisation. Drug treatment is often sought to alleviate these problems, but there is significant uncertainty about the efficacy and adverse effects of the various hypnotic drugs in this vulnerable population. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects, including common adverse effects, of any drug treatment versus placebo for sleep disorders in people with dementia, through identification and analysis of all relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs). SEARCH METHODS: We searched ALOIS (www.medicine.ox.ac.uk/alois), the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group's Specialized Register, in March 2013 and again in March 2016, using the terms: sleep, insomnia, circadian, hypersomnia, parasomnia, somnolence, rest-activity, sundowning. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included RCTs that compared a drug with placebo, and that had the primary aim of improving sleep in people with dementia who had an identified sleep disturbance at baseline. Trials could also include non-pharmacological interventions, as long as both drug and placebo groups had the same exposure to them. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently extracted data on study design, risk of bias, and results from the included study reports. We obtained additional information from study authors where necessary. We used the mean difference as the measure of treatment effect, and where possible, synthesized results using a fixed-effect model. MAIN RESULTS: We found six RCTs eligible for inclusion for three drugs: melatonin (222 participants, four studies, but only two yielded data on our primary sleep outcomes suitable for meta-analysis), trazodone (30 participants, one study), and ramelteon (74 participants, one study, no peer-reviewed publication, limited information available).The participants in the trazodone study and almost all participants in the melatonin studies had moderate-to-severe dementia due to Alzheimer's disease (AD); those in the ramelteon study had mild-to-moderate AD. Participants had a variety of common sleep problems at baseline. All primary sleep outcomes were measured using actigraphy. In one study of melatonin, drug treatment was combined with morning bright light therapy. Only two studies made a systematic assessment of adverse effects. Overall, the evidence was at low risk of bias, although there were areas of incomplete reporting, some problems with participant attrition, related largely to poor tolerance of actigraphy and technical difficulties, and a high risk of selective reporting in one trial that contributed very few participants. The risk of bias in the ramelteon study was unclear due to incomplete reporting.We found no evidence that melatonin, at doses up to 10 mg, improved any major sleep outcome over 8 to 10 weeks in patients with AD who were identified as having a sleep disturbance. We were able to synthesize data for two of our primary sleep outcomes: total nocturnal sleep time (mean difference (MD) 10.68 minutes, 95% CI -16.22 to 37.59; N = 184; two studies), and the ratio of daytime sleep to night-time sleep (MD -0.13, 95% CI -0.29 to 0.03; N = 184; two studies). From single studies, we found no difference between melatonin and placebo groups for sleep efficiency, time awake after sleep onset, or number of night-time awakenings. From two studies, we found no effect of melatonin on cognition or performance of activities of daily living (ADL). No serious adverse effects of melatonin were reported in the included studies. We considered this evidence to be of low quality.There was low-quality evidence that trazodone 50 mg given at night for two weeks improved total nocturnal sleep time (MD 42.46 minutes, 95% CI 0.9 to 84.0; N = 30; one study), and sleep efficiency (MD 8.53%, 95% CI 1.9 to 15.1; N = 30; one study) in patients with moderate-to-severe AD, but it did not affect the amount of time spent awake after sleep onset (MD -20.41, 95% CI -60.4 to 19.6; N = 30; one study), or the number of nocturnal awakenings (MD -3.71, 95% CI -8.2 to 0.8; N = 30; one study). No effect was seen on daytime sleep, cognition, or ADL. No serious adverse effects of trazodone were reported.Results from a phase 2 trial investigating ramelteon 8 mg administered at night were available in summary form in a sponsor's synopsis. Because the data were from a single, small study and reporting was incomplete, we considered this evidence to be of low quality in general terms. Ramelteon had no effect on total nocturnal sleep time at one week (primary outcome) or eight weeks (end of treatment) in patients with mild-to-moderate AD. The synopsis reported few significant differences from placebo for any sleep, behavioural, or cognitive outcomes; none were likely to be of clinical significance. There were no serious adverse effects from ramelteon. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We discovered a distinct lack of evidence to help guide drug treatment of sleep problems in dementia. In particular, we found no RCTs of many drugs that are widely prescribed for sleep problems in dementia, including the benzodiazepine and non-benzodiazepine hypnotics, although there is considerable uncertainty about the balance of benefits and risks associated with these common treatments. From the studies we identified for this review, we found no evidence that melatonin (up to 10mg) helped sleep problems in patients with moderate to severe dementia due to AD. There was some evidence to support the use of a low dose (50 mg) of trazodone, although a larger trial is needed to allow a more definitive conclusion to be reached on the balance of risks and benefits. There was no evidence of any effect of ramelteon on sleep in patients with mild to moderate dementia due to AD. This is an area with a high need for pragmatic trials, particularly of those drugs that are in common clinical use for sleep problems in dementia. Systematic assessment of adverse effects is essential.
27848250	Pharmacological Effects of Active Components of Chinese Herbal Medicine in the Treatment of Alzheimer's Disease: A Review.	Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common neurodegenerative disorder associated with dementia, not only severely decreases the quality of life for its victims, but also brings a heavy economic burden to the family and society. Unfortunately, few chemical drugs designed for clinical applications have reached the expected preventive or therapeutic effect so far, and combined with their significant side-effects, there is therefore an urgent need for new strategies to be developed for AD treatment. Traditional Chinese Medicine has accumulated many experiences in the treatment of dementia during thousands of years of practice; modern pharmacological studies have confirmed the therapeutic effects of many active components derived from Chinese herbal medicines (CHM). Ginsenoside Rg1, extracted from Radix Ginseng, exerts a [Formula: see text]-secretase inhibitor effect so as to decrease A[Formula: see text] aggregation. It can also inhibit the apoptosis of neuron cells. Tanshinone IIA, extracted from Radix Salviae miltiorrhizae, and baicalin, extracted from Radix Scutellariae[Formula: see text] can inhibit the oxidative stress injury in neuronal cells. Icariin, extracted from Epimedium brevicornum, can decrease A[Formula: see text] levels and the hyperphosphorylation of tau protein, and can also inhibit oxidative stress and apoptosis. Huperzine A, extracted from Huperzia serrata, exerts a cholinesterase inhibitor effect. Evodiamine, extracted from Fructus Evodiae, and curcumin, extracted from Rhizoma Curcumae Longae, exert anti-inflammatory actions. Curcumin can act on A[Formula: see text] and tau too. Due to the advantages of multi-target effects and fewer side effects, Chinese medicine is more appropriate for long-term use. In this present review, the pharmacological effects of commonly used active components derived from Chinese herbal medicines in the treatment of AD are discussed.
27848119	Advanced magnetic resonance imaging of neurodegenerative diseases.	Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is playing an increasingly important role in the study of neurodegenerative diseases, delineating the structural and functional alterations determined by these conditions. Advanced MRI techniques are of special interest for their potential to characterize the signature of each neurodegenerative condition and aid both the diagnostic process and the monitoring of disease progression. This aspect will become crucial when disease-modifying (personalized) therapies will be established. MRI techniques are very diverse and go from the visual inspection of MRI scans to more complex approaches, such as manual and automatic volume measurements, diffusion tensor MRI, and functional MRI. All these techniques allow us to investigate the different features of neurodegeneration. In this review, we summarize the most recent advances concerning the use of MRI in some of the most important neurodegenerative conditions, putting an emphasis on the advanced techniques.
27848117	Capgras syndrome in Parkinson's disease: two new cases and literature review.	The Capgras syndrome (CS) is a rare psychiatric disorder. CS is classified as a delusional misidentification syndrome. Initially, CS was described in paranoid schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorders. CS has also been reported in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and Lewy body dementia. To date, there are very few descriptions of the occurrence of CS in idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD), with or without dementia. Considering the recent observation of two new cases in PD patients, a systematic overview of the literature published between 1976 and 2016 reporting CS in PD was conducted. The purpose of this article is to examine the phenomenon in people with PD with and without dementia, the psychopathologic context in which it happened, the role played by the dopaminergic medications and to define useful therapeutic strategies. Our CS cases occurred in two elderly patients with advanced PD and cognitive impairment, respectively, after an acute stressor event and after an increase of the total daily dose of levodopa. In light of our observations and the cases reported in the literature, we argue that CS is an acute or subacute psychotic disorder occurring mostly in PD with dementia. Besides, the increase in brain dopamine levels induced by acute stressful events and/or dopamine-enhancing medications should be considered as a possible causal mechanism of CS in patients with advanced stages of PD and cognitive decline.
27846918	Neurology Health Advocacy Curriculum: Needs Assessment, Curricular Content and Underlying Components.	BACKGROUND: Lack of a health advocacy curriculum and clarity are obstacles for effectively teaching neurology health advocacy (NHA) to neurology residents. Our purpose is to assess the need and develop content for a NHA curriculum and to describe its underlying components. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study with two steps. In step one, neurologists and neurology residents at University of Calgary were surveyed about their perception of teaching NHA and asked to rank 56 neurological diseases on a Likert scale based on how well they lend themselves to teaching health advocacy. In step two, curricular items were developed for the top five neurological diseases, using a modified Delphi procedure. The reliability of the survey instrument was determined by Cronbach's alpha. Exploratory factor analysis was used to identify the underlying components of NHA. RESULTS: Forty-six neurologists and 14 neurology residents were surveyed, with a response rate of 88.33%. Fifty-six percent of neurologists and 85% of residents believe that NHA curriculum is needed. The top five neurological presentations, that lend themselves easily to teaching NHA were: stroke/transient ischemic attacks, alcoholism, epilepsy, Alzheimer's disease, and multiple sclerosis. The survey instrument reliability was 0.97. Exploratory factor analysis revealed four factors that can explain the variability in the survey instrument: multidisciplinary approach to neurological disorders, prevention of recurrence of neurological disease, collaboration with other medical subspecialties, and communication with professions outside the medical field. CONCLUSION: Neurologists' and residents' responses support that NHA curriculum is needed. Four components of NHA were identified that can be used for teaching NHA as well as health advocacy in general practice.
27846826	Natural product HTP screening for antibacterial (E.coli 0157:H7) and anti-inflammatory agents in (LPS from E. coli O111:B4) activated macrophages and microglial cells; focus on sepsis.	BACKGROUND: Acute systemic inflammatory response syndrome arising from infection can lead to multiple organ failure and death, with greater susceptibility occurring in immunocompromised individuals. Moreover, sub-acute chronic inflammation is a contributor to the pathology of diverse degenerative diseases (Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease and arthritis). Given the known limitations in Western medicine to treat a broad range of inflammatory related illness as well as the emergence of antibiotic resistance, there is a renewed interest in complementary and alternative medicines (CAMs) to achieve these means. METHODS: A high throughput (HTP) screening of >1400 commonly sold natural products (bulk herbs, cooking spices, teas, leaves, supplement components, nutraceutical food components, fruit and vegetables, rinds, seeds, polyphenolics etc.) was conducted to elucidate anti-inflammatory substances in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (E. coli serotype O111:B4) monocytes: RAW 264.7 macrophages [peripheral], BV-2 microglia [brain]) relative to hydrocortisone, dexamethasone and L-N6-(1Iminoethyl)lysine (L-NIL). HTP evaluation was also carried out for lethal kill curves against E.coli 0157:H7 1x106 CFU/mL relative to penicillin. Validation studies were performed to assess cytokine profiling using antibody arrays. Findings were corroborated by independent ELISAs and NO2-/iNOS expression quantified using the Griess Reagent and immunocytochemistry, respectively. For robust screening, we developed an in-vitro efficacy paradigm to ensure anti-inflammatory parameters were observed independent of cytotoxicity. This caution was taken given that many plants exert tumoricidal and anti-inflammatory effects at close range through similar signaling pathways, which could lead to false positives. RESULTS: The data show that activated BV-2 microglia cells (+ LPS 1mug/ml) release >10-fold greater IL-6, MIP1/2, RANTES and nitric oxide (NO2-), where RAW 264.7 macrophages (+ LPS 1mug/ml) produced > 10-fold rise in sTNFR2, MCP-1, IL-6, GCSF, RANTES and NO2-. Data validation studies establish hydrocortisone and dexamethasone as suppressing multiple pro-inflammatory processes, where L-NIL suppressed NO2-, but had no effect on iNOS expression or IL-6. The screening results demonstrate relative few valid hits with anti-inflammatory effects at < 250mug/ml for the following: Bay Leaf (Laurus nobilis), Elecampagne Root (Inula helenium), Tansy (Tanacetum vulgare),Yerba (Eriodictyon californicum) and Centipeda (Centipeda minima), Ashwagandha (Withania somnifera), Feverfew (Tanacetum parthenium), Rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis), Turmeric Root (Curcuma Longa), Osha Root (Ligusticum porteri), Green Tea (Camellia sinensis) and constituents: cardamonin, apigenin, quercetin, biochanin A, eupatorin, (-)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) and butein. Natural products lethal against [E. coli 0157:H7] where the LC50 < 100 mug/ml included bioactive silver hydrosol-Argentyn 23, green tea (its constituents EGCG > Polyphenon 60 > (-)-Gallocatechin > Epicatechin > (+)-Catechin), Grapeseed Extract (Vitis vinifera), Chinese Gallnut (its constituents gallic acid > caffeic acid) and gallic acid containing plants such as Babul Chall Bark (Acacia Arabica), Arjun (Terminalia Arjuna) and Bayberry Root Bark (Morella Cerifera). CONCLUSIONS: These findings emphasize and validate the previous work of others and identify the most effective CAM anti-inflammatory, antibacterial compounds using these models. Future work will be required to evaluate potential combination strategies for long-term use to prevent chronic inflammation and possibly lower the risk of sepsis in immunocompromised at risk populations.
27845490	Cognitive disability in alzheimer's disease and its management.	Cognitive disability linked to neurodegenerative diseases and in particular to Alzheimer's disease, remains an increasing cause for concern through a dramatic prevalence increment and associated socio-economic burdens. Initially Alzheimer's disease develops asymptomatically with primary clinical signs, such as memory impairment, decline of spatial and perceptual abilities, occurring at a later stage. This delay implies the possibility of promoting early interventions during the pre-symptomatic stage of the disease. Different strategies have been applied in order to prevent/delay onset of Alzheimer's disease or at least to improve quality of life and health conditions of Alzheimer's disease patients and their caregivers, especially in the absence of current viable therapies. Multidomain interventions, aimed at affecting several risk factors simultaneously, offer a versatility that may attain improved outcomes in comparison with single-domain prevention trials. These multidomain interventions involve diet, physical exercise, cognitive training and social activities, while music therapy, improving self-consciousness and reducing neurofibrils, may contribute to deceleration/delay onset of Alzheimer's disease progression. Information and Communication Technology (ICT) provides broad applications to improve quality of life and well-being of Alzheimer's disease patients and caregivers, suffering from psychological distress, as well as reducing additional public health costs.
27841000	A mutation in beta-amyloid precursor protein renders SHSY5Y cells vulnerable to isoflurane toxicity: The role of inositol 1,4,5trisphosphate receptors.	Isoflurane is a commonly used inhaled anesthetic, which induces apoptosis of SHSY5Y cells in a dose and timedependent manner; however, the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. The authors of the present study hypothesized that a mutation in betaamyloid precursor protein (APP), which is a gene associated with familial Alzheimer's disease, may render cells vulnerable to isofluraneinduced cytotoxicity via activation of inositol 1,4,5trisphosphate receptors (IP3R). In the present study, SHSY5Y cells were transfected with a vector or with mutated APP, and were treated with the equivalent of 1 minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) isoflurane for 8 h. Cell apoptosis rate, alterations to cytosolic calcium concentrations ([Ca2+]c), and protein levels of IP3R were determined following exposure of cells to isoflurane. In addition, the effects of the IP3R antagonist xestospongin C were determined on isofluraneinduced cytotoxicity and calcium release from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of mutated APP and vectortransfected SHSY5Y cells. Treatment with isoflurane (1 MAC) for 8 h induced a higher degree of cytotoxicity, and a marked increase in [Ca2+]c and IP3R protein levels in mutated APPtransfected SHSY5Y cells compared with vectortransfected SHSY5Y cells. Xestospongin C significantly attenuated isofluranemediated cytotoxicity and inhibited calcium release from the ER of SHSY5Y cells. These results indicated that the APP mutation may render SHSY5Y cells vulnerable to isoflurane neurotoxicity, and the underlying mechanism may be associated with Ca2+ dysregulation via overactivation of IP3R.
27840401	Potent Selective Inhibition of Monoamine Oxidase A by Alternariol Monomethyl Ether Isolated from Alternaria brassicae.	Alternariol monomethyl ether (AME), a dibenzopyrone derivative, was isolated from Alternaria brassicae along with altertoxin II (ATX-II). The compounds were tested for the inhibitory activity of monoamine oxidase (MAO), which catalyzes neurotransmitting monoamines. AME was found to be a highly potent and selective inhibitor of human MAO-A with an IC50 value of 1.71 microM; however, it was found to be ineffective for MAO-B inhibition. ATX-II was not effective for the inhibition of either MAO-A or MAO-B. The inhibition of MAO-A using AME was apparently instantaneous. MAO-A activity was almost completely recovered after the dilution of the inhibited enzyme with an excess amount of AME, suggesting AME is a reversible inhibitor. AME showed mixed inhibition for MAO-A in Lineweaver-Burk plots with a Ki value of 0.34 microM. The findings of this study suggest that microbial metabolites and dibenzopyrone could be potent MAO inhibitors. In addition, AME could be a useful lead compound for developing reversible MAO-A inhibitors to treat depression, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease.
27840193	Ginsenoside Re reduces Abeta production by activating PPARgamma to inhibit BACE1 in N2a/APP695 cells.	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by beta-amyloid protein (Abeta) deposition. Reducing the Abeta load may be a new perspective for AD treatment. Ginsenoside Re is an extract from Panax notoginseng, which is a well-known traditional Chinese medicine that has been used for the treatment of various diseases for years. Ginsenoside Re has been reported to decrease Abeta in Alzheimer's disease animal models, but the mechanism has not been fully elucidated. In the present study, we investigated the mechanism of ginsenoside Re. Our results showed that ginsenoside Re decreased the Abeta levels in N2a/APP695 cells. Abeta peptides are generated by beta-secretase (beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1)) and gamma-secretase. We found that ginsenoside Re decreased the BACE1 mRNA and protein levels and inhibited BACE1 activity in the N2a/APP695 cells. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma) is a transcription factor that regulates the activity of the BACE1 promoter, and activating PPARgamma can inhibit BACE1. The results also showed that ginsenoside Re significantly increased the PPARgamma protein and mRNA levels. These effects of ginsenoside Re on BACE1 could be effectively inhibited by the PPARgamma antagonist GW9662. These findings indicate that ginsenoside Re inhibits BACE1 through activation of PPARgamma, which ultimately reduces the generation of Abeta1-40 and Abeta1-42. Therefore, ginsenoside Re may be a promising agent for the modulation of Abeta-related pathology in AD.
27839790	SenseCam: A new tool for memory rehabilitation?	The emergence of life-logging technologies has led neuropsychologist to focus on understanding how this new technology could help patients with memory disorders. Despite the growing number of studies using life-logging technologies, a theoretical framework supporting its effectiveness is lacking. This review focuses on the use of life-logging in the context of memory rehabilitation, particularly the use of SenseCam, a wearable camera allowing passive image capture. In our opinion, reviewing SenseCam images can be effective for memory rehabilitation only if it provides more than an assessment of prior occurrence in ways that reinstates previous thoughts, feelings and sensory information, thus stimulating recollection. Considering the fact that, in memory impairment, self-initiated processes are impaired, we propose that the environmental support hypothesis can explain the value of SenseCam for memory retrieval. Twenty-five research studies were selected for this review and despite the general acceptance of the value of SenseCam as a memory technique, only a small number of studies focused on recollection. We discuss the usability of this tool to improve episodic memory and in particular, recollection.
27838936	Computerized Cognitive Training in Older Adults With Mild Cognitive Impairment or Dementia: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.	OBJECTIVE: Previous meta-analyses indicate that computerized cognitive training (CCT) is a safe and efficacious intervention for cognition in older adults. However, efficacy varies across populations and cognitive domains, and little is known about the efficacy of CCT in people with mild cognitive impairment or dementia. METHOD: The authors searched Medline, Embase, PsychINFO, CINAHL, and CENTRAL through July 1, 2016, for randomized controlled trials of CCT in older adults with mild cognitive impairment or dementia. Overall cognition, individual cognitive domains, psychosocial function, and activities of daily living were pooled separately for mild cognitive impairment and dementia trials. RESULTS: The overall effect on cognition in mild cognitive impairment across 17 trials was moderate (Hedges' g=0.35, 95% CI=0.20-0.51). There was no evidence of publication bias or difference between active- and passive-controlled trials. Small to moderate effects were found for global cognition, attention, working memory, learning, and memory, with the exception of nonverbal memory, and for psychosocial functioning, including depressive symptoms. In dementia, statistically significant effects were found on overall cognition (k=11, g=0.26, 95% CI=0.01-0.52) and visuospatial skills, but these were driven by three trials of virtual reality or Nintendo Wii. CONCLUSIONS: CCT is efficacious on global cognition, select cognitive domains, and psychosocial functioning in people with mild cognitive impairment. This intervention therefore warrants longer-term and larger-scale trials to examine effects on conversion to dementia. Conversely, evidence for efficacy in people with dementia is weak and limited to trials of immersive technologies.
27836688	Pathologic significance of SET/I2PP2A-mediated PP2A and non-PP2A pathways in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).	SET (SE translocation, SET), a constitutive inhibitor of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), is a multifunctional oncoprotein involved in DNA replication, histone modification, nucleosome assembly, gene transcription and cell proliferation. It is widely expressed in human tissues including the gonadal system and brain. Intensive studies have shown that overexpressed SET plays an important role in the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD), and may also contribute to the malignant transformation of breast and ovarian cancers. Recent studies indicated that through interaction with PP2A, SET may upregulate androgen biosynthesis and contribute to hyperandrogenism in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) patients. This review article summarizes data concerning the SET expression in ovaries from PCOS and normal women, and analyzes the role/regulatory mechanism of SET for androgen biosynthesis in PCOS, as well as the significance of this action in the development of PCOS. The potential value of SET-triggered pathway as a therapeutic target and the application of anti-SET reagents for treating hyperandrogenism in PCOS patients are also discussed.
27836195	Design, synthesis of allosteric peptide activator for human SIRT1 and its biological evaluation in cellular model of Alzheimer's disease.	Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) is one of the member of the mammalian proteins of the Sirtuin family of NAD+ dependent deacetylases, has recently been shown to attenuate amyloidogenic processing of amyloid protein precursor (APP) in in-vitro cell culture studies and transgenic mouse models of Alzheimer's disease (AD). SIRT1 has been shown to have a protective role against (AD). It has been reported earlier that increasing SIRT1 activity can prevent AD in mice model. Tripeptide as an activator of SIRT1 were screened on the basis of structural information by molecular docking and synthesized by solid phase method. The enhancement of biochemical activity of pure recombinant SIRT1 as well as SIRT1 in serum of AD patients in presence of tripeptide was done by Fluorescent Activity Assay. The activity of SIRT1 by peptide was assessed in IMR-32 cell line by measuring acetylated p53 level. Further the protective effect of SIRT1 activator in cellular model of AD was analyzed by MTT assay. We find CWR tripeptide as a SIRT1 activator by molecular docking, enhanced the activity of SIRT1 protein by lowering the Michaelis constant, Km by allosteric mechanism. The activity of serum SIRT1 of AD was also increases by CWR. It also decreased the acetylation of p53 in IMR32 neuroblastoma cells and protected the cell death caused by Abeta amyloid fragments in cell line model of AD. Thus, it can be concluded that CWR may serve as platform to elucidate further small molecule activator as a therapeutic agent for AD targeting SIRT1.
27832767	Chitinase-3-like 1 protein (CHI3L1) locus influences cerebrospinal fluid levels of YKL-40.	BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology appears several years before clinical symptoms, so identifying ways to detect individuals in the preclinical stage is imperative. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Tau/Abeta42 ratio is currently the best known predictor of AD status and cognitive decline, and the ratio of CSF levels of chitinase-3-like 1 protein (CHI3L1, YKL-40) and amyloid beta (Abeta42) were reported as predictive, but individual variability and group overlap inhibits their utility for individual diagnosis making it necessary to find ways to improve sensitivity of these biomarkers. METHODS: We used linear regression to identify genetic loci associated with CSF YKL-40 levels in 379 individuals (80 cognitively impaired and 299 cognitively normal) from the Charles F and Joanne Knight Alzheimer's Disease Research Center. We tested correlations between YKL-40 and CSF Tau/Abeta42 ratio, Abeta42, tau, and phosphorylated tau (ptau181). We used studentized residuals from a linear regression model of the log-transformed, standardized protein levels and the additive reference allele counts from the most significant locus to adjust YKL-40 values and tested the differences in correlations with CSF Tau/Abeta42 ratio, Abeta42, tau, and ptau181. RESULTS: We found that genetic variants on the CH13L1 locus were significantly associated with CSF YKL-40 levels, but not AD risk, age at onset, or disease progression. The most significant variant is a reported expression quantitative trait locus for CHI3L1, the gene which encodes YKL-40, and explained 12.74 % of the variance in CSF YKL-40 in our study. YKL-40 was positively correlated with ptau181 (r = 0.521) and the strength of the correlation significantly increased with the addition of genetic information (r = 0.573, p = 0.006). CONCLUSIONS: CSF YKL-40 levels are likely a biomarker for AD, but we found no evidence that they are an AD endophenotype. YKL-40 levels are highly regulated by genetic variation, and by including genetic information the strength of the correlation between YKL-40 and ptau181 levels is significantly improved. Our results suggest that studies of potential biomarkers may benefit from including genetic information.
27830791	The activities of amyloids from a structural perspective.	The aggregation of proteins into structures known as amyloids is observed in many neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease. Amyloids are composed of pairs of tightly interacting, many stranded and repetitive intermolecular beta-sheets, which form the cross-beta-sheet structure. This structure enables amyloids to grow by recruitment of the same protein and its repetition can transform a weak biological activity into a potent one through cooperativity and avidity. Amyloids therefore have the potential to self-replicate and can adapt to the environment, yielding cell-to-cell transmissibility, prion infectivity and toxicity.
27830781	Mammalian prions and their wider relevance in neurodegenerative diseases.	Prions are notorious protein-only infectious agents that cause invariably fatal brain diseases following silent incubation periods that can span a lifetime. These diseases can arise spontaneously, through infection or be inherited. Remarkably, prions are composed of self-propagating assemblies of a misfolded cellular protein that encode information, generate neurotoxicity and evolve and adapt in vivo. Although parallels have been drawn with Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative conditions involving the deposition of assemblies of misfolded proteins in the brain, insights are now being provided into the usefulness and limitations of prion analogies and their aetiological and therapeutic relevance.
27830780	The road to restoring neural circuits for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.	Alzheimer's disease is a progressive loss of memory and cognition, for which there is no cure. Although genetic studies initially suggested a primary role for amyloid-in Alzheimer's disease, treatment strategies targeted at reducing amyloid-have failed to reverse cognitive symptoms. These clinical findings suggest that cognitive decline is the result of a complex pathophysiology and that targeting amyloid-alone may not be sufficient to treat Alzheimer's disease. Instead, a broad outlook on neural-circuit-damaging processes may yield insights into new therapeutic strategies for curing memory loss in the disease.
27830778	Defects in trafficking bridge Parkinson's disease pathology and genetics.	Parkinson's disease is a debilitating, age-associated movement disorder. A central aspect of the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease is the progressive demise of midbrain dopamine neurons and their axonal projections, but the underlying causes of this loss are unclear. Advances in genetics and experimental model systems have illuminated an important role for defects in intracellular transport pathways to lysosomes. The accumulation of altered proteins and damaged mitochondria, particularly at axon terminals, ultimately might overwhelm the capacity of intracellular disposal mechanisms. Cell-extrinsic mechanisms, including inflammation and prion-like spreading, are proposed to have both protective and deleterious functions in Parkinson's disease.
27830689	[Isomerization of Asp7 increases the toxic effects of amyloid beta and its phosphorylated form in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells].	The generation of amyloid beta (Abeta) toxic oligomers during the formation of senile plaques and amyloid fibrils is thought to play a central role in the onset and progression of Alzheimer's disease. Abeta production is a physiological process, but the factors that trigger a transition to pathogenic Abeta aggregation remain unknown. Posttranslational modifications of Abeta could potentially induce the transition. The effects of Abeta and its modified forms containing isomerized Asp7, phosphorylated Ser8, or both, were studied in SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells. Asp7 isomerization of was shown to increase cytotoxicity of both the intact and phosphorylated Abeta. An increase in cytotoxicity was not associated with an increased internalization of the isomerized Asp7-containing Abeta or an influence on the function of mitochondria or reduced glutathione and reactive oxygen species levels. The nitric oxide (NO) level was identified as a determinant of the cytotoxic effect of isomerized Asp7-containing peptides, a decrease in NO level correlating with an increase in cytotoxicity.
27829572	Magnesium in the CNS: recent advances and developments.	A potential neuroprotective role for magnesium in neurological disease has been appreciated for almost three decades, yet translation to the clinical arena has proven elusive. Accumulating experimental evidence continues to suggest that magnesium plays a critical role in a number of neurological conditions including headache, stress, alcohol/drug intoxication, acute brain injury, seizures, Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. Simple administration of a magnesium salt in these conditions has not always been therapeutically successful, with a number of studies showing poor penetration of serum magnesium across the blood brain barrier. Several studies have since demonstrated that using a carrier such as polyethylene glycol can address this, simultaneously reducing the dose of magnesium required to achieve the desired central effects while at the same time attenuating deleterious peripheral effects. Alternatively, administering a more permeable magnesium salt, such as magnesium threonate, is seen as the preferred option in more chronic neurological conditions, with positive results having been achieved in experimental models of Alzheimer's disease. Irrespective of the approach, improved central penetration of a magnesium compound that avoids peripheral side effects of high magnesium dosages is clearly a desirable outcome, and should now be investigated in animal models that accurately mimic the complex human condition.
27829557	Enhancing surface functionality of reduced graphene oxide biosensors by oxygen plasma treatment for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis.	We performed oxygen plasma treatment on reduced graphene oxide (rGO) to improve its surface reactivity with respect to biomolecular interactions. Oxygen-plasma-treated rGO surfaces were employed as reactive interfaces for the detection of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides, the pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD), as the target analytes. By measuring the changes in electrical characteristics and confirmation through topographic analysis, the oxygen-plasma-treated rGO sensors had enhanced surface functionality for better antibody immobilization and sensing performance, with a 3.33-fold steeper slope for the electrical responses versus analyte concentration curve (logarithmic scale) compared to the untreated. The elicited biomolecular reactivity of the rGO surfaces with the oxygen plasma treatment remained at 46-51% of the initial value even after aging for 6h in ambient conditions. This phenomenon was also confirmed by pretreating the rGO surfaces with a blocking agent and subsequently subjecting them to antibody immobilization. Finally, the feasibility of the oxygen-plasma-treated rGO sensors as a diagnostic tool was evaluated with clinical samples of neural-derived exosomal Abeta peptides extracted from apparent AD patients and normal controls (NC). In contrast to the untreated sensors (p=0.0460), the oxygen-plasma-treated rGO sensors showed a significant p-value in the identification of clinical samples of AD and NC subjects (p<0.001). These results suggest that oxygen plasma treatment improves sensor performance without complicated fabrication procedures and should aid in the development of novel diagnostic tools based on carbon nanomaterials.
27829556	Detection of the tau protein in human serum by a sensitive four-electrode electrochemical biosensor.	This study presents a novel approach based on a four-electrode electrochemical biosensor for the detection of tau protein - one of the possible markers for the prediction of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The biosensor is based on the formation of stable antibody-antigen complexes on gold microband electrodes covered with a layer of a self-assembled monolayer and protein G. Antibodies were immobilized on the gold electrode surface in an optimal orientation by protein G interaction. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was used to analyze impedance change, which revealed a linear response with increasing tau concentrations. The assay is fast (<1h for incubation and measurement) and very sensitive. The limit of quantification for the full-length 2N4R tau protein is 0.03pM, a value unaltered when the assay was processed in bovine serum albumin or human serum. This technology could be adapted for the detection of other biomarkers to provide a multiple assay to identify AD progression in a point of care setting.
27825018	Beyond immunotherapy: new approaches for disease modifying treatments for early Alzheimer's disease.	INTRODUCTION: Current pharmacological recommendations for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD) include the cholinesterase inhibitors and the N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonist, memantine. However, these medications only manage symptoms of AD, and do not target Abeta plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. As such, there is a need to develop effective and safe disease modifying treatments that directly target AD pathology and alter the course of AD progression. Areas covered: This review evaluates ongoing phase 2 and 3 clinical trials, as well as those completed or published over the past five years. Studies for this review were obtained from clinicaltrials.gov, alzforum.org/therapeutics, and PubMed. Keywords and search criteria included: phase 2, or 3 trials related to Alzheimer's disease, mild cognitive impairment, amyloid-beta and tau. Immunotherapies for AD have not been included as this is beyond the scope of this review. Expert opinion: A substantial number of trials investigating disease modifying drugs in AD target amyloid-beta and tau pathology. However, many of these trials have relatively short treatment duration and do not include combined assessment of biomarkers and clinical outcomes. Future investigations are recommended to include biomarker assessments and clinical outcomes over a minimum treatment duration of 18 months in order to establish disease-modifying effects.
27823887	Targeting Alzheimer's disease by investigating previously unexplored chemical space surrounding the cholinesterase inhibitor donepezil.	A series of twenty seven acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, as potential agents for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, were designed and synthesised based upon previously unexplored chemical space surrounding the molecular skeleton of the drug donepezil, which is currently used for the management of mild to severe Alzheimer's disease. Two series of analogues were prepared, the first looking at the replacement of the piperidine ring in donepezil with different sized saturated N-containing ring systems and the second looking at the introduction of different linkers between the indanone and piperidine rings in donepezil. The most active analogue 5,6-dimethoxy-1-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-2-yl 1-benzylpiperidine-4-carboxylate (67) afforded an in vitro IC50 value of 0.03 +/- 0.07 muM against acetylcholinesterase with no cytotoxicity observed (IC50 of >100 muM, SH-SY5Y cell line). In comparison donepezil had an IC50 of 0.05 +/- 0.06 muM and an observed cytotoxicity IC50 of 15.54 +/- 1.12 muM. Molecular modelling showed a strong correlation between activity and in silico binding in the active site of acetylcholinesterase.
27823753	Alzheimer's disease, apolipoprotein E and hormone replacement therapy.	Alzheimer's disease is the most frequent cause of dementia in older patients. The prevalence is higher in women than in men. This may be the result of both the higher life expectancy of women and the loss of neuroprotective estrogen after menopause. Earlier age at menopause (spontaneous or surgical) is associated with an enhanced risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. Therefore, it is postulated that estrogen could be protective against it. If so, increasing exposure to estrogen through the use of postmenopausal hormone replacement could also be protective against Alzheimer's disease. The results of the clinical studies that have examined this hypothesis are inconclusive, however. One explanation for this is that estrogen treatment is protective only if it is initiated in the years immediately after menopause. Another possibility is that the neuroprotective effects of estrogen are negated by a particular genotype of apolipoprotein E. This protein plays an important role in cholesterol transport to the neurons. Studies that have examined the link between estrogen replacement therapy, Alzheimer's disease and the E4 allele of ApoE are inconclusive. This article reviews the literature on the influence of hormone replacement therapy on the incidence and progression of Alzheimer's disease.
27822591	[Memantine as add-on medication to acetylcholinesterase inhibitor therapy for Alzheimer dementia].	Currently available data indicate superior therapeutic effects of combination treatment for Alzheimer dementia with memantine and acetylcholine esterase inhibitors in certain clinical contexts. Out of five randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trials two showed superior therapeutic effects in comparison to monotherapy with acetylcholinesterase inhibitors regarding various domains. Recently published meta-analyses and cost-benefit analyses also showed positive results. Recently published German guidelines for dementia treatment also take these new data into account and recommend combination treatment in patients with severe dementia on stable donepezil medication. This article gives an overview of current evidence for combination therapy.
27822470	Transcriptional Regulation of lncRNA Genes by Histone Modification in Alzheimer's Disease.	Increasing studies have revealed that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are not transcriptional noise but play important roles in the regulation of a wide range of biological processes, and the dysregulation of lncRNA genes is associated with disease development. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disease that usually starts slowly and gets worse over time. However, little is known about the roles of lncRNA genes in AD and how the lncRNA genes are transcriptionally regulated. Herein, we analyzed RNA-seq data and ChIP-seq histone modification data from CK-p25 AD model and control mice and identified 72 differentially expressed lncRNA genes, 4,917 differential peaks of H3K4me3, and 1,624 differential peaks of H3K27me3 between AD and control samples, respectively. Furthermore, we found 92 differential peaks of histone modification H3K4me3 are located in the promoter of 39 differentially expressed lncRNA genes and 8 differential peaks of histone modification H3K27me3 are located upstream of 7 differentially expressed lncRNA genes, which suggest that the majority of lncRNA genes may be transcriptionally regulated by histone modification in AD.
27818183	Assessment of the pharmacokinetic profile of novel s-triazine derivatives and their potential use in treatment of Alzheimer's disease.	AIMS: The current treatment of Alzheimer's disease is purely symptomatic. Scientists are looking for new treatment options which could alter the course of the disease and improve the quality of life in patients with Alzheimer's disease. In this paper 14 novel s-triazine molecules have been evaluated for their lipophilicity. In addition docking study was carried out to evaluate acetylcholinesterase activity of these compounds. MAIN METHODS: Lipophilicity was evaluated by RP HPTLC using 5 different mobile phases and obtained results were used in calculations of pharmacokinetic parameters - logBB, Ka and Pej. Multiple linear regression analysis was refined, taking account of molecular polarity (total polar surface area, TPSA) and molecular weight (Mw) descriptors. Appropriate QSAR models were developed. Docking studies were carried out using the Vina docking. KEY FINDINGS: Five out of fourteen compounds evaluated [5-10] are selected as the most promising compounds with satisfactory pharmacokinetic properties and good docking scores. SIGNIFICANCE: Compound 10 possesses the best combination of favourable pharmacokinetic characteristics (brain penetration, intestinal absorption) and capacity for acetylcholinesterase inhibition. Consequently this molecule should be further evaluated for potential therapeutic use in Alzheimer's disease.
27814300	Role of Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 3 (SOCS3) in Altering Activated Microglia Phenotype in APPswe/PS1dE9 Mice.	In response to changes of the central nervous system environment, microglia are capable of acquiring diverse phenotypes for cytotoxic or immune regulation and resolution of injury. Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology also induces several microglial activations, resulting in production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen species or clearance of amyloid-beta (Abeta) through phagocytosis. We previously demonstrated that microglial activation and increase in oxidative stress started from the middle age in APPswe/PS1dE9 mice, and hypothesized that M1 activation occurs in middle-aged AD mice by Abeta stimulation. In the present study, we analyzed in vivo expressions of pro-inflammatory cytokines (M1 microglial markers), M2 microglial markers, and suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) family, and examined the microglial phenotypic profile in APPswe/PS1dE9 mice. Then we compared the in vitro gene expression patterns of Abeta- and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated primary-cultured microglia. Microglia in APPswe/PS1dE9 mice exhibited an M1-like phenotype, expressing tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) but not interleukin 6 (IL6). Abeta-stimulated primary-cultured microglia also expressed TNFalpha but not IL6, whereas LPS-stimulated primary-cultured microglia expressed both pro-inflammatory cytokines. Furthermore, both microglia in APPswe/PS1dE9 mice and Abeta-stimulated primary-cultured microglia expressed SOCS3. Reduction of SOCS3 expression in Abeta-challenged primary-cultured microglia resulted in upregulation of IL6 expression. Our findings indicate that SOCS3 suppresses complete polarization to M1 phenotype through blocking IL6 production, and Abeta-challenged primary-cultured microglia replicate the in vivo gene expression pattern of microglia in APPswe/PS1dE9 mice. Abeta may induce the M1-like phenotype through blocking of IL6 by SOCS3.
27814291	Vascular dysfunction-associated with Alzheimer's disease.	Our attention is focused on the study of a new model based on the red blood cell (RBC) and on its interaction with amyloid beta peptide 1-42 (Abeta). RBC are highly deformable to assist blood flow in the microcirculation. For this reasons RBC abnormalities could contribute to Alzheimer's disease (AD) by obstructing oxygen delivery to brain, causing hypoxia. In our work, considering that RBC membrane contains, among blood elements, higher acetylcholinesterase (AChE) levels, we can assume that in blood occurs a mechanism similar to the one which occurs at the neuronal level leading to an increase of Abeta toxicity mediated by its binding with AChE, located on the RBC external face. Furthermore, since mechanical properties of RBC membrane are regulated by a number of molecular components of signalling and/or regulatory pathways, of these, particular interest has been addressed toward Nitric Oxide (NO) metabolism, due to its dependence to AChE.
27809706	Oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction-linked neurodegenerative disorders.	Reactive species play an important role in physiological functions. Overproduction of reactive species, notably reactive oxygen (ROS) and nitrogen (RNS) species along with the failure of balance by the body's antioxidant enzyme systems results in destruction of cellular structures, lipids, proteins, and genetic materials such as DNA and RNA. Moreover, the effects of reactive species on mitochondria and their metabolic processes eventually cause a rise in ROS/RNS levels, leading to oxidation of mitochondrial proteins, lipids, and DNA. Oxidative stress has been considered to be linked to the etiology of many diseases, including neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) such as Alzheimer diseases, Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Friedreich's ataxia, Huntington's disease, Multiple sclerosis, and Parkinson's diseases. In addition, oxidative stress causing protein misfold may turn to other NDDs include Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy, Kuru, Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker syndrome, and Fatal Familial Insomnia. An overview of the oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction-linked NDDs has been summarized in this review.
27769848	TREMs in Alzheimer's disease: Genetic and clinical investigations.	Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells (TREMs) receptors constitute a family modulators in human innate immunity system that encode by a gene cluster. Rare variants in TREM2 were reported to be associated with significant Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk. However, inconsistent results were also reported in some studies of Non-European descents. Recently, the other TREM family members are also considered to involve in AD and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) soluble form of TREM2 (sTREM2) levels has also been associated with respond to progression of disease. In this review, we converged the data of genetic and clinical investigations to identify the clearer role of TREMs in AD. Here, comprehensively analyze of multidisciplinary fields highlights the contribution of TREMs locus to AD development.
27725222	Prognostic impact of serum soluble LR11 in newly diagnosed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma: A multicenter prospective analysis.	BACKGROUND: LR11 (also called SorLA or SORL1) is a type I membrane protein, originally identified as a biomarker for atherosclerosis and Alzheimer's disease. We recently found that LR11 was specifically expressed in Diffuse Large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) cells, and high serum sLR11 concentrations in retrospective cohort indicated inferior survival. In this study, we prospectively validated the clinical impact of serum sLR11 in 97 patients with newly-diagnosed, untreated DLBCL. RESULTS: Serum sLR11 concentrations were increased in DLBCL patients compared to normal controls (mean+/-SD: 21.2+/-27.6 vs. 8.8+/-1.8ng/ml, P<0.0001), and significantly reduced at remission (mean+/-SD: 17.4+/-16.4 vs. 10.9+/-4.5ng/ml, P=0.02). Increased serum sLR11 concentrations were affected by tumor burden and bone marrow invasion. The 2-y OS and PFS were significantly lower in patients with high sLR11 concentrations (</=18.1ng/ml vs. >18.1ng/ml; 2-y OS: 89.0% vs. 56.4%, P<0.0001; 2-y PFS: 85.8% vs. 56.9%, P<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Serum sLR11 is a tumor-derived biomarker for predicting the survival of newly diagnosed patients with DLBCL.
27685250	DNA methylation changes at SNCA intron 1 in patients with dementia with Lewy bodies.	AIM: It is difficult to diagnose dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) because it exhibits clinical and neuropathological overlap with both Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. The alpha-synuclein protein is a major component of Lewy bodies, and accumulation of alpha-synuclein aggregates causes synaptic dysfunction in DLB. Epigenetic changes at the synuclein alpha ( SNCA ) gene may be involved in DLB pathogenesis. METHODS: We examined DNA methylation rates at 10 CpG sites located in intron 1 of SNCA and SNCA mRNA expression in peripheral leukocytes to compare DLB patients (n = 20; nine men, 11 women; age = 78.8 +/- 7.7 years) with healthy controls (n = 20; eight men, 12 women; age = 77.0 +/- 6.9 years). RESULTS: The methylation rate at CpG 4 ( P = 0.002) and the overall mean methylation rate at these sites (P < 0.001) were significantly lower in DLB patients than in healthy controls after Bonferroni correction. Although SNCA126 , a partial form of SNCA mRNA expression, was significantly increased in DLB ( P = 0.017), there was no significant difference in total SNCA mRNA expression between DLB patients and healthy controls ( P = 0.165). No correlation was observed between SCNA mRNA expression levels and blood DNA methylation rates in either DLB or healthy controls. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicated that lower methylation rates may be a biomarker for DLB.
27591943	Design of PLGA-functionalized quercetin nanoparticles for potential use in Alzheimer's disease.	Dysfunctional interaction of amyloid-beta (Abeta) with excess metal ions is proved to be related to the etiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Hence, disruption of these metal-peptide interactions using nanoparticles (NPs) holds considerable promise as a therapeutic strategy to combat this incurable disease. Given that quercetin is a natural product, the biocompatibility and small size essential for permeating the blood-brain barrier make it a potential therapeutic drug candidate for treating AD. Nanocarriers formulated with the US Food and Drug Administration-approved biocompatible and biodegradable polymer PLGA are being widely explored for the controlled delivery of therapeutic drugs, proteins, peptides, oligonucleotides, and genes. With this background, the present study was undertaken to investigate the effects of PLGA-functionalized quercetin (PLGA@QT) NPs on inhibited and disassembled Abeta42 fibrils and the PLGA@QT NPs have low cytotoxicity when tested on SH-SY5Y cells in vitro. As expected, the cytotoxicity studies of the PLGA@QT NPs led to a concentration-related behaviour on the SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells. And, it has demonstrated that PLGA@QT NPs can inhibit the neurotoxicity of Zn2+-Abeta42 system and enhance the viability of neuron cells. The results from behavioral tests indicate that injection of PLGA@QT NPs into APP/PS1 mice ameliorate cognition and memory impairments. Most encouragingly, the in vivo systemic toxicity of PLGA@QT NPs examined by histological analysis in major organs did not show any signs of adverse effect to mice. Thus, the prepared quercetin based nanoscale drug delivery carrier efficiently enhanced the therapeutic index and reduced the side effects. Our findings are highly encouraging, providing substantial evidence of the safety of PLGA@QT NPs for biomedical application. We expect these findings will be relevant for other NPs for treatment of AD and have broad implications in NP-based studies and applications.
27528198	Berberis Vulgaris and Berberine: An Update Review.	Berberine is an isoquinoline alkaloid present in several plants, including Coptis sp. and Berberis sp. Berberine is a customary component in Chinese medicine, and is characterized by a diversity of pharmacological effects. An extensive search in electronic databases (PubMed, Scopus, Ovid, Wiley, ProQuest, ISI, and Science Direct) were used to identify the pharmacological and clinical studies on Berberis vulgaris and berberine, during 2008 to 2015, using 'berberine' and 'Berberis vulgaris' as search words. We found more than 1200 new article studying the properties and clinical uses of berberine and B. vulgaris, for treating tumor, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, hyperlipidemia, inflammation, bacterial and viral infections, cerebral ischemia trauma, mental disease, Alzheimer disease, osteoporosis, and so on. In this article, we have updated the pharmacological effects of B. vulgaris and its active constituent, berberine. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
27808372	Role of ADH1B rs1229984 and ALDH2 rs671 gene polymorphisms in the development of Alzheimer's disease.	In the present study, we investigated the association between ADH1B rs1229984 and ALDH2 rs671 polymorphisms and the development of Alzheimer's disease in a Chinese population. Genotyping of the ADH1B rs1229984 and ALDH2 rs671 polymorphisms was carried out by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism. Logistic regression analyses revealed that the AA genotype of ADH1B rs1229984 was associated with an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease (OR = 2.54, 95%CI = 1.19-5.41). In addition, ADH1B rs1229984 was also associated with elevated risk of Alzheimer's disease in both dominant (OR = 1.78, 95%CI = 1.09-2.93) and recessive (OR = 2.33, 95%CI = 1.18-4.57) models. For ALDH2 rs671, the AA genotype was correlated with an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease as compared to the GG genotype (OR = 4.57, 95%CI = 1.60-14.01). The ALDH2 rs671 polymorphism was associated with Alzheimer's in both dominant (OR = 1.79, 95%CI = 1.08-2.97) and recessive (OR = 4.17, 95%CI = 1.49-12.67) models. In conclusion, we observed that ADH1B rs1229984 and ALDH2 rs671 polymorphisms increased the risk of Alzheimer's disease in all the genetic models.
27699588	The protein-interaction network with functional roles in tumorigenesis, neurodegeneration, and aging.	The present review summarizes the knowledge about a protein-interaction network, which includes proteins with significant functions in the mechanisms of aging and age-related diseases. All the detected interacting proteins TPPII, p53, MYBBP1A, CDK2 and SIRT7, SIRT6, and CD147 are suitable for the development of antitumor therapeutics and treatments for diseases of aging. TPPII and SIRT6 directly affect glucose metabolism which drive malignant growth. In addition, SIRT6 activators are attractive candidates for Alzheimer's disease (AD) due to the protection effect of SIRT6 overexpression from DNA damage. TPPII activity exhibits a decreasing effect on mTOR signaling, and its requirement for the degradation of Abeta peptides in the human fibroblasts suggests that it has dual functions in tumorigenesis and AD-related pathology. Likewise, the direct promotion of the invasiveness of breast epithelial cells and the contribution to the Abeta degradation by stimulating the matrix metalloproteinases production suggest a double functional role for CD147. An association of the partial portion of cellular CD147 to gamma-secretase further supports the functional relation to AD pathology. The animal and cellular models with downregulated or knockout TPPII, p53, SIRT6, SIRT7, and MYBBP1A expression levels illustrate similar functions of the interacting proteins. They demonstrate similar effects on the length of life span, premature aging, and lipid metabolism. The presented protein-interaction network is relevant to the discoveries of the mechanisms of tumorigenesis, aging, and neurodegeneration.
27805721	Treatment of epilepsy for people with Alzheimer's disease.	BACKGROUND: Any type of seizure can be observed in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Antiepileptic drugs seem to prevent the recurrence of epileptic seizures in most people with AD. There are pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments for epilepsy in people with AD. There are no current systematic reviews to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of the treatment. This review aims to review those different modalities. OBJECTIVES: To assess the efficacy and tolerability of the treatment of epilepsy for people with Alzheimer's disease (AD) (including sporadic AD and dominantly inherited AD). SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Epilepsy Group Specialized Register (1 February 2016), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (1 February 2016), MEDLINE (Ovid, 1 February 2016) and ClinicalTrials.gov (1 February 2016). In an effort to identify further published, unpublished and ongoing trials, we searched ongoing trials' registers, reference lists and relevant conference proceedings, and contacted authors and pharmaceutical companies. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials investigating treatment for epilepsy in people with AD, with the outcomes of proportion of seizure freedom or experiencing adverse events. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently screened the titles and abstracts of identified records, selected studies for inclusion, extracted data, cross-checked the data for accuracy and assessed the methodological quality. We performed no meta-analyses due to the limited available data. MAIN RESULTS: We included one randomised controlled trial with 95 participants. Concerning the proportion of participants with seizure freedom, no significant differences were found in levetiracetam (LEV) versus lamotrigine (LTG) (risk ratio (RR) 1.20, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.53 to 2.71), in levetiracetam versus phenobarbital (PB) (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.47 to 2.19), or in LTG versus PB (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.35 to 2.02). It seemed that LEV could improve cognition and LTG could relieve depression; while PB and LTG could worsen cognition, and LEV and PB could worsen mood. We judged the quality of the evidence to be very low. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: This review does not provide sufficient evidence to support LEV, PB and LTG for the treatment of epilepsy in people with AD. Regarding the efficacy and tolerability, no significant differences were found between LEV, PB and LTG. In the future, large randomised, double-blind, controlled, parallel-group clinical trials are required to determine the efficacy and tolerability of treatment for epilepsy in people with AD.
27804000	Novel sila-amide derivatives of N-acetylcysteine protects platelets from oxidative stress-induced apoptosis.	Oxidative stress-induced platelet apoptosis is one among the many causes for the development and progression of many disorders like cardiovascular diseases, arthritis, Alzheimer's disease and many chronic inflammatory responses. Many studies have demonstrated the less optimal effect of N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) in oxidative stress-induced cellular damage. This could be due to its less lipophilicity which makes it difficult to enter the cellular membrane. Therefore in the present study, lipophilic sila-amide derivatives (6a and 6b) synthesized through the reaction of NAC with 3-Aminopropyltrimethylsilane and aminomethyltrimethylsilane were used to determine their protective property against oxidative stress-induced platelet apoptosis. At a concentration of 10 microM, compound 6a and 6b were able to significantly inhibit Rotenone/H2O2 induced platelet apoptotic markers like reactive oxygen species, intracellular calcium level, mitochondrial membrane potential, cytochrome c release from mitochondrial to the cytosol, caspase-9 and -3 activity and phosphatidylserine externalization. Therefore, the compounds can be extrapolated as therapeutic agents to protect platelets from oxidative stress-induced platelet apoptosis and its associated complications.
27644698	Cognitive, social, and neural determinants of diminished decision-making and financial exploitation risk in aging and dementia: A review and new model.	In this article we will briefly review how changes in brain and in cognitive and social functioning, across the spectrum from normal to pathological aging, can lead to decision-making impairments that increase abuse risk in many life domains (e.g., health care, social engagement, financial management). The review will specifically focus on emerging research identifying neural, cognitive, and social markers of declining financial decision-making capacity in older adults. We will highlight how these findings are opening avenues for early detection and new interventions to reduce exploitation risk.
27040443	A novel oxidative stress marker in patients with Alzheimer's disease: dynamic thiol-disulphide homeostasis.	OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the dynamic thiol-disulphide homeostasis as an oxidative stress parameter, using a newly proposed method, in patients with Alzheimer's disease. METHODS: In total, 97 participants were included in the study. Among them, 51 had been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease, and the remaining 46 were healthy individuals. Total thiol (-SH+-S-S-) levels and native thiol (-SH) levels in serum of each participant were measured. The amount of dynamic disulphide bonds (-S-S-) and (-S-S-) x100/(-SH), (-S-S-) x100/(-SH+-S-S-), and -SHx100/(-SH+-S-S-) ratios were calculated from these values. The obtained data were used to compare Alzheimer's disease patients with healthy individuals. RESULTS: The average total thiol and native thiol levels of patient with Alzheimer's disease in the study were found to be significantly lower than those levels of healthy individuals. In addition, in the patient group, the -S-S-x100/-S-S+-SH ratio was found to be significantly higher, whereas the -SHx100/-S-S+-SH ratio was found to be significantly lower compared with healthy individuals. Total thiol and native thiol levels, dynamic disulphide bond amount, and -S-S-x100/-SH, -S-S-x100/-S-S+-SH, and -SHx100/-S-S+-SH ratios were not found to be correlated with mini mental state examination score or duration of disease. CONCLUSION: Recent studies have shown that oxidative stress is the one of the molecular changes underlying the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. In this study, we have investigated the dynamic thiol-disulphide homeostasis in patients with Alzheimer's disease, using a novel method.
27801864	Tocotrienol Affects Oxidative Stress, Cholesterol Homeostasis and the Amyloidogenic Pathway in Neuroblastoma Cells: Consequences for Alzheimer's Disease.	One of the characteristics of Alzheimer s disease (AD) is an increased amyloid load and an enhanced level of reactive oxidative species (ROS). Vitamin E has known beneficial neuroprotective effects, and previously, some studies suggested that vitamin E is associated with a reduced risk of AD due to its antioxidative properties. However, epidemiological studies and nutritional approaches of vitamin E treatment are controversial. Here, we investigate the effect of alpha-tocotrienol, which belongs to the group of vitamin E, on AD-relevant processes in neuronal cell lines. In line with the literature, alpha-tocotrienol reduced the ROS level in SH-SY5Y cells. In the presence of tocotrienols, cholesterol and cholesterol esters, which have been shown to be risk factors in AD, were decreased. Besides the unambiguous positive effects of tocotrienol, amyloid-beta (Abeta) levels were increased accompanied by an increase in the activity of enzymes responsible for Abeta production. Proteins and gene expression of the secretases and their components remained unchanged, whereas tocotrienol accelerates enzyme activity in cell-free assays. Besides enhanced Abeta production, tocotrienols inhibited Abeta degradation in neuro 2a (N2a)-cells. Our results might help to understand the controversial findings of vitamin E studies and demonstrate that besides the known positive neuroprotective properties, tocotrienols also have negative characteristics with respect to AD.
27799765	Getting into the brain: liposome-based strategies for effective drug delivery across the blood-brain barrier.	This review summarizes articles that have been reported in literature on liposome-based strategies for effective drug delivery across the blood-brain barrier. Due to their unique physicochemical characteristics, liposomes have been widely investigated for their application in drug delivery and in vivo bioimaging for the treatment and/or diagnosis of neurological diseases, such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, stroke, and glioma. Several strategies have been used to deliver drug and/or imaging agents to the brain. Covalent ligation of such macromolecules as peptides, antibodies, and RNA aptamers is an effective method for receptor-targeting liposomes, which allows their blood-brain barrier penetration and/or the delivery of their therapeutic molecule specifically to the disease site. Additionally, methods have been employed for the development of liposomes that can respond to external stimuli. It can be concluded that the development of liposomes for brain delivery is still in its infancy, although these systems have the potential to revolutionize the ways in which medicine is administered.
27799753	Mutations, associated with early-onset Alzheimer's disease, discovered in Asian countries.	Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common form of senile dementia, is a genetically complex disorder. In most Asian countries, the population and the number of AD patients are growing rapidly, and the genetics of AD has been extensively studied, except in Japan. However, recent studies have been started to investigate the genes and mutations associated with AD in Korea, the People's Republic of China, and Malaysia. This review describes all of the known mutations in three early-onset AD (EOAD) causative genes (APP, PSEN1, and PSEN2) that were discovered in Asian countries. Most of the EOAD-associated mutations have been detected in PSEN1, and several novel PSEN1 mutations were recently identified in patients from various parts of the world, including Asia. Until 2014, no PSEN2 mutations were found in Asian patients; however, emerging studies from Korea and the People's Republic of China discovered probably pathogenic PSEN2 mutations. Since several novel mutations were discovered in these three genes, we also discuss the predictions on their pathogenic nature. This review briefly summarizes genome-wide association studies of late-onset AD and the genes that might be associated with AD in Asian countries. Standard sequencing is a widely used method, but it has limitations in terms of time, cost, and efficacy. Next-generation sequencing strategies could facilitate genetic analysis and association studies. Genetic testing is important for the accurate diagnosis and for understanding disease-associated pathways and might also improve disease therapy and prevention.
27799057	Integrative network analysis of nineteen brain regions identifies molecular signatures and networks underlying selective regional vulnerability to Alzheimer's disease.	BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia, characterized by progressive cognitive impairment and neurodegeneration. However, despite extensive clinical and genomic studies, the molecular basis of AD development and progression remains elusive. METHODS: To elucidate molecular systems associated with AD, we developed a large scale gene expression dataset from 1053 postmortem brain samples across 19 cortical regions of 125 individuals with a severity spectrum of dementia and neuropathology of AD. We excluded brain specimens that evidenced neuropathology other than that characteristic of AD. For the first time, we performed a pan-cortical brain region genomic analysis, characterizing the gene expression changes associated with a measure of dementia severity and multiple measures of the severity of neuropathological lesions associated with AD (neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles) and constructing region-specific co-expression networks. We rank-ordered 44,692 gene probesets, 1558 co-expressed gene modules and 19 brain regions based upon their association with the disease traits. RESULTS: The neurobiological pathways identified through these analyses included actin cytoskeleton, axon guidance, and nervous system development. Using public human brain single-cell RNA-sequencing data, we computed brain cell type-specific marker genes for human and determined that many of the abnormally expressed gene signatures and network modules were specific to oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, and neurons. Analysis based on disease severity suggested that: many of the gene expression changes, including those of oligodendrocytes, occurred early in the progression of disease, making them potential translational/treatment development targets and unlikely to be mere bystander result of degeneration; several modules were closely linked to cognitive compromise with lesser association with traditional measures of neuropathology. The brain regional analyses identified temporal lobe gyri as sites associated with the greatest and earliest gene expression abnormalities. CONCLUSIONS: This transcriptomic network analysis of 19 brain regions provides a comprehensive assessment of the critical molecular pathways associated with AD pathology and offers new insights into molecular mechanisms underlying selective regional vulnerability to AD at different stages of the progression of cognitive compromise and development of the canonical neuropathological lesions of AD.
27798977	A class of carbonic anhydrase I - selective activators.	A series of ureido and bis-ureido derivatives were prepared by reacting histamine with alkyl/aryl-isocyanates or di-isocyanates. The obtained derivatives were assayed as activators of the enzyme carbonic anhydrase (CA, EC 4.2.1.1), due to the fact that histamine itself has this biological activity. Although inhibition of CAs has pharmacological applications in the field of antiglaucoma, anticonvulsant, anticancer, and anti-infective agents, activation of these enzymes is not yet properly exploited pharmacologically for cognitive enhancement or Alzheimer's disease treatment, conditions in which a diminished CA activity was reported. The ureido/bis-ureido histamine derivatives investigated here showed activating effects only against the cytosolic human (h) isoform hCA I, having no effect on the widespread, physiologically dominant isoform hCA II. This is the first report in which CA I-selective activators were identified. Such compounds may constitute interesting tools for better understanding the physiological/pharmacological effects connected to activation of this widespread CA isoform, whose physiological function is not fully understood.
27092587	Production of precursors for anti-Alzheimer drugs: Asymmetric bioreduction in a packed-bed bioreactor using immobilized D. carota cells.	(S)-1-Phenylethanol derivatives, which are the precursors of many pharmacological products, have also been used as anti-Alzheimer drugs. Bioreduction experiments were performed in a batch and packed-bed bioreactor. Then, the kinetics constants were determined by examining the reaction kinetics in the batch system with free and immobilized carrot cells. Also, the effective diffusion coefficient (De) of acetophenone in calcium alginate-immobilized carrot cells was investigated. Kinetics constants for free cells, which are intrinsic values, are reaction rate Vmax = 0.052 mmol L-1 min-1, and constants of the Michaelis-Menten KM = 2.31 mmol L-1. Kinetics constants for immobilized cells, which are considered apparent values, are Vmax, app = 0.0407 mmol L-1 min-1, KM, app = 3.0472 mmol L-1 for 2 mm bead diameter, and Vmax, app = 0.0453 mmol L-1 min-1, KM, app = 4.9383 mmol L-1 for 3 mm bead diameter. Average value of effective diffusion coefficient of acetophenone in immobilized beads was determined as 1.97 x 10-6 cm2 s-1. Using immobilized carrot cells in an up-flow packed-bed reactor, continuous production of (S)-1-phenylethanol through asymmetric bioreduction of acetophenone was performed. The effects of the residence time and concentrations of substrate were investigated at pH 7.6 and 33 degrees C. Enantiomerically pure (S)-1-phenylethanol (ee > 99%) was produced with 75% conversion at 4-hr residence time.
27792188	The Impact of Vitamin E and Other Fat-Soluble Vitamins on Alzheimer s Disease.	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia in the elderly population, currently affecting 46 million people worldwide. Histopathologically, the disease is characterized by the occurrence of extracellular amyloid plaques composed of aggregated amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles containing the microtubule-associated protein tau. Abeta peptides are derived from the sequential processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by enzymes called secretases, which are strongly influenced by the lipid environment. Several vitamins have been reported to be reduced in the plasma/serum of AD-affected individuals indicating they have an impact on AD pathogenesis. In this review we focus on vitamin E and the other lipophilic vitamins A, D, and K, and summarize the current knowledge about their status in AD patients, their impact on cognitive functions and AD risk, as well as their influence on the molecular mechanisms of AD. The vitamins might affect the generation and clearance of Abeta both by direct effects and indirectly by altering the cellular lipid homeostasis. Additionally, vitamins A, D, E, and K are reported to influence further mechanisms discussed to be involved in AD pathogenesis, e.g., Abeta-aggregation, Abeta-induced neurotoxicity, oxidative stress, and inflammatory processes, as summarized in this article.
27639297	Ester to amide substitution improves selectivity, efficacy and kinetic behavior of a benzodiazepine positive modulator of GABAA receptors containing the alpha5 subunit.	We have synthesized and characterized MP-III-022 ((R)-8-ethynyl-6-(2-fluorophenyl)-N,4-dimethyl-4H-benzo[f]imidazo[1,5-a][1,4]diaz epine-3-carboxamide) in vitro and in vivo as a binding- and efficacy-selective positive allosteric modulator of GABAA receptors containing the alpha5 subunit (alpha5GABAARs). By approximation of the electrophysiological responses which the estimated free rat brain concentrations can induce, we demonstrated that convenient systemic administration of MP-III-022 in the dose range 1-10mg/kg may result in a selective potentiation, over a wide range from mild to moderate to strong, of alpha5betagamma2 GABAA receptors. For eliciting a comparable range of potentiation, the widely studied parent ligand SH-053-2'F-R-CH3 containing an ester moiety needs to be administered over a much wider dose range (10-200mg/kg), but at the price of activating non-alpha5 GABAARs as well as the desired alpha5GABAARs at the highest dose. At the dose of 10mg/kg, which elicits a strong positive modulation of alpha5GABAARs, MP-III-022 caused mild, but significant muscle relaxation, while at doses 1-10mg/kg was devoid of ataxia, sedation or an influence on the anxiety level, characteristic for non-selective benzodiazepines. As an amide compound with improved stability and kinetic properties, MP-III-022 may represent an optimized tool to study the influence of alpha5GABAARs on the neuronal pathways related to CNS disorders such as schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, Down syndrome or autism.
27594339	Membrane raft domains and remodeling in aging brain.	Lipids are the fundamental structural components of biological membranes. For a long time considered as simple barriers segregating aqueous compartments, membranes are now viewed as dynamic interfaces providing a molecular environment favorable to the activity of membrane-associated proteins. Interestingly, variations in membrane lipid composition, whether quantitative or qualitative, play a crucial role in regulation of membrane protein functionalities. Indeed, a variety of alterations in brain lipid composition have been associated with the processes of normal and pathological aging. Although not establishing a direct cause-and-effect relationship between these complex modifications in cerebral membranes and the process of cognitive decline, evidence shows that alterations in membrane lipid composition affect important physicochemical properties notably impacting the lateral organization of membranes, and thus microdomains. It has been suggested that preservation of microdomain functionality may represent an effective strategy for preventing or decelerating neuronal dysfunction and cerebral vulnerability, processes that are both aggravated by aging. The working hypothesis developed in this review proposes that preservation of membrane organization, for example, through nutritional supplementation of docosahexaenoic acid, could prevent disturbances in and preserve effective cerebral function.
27521767	Crosstalk pathway inference using topological information and biclustering of gene expression data.	Detection of crosstalks among pathways is a challenging task, which requires the identification of different types of interactions associated with cellular processes. A common strategy used in bioinformatics consists in extrapolating pathway associations from the pairwise analysis of some genes related to them, using gene expression data and topological information. PET, the method proposed in this paper, goes a step further by incorporating a strategy for the detection of correlation across conditions between differentially expressed genes based on biclustering analysis. In order to evaluate the performance of this new approach, a comparison with two recently published algorithms was carried out. The methods were contrasted in the inference of pathway associations from Alzheimer disease datasets, where the new proposal presents a higher crosstalk discoveries' rate. Finally, the analysis of the biological relevance of the pathway associations inferred by PET has shown the soundness of the extracted knowledge.
27473185	Dietary arachidonic acid as a risk factor for age-associated neurodegenerative diseases: Potential mechanisms.	Alzheimer's disease and associated diseases constitute a major public health concern worldwide. Nutrition-based, preventive strategies could possibly be effective in delaying the occurrence of these diseases and lower their prevalence. Arachidonic acid is the second major polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) and several studies support its involvement in Alzheimer's disease. The objective of this review is to examine how dietary arachidonic acid contributes to Alzheimer's disease mechanisms and therefore to its prevention. First, we explore the sources of neuronal arachidonic acid that could potentially originate from either the conversion of linoleic acid, or from dietary sources and transfer across the blood-brain-barrier. In a second part, a brief overview of the role of the two main agents of Alzheimer's disease, tau protein and Abeta peptide is given, followed by the examination of the relationship between arachidonic acid and the disease. Third, the putative mechanisms by which arachidonic acid could influence Alzheimer's disease occurrence and evolution are presented. The conclusion is devoted to what remains to be determined before integrating arachidonic acid in the design of preventive strategies against Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative diseases.
27184464	SNCA Gene Polymorphism may Contribute to an Increased Risk of Alzheimer's Disease.	BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study is to elucidate the association between alpha-synuclein (SNCA) polymorphisms and the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHODS: The PCR-RFLP was applied to detect SNCA gene rs6532190, rs3775430, and rs10516846 polymorphisms in 98 AD patients and 105 healthy elderly. RESULTS: The GG frequency of rs10516846 was evidently increased in AD group than control group (P < 0.05). There was a significant difference in SNCA level between the AD and control groups (P < 0.01). In the AD group, the SNCA level in cerebrospinal fluid of GG (rs10516846) carriers was increased as compared with AA carriers (P < 0.05). The GG (rs10516846) frequency of the early-onset AD group is significantly higher than that of the late-onset AD group (P < 0.05). The frequency of rs3775430 GG was lower in the early-onset group than that in the late-onset group (0% vs. 16.7%). The SNCA level in cerebrospinal fluid of GG (rs10516846) carriers in the early-onset AD group is higher than that of AA carriers (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: SNCA gene polymorphism may be associated with an increased risk of AD and GG genotype of rs10516846 and elevated SNCA level in CSF may increase the risk of early-onset AD.
27040325	Development of Unlabeled Probe Based High-Resolution Melting Analysis for Detection of Filaggrin Gene Mutation c.3321delA.	BACKGROUND: Filaggrin gene (FLG) plays an important role in skin barrier function, and loss-of-function mutations of FLG have been shown to be a predisposing factor for atopic dermatitis (AD). The c.3321delA mutation is the most common FLG mutation in Chinese population. We aim to develop a rapid, cost-efficiency, and reliable closed-tube method that has not been described for the detection of c.3321delA mutation. METHODS: Recombinant wild-type and mutant plasmids of c.3321delA mutation were constructed, heterozygous mutant plasmids were prepared by mixing the mutant plasmids and wild-type plasmids at 1:1 ratio. High-resolution melting analysis (HRMA) coupled with an unlabeled DNA probe was employed to identify the shift in melting temperature of the probe-template complex, which reflects the presence of c.3321delA mutation. RESULTS: Unlabeled probe based HRMA was able to distinguish all three genotypes (wild-type, heterozygote, and mutant) of c.3321delA mutation. Then, we applied this method to genotype 1,317 clinical samples. Genotyping results obtained from unlabeled probe HRMA were 100% concordant with the results from direct sequencing. CONCLUSION: We developed a fast and high-throughput method to detect the c.3321delA mutation.
25767142	Personal message cards: An evaluation of an alternative method of delivering simulated presence therapy.	Simulated presence therapy is a technique which utilises a familiar recorded voice to calm and reassure people with dementia who are agitated or anxious. Although simulated presence therapy has shown potential benefits in small-scale studies, practical limitations in making and playing the recordings have restricted its use. An alternative method of delivering a message from an attachment figure is through a personal message card. This was one of seven products used within the Bath Memory Technology Library which was made available free of charge to people affected by dementia and their carers. This paper provides an evaluation of the personal message cards. Although feedback was received on only 10 of the 24 cards that were distributed, for nine people there was evidence that the cards met the goals that had been set either fully or in part, and that people affected by even quite severe levels of dementia could benefit from them.
25697501	Making sense of dementia: Exploring the use of the Markers of Assimilation of Problematic Experiences in Dementia scale to understand how couples process a diagnosis of dementia.	This qualitative study aimed to see whether the Markers of Assimilation of Problematic Experiences in Dementia (MAPED) scale could be applied to couples. It aimed to explore the interactions between couples and how this affected the levels of assimilation. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with four heterosexual couples. The results suggested that MAPED can be usefully applied to couples. It highlighted the oscillating process which couples undergo as they process a dementia diagnosis. This supports the notion that making sense of a dementia diagnosis is not static, but a fluctuating and ever changing process. The strategies couples employed either facilitated or prevented the expression and integration of the Problematic Voice. The study highlights the importance of supporting couples together during a dementia diagnosis.
25613981	Primary care-led dementia diagnosis services in South Gloucestershire: Themes from people and families living with dementia and health care professionals.	BACKGROUND: Primary care-led dementia services are an increasingly common form of service delivery; however, little is known about how these services are understood by their main stakeholders: the patients, family members and health care professionals. A primary care-led dementia service was piloted in the South Gloucestershire area during 2012, in which general practitioners (GPs) led the process of assessment and establishing a diagnosis. Of the 26 surgeries in the area, 11 initially agreed to participate in the pilot, with 12 more joining the project by the end of December 2012. AIM: The aim of this study was to provide a qualitative analysis of the experiences of health care professionals, patients and their families, of the new process of assessment, diagnosis and treatment of dementia within a primary care service. METHODS: Four patients, three care-givers and eight health care professionals were interviewed by peer researchers - all of whom were current care-givers. Interviews were transcribed and analysed using thematic analysis following Braun and Clarke's model. Data were also gathered about the number of referrals and what happened to these referrals. RESULTS: Themes gathered into four main areas: 'the journey', 'what next?', 'the benefits and limits of primary care' and 'are GPs getting it right'? CONCLUSIONS: The analysis provided a perspective on the experiences of patients, family members and health care professionals involved in the relocation of part of the memory service, from secondary care (memory clinics) to primary care, being piloted in South Gloucestershire. This identified both practical issues to be improved upon as well as possible barriers.
25538123	Negotiating access to a diagnosis of dementia: Implications for policies in health and social care.	The 'Pathways to Diagnosis' study captured the experience of the prediagnosis period of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias through indepth interviews with 29 persons with dementia and 34 of their family caregivers across four sites: anglophones in Calgary, francophones in Ottawa, Chinese-Canadians in Greater Vancouver and Indo-Canadians in Toronto. In this cross-site analysis, we use the 'Candidacy' framework to comprehensively explore the challenges to securing a diagnosis of dementia in Canada and to develop relevant health and social policy. Candidacy views eligibility for appropriate medical care as a process of joint negotiation between individuals and health services, which can be understood relative to seven dimensions: identification of need, navigation, appearances at services, adjudication by providers, acceptance of/resistance to offers, permeability of services and local conditions. Interviewees experienced challenges relative to each of the seven dimensions and these varied in form and emphasis across the four ethno-linguistic groups.
25476006	How does a woman with Alzheimer's disease make sense of becoming cared for?	This case study explores the meaning one woman with Alzheimer's disease (AD) gives to receiving assistance with instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs) from her spouse. Improving the care of people living with AD is widely accepted as an important outcome in dementia services. Understanding how it feels for the person with AD to receive that care is essential to enhance their quality of life. Experiences identified using interpretative phenomenological analysis focus on a connection to past self and maintaining identity whilst also accepting change. The experience of 'Sameness and Change' identifies her feelings of discontinuity whilst 'Goodness' depicts her continued emotional expression of care presented in an attempt to remain someone of value within her family. These findings offer new insight and understanding to assist a woman's transition from carer to becoming cared for.
25425445	'Singing for the Brain': A qualitative study exploring the health and well-being benefits of singing for people with dementia and their carers.	Dementia has detrimental effects on cognitive, psychological and behavioural functioning, as well as significant impact on those who provide care. There is a need to find suitable psychosocial interventions to help manage the condition, enhance well-being, and to provide support for caregivers. This study explored the impact of Singing for the Brain, an intervention based on group singing activities developed by The Alzheimer's Society for people with dementia and their carers. This qualitative study used semi-structured interviews with people with dementia and their carers. Ten interviews involving 20 participants were analysed thematically. Social inclusiveness and improvements in relationships, memory and mood were found to be especially important to participants. As well as enjoying the sessions, participants found that attending Singing for the Brain helped in accepting and coping with dementia.
27785947	Increased non-protein bound iron in Down syndrome: contribution to lipid peroxidation and cognitive decline.	Down syndrome (DS, trisomy 21) is the leading cause of chromosomal-related intellectual disability. At an early age, adults with DS develop with the neuropathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease, associated with a chronic oxidative stress. To investigate if non-protein bound iron (NPBI) can contribute to building up a pro-oxidative microenvironment, we evaluated NPBI in both plasma and erythrocytes from DS and age-matched controls, together with in vivo markers of lipid peroxidation (F2-isoprostanes, F2-dihomo-isoprostanes, F4-neuroprostanes) and in vitro reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation in erythrocytes. The serum iron panel and uric acid were also measured. Second, we explored possible correlation between NPBI, lipid peroxidation and cognitive performance. Here, we report NPBI increase in DS, which correlates with increased serum ferritin and uric acid. High levels of lipid peroxidation markers and intraerythrocyte ROS formations were also reported. Furthermore, the scores of Raven's Colored Progressive Matrices (RCPM) test, performed as a measure of current cognitive function, are inversely related to NPBI, serum uric acid, and ferritin. Likewise, ROS production, F2-isoprostanes, and F4-neuroprostanes were also inversely related to cognitive performance, whereas serum transferrin positively correlated to RCPM scores. Our data reveal that increased availability of free redox-active iron, associated with enhanced lipid peroxidation, may be involved in neurodegeneration and cognitive decline in DS. In this respect, we propose chelation therapy as a potential preventive/therapeutic tool in DS.
27785946	2,2,2-Trifluoroethyl-thiadiazines: a patent evaluation of WO2016023927.	The Alzheimer's disease (AD) is acknowledged as the most common type of dementia in aging adults. It is characterized by the formation of intracellular neurofibrillary tangles and extracellular amyloid plaques. The latter insoluble deposits mainly consist of beta-amyloid peptides (Abeta), which are the derivatives of the amyloid precursor protein (APP). The formation of neurotoxic Abeta-peptides involves the cleavage of APP with beta-secretase enzyme (beta-site APP cleaving enzyme 1, BACE1) so the potential of BACE1 inhibitors as therapeutic agents for AD is now drawing much attention. The patent application WO2016023927 reports the preparation of new 1,2,4-thiadiazine inhibitors of BACE1 activity and their use as therapeutically active substances. Some of the new compounds are claimed to be good inhibitors with the IC50 values in the 0.000292-0.134165 muM range. Several pharmaceutical preparations based on these compounds are proposed for possible treatment and prevention of AD. Expert opinion: In light of the novelty from the chemical point of view and improved biological activity, the reported 2,2,2-trifluoroethylthiadiazines could be considered as promising BACE1 inhibitors. However, the available data are insufficient to make a recommendation if these compounds can be considered as drug candidates. Further studies with a larger number of compounds are required. The compounds described in the patent have to be characterized more thoroughly from the chemical viewpoint (e.g., by means of IR, 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy, X-ray crystallography), especially as regards stereochemical details.
27785931	Role of Glutathione-S-transferases in neurological problems.	INTRODUCTION: Role of Glutathione-S-transferases (GSTs) has been well explored in the cellular detoxification process, regulation of redox homeostasis and S-glutothionylation of target proteins like JNK, ASK1 etc. However, altered levels or functions of this enzyme or their subtypes have emerged in the development of several pathologies diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, cancer and related conditions. Oxidative stress is one of the possible pathological events that contributes significantly to activation of degenerating cascades inside neuronal cells. The central nervous system is highly sensitive to oxidative stress because of low levels or capacities of antioxidant enzymes. The brain is highly metabolic in nature making it susceptible to oxidative stress. Areas covered: The present review provides a comprehensive overview of the multiple connections of GSTs within diverse neurological diseases including cancer. Furthermore, the authors have made significant efforts to discuss the regulation of different GST isoforms that have been associated with various pathological processes such as glioblastoma, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, stroke and epilepsy. Expert opinion: Though GSTs have been one of the key areas of scientific research over the last few decades, much remains to be elucidated about their physiological functions as well as pathological involvement of GSTs and their polymorphic variants.
27666598	Calcium-Channel Blockers and Dementia Risk in Older Adults- National Health Insurance Service - Senior Cohort (2002-2013).	BACKGROUND: Some disagreements surround the effects of calcium-channel blockers (CCBs) on the risk of dementia. The purpose of this study was to investigate the protective effects of CCBs on dementia among elderly hypertensive Koreans.Methods and Results:We conducted a large population-based cohort study using the senior cohort database of the Korean National Health Insurance Service (2002-2013). Subjects were elderly hypertensive Koreans older than 60 years of age. A total of 18,423 patients (CCB user group: 13,692 patients; non-CCB antihypertensive user group: 4,731 patients) were statistically analyzed using the Cox proportional hazard regression model to estimate the adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) and confidence intervals (CIs) of dementia associated with CCB use. There were 2,881 cases (21.0%) of dementia in the CCB user group and 1,124 cases (23.8%) in the non-user group. CCB use significantly reduced the risk of total dementia (aHR 0.81, 95% CI 0.75-0.87, P<0.0001), Alzheimer's dementia (aHR 0.80, 95% CI 0.72-0.88, P<0.0001), and vascular dementia (aHR 0.81, 95% CI 0.70-0.94, P=0.0067). CONCLUSIONS: CCB use had a protective effect on the risk of dementia among elderly hypertensive Koreans. (Circ J 2016; 80: 2336-2342).
27726955	Cognitive Outcomes of Cardiovascular Surgical Procedures in the Old: An Important but Neglected Area.	Older individuals can now undergo invasive cardiovascular procedures without serious concern about mortality, and the numbers and proportions of the over 65s and 85s doing so in Australia has been increasing over the last 20 years. There is overwhelming evidence linking cardiovascular conditions to late-life (65 years and over) cognitive impairment and dementia including Alzheimer's Disease, primarily due to impaired cerebrovascularisation and cascading neuropathological processes. Somewhat paradoxically, these cardiovascular interventions, carried out with the primary aim of revascularisation, are not usually associated with short- or long-term improvements in cognitive function in older adults. We discuss factors associated with cognitive outcomes post-cardiovascular surgeries in patients over 65 years of age. There are many opportunities for future research: we know almost nothing about cognitive outcomes following invasive cardiac procedures in the oldest old (85 years and over) nor how to predict the cognitive/delirium outcome using pre-surgical data, and lastly, intervention opportunities exist both pre and postoperatively that have not been tested. As our population ages with increased cardiovascular burden and rates of cardiovascular interventions and surgeries, it is critical that we understand the cognitive consequences of these procedures, who is at greatest risk, and ways to optimise cognition.
27779711	Rapamycin inhibits lipopolysaccharide-induced neuroinflammation in vitro and in vivo.	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common type of progressive neurodegenerative disorder, and is responsible for the most common form of dementia in the elderly. Inflammation occurs in the brains of patients with AD, and is critical for disease progression. In the present study, the effects of rapamycin (RAPA) on neuroinflammation lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced were investigated. SHSY5Y human neuroblastoma cells were treated with 20 microg/ml LPS and 0.1, 1 or 10 nmol/l RAPA, and were analyzed at various time points (6, 12 and 24 h). The mRNA expression levels of interleukin (IL) 1beta, IL6 and hypoxiainducible factor 1alpha (HIF1alpha) were determined using reverse transcriptionquantitative polymerase chain reaction. The protein expression levels of phosphorylated (p)S6, pnuclear factor kappaB (NFkappaB), pinhibitor of NFkappaB kinase subunit beta (IKKbeta) and ptau protein were measured by western blot analysis. pIKKbeta, pNFkappaB, pS6 and ptau were significantly decreased at 6, 12 and 24 h when cells were treated with >/=0.1 nmol/ml RAPA. In addition, female Sprague Dawley rats were intracranially injected with a single dose of 100 microg/kg LPS in the absence or presence of 1 mg/kg RAPA pretreatment. Brain tissues were subjected to immunohistochemical analysis 624 h later, which revealed that the expression levels of HIF1alpha and pS6 in rat cerebral cortex were increased following LPS injection; however, this increase was abrogated by RAPA treatment. RAPA may therefore be considered a potential therapeutic agent for the early or emergency treatment of neuroinflammation.
27776476	Targeting NO/cGMP Signaling in the CNS for Neurodegeneration and Alzheimer's Disease.	cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) plays a central role in various aspects of central nervous system (CNS) function, ranging from the developmental stages to neuronal plasticity and survival in adult brain. Activation of CREB plays a crucial role in learning and memory and is at the convergence of multiple intracellular signaling cascades including CAMKII and MAPK. This review focuses on the important functions of nitric oxide (NO) in activating CREB via the NO receptor, soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC), and production of the second messenger, cGMP. The involvement of the NO/cGMP signaling pathway in synaptic plasticity suggests several avenues for therapeutic intervention, and targeting early synaptic degeneration could be an attractive approach for the development of novel disease-modifying approaches to treat cognition and memory dysfunction in neurodegenerative diseases.
27776438	Independent Component Analysis-Support Vector Machine-Based Computer-Aided Diagnosis System for Alzheimer's with Visual Support.	Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems constitute a powerful tool for early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), but limitations on interpretability and performance exist. In this work, a fully automatic CAD system based on supervised learning methods is proposed to be applied on segmented brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) from Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative (ADNI) participants for automatic classification. The proposed CAD system possesses two relevant characteristics: optimal performance and visual support for decision making. The CAD is built in two stages: a first feature extraction based on independent component analysis (ICA) on class mean images and, secondly, a support vector machine (SVM) training and classification. The obtained features for classification offer a full graphical representation of the images, giving an understandable logic in the CAD output, that can increase confidence in the CAD support. The proposed method yields classification results up to 89% of accuracy (with 92% of sensitivity and 86% of specificity) for normal controls (NC) and AD patients, 79% of accuracy (with 82% of sensitivity and 76% of specificity) for NC and mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 85% of accuracy (with 85% of sensitivity and 86% of specificity) for MCI and AD patients.
27748870	Identification of therapeutic targets for Alzheimer's disease via differentially expressed gene and weighted gene co-expression network analyses.	In order to investigate the pathogenic targets and associated biological process of Alzheimer's disease in the present study, mRNA expression profiles (GSE28146) and microRNA (miRNA) expression profiles (GSE16759) were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. In GSE28146, eight control samples, and Alzheimer's disease samples comprising seven incipient, eight moderate, seven severe Alzheimer's disease samples, were included. The Affy package in R was used for background correction and normalization of the raw microarray data. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and differentially expressed miRNAs were identified using the Limma package. In addition, mRNAs were clustered using weighted gene correlation network analysis, and modules found to be significantly associated with the stages of Alzheimer's disease were screened out. The Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery was used to perform Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analyses. The target genes of the differentially expressed miRNAs were identified using the miRWalk database. Compared with the control samples, 175,59 genes and 90 DEGs were identified in the incipient, moderate and severe Alzheimer's disease samples, respectively. A module, which contained 1,592 genes was found to be closely associated with the stage of Alzheimer's disease and biological processes. In addition, pathways associated with Alzheimer's disease and other neurological diseases were found to be enriched in those genes. A total of 139 overlapped genes were identified between those genes and the DEGs in the three groups. From the miRNA expression profiles, 189 miRNAs were found differentially expressed in the samples from patients with Alzheimer's disease and 1,647 target genes were obtained. In addition, five overlapped genes were identified between those 1,647 target genes and the 139 genes, and these genes may be important pathogenic targets for Alzheimer's disease. Through bioinformatics analysis, potential therapeutic targets and associated biological processes were identified, which may assist in understanding and treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
27748814	Neurotoxin betaNmethylaminoLalanine induces endoplasmic reticulum stressmediated neuronal apoptosis.	beta-N-methylamino-L-alanine (BMAA) is a neurotoxin that is closely associated with the incidence of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. In cultured neuronal cells, BMAA notably induces the upregulation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) chaperons and activates the unfolded protein response (UPR) receptor pathways of protein kinase RNAlike endoplasmic reticulum kinase, inositolrequiring kinase 1 and transcription factor 6. The ER stressspecific protein CCAAT/enhancerbinding protein homologous protein (CHOP) affords proapoptotic responses that cause mitochondrial damage and caspase activation. BMAA also induces the activation of mitogenactivated protein kinase member cJUN Nterminal kinase, p38 and extracellular signalregulated kinase, which have been suggested to be involved in the signaling pathway of UPRmediated apoptosis. Inhibition of ER stress using ER stress antagonist, salubrinal, attenuated the expression of CHOP and alleviated neuronal death. Overexpression of heat shock protein 70 suppressed the activation of UPR receptors and UPRevoked apoptotic signaling. The present findings demonstrated that ER stress induced by BMAA is the important mediator of neuronal injury and apoptotic death, and suggests development in novel therapeutic strategies for treatment.
27665864	Apolipoprotein E genotyping using PCR-GoldMag lateral flow assay and its clinical applications.	A polymerase chain reaction-gold magnetic nanoparticles lateral flow assay (PCR-GoldMag LFA) has been developed via integrating multiplex amplification refractory mutation system PCR (multiARMSPCR) with GoldMagbased LFA for the visual detection of singlenucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). This assay was applied to genotype Apolipoprotein E (ApoE). ApoE genotyping is important due to the predictive value for the development of coronary artery disease and Alzheimer's disease. The method requires two steps: i) Simultaneous amplifications of the two polymorphic codons (ApoE 158 and 112), performed in separated reactions using multiARMSPCR; and ii) detection of the wildtype and mutant PCR products via dual immunoreactions, which can be performed in ~5 min. Within two LFAs, antidigoxin antibodyconjugated GoldMag probes bind digoxinlabeled wildtype PCR products, and antifluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) antibody-conjugated GoldMag probes bind FITClabeled mutant PCR products. All PCR products are biotin labeled and are detected by streptavidin-coated regions on the LFA strip, resulting in a red color. The current approach is capable of detecting the SNPs of ApoE in ~1.5 h, with a broad detection range from 101,000 ng of genomic DNA. Thus, the present protocol may facilitate simple, fast and costeffective screening for important SNPs, as demonstrated by the evaluation of the prevalence of ApoE variants in a Han Chinese cohort.
27775603	Zinc Finger and X-Linked Factor (ZFX) Binds to Human SET Transcript 2 Promoter and Transactivates SET Expression.	SET (SE Translocation) protein carries out multiple functions including those for protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) inhibition, histone modification, DNA repair, and gene regulation. SET overexpression has been detected in brain neurons of patients suffering Alzheimer's disease, follicle theca cells of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) patients, and ovarian cancer cells, indicating that SET may play a pathological role for these disorders. SET transcript 2, produced by a specific promoter, represents a major transcript variant in different cell types. In this study, we characterized the transcriptional activation of human SET transcript 2 promoter in HeLa cells. Promoter deletion experiments and co-transfection assays indicated that ZFX, the Zinc finger and X-linked transcription factor, was able to transactivate the SET promoter. A proximal promoter region containing four ZFX-binding sites was found to be critical for the ZFX-mediated transactivation. Mutagenesis study indicated that the ZFX-binding site located the closest to the transcription start site accounted for most of the ZFX-mediated transactivity. Manipulation of ZFX levels by overexpression or siRNA knockdown confirmed the significance and specificity of the ZFX-mediated SET promoter activation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation results verified the binding of ZFX to its cognate sites in the SET promoter. These findings have led to identification of ZFX as an upstream factor regulating SET gene expression. More studies are required to define the in vivo significance of this mechanism, and specifically, its implication for several benign and malignant diseases related to SET dysregulation.
27773727	Integrated late onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) susceptibility genes: Cholesterol metabolism and trafficking perspectives.	Late onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) is the most common type of dementia and is characterized by decreased amyloid-beta (Abeta) clearance from the brain. Cholesterol regulates the production and clearance of Abeta. Genome-wide association study (GWAS) suggests that at least 20 genes are associated with LOAD. The genes APOE, CLU, SORL1, PICALM, and BIN1 have a relatively high LOAD susceptibility. Additional experimental and bioinformatic approaches to integrate data from genetics, epigenetics, and molecular networks may further increase our understanding of LOAD in relation to cholesterol metabolism and trafficking.
27553189	Cerebral vasomotor reactivity in neurodegenerative diseases.	Small-caliber cerebral vessels change their diameters in response to alterations of key metabolite concentrations such as carbon dioxide or oxygen. This phenomenon, termed the cerebral vasomotor reactivity (CVMR), is the basis for blood flow regulation in the brain in accordance with its metabolic status. Typically, CVMR is determined as the amount of change in cerebral blood flow in response to a vasodilating stimulus, which can be measured by various neuroimaging methods or by transcranial Doppler. It has been shown that CVMR is impaired in cerebrovascular diseases, but there is also evidence of a similar dysfunction in neurodegenerative disorders. Here, we review studies that have investigated CVMR in the common neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and multiple sclerosis. Moreover, we discuss potential neurodegenerative mechanisms responsible for the impairment of CVMR.
27546893	The relationship between serum paraoxonase levels and carotid atherosclerotic plaque formation in Alzheimer's patients.	Low paraoxonase 1 (PON1) activity and carotid atherosclerosis have been suggested to be important risk factors for dementia. However, the studies to date could not fully clarify the relationship between PON1, carotid atherosclerosis and dementia. The present study aimed to measure carotid atherosclerosis and PON1 activity in Alzheimer's Disease and to evaluate the relationship between them. The study included 25 Alzheimer's patients and 25 control subjects, for a total of 50 individuals. The study measured the serum PON1 activity and other biochemical parameters and carotid atherosclerotic plaque values of the participants. The mean paraoxonase activity (31.06+/-2.31U/L) was significantly lower in the Alzheimer's group compared to the control group (59.05+/-7.05U/L) (P<0.001). Nonetheless, the carotid plaque values were significantly higher in the patient group (3.02+/-0.52mm) compared to the control group (1.84+/-0.45mm) (P<0.001). Furthermore, there was a negative correlation (81.0%) between PON1 activity and carotid plaque in the overall study group (P<0.05). Also serum homocystein level was higher in the patient group (22.15+/-7.05) compared to the control group (13.30+/-3.32). In conclusion, our findings show inverse association between PON1 activity and carotid atherosclerosis in Alzheimer patients: the lower the PON1 activity the more progressed the atherosclerotic process in AD.
27479193	Multifaceted effects of aluminium in neurodegenerative diseases: A review.	Aluminium (Al) is the most common metal and widely distributed in our environment. Al was first isolated as an element in 1827, and its use began only after 1886. Al is widely used for industrial applications and consumer products. Apart from these it is also used in cooking utensils and in pharmacological agents, including antacids and antiperspirants from which the element usually enters into the human body. Evidence for the neurotoxicity of Al is described in various studies, but still the exact mechanism of Al toxicity is not known. However, the evidence suggests that the Al can potentiate oxidative stress and inflammatory events and finally leads to cell death. Al is considered as a well-established neurotoxin and have a link between the exposure and development of neurodegenerative diseases, including Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), Alzheimer's disease (AD), dementia, Gulf war syndrome and Parkinsonism. Here, we review the detailed possible pathogenesis of Al neurotoxicity. This review summarizes Al induced events likewise oxidative stress, cell mediated toxicity, apoptosis, inflammatory events in the brain, glutamate toxicity, effects on calcium homeostasis, gene expression and Al induced Neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) formation. Apart from these we also discussed animal models that are commonly used for Al induced neurotoxicity and neurodegeneration studies. These models help to find out a better way to treat and prevent the progression in Al induced neurodegenerative diseases.
27468961	N-Butylphthalide (NBP) ameliorated cerebral ischemia reperfusion-induced brain injury via HGF-regulated TLR4/NF-kappaB signaling pathway.	N-Butylphthalide (NBP) has been known to have potential neuroprotective effects in Alzheimer's disease and stroke animal models. Hepatocyte-growth factor (HGF), with strong angiogenic properties, exerted protective role in brain injury. The present study was aimed to investigate the possible anti-inflammatory effects of NBP on the brain injury of rats with cerebral ischemia reperfusion (IR) and astrocytes activation induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment. Our results showed that cerebral IR induced brain damage with down-regulation of HGF and astrocytes activation. NBP treatment significantly increased HGF expression and activated cMet/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, stimulating mTOR activity and suppressing apoptosis in brain tissues. Also NBP inhibited pro-inflammatory cytokines expression, including IL-6, IL-1beta, and TNFalpha, via TLR4/NF-kappaB suppression. Anti-HGF treatment enhanced TLR4 expression while HGF could suppress TLR4 activation and its down-streaming signals, attenuating inflammation finally. Notably, NBP up-regulated HGF and down-regulated TLR4 expression significantly in the astrocytes combined with the treatment of TLR4 inhibitor than the cells only treated with TLR4 inhibitor, suggesting that NBP could further suppress TLR4 activation, suggesting that NBP might impede TLR4 through up-regulating HGF expression. These results suggested that NBP treatment significantly ameliorated cerebral IR-induced brain injury by inhibiting TLR4/NF-kappaB-associated inflammation regulated by HGF.
27702574	Cell-free analysis of polyQ-dependent protein aggregation and its inhibition by chaperone proteins.	Protein misfolding and aggregation is one of the major causes of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and Huntington's disease. So far protein aggregation related to these diseases has been studied using animals, cultured cells or purified proteins. In this study, we show that a newly synthesized polyglutamine protein implicated in Huntington's disease forms large aggregates in HeLa cells, and successfully recapitulate the process of this aggregation using a translation-based system derived from HeLa cell extracts. When the cell-free translation system was pre-incubated with recombinant human cytosolic chaperonin CCT, or the Hsc70 chaperone system (Hsc70s: Hsc70, Hsp40, and Hsp110), aggregate formation was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, when these chaperone proteins were added in a post-translational manner, aggregation was not prevented. These data led us to suggest that chaperonin CCT and Hsc70s interact with nascent polyglutamine proteins co-translationally or immediately after their synthesis in a fashion that prevents intra- and intermolecular interactions of aggregation-prone polyglutamine proteins. We conclude that the in vitro approach described here can be usefully employed to analyze the mechanisms that provoke polyglutamine-driven protein aggregation and to screen for molecules to prevent it.
27766923	In vitro antiaggregation and deaggregation potential of Rhizophora mucronata and its bioactive compound (+)- catechin against Alzheimer's beta amyloid peptide (25-35).	OBJECTIVE: Amyloid hypothesis states that endogenous beta-amyloid peptides (Abeta), especially its aggregated oligomers and fibrils are the key pathogenic factors leading to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Therefore, inhibition of Abeta fibrillation rather than blocking its production is considered promising therapeutic intervention. Hence, the present study was carried out to assess the effect of methanolic leaf extract of R. mucronata (MERM) and its bioactive compound catechin on in vitro fibrillation of Abeta (25-35). METHODOLOGY: Antiaggregation and disaggregation effect by MERM and (+)- catechin against Abeta (25-35) were assessed in three different phases by thioflavin T (ThT) fluorescence assay and confocal microscopic analysis. The conformational changes in the aggregated Abeta fibrils in the presence and absence of MERM and catechin were analysed by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and CD spectroscopy. RESULTS: Results of ThT and confocal microscopic studies showed decrease in fluorescence intensity in MERM and catechin-treated groups illustrating that both MERM and catechin effectively inhibited fibril aggregation as well as destabilized preformed Abeta fibril. TEM revealed that MERM incubated samples were virtually devoid of structured fibrils but had an amorphous-like consistency, whereas the control contained structured fibrils of various width and length. FTIR analysis showed decrease in absorbance at 1630 cm-1 (amide I region) in MERM-treated groups substantiating the results of ThT assay. Circular dichroism data indicate that catechin prevents the formation of beta-structured aggregates of Abeta peptide. CONCLUSION: Results suggest that MERM and catechin might have direct interaction with Abeta peptide preventing its fibrillation.
27766461	Nuclear Lipids in the Nervous System: What they do in Health and Disease.	In the last 20 years it has been widely demonstrated that cell nucleus contains neutral and polar lipids localized in nuclear membranes, nucleoli, nuclear matrix and chromatin. Nuclear lipids may show specific organization forming nuclear lipid microdomains and have both structural and functional roles. Depending on their localization, nuclear lipids play different roles such as the regulation of nuclear membrane and nuclear matrix fluidity but they also can act as platforms for vitamin and hormone function, for active chromatin anchoring, and for the regulation of gene expression, DNA duplication and transcription. Crosstalk among different kinds of lipid signalling pathways influence the physiopathology of numerous cell types. In neural cells the nuclear lipids are involved in cell proliferation, differentiation, inflammation, migration and apoptosis. Abnormal metabolism of nuclear lipids might be closely associated with tumorigenesis and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer disease and Parkinson disease among others.
27597727	Neurodegenerative diseases linked to misfolded proteins and their therapeutic approaches: A review.	Neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Creutzfeldt-Jacob, Huntington's diseases and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, are mainly characterized by the massive deposition of misfolded protein aggregates consequent to aberrant production or overexpression of specific proteins. The development of new therapeutics for the treatment of neurodegenerative pathophysiologies currently stands at a crossroads. This presents an opportunity to transition future drug discovery efforts to target disease modification, an area in which much still remains unknown. In this review we examine recent progress in the area of neurodegenerative drug discovery, focusing on some of the most common targets.
27763550	Age- and Brain Region-Specific Changes of Glucose Metabolic Disorder, Learning, and Memory Dysfunction in Early Alzheimer's Disease Assessed in APP/PS1 Transgenic Mice Using 18F-FDG-PET.	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a leading cause of dementia worldwide, associated with cognitive deficits and brain glucose metabolic alteration. However, the associations of glucose metabolic changes with cognitive dysfunction are less detailed. Here, we examined the brains of APP/presenilin 1 (PS1) transgenic (Tg) mice aged 2, 3.5, 5 and 8 months using 18F-labed fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) microPET to assess age- and brain region-specific changes of glucose metabolism. FDG uptake was calculated as a relative standardized uptake value (SUVr). Morris water maze (MWM) was used to evaluate learning and memory dysfunction. We showed a glucose utilization increase in multiple brain regions of Tg mice at 2 and 3.5 months but not at 5 and 8 months. Comparisons of SUVrs within brains showed higher glucose utilization than controls in the entorhinal cortex, hippocampus, and frontal cortex of Tg mice at 2 and 3.5 months but in the thalamus and striatum at 3.5, 5 and 8 months. By comparing SUVrs in the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus, Tg mice were distinguished from controls at 2 and 3.5 months. In MWM, Tg mice aged 2 months shared a similar performance to the controls (prodromal-AD). By contrast, Tg mice failed training tests at 3.5 months but failed all MWM tests at 5 and 8 months, suggestive of partial or complete cognitive deficits (symptomatic-AD). Correlation analyses showed that hippocampal SUVrs were significantly correlated with MWM parameters in the symptomatic-AD stage. These data suggest that glucose metabolic disorder occurs before onset of AD signs in APP/PS1 mice with the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus affected first, and that regional FDG uptake increase can be an early biomarker for AD. Furthermore, hippocampal FDG uptake is a possible indicator for progression of Alzheimer's cognition after cognitive decline, at least in animals.
27763482	Can angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors impact cognitive decline in early stages of Alzheimer's disease? An overview of research evidence in the elderly patient population.	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease, in which an accumulation of toxic amyloid beta in the brain precedes the emergence of clinical symptoms. AD spectrum consists of presymptomatic, early symptomatic, and symptomatic phase of dementia. At present, no pharmacotherapy exists to modify or reverse a course of AD, and only symptomatic treatments are available. Many elderly patients, diagnosed with multiple medical conditions (such as cardiovascular diseases, Type 2 diabetes mellitus, and cerebrovascular diseases) are at increased risk of the development of mild cognitive impairment (MCI), AD, and vascular dementia. Studies have revealed reduced rates of cognitive decline, in elderly patients, who were treated with centrally active angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-Is) (that have an ability to cross the blood-brain barrier). This article reviews recently published literature, focused on possible protective influence of the centrally active ACE-Is, in the elderly population, at risk for cognitive decline.
27757016	A fixed-dose combination of memantine extended-release and donepezil in the treatment of moderate-to-severe Alzheimer's disease.	Currently available therapies for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD) consist of cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEIs), such as donepezil, and the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist memantine. In December 2014, the US Food and Drug Administration approved Namzaric, a once-daily, fixed-dose combination (FDC) of memantine extended-release (ER) and donepezil for patients with moderate-to-severe AD. The FDC capsule is bioequivalent to the coadministered individual drugs, and its bioavailability is similar when taken fasting, with food, or sprinkled onto applesauce. The combination of memantine and ChEIs in moderate-to-severe AD provides additional benefits to ChEI monotherapy across multiple domains and may delay the time to nursing home admission. A dedicated study of memantine ER compared to placebo in patients on a stable dose of a ChEI found statistically significant benefits on cognition and global status but not functioning. Treatment with memantine ER and donepezil is generally well tolerated, although higher doses of ChEIs are associated with more serious adverse events such as vomiting, syncope, and weight loss. Potential advantages of the FDC include a simpler treatment regimen, reduction in pill burden, and the ability to sprinkle the capsule onto soft foods. Patients who may benefit from the FDC include those with significant dysphagia, a history of poor compliance, or limited caregiver interaction. However, available evidence that these advantages would increase treatment adherence and persistence is conflicting, meaning that the added cost of switching patients from generic options to an FDC may not always be justified.
27756506	Transforming growth factor-beta1 in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with distinct neurodegenerative diseases.	A chronic inflammatory condition may underlie neurodegenerative disorders, including Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). For example, both PD and AD patients show an increase in transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) levels in their cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). TGF-beta1 is a cytokine that inhibits inflammation. In the present study, using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, we tested the hypothesis that the level of TGF-beta1 in the CSF of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), spinocerebellar degeneration (SCD), or multiple system atrophy-cerebellar subtype (MSA-C) would be elevated compared with that of normal controls. We found that TGF-beta1 levels in the CSF were not significantly different between these patients and normal controls. Our data suggest that the level of TGF-beta1 in the CSF is an unreliable biomarker of ALS, SCD, and MSA-C.
27756296	Using linked administrative and disease-specific databases to study end-of-life care on a population level.	BACKGROUND: The use of full-population databases is under-explored to study the use, quality and costs of end-of-life care. Using the case of Belgium, we explored: (1) which full-population databases provide valid information about end-of-life care, (2) what procedures are there to use these databases, and (3) what is needed to integrate separate databases. METHODS: Technical and privacy-related aspects of linking and accessing Belgian administrative databases and disease registries were assessed in cooperation with the database administrators and privacy commission bodies. For all relevant databases, we followed procedures in cooperation with database administrators to link the databases and to access the data. RESULTS: We identified several databases as fitting for end-of-life care research in Belgium: the InterMutualistic Agency's national registry of health care claims data, the Belgian Cancer Registry including data on incidence of cancer, and databases administrated by Statistics Belgium including data from the death certificate database, the socio-economic survey and fiscal data. To obtain access to the data, approval was required from all database administrators, supervisory bodies and two separate national privacy bodies. Two Trusted Third Parties linked the databases via a deterministic matching procedure using multiple encrypted social security numbers. CONCLUSION: In this article we describe how various routinely collected population-level databases and disease registries can be accessed and linked to study patterns in the use, quality and costs of end-of-life care in the full population and in specific diagnostic groups.
27756054	Bioactive effects of quercetin in the central nervous system: Focusing on the mechanisms of actions.	Quercetin, a ubiquitous flavonoid that is widely distributed in plants is classified as a cognitive enhancer in traditional and oriental medicine. The protective effects of quercetin for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders and cerebrovascular diseases have been demonstrated in both in vitro and in vivo studies. The free radical scavenging activity of quercetin has been well-documented, wherein quercetin has been observed to exhibit protective effects against oxidative stress mediated neuronal damage by modulating the expression of NRF-2 dependent antioxidant responsive elements, and attenuation of neuroinflammation by suppressing NF-kappaB signal transducer and activator of transcription-1 (STAT-1). Several in vitro and in vivo studies have also shown that quercetin destabilizes and enhances the clearance of abnormal protein such as beta- amyloid peptide and hyperphosphorlyated tau, the key pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease. Quercetin enhances neurogenesis and neuronal longevity by modulating a broad number of kinase signaling cascades such as phophoinositide 3- kinase (P13-kinase), AKT/PKB tyrosine kinase and Protein kinase C (PKC). Quercetin has also been well reported for its ability to reverse cognitive impairment and memory enhancement during aging. The current review focuses on summarizing the recent findings on the neuroprotective effect of quercetin, its mechanism of action and its possible roles in the prevention of neurological disorders.
27754406	The Identification of Biochanin A as a Potent and Selective beta-Site App-Cleaving Enzyme 1 (Bace1) Inhibitor.	Beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) is the enzyme involved in the abnormal production of the amyloidogenic peptide Abeta, one of the major causes of histological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Thus, BACE1 represents a key target protein in the development of new potential target for the prevention and treatment of AD. In this study, in vitro anti-AD activity of biochanin A, a dietary isoflavone found in legumes and most notably red clover, were evaluated via human recombinant BACE1 inhibition assay, as well as enzyme kinetic and molecular docking predictions. Enzyme-based assays revealed that biochanin A exhibited a non-competitive inhibitory effect on BACE1 with an IC50 value of 28 muM and a Ki of 43 muM. In addition, docking simulation results demonstrated that ASN37, SER35, SER36, TRP76, and ARG128 residues of BACE1 interacted with biochanin A. Moreover, the binding energy of biochanin A was negative (-8.4 kcal/mol), indicating that it might potentiate a strong binding between the compound and the allosteric site of BACE1, resulting in further effective BACE1 inhibition. The present novel findings raise the possibility that biochanin A may be used as a preventative, developed into a therapeutic agent for AD, or both.
27752950	Short residence duration was associated with asthma but not cognitive function in the elderly: USA NHANES, 2001-2002.	There has been a growing interest in how the built environment affects health and well-being. Housing characteristics are associated with human health while environmental chemicals could have mediated the effects. However, it is unclear if and how residence duration might have a role in health and well-being. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate the associations among residence duration, common chronic diseases, and cognitive function in older adults in a national and population-based setting. Data were extracted from the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 2001-2002, with assessment information on demographics, lifestyle factors, housing characteristics, self-reported common chronic diseases, and cognitive function by using the digit symbol substitution test from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (a measurement of attention and psychomotor speed). Statistical analyses including the chi-square test, t test, and survey-weighted general linear modeling and logistic regression modeling were performed. Residence duration was significantly associated with risk of asthma but not with other chronic disease, showing a longer stay in the same housing leading to lower risk of asthma (OR 0.43, 95%CI 0.27-0.69, P = 0.002) among the American older adults. However, having asthma was not associated with cognitive function decline. In conclusion, residence duration was found to be associated with risk of asthma but not cognitive function. Future research examining the relationship of residence duration and cognitive tests by other domains of cognitive function following asthma episodes would be suggested. For practice and policy implications, familiarity with the housing environment might help with lessening respiratory symptoms.
27751629	Community-Level Measures of Stroke Knowledge among Children: Findings from Hip Hop Stroke.	BACKGROUND: Community-level determinants of stroke knowledge among children are unknown but could meaningfully impact public stroke education campaigns. We explored for associations between community- and school-level quality measures relative to baseline stroke knowledge among children participating in the Hip Hop Stroke program. METHODS: Baseline stroke knowledge assessments were performed in 2839 fourth-, fifth-, and sixth-grade students (ages 9-11 years) from November 2005 to April 2014. Knowledge was assessed relative to school performance grade (SPG, graded A-F; a school-level measure determined by the New York City [NYC] Department of Education) and economic need index (ENI, range: 0-2; a community-level, within-school measure of subsidized housing and meals with higher scores indicating more socioeconomic distress). RESULTS: Schools studied included those with SPG = B (n = 196), SPG = C (n = 1590), and SPG = D (n = 1053) and mean ENI = .85 (standard deviation: .23). A composite assessment of knowledge, including 4 stroke symptoms (blurred vision, facial droop, sudden headache, and slurred speech), was conducted consistently since 2006. Overall, students correctly identified a mean of 1.74 stroke symptoms (95% confidence interval: 1.70-1.79; possible range: 0-4, expected value of chance response alone or no knowledge = 2). For quartiles of ENI, mean knowledge scores are as follows: ENIQ1 = 2.00, ENIQ2 = 2.09, ENIQ3 = 1.46, and ENIQ4 = 1.56 (ENIQ3 and ENIQ4 versus ENIQ1, P < .001). For SPG, SPG = B schools: 2.09, SPG = C: 1.83, and SPG = D: 1.56 (SPG = C and SPG = D versus SPG = B schools, P </= .05). CONCLUSIONS: Children's stroke knowledge was lowest in NYC communities with greater economic need and lower school performance. These findings could guide stroke education campaign implementation strategies.
27744252	Synthesis and evaluation of 7-substituted coumarin derivatives as multimodal monoamine oxidase-B and cholinesterase inhibitors for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.	A series of 7-substituted coumarin derivatives were designed and synthesised to display ChE and MAO-B inhibitory activity. The compounds consisted out of a coumarin structure (MAO-B inhibitor) and benzyl-, piperidine-, N-benzylpiperidine- or p-bromo-N-benzylpiperizine moiety, resembling the N-benzylpiperidine function of donepezil (ChE inhibitor), connected via an alkyl ether linkage at the 7 position. The biological assay results indicated that all the compounds (1-25) displayed selective inhibition to hMAO-B over hMAO-A, with the benzyloxy series (1-8, 10-13) showing nano-molar hMAO-B inhibition (IC50: 0.5-73 nM). Limited ChE inhibitory activity was however observed for the benzyloxy series with the exception of 2 and especially 3 showing selective BuChE inhibition. From this series 3 showed the best multifunctional activity (eqBuChE IC50 = 0.96 muM, hMAO-A IC50 = 2.13 muM, hMAO-B IC50 = 0.0021 muM). Within the N-benzylpiperidine (16-19) and p-bromo-N-benzylpiperizine (21-24) series the compounds in general showed moderate ChE and MAO-B inhibitory activity. Of these compounds 19 was the most potent multifunctional agent showing good eeAChE and eqBuChE inhibition (IC50 = 9.10 muM and 5.90 muM, respectively), and relatively potent and selective hMAO-B inhibition (IC50 = 0.30 muM, SI = >33). Molecular modeling revealed that 19 was able to bind simultaneously to the CAS, mid-gorge and PAS sites of AChE and BuChE suggesting that it will be able to inhibit AChE induced Abeta aggregation. From this study, compounds that 3 and 19 can be considered as promising multifunctional lead compounds.
27744187	Design, synthesis and biological evaluation of bambuterol analogues as novel inhibitors of butyrylcholinesterase.	An increase activity of butyrylcholinesterase is believed to contribute to Alzheimer's disease. Bambuterol is a known potent inhibitor of butyrylcholinesterase, but it has undesired cardiac effects and less lipophilicity. Thirteen bambuterol analogues were synthesized using 1-(3, 5-dihydroxyphenyl) ethanone as a starting material. In-vitro cholinesterase assay established that the majority of the compounds are specific butyrylcholinesterase inhibitors. Out of the 13 compounds, two bambuterol derivatives, BD-6 and BD-11 exhibited similar efficacies in inhibiting butyrylcholinesterase with fewer effects on heart and enhanced possibilities of permeating through the blood-brain barrier as compared to bambuterol. These bambuterol analogues may provide better alternatives for treatments of Alzheimer's disease.
27737437	Association Between Androgen Deprivation Therapy and Risk of Dementia.	Importance: A growing body of evidence supports a link between androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) and cognitive dysfunction, including Alzheimer disease. However, it is currently unknown whether ADT may contribute to the risk of dementia more broadly. Objective: To use an informatics approach to examine the association of ADT as a treatment for prostate cancer with the subsequent development of dementia (eg, senile dementia, vascular dementia, frontotemporal dementia, and Alzheimer dementia). Design, Setting, and Participants: In this cohort study, a text-processing method was used to analyze electronic medical record data from an academic medical center from 1994 to 2013, with a median follow-up of 3.4 years (interquartile range, 1.0-7.2 years). We identified 9455 individuals with prostate cancer who were 18 years or older at diagnosis with data recorded in the electronic health record and follow-up after diagnosis. We excluded 183 patients with a previous diagnosis of dementia. Our final cohort comprised 9272 individuals with prostate cancer, including 1826 men (19.7%) who received ADT. Main Outcomes and Measures: We tested the effect of ADT on the risk of dementia using propensity score-matched Cox proportional hazards regression models and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. Results: Among 9272 men with prostate cancer (mean [SD] age, 66.9 [10.9] years; 5450 [58.8%] white), there was a statistically significant association between use of ADT and risk of dementia (hazard ratio, 2.17; 95% CI, 1.58-2.99; P < .001). In sensitivity analyses, results were similar when excluding patients with Alzheimer disease (hazard ratio, 2.32; 95% CI, 1.73-3.12; P < .001). The absolute increased risk of developing dementia among those who received ADT was 4.4% at 5 years (7.9% among those who received ADT vs 3.5% in those who did not receive ADT). Analyses stratified by duration of ADT found that individuals with at least 12 months of ADT use had the greatest absolute increased risk of dementia (hazard ratio, 2.36; 95% CI, 1.64-3.38; P < .001). Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated that ADT users 70 years or older had the lowest cumulative probability of remaining dementia free (log-rank P < .001). Conclusions and Relevance: Androgen deprivation therapy in the treatment of prostate cancer may be associated with an increased risk of dementia. This finding should be further evaluated in prospective studies.
27736684	Discovery of novel rivastigmine-hydroxycinnamic acid hybrids as multi-targeted agents for Alzheimer's disease.	A series of rivastigmine-caffeic acid and rivastigmine-ferulic acid hybrids were designed, synthesized, and evaluated as multifunctional agents for Alzheimer's disease (AD) in vitro. The new compounds exerted antioxidant neuroprotective properties and good cholinesterases (ChE) inhibitory activities. Some of them also inhibited amyloid protein (Abeta) aggregation. In particular, compound 5 emerged as promising drug candidates endowed with neuroprotective potential, ChE inhibitory, Abeta self-aggregation inhibitory and copper chelation properties. These data suggest that compound 5 offers an attractive starting point for further lead optimization in the drug-discovery process against AD.
27734813	[Small molecule inhibitors of PERK-dependent signaling pathway as a novel, therapeutic molecular strategy in Alzheimer's disease treatment].	Nowadays more than 24 million people suffer from Alzheimer's disease (AD) that is the most common progressive cause of dementia. Molecular mechanisms of neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease is closely link with accumulation of misfolded proteins in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Deposition of senile plaques is one of the main feature of Alzheimer's disease as well as is strictly correlated with impairment of cognitive abilities. The accumulation of misfolded proteins in the lumen of the ER triggers activation of the ER stress, and subsequently unfolded protein response (UPR) signaling branches, which consists of a cascade of events on the molecular level of nerve cell. That results in attenuation of global protein translation mediated by the activated Protein kinase RNA-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) through phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2alpha (eIF2alpha). On the contrary, prolonged ER stress contributes to preferential translation of proteins such as Activating Transcription Factor 4 (ATF4) and CCAAT-enhancer binding protein homologous protein (CHOP) engaged in apoptotic cell death. Moreover, ensues preferential translation of enzyme beta-secretase 1 (BACE1), which is an enzyme involved in deposition of senile plagues in brain tissue, that are the main cause of cognitive impairment. Recent molecular and genetic investigations present a new point of view on the therapeutic strategy for AD. Deactivation of PERK kinase via smallmolecule inhibitors has been identified as a potential therapeutic target. It is highly possible that the inhibition of PERK activity may contribute to preventing the excessive accumulation of senile plaques among the neurons and, as a result, neuronal loss and significant decline in cognitive abilities in AD.
27733285	Global, regional, national, and selected subnational levels of stillbirths, neonatal, infant, and under-5 mortality, 1980-2015: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2015.	BACKGROUND: Established in 2000, Millennium Development Goal 4 (MDG4) catalysed extraordinary political, financial, and social commitments to reduce under-5 mortality by two-thirds between 1990 and 2015. At the country level, the pace of progress in improving child survival has varied markedly, highlighting a crucial need to further examine potential drivers of accelerated or slowed decreases in child mortality. The Global Burden of Disease 2015 Study (GBD 2015) provides an analytical framework to comprehensively assess these trends for under-5 mortality, age-specific and cause-specific mortality among children under 5 years, and stillbirths by geography over time. METHODS: Drawing from analytical approaches developed and refined in previous iterations of the GBD study, we generated updated estimates of child mortality by age group (neonatal, post-neonatal, ages 1-4 years, and under 5) for 195 countries and territories and selected subnational geographies, from 1980-2015. We also estimated numbers and rates of stillbirths for these geographies and years. Gaussian process regression with data source adjustments for sampling and non-sampling bias was applied to synthesise input data for under-5 mortality for each geography. Age-specific mortality estimates were generated through a two-stage age-sex splitting process, and stillbirth estimates were produced with a mixed-effects model, which accounted for variable stillbirth definitions and data source-specific biases. For GBD 2015, we did a series of novel analyses to systematically quantify the drivers of trends in child mortality across geographies. First, we assessed observed and expected levels and annualised rates of decrease for under-5 mortality and stillbirths as they related to the Soci-demographic Index (SDI). Second, we examined the ratio of recorded and expected levels of child mortality, on the basis of SDI, across geographies, as well as differences in recorded and expected annualised rates of change for under-5 mortality. Third, we analysed levels and cause compositions of under-5 mortality, across time and geographies, as they related to rising SDI. Finally, we decomposed the changes in under-5 mortality to changes in SDI at the global level, as well as changes in leading causes of under-5 deaths for countries and territories. We documented each step of the GBD 2015 child mortality estimation process, as well as data sources, in accordance with the Guidelines for Accurate and Transparent Health Estimates Reporting (GATHER). FINDINGS: Globally, 5.8 million (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 5.7-6.0) children younger than 5 years died in 2015, representing a 52.0% (95% UI 50.7-53.3) decrease in the number of under-5 deaths since 1990. Neonatal deaths and stillbirths fell at a slower pace since 1990, decreasing by 42.4% (41.3-43.6) to 2.6 million (2.6-2.7) neonatal deaths and 47.0% (35.1-57.0) to 2.1 million (1.8-2.5) stillbirths in 2015. Between 1990 and 2015, global under-5 mortality decreased at an annualised rate of decrease of 3.0% (2.6-3.3), falling short of the 4.4% annualised rate of decrease required to achieve MDG4. During this time, 58 countries met or exceeded the pace of progress required to meet MDG4. Between 2000, the year MDG4 was formally enacted, and 2015, 28 additional countries that did not achieve the 4.4% rate of decrease from 1990 met the MDG4 pace of decrease. However, absolute levels of under-5 mortality remained high in many countries, with 11 countries still recording rates exceeding 100 per 1000 livebirths in 2015. Marked decreases in under-5 deaths due to a number of communicable diseases, including lower respiratory infections, diarrhoeal diseases, measles, and malaria, accounted for much of the progress in lowering overall under-5 mortality in low-income countries. Compared with gains achieved for infectious diseases and nutritional deficiencies, the persisting toll of neonatal conditions and congenital anomalies on child survival became evident, especially in low-income and low-middle-income countries. We found sizeable heterogeneities in comparing observed and expected rates of under-5 mortality, as well as differences in observed and expected rates of change for under-5 mortality. At the global level, we recorded a divergence in observed and expected levels of under-5 mortality starting in 2000, with the observed trend falling much faster than what was expected based on SDI through 2015. Between 2000 and 2015, the world recorded 10.3 million fewer under-5 deaths than expected on the basis of improving SDI alone. INTERPRETATION: Gains in child survival have been large, widespread, and in many places in the world, faster than what was anticipated based on improving levels of development. Yet some countries, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, still had high rates of under-5 mortality in 2015. Unless these countries are able to accelerate reductions in child deaths at an extraordinary pace, their achievement of proposed SDG targets is unlikely. Improving the evidence base on drivers that might hasten the pace of progress for child survival, ranging from cost-effective intervention packages to innovative financing mechanisms, is vital to charting the pathways for ultimately ending preventable child deaths by 2030.

27733281	Global, regional, and national life expectancy, all-cause mortality, and cause-specific mortality for 249 causes of death, 1980-2015: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2015.	BACKGROUND: Improving survival and extending the longevity of life for all populations requires timely, robust evidence on local mortality levels and trends. The Global Burden of Disease 2015 Study (GBD 2015) provides a comprehensive assessment of all-cause and cause-specific mortality for 249 causes in 195 countries and territories from 1980 to 2015. These results informed an in-depth investigation of observed and expected mortality patterns based on sociodemographic measures. METHODS: We estimated all-cause mortality by age, sex, geography, and year using an improved analytical approach originally developed for GBD 2013 and GBD 2010. Improvements included refinements to the estimation of child and adult mortality and corresponding uncertainty, parameter selection for under-5 mortality synthesis by spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression, and sibling history data processing. We also expanded the database of vital registration, survey, and census data to 14 294 geography-year datapoints. For GBD 2015, eight causes, including Ebola virus disease, were added to the previous GBD cause list for mortality. We used six modelling approaches to assess cause-specific mortality, with the Cause of Death Ensemble Model (CODEm) generating estimates for most causes. We used a series of novel analyses to systematically quantify the drivers of trends in mortality across geographies. First, we assessed observed and expected levels and trends of cause-specific mortality as they relate to the Socio-demographic Index (SDI), a summary indicator derived from measures of income per capita, educational attainment, and fertility. Second, we examined factors affecting total mortality patterns through a series of counterfactual scenarios, testing the magnitude by which population growth, population age structures, and epidemiological changes contributed to shifts in mortality. Finally, we attributed changes in life expectancy to changes in cause of death. We documented each step of the GBD 2015 estimation processes, as well as data sources, in accordance with Guidelines for Accurate and Transparent Health Estimates Reporting (GATHER). FINDINGS: Globally, life expectancy from birth increased from 61.7 years (95% uncertainty interval 61.4-61.9) in 1980 to 71.8 years (71.5-72.2) in 2015. Several countries in sub-Saharan Africa had very large gains in life expectancy from 2005 to 2015, rebounding from an era of exceedingly high loss of life due to HIV/AIDS. At the same time, many geographies saw life expectancy stagnate or decline, particularly for men and in countries with rising mortality from war or interpersonal violence. From 2005 to 2015, male life expectancy in Syria dropped by 11.3 years (3.7-17.4), to 62.6 years (56.5-70.2). Total deaths increased by 4.1% (2.6-5.6) from 2005 to 2015, rising to 55.8 million (54.9 million to 56.6 million) in 2015, but age-standardised death rates fell by 17.0% (15.8-18.1) during this time, underscoring changes in population growth and shifts in global age structures. The result was similar for non-communicable diseases (NCDs), with total deaths from these causes increasing by 14.1% (12.6-16.0) to 39.8 million (39.2 million to 40.5 million) in 2015, whereas age-standardised rates decreased by 13.1% (11.9-14.3). Globally, this mortality pattern emerged for several NCDs, including several types of cancer, ischaemic heart disease, cirrhosis, and Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. By contrast, both total deaths and age-standardised death rates due to communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional conditions significantly declined from 2005 to 2015, gains largely attributable to decreases in mortality rates due to HIV/AIDS (42.1%, 39.1-44.6), malaria (43.1%, 34.7-51.8), neonatal preterm birth complications (29.8%, 24.8-34.9), and maternal disorders (29.1%, 19.3-37.1). Progress was slower for several causes, such as lower respiratory infections and nutritional deficiencies, whereas deaths increased for others, including dengue and drug use disorders. Age-standardised death rates due to injuries significantly declined from 2005 to 2015, yet interpersonal violence and war claimed increasingly more lives in some regions, particularly in the Middle East. In 2015, rotaviral enteritis (rotavirus) was the leading cause of under-5 deaths due to diarrhoea (146 000 deaths, 118 000-183 000) and pneumococcal pneumonia was the leading cause of under-5 deaths due to lower respiratory infections (393 000 deaths, 228 000-532 000), although pathogen-specific mortality varied by region. Globally, the effects of population growth, ageing, and changes in age-standardised death rates substantially differed by cause. Our analyses on the expected associations between cause-specific mortality and SDI show the regular shifts in cause of death composition and population age structure with rising SDI. Country patterns of premature mortality (measured as years of life lost [YLLs]) and how they differ from the level expected on the basis of SDI alone revealed distinct but highly heterogeneous patterns by region and country or territory. Ischaemic heart disease, stroke, and diabetes were among the leading causes of YLLs in most regions, but in many cases, intraregional results sharply diverged for ratios of observed and expected YLLs based on SDI. Communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional diseases caused the most YLLs throughout sub-Saharan Africa, with observed YLLs far exceeding expected YLLs for countries in which malaria or HIV/AIDS remained the leading causes of early death. INTERPRETATION: At the global scale, age-specific mortality has steadily improved over the past 35 years; this pattern of general progress continued in the past decade. Progress has been faster in most countries than expected on the basis of development measured by the SDI. Against this background of progress, some countries have seen falls in life expectancy, and age-standardised death rates for some causes are increasing. Despite progress in reducing age-standardised death rates, population growth and ageing mean that the number of deaths from most non-communicable causes are increasing in most countries, putting increased demands on health systems.

27730373	Angela R.: a familial Alzheimer's disease case in the days of Auguste D.	The rebuilding of the N family, a large Italian kindred affected by early-onset autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease (AD), provided an important contribution to the discovery of Presenilin 1 (PSEN1), the main gene responsible for familial AD. This pedigree was identified with the help of medical records from the archives of the Psychiatric Hospital of Girifalco, Italy. The clinical record of Angela R., an ancestor of the N family, dating back to 1904, showed a clinical picture of Angela R., consistent with a diagnosis of non-amnestic probable AD, matching the "dysexecutive" phenotype described in her descendants. The a posteriori diagnosis of AD is supported by the evidence of the causative genetic mutation PSEN1-Met146Leu as well as neuropathological AD features in her genealogically proven descendants. The clinical case of Angela R. was recorded at the same time of Alzheimer's description of Auguste D. Its discovery crucially contributed to the genealogical reconstruction of the N family, linking came from different branches, which until then were unrelated, to the same kindred. The archives of the Girifalco Hospital represented a valuable source of medical and historical information and were essential to the research on Italian-American AD families that finally led to the identification of new genes.
27727239	Human whole genome genotype and transcriptome data for Alzheimer's and other neurodegenerative diseases.	Previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS), conducted by our group and others, have identified loci that harbor risk variants for neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Human disease variants are enriched for polymorphisms that affect gene expression, including some that are known to associate with expression changes in the brain. Postulating that many variants confer risk to neurodegenerative disease via transcriptional regulatory mechanisms, we have analyzed gene expression levels in the brain tissue of subjects with AD and related diseases. Herein, we describe our collective datasets comprised of GWAS data from 2,099 subjects; microarray gene expression data from 773 brain samples, 186 of which also have RNAseq; and an independent cohort of 556 brain samples with RNAseq. We expect that these datasets, which are available to all qualified researchers, will enable investigators to explore and identify transcriptional mechanisms contributing to neurodegenerative diseases.
27727187	Design, Synthesis and Evaluation of Novel Tacrine-Ferulic Acid Hybrids as Multifunctional Drug Candidates against Alzheimer's Disease.	Five novel tacrine-ferulic acid hybrid compounds (8a-e) were synthesized and their structures were identified on the basis of a detailed spectroscopic analysis. The activities of inhibiting acetyl cholinesterase (AChE) and butyryl cholinesterase (BuChE), reducing self-induced beta-amyloid (Abeta) aggregation and chelating Cu2+ were evaluated in vitro. Among them, 8c and 8d displayed the higher selectivity in inhibiting AChE over BuChE. Moreover, 8d also showed dramatic inhibition of self-Abeta aggregation, activity of chelating Cu2+ and activity against Abeta-induced neurotoxicity in Neuro-2A cells.
27725441	Perturbed Calcineurin-NFAT Signaling Is Associated with the Development of Alzheimer's Disease.	Down syndrome (DS), the most common genetic disorder, is caused by trisomy 21. DS is accompanied by heart defects, hearing and vision problems, obesity, leukemia, and other conditions, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). In comparison, most cancers are rare in people with DS. Overexpression of dual specificity tyrosine-phosphorylation-regulated kinase 1A and a regulator of calcineurin 1 located on chromosome 21 leads to excessive suppression of the calcineurin-nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) signaling pathway, resulting in reduced expression of a critical angiogenic factor. However, it is unclear whether the calcineurin-NFAT signaling pathway is involved in AD pathology in DS patients. Here, we investigated the association between the calcineurin-NFAT signaling pathway and AD using neuronal cells. Short-term pharmacological stimulation decreased gene expression of tau and neprilysin, and long-term inhibition of the signaling pathway decreased that of amyloid precursor protein. Moreover, a calcineurin inhibitor, cyclosporine A, also decreased neprilysin activity, leading to increases in amyloid-beta peptide levels. Taken together, our results suggest that a dysregulation in calcineurin-NFAT signaling may contribute to the early onset of AD in people with DS.
27725432	New Age Therapy for Alzheimer's Disease by Neuronal Network Reconstruction.	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a recognized incurable neurodegenerative disorder. Clinically prescribed medicines for AD are expected to bring about only slight symptomatic improvement or a delay of its progression. Another strategy, amyloid beta (Abeta) lowing agents, has not been successful at memory improvement. We have hypothesized that an improvement in cognitive function requires the construction of neuronal networks, including neurite regeneration and synapse formation; therefore, we have been exploring candidates for radical anti-AD drugs that can restore Abeta-induced neurite atrophy and memory impairment. Our studies found several promising drug candidates that may improve memory dysfunction in AD model mice. The main activity of these drugs is the restoration of damaged axons. Focusing on candidates based on the recovery of neurite atrophy in vitro certainly leads to positive effects on memory improvement also in vivo. This suggests that neuronal network reconstruction may importantly relate to functional recovery in the brain. When identifying the signaling mechanisms of exogenous compounds like natural medicine-derived constituents, molecules directly activated by the compound are hard to be identified. However, the drug affinity responsive target stability (DARTS) analysis may pave the way to an approach to determine the initial molecule of the signaling pathway. Exploring new drug candidates and clarifying their signaling pathways directly relating to neuronal network reconstruction may provide promising therapeutic strategies with which to overcome AD.
27724967	Relationship between oxysterols and mild cognitive impairment in the elderly: a case-control study.	BACKGROUND: To investigate the relationship between oxysterols and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in a matched case-control study. METHODS: The plasma levels of four oxysterols, 27-hydroxycholesterol (27-OHC), 24S-hydroxycholesterol (24S-OHC), 7alpha-hydroxycholesterol (7alpha-OHC) and 7beta-hydroxycholesterol (7beta-OHC), were analyzed by High Performance Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (HPLC-MS) and compared between 70 MCI patients and 140 matched controls with normal cognition. The odds ratio (OR) was calculated using logistic analyses to assess the association between oxysterols and MCI. RESULTS: Compared with controls with normal cognition, plasma level of 27-OHC was significantly higher in MCI patients. Logistic analyses suggested high plasma level of 27-OHC was significantly associated with MCI even after multivariate adjustment (OR = 2.86, 95 % CI: 1.52 ~ 5.37). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggested that the increased plasma level of 27-OHC was associated with MCI, suggesting high plasma levels of 27-OHC may pay an important role in the development of MCI.
27721157	Design, synthesis, in-silico and biological evaluation of novel donepezil derivatives as multi-target-directed ligands for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.	A novel series of donepezil based multi-functional agents "(E)-5,6-dimethoxy-2-(4-(4-substituted piperazin-1-yl)benzylidene)-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-ones" have been designed and synthesized as potential anti-Alzheimer's agents. In-vitro studies revealed that these compounds demonstrated moderate to good AChE and Abeta aggregation inhibitory activity. These derivatives are also endowed with admirable antioxidant activity. Among the entire series compounds IP-9, IP-13 and IP-15 appeared as most active multi-functional agents and displayed marked AChE inhibitory, Abeta disaggregation and antioxidant activity. Studies indicate that IP-13 and IP-15 showed better AChE inhibitory activity than the standard drug donepezil and IP-9, IP-13 as well as IP-15 exhibited better Abeta aggregation inhibitory activity than curcumin. These compounds (IP-9, IP-13 and IP-15) successfully diminished H2O2 induced oxidative stress in SH-SY5Y cells and displayed excellent neuroprotective activity against H2O2 as well as Abeta induced toxicity in SH-SY5Y cells in a concentration dependent manner. Moreover, these derivatives did not exert any significant toxicity in neuronal SH-SY5Y cells in cytotoxicity assay. To elucidate the plausible binding mode of the compounds IP-9, IP-13 and IP-15, molecular docking studies and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation studies were also performed and the results indicate their significant interactions with the active sites of AChE as well as Abeta1-42 peptide. Thus, the present study evidently showed that IP-9, IP-13 and IP-15 are potent multi-functional agents against Alzheimer's disease and might serve as promising lead candidates for anti-Alzheimer drug development.
27721153	Design, synthesis and biological evaluation of new phthalimide and saccharin derivatives with alicyclic amines targeting cholinesterases, beta-secretase and amyloid beta aggregation.	The complexity of Alzheimer's disease (AD) calls for search of multifunctional compounds as potential candidates for effective therapy. A series of phthalimide and saccharin derivatives linked by different alicyclic fragments (piperazine, hexahydropyrimidine, 3-aminopyrrolidine or 3-aminopiperidine) with phenylalkyl moieties attached have been designed, synthesized, and evaluated as multifunctional anti-AD agents with cholinesterase, beta-secretase and beta-amyloid inhibitory activities. In vitro studies showed that the majority of saccharin derivatives with piperazine moiety and one phthalimide derivative with 3-aminopiperidine fragment exhibited inhibitory potency toward acetylcholinesterase (AChE) with EeAChE IC50 values ranging from 0.83 muM to 19.18 muM. The target compounds displayed inhibition of human beta-secretase-1 (hBACE1) ranging from 26.71% to 61.42% at 50 muM concentration. Among these compounds, two multifunctional agents (26, [2-(2-(4-benzylpiperazin-1-yl)ethyl)benzo[d]isothiazol-3(2H)-one 1,1-dioxide] and 52, 2-(2-(3-(3,5-difluorobenzylamino)piperidin-1-yl)ethyl)isoindoline-1,3-dione) have been identified. Compound 26 exhibited the highest inhibitory potency against EeAChE (IC50 = 0.83 muM) and inhibitory activity against hBACE1 (33.61% at 50 muM). Compound 52 is a selective AChE inhibitor (IC50 AChE = 6.47 muM) with BACE1 inhibitory activity (26.3% at 50 muM) and it displays the most significant Abeta anti-aggregating properties among all the obtained compounds (39% at 10 muM). Kinetic and molecular modeling studies indicate that 26 may act as non-competitive AChE inhibitor able to interact with both catalytic and peripheral active site of the enzyme.
27720999	Neurotrophin-3 promotes proliferation and cholinergic neuronal differentiation of bone marrow- derived neural stem cells via notch signaling pathway.	AIMS: Recently, the potential for neural stem cells (NSCs) to be used in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been reported; however, the therapeutic effects are modest by virtue of the low neural differentiation rate. In our study, we transfected bone marrow-derived NSCs (BM-NSCs) with Neurotrophin-3 (NT-3), a superactive neurotrophic factor that promotes neuronal survival, differentiation, and migration of neuronal cells, to investigate the effects of NT-3 gene overexpression on the proliferation and differentiation into cholinergic neuron of BM-NSCs in vitro and its possible molecular mechanism. MAIN METHODS: BM-NSCs were generated from BM mesenchymal cells of adult C57BL/6 mice and cultured in vitro. After transfected with NT-3 gene, immunofluorescence and RT-PCR method were used to determine the ability of BM-NSCs on proliferation and differentiation into cholinergic neuron; Acetylcholine Assay Kit was used for acetylcholine (Ach). RT-PCR and WB analysis were used to characterize mRNA and protein level related to the Notch signaling pathway. KEY FINDINGS: We found that NT-3 can promote the proliferation and differentiation of BM-NSCs into cholinergic neurons and elevate the levels of acetylcholine (ACh) in the supernatant. Furthermore, NT-3 gene overexpression increase the expression of Hes1, decreased the expression of Mash1 and Ngn1 during proliferation of BM-NSCs. Whereas, the expression of Hes1 was down-regulated, and Mash1 and Ngn1 expression were up-regulated during differentiation of BM-NSCs. SIGNIFICANCE: Our findings support the prospect of using NT-3-transduced BM-NSCs in developing therapies for AD due to their equivalent therapeutic potential as subventricular zone-derived NSCs (SVZ-NSCs), greater accessibility, and autogenous attributes.
27717954	Specific Features of Executive Dysfunction in Alzheimer-Type Mild Dementia Based on Computerized Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) Test Results.	BACKGROUND The primary manifestation of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is decline in memory. Dysexecutive symptoms have tremendous impact on functional activities and quality of life. Data regarding frontal-executive dysfunction in mild AD are controversial. The aim of this study was to assess the presence and specific features of executive dysfunction in mild AD based on Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) results. MATERIAL AND METHODS Fifty newly diagnosed, treatment-naive, mild, late-onset AD patients (MMSE >/=20, AD group) and 25 control subjects (CG group) were recruited in this prospective, cross-sectional study. The CANTAB tests CRT, SOC, PAL, SWM were used for in-depth cognitive assessment. Comparisons were performed using the t test or Mann-Whitney U test, as appropriate. Correlations were evaluated by Pearson r or Spearman R. Statistical significance was set at p<0.05. RESULTS AD and CG groups did not differ according to age, education, gender, or depression. Few differences were found between groups in the SOC test for performance measures: Mean moves (minimum 3 moves): AD (Rank Sum=2227), CG (Rank Sum=623), p<0.001. However, all SOC test time measures differed significantly between groups: SOC Mean subsequent thinking time (4 moves): AD (Rank Sum=2406), CG (Rank Sum=444), p<0.001. Correlations were weak between executive function (SOC) and episodic/working memory (PAL, SWM) (R=0.01-0.38) or attention/psychomotor speed (CRT) (R=0.02-0.37). CONCLUSIONS Frontal-executive functions are impaired in mild AD patients. Executive dysfunction is highly prominent in time measures, but minimal in performance measures. Executive disorders do not correlate with a decline in episodic and working memory or psychomotor speed in mild AD.
27711939	The Ege Agraphia Test Battery for Identifying the Writing Disorders in Cases with Mild Cognitive Impairment and Alzheimer's Disease.	OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to create an agraphia test battery specific to Turkish language, to obtain normative data for the performance and error types of this test and to demonstrate its success in detecting cognitive disorders in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) cases that can't be diagnosed by formal neuropsychological tests due to the fact that writing is a complex function. METHOD: For this purpose, 20 healthy control (HC) subjects, 20 MCI cases and 20 Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients with Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) of 1 were evaluated with Ege Agraphia Test Battery. RESULTS: Significant differences between the performance points and the error types of HC subjects, MCI cases and AD patients were obtained. As the cognitive impairment of the subjects in the study got worse, the writing skills also became worse revealing lower test points. Besides, some statistically significant differences between the error types of MCI cases and AD patients were found. CONCLUSION: Ege Agraphia Test Battery is not only a practical test, but also is the first defined agraphia test specific for Turkish language. Writing disorders in cases with MCI support the view that MCI is a transition period for AD. Further studies are required to increase the test data and proper rearrangements of the test battery.
27710863	Expression of Alzheimer's disease risk genes in ischemic brain degeneration.	We review the Alzheimer-related expression of genes following brain ischemia as risk factors for late-onset of sporadic Alzheimer's disease and their role in Alzheimer's disease ischemia-reperfusion pathogenesis. More recent advances in understanding ischemic etiology of Alzheimer's disease have revealed dysregulation of Alzheimer-associated genes including amyloid protein precursor, beta-secretase, presenilin 1 and 2, autophagy, mitophagy and apoptosis. We review the relationship between these genes dysregulated by brain ischemia and the cellular and neuropathological characteristics of Alzheimer's disease. Here we summarize the latest studies supporting the theory that Alzheimer-related genes play an important role in ischemic brain injury and that ischemia is a needful and leading supplier to the onset and progression of sporadic Alzheimer's disease. Although the exact molecular mechanisms of ischemic dependent neurodegenerative disease and neuronal susceptibility finally are unknown, a downregulated expression of neuronal defense genes like alfa-secretase in the ischemic brain makes the neurons less able to resist injury. The recent challenge is to find ways to raise the adaptive reserve of the brain to overcome such ischemic-associated deficits and support and/or promote neuronal survival. Understanding the mechanisms underlying the association of these genes with risk for Alzheimer's disease will provide the most meaningful targets for therapeutic development to date.
27703109	[Clinical Implications and Appropriate Use of Amyloid Imaging with florbetapir (<sup>18</sup>F) in Diagnosis of Patients with Alzheimer Disease].	florbetapir (<sup>18</sup>F) is a radiolabeled compound that can be used to visualize amyloid-beta (Abeta) plaques in the brains of patients with cognitive dysfunction, who are suspected of having Alzheimer disease (AD). Knowing the status of Abeta accumulation in the brain is beneficial to selecting therapeutic strategies or to planning of laboratory examinations, hence amyloid PET imaging is expected to be utilized more often in a clinical setting. Based on the results of a clinical study of florbetapir (<sup>18</sup>F), this review discusses the usefulness and clinical significance of amyloid PET imaging, and its appropriate use in Japan.

27701713	An Update on Biomedical Application of Nanotechnology for Alzheimer's Disease Diagnosis and Therapy.	Approximately 35 million people worldwide suffer from Alzheimer's disease (AD). The cellular uptake and specific transport of drugs and imaging agents to brain are common issues in the diagnosis and therapy of AD. New advances in nanotechnology have supplied favorable solutions to this issue. Various nanocarriers such as polymeric nanoparticles, liposomes, micelles, dendrimers and nanogels have been studied for the delivery of drugs and imaging agents to brain. This review presents a succinct discussion of the applications of nanotechnology for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis and therapy.
27696179	Long-Term Cognitive Improvement After Benfotiamine Administration in Patients with Alzheimer's Disease.	To date, we still lack disease-modifying therapies for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here, we report that long-term administration of benfotiamine improved the cognitive ability of patients with AD. Five patients with mild to moderate AD received oral benfotiamine (300 mg daily) over 18 months. All patients were examined by positron emission tomography with Pittsburgh compound B (PiB-PET) and exhibited positive imaging with beta-amyloid deposition, and three received PiB-PET imaging at follow-up. The five patients exhibited cognitive improvement as assayed by the Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE) with an average increase of 3.2 points at month 18 of benfotiamine administration. The three patients who received follow-up PiB-PET had a 36.7% increase in the average standardized uptake value ratio in the brain compared with that in the first scan. Importantly, the MMSE scores of these three had an average increase of 3 points during the same period. Benfotiamine significantly improved the cognitive abilities of mild to moderate AD patients independently of brain amyloid accumulation. Our study provides new insight to the development of disease-modifying therapy.
27689729	Natural and synthetic bioactive inhibitors of glycogen synthase kinase.	Glycogen synthase kinase-3 is a multi-functional serine-threonine kinase and is involved in diverse physiological processes, including metabolism, cell cycle, and gene expression by regulating a wide variety of known substrates like glycogen synthase, tau-protein and beta-catenin. Aberrant GSK-3 has been involved in diabetes, inflammation, cancer, Alzheimer's and bipolar disorder. In this review, we present an overview of the involvement of GSK-3 in various signalling pathways, resulting in a number of adverse pathologies due to its dysregulation. In addition, a detailed description of the small molecule inhibitors of GSK-3 with different mode of action discovered or specifically developed for GSK-3 has been presented. Furthermore, some clues for the future optimization of these promising molecules to develop specific drugs inhibiting GSK-3, for the treatment of associated disease conditions have also been discussed.
27688184	New azepino[4,3-b]indole derivatives as nanomolar selective inhibitors of human butyrylcholinesterase showing protective effects against NMDA-induced neurotoxicity.	Several 6-substituted 3,4,5,6-tetrahydroazepino[4,3-b]indol-1(2H)-one (THAI) derivatives were synthesized and evaluated for their activity as cholinesterase (ChE) inhibitors. The most potent inhibitors were identified among 6-(2-phenylethyl)-THAI derivatives, and in particular compounds 12b and 12d proved to be very active against human BChE (IC50 = 13 and 1.8 nM, respectively), with 1000-fold selectivity over AChE. Structure-activity relationships highlighted critical features (e.g., ring fusion [4,3-b], integrity of the lactam CONH function) and favorable physicochemical properties of the 6-(2-phenylethyl) group (i.e., optimal position, size and lipophilicity of phenyl substituents). The effects of a number of compounds against NMDA-induced SH-SY5Y neuronal cell injury were also evaluated. Treatment with 12b increased cell viability in SH-SY5Y cells pretreated with 250 muM NMDA, with significant effects (P < 0.05) at concentrations between 0.5 and 5 muM. These findings suggest that THAI can be used as a scaffold for developing new drug leads for the treatment of Alzheimer-type neurodegeneration syndrome.
27684880	Interleukin-8 gene polymorphism -251T>A contributes to Alzheimer's disease susceptibility.	BACKGROUND: Published association studies have investigated the correlation between interleukin-8 (IL-8) gene polymorphism -251T>A and susceptibility to Alzheimer's disease (AD); however, the results are conflicting. Thus, we conducted the meta-analysis to reassess the effect of IL-8 gene -251T>A variant on the risk of AD. METHODS: Relevant studies regarding this association were electronically searched and identified from the PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, and the Chinese Biomedicine Database. The odds ratios (ORs) with the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were pooled to calculate the strength of this association. RESULTS: Nine studies with a total of 1406 cases and 2152 controls were included in the meta-analysis. Overall, a significant association of IL-8 gene -251T>A polymorphism with increased risk of AD was observed in several genetic models (allele, A vs T: OR=1.32, 95%CI=1.16-1.50; homozygous, AA vs TT: OR=1.70, 95%CI=1.21-2.21; heterozygous, TA vs TT: OR=1.37, 95%CI=1.12-1.69; recessive, AA vs TA+TT: OR=1.40, 95%CI=1.12-1.75). Similarly, such association was also revealed both in Asian and European populations in the subgroup analysis by ethnicity. CONCLUSION: The current study suggested that IL-8 gene polymorphism -251T>A may contribute to the susceptibility to AD.
27684793	Association of genetic variants in the receptor for advanced glycation end products gene with diabetic retinopathy: A meta-analysis.	BACKGROUND: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a major sight-threatening diabetic complication. Previous studies have examined the association of DR with multiple genetic variants in the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) gene, with inconsistent results. OBJECTIVE: To perform a systematic literature search and conduct meta-analyses to examine the association of genetic variants in RAGE with DR. DATA SOURCES: PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, Google Scholar, and HuGE. STUDY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA AND PARTICIPANTS: Studies were on human subjects; the studies were case-control ones and included subjects who had DR and those who did not have DR; and the studies provided genotype data for genetic variants in RAGE, separately for subjects who had and did not have DR, or provided odds ratios (ORs) and the 95% confidence intervals (CIs), or provided sufficient data for the calculation of OR and the 95% CI. STUDY APPRAISAL AND SYNTHESIS METHODS: We used OR as a measure of association, and used random-effects model in all the meta-analyses. Between-study heterogeneity was assessed using I, and publication bias was evaluated using Egger test. RESULTS: A total of 13 studies met the eligibility criteria and were included in our analyses. We found that Gly82Ser was significantly associated with DR (OR = 2.40, 95% CI: 1.46-3.97; P = 0.001) using a recessive model. -374T/A also showed significant association with DR under a dominant model (OR = 1.21, 95% CI: 1.03-1.43; P = 0.023). We did not find a significant association of DR with other genetic variants in RAGE. LIMITATIONS: The number of included studies is small for some genetic variants; duration of diabetes varied across studies; most studies were conducted in Asia; and it is not clear whether the observed association can be generalized to other ethnicities; and we could not control for other potential confounding factors. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS OF KEY FINDINGS: We found that Gly82Ser in RAGE showed significant association with DR. More studies with larger sample sizes that control for important risk factors, such as duration of diabetes, are needed to validate our findings.
27681477	Caregiver burden and prevalence of depression, anxiety and sleep disturbances in Alzheimer's disease caregivers in China.	AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To evaluate caregiver burden and factors that influence this burden among caregivers and patients with Alzheimer's disease in China. BACKGROUND: Long-term care can reduce the quality of life for caregivers and result in both mental and physical exhaustion. However, little is known about caregiver burden and associated factors in China. DESIGN: The study had a quantitative cross-sectional design. METHODS: A total of 309 caregivers and their patients were included in the study. The patients' cognitive, psychological and functional status and their caregivers' burden, sleep quality and mental state were evaluated. Descriptive analyses, single-factor regression and stepwise factor regression were used to determine the effects of various factors on caregiver burden. RESULTS: Older females and spouses still play an important role in providing family care for those with dementia. Most of the caregivers were the sole full-time caregiver and had little time for themselves. Sleepiness was a common physical problem for caregivers, and some of them had moderate to severe depression and anxiety. A lower functional status of the patient was associated with higher caregiver burden. Poorer physical status compared with before caregiving began, lower life satisfaction, and higher degrees of depression and anxiety were associated with higher caregiver burden. CONCLUSION: Depression, anxiety and sleep problems are the main challenges that are faced by family caregivers of patients with Alzheimer's disease. Caregivers' functional status, lower life satisfaction, depression and anxiety influenced caregiver burden. Caregiver burden was related to the severity of the patient's dementia and the personal factors of the caregivers. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: To provide information about caregivers' current status while caring for patients with Alzheimer's disease and to understand caregiver burden and its related factors. Professionals who work with Alzheimer's disease should pay more attention to caregiver burden, especially those with mental and physical problems.
27680087	Memory Binding Test Distinguishes Amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment and Dementia from Cognitively Normal Elderly.	OBJECTIVE: We aimed to assess reliability and cross-sectional discriminative validity of the Memory Binding Test (MBT) to distinguish persons with amnestic cognitive impairment (aMCI) and dementia from cognitively normal elderly controls. METHOD: The MBT was administered to 20 participants with dementia, 31 with aMCI and 246 controls, who received the first administration of the MBT from May 2003 to December 2007, as a substudy of the community-based Einstein Aging Study (age range: 70+). The optimal index resulted from comparing the partial area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (ROC AUC) of four major MBT indices for specificities >/=0.70. Optimal cut-score of the optimal index was selected by maximizing the sum of sensitivity and specificity. Age and education effects were assessed using stratified cut-scores and adjusted logistic regression. Reliability was computed as intraclass correlation between scores at baseline and 1-year follow-up for participants who remained cognitively normal. RESULTS: Total number of Items recalled in the Paired condition (TIP) was elected the optimal index. TIP cut-score was </=22 for differentiating aMCI alone (sensitivity = 0.74, specificity = 0.73) and aMCI and dementia combined (sensitivity = 0.84, specificity = 0.73) from controls. It was </=17 for differentiating dementia from aMCI and controls (sensitivity = 0.95, specificity = 0.87). Age and education adjustments did not materially improve discriminative validity. The reliability of TIP was 0.77. CONCLUSIONS: MBT achieved moderate to good reliability. TIP had superior cross-sectional discriminative validity than the other MBT indices. We recommend using the empirical cut-score of TIP </=22 for discriminating aMCI and dementia and </=17 for discriminating dementia alone.
27678025	Emerging drugs to reduce abnormal beta-amyloid protein in Alzheimer's disease patients.	INTRODUCTION: Currently available drugs against Alzheimer's disease (AD) target cholinergic and glutamatergic neurotransmissions without affecting the underlying disease process. Putative disease-modifying drugs are in development and target beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptide and tau protein, the principal neurophatological hallmarks of the disease. Areas covered: Phase III clinical studies of emerging anti-Abeta drugs for the treatment of AD were searched in US and EU clinical trial registries and in the medical literature until May 2016. Expert opinion: Drugs in Phase III clinical development for AD include one inhibitor of the beta-secretase cleaving enzyme (BACE) (verubecestat), three anti-Abeta monoclonal antibodies (solanezumab, gantenerumab, and aducanumab), an inhibitor of receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) (azeliragon) and the combination of cromolyn sodium and ibuprofen (ALZT-OP1). These drugs are mainly being tested in subjects during early phases of AD or in subjects at preclinical stage of familial AD or even in asymptomatic subjects at high risk of developing AD. The hope is to intervene in the disease process when it is not too late. However, previous clinical failures with anti-Abeta drugs and the lack of fully understanding of the pathophysiological role of Abeta in the development of AD, put the new drugs at substantial risk of failure.
27677549	Neurotoxic Non-proteinogenic Amino Acid beta-N-Methylamino-L-alanine and Its Role in Biological Systems.	Secondary metabolites of photoautotrophic organisms have attracted considerable interest in recent years. In particular, molecules of non-proteinogenic amino acids participating in various physiological processes and capable of producing adverse ecological effects have been actively investigated. For example, the non-proteinogenic amino acid beta-N-methylamino-L-alanine (BMAA) is neurotoxic to animals including humans. It is known that BMAA accumulation via the food chain can lead to development of neurodegenerative diseases in humans such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases as well as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Moreover, BMAA can be mistakenly incorporated into a protein molecule instead of serine. Natural sources of BMAA and methods for its detection are discussed in this review, as well as the role of BMAA in metabolism of its producers and possible mechanisms of toxicity of this amino acid in different living organisms.
27676471	Further investigation of Paprotrain: Towards the conception of selective and multi-targeted CNS kinase inhibitors.	Starting from a known compound, identified as the first inhibitor of the kinesin MKLP-2 and named Paprotrain, we have investigated its reactivity to produce through photochemistry a potent nanomolar inhibitor of the kinase DYRK1A. Using similar and different chemical pathways, we have designed several families of compounds that have been screened on a panel of five protein kinases: CK1delta/epsilon, CDK5/p25, GSK3alpha/beta, DYRK1A and CLK1, all involved in neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. We have identified a first group of multi-targeted compounds, a second group of dual inhibitors of DYRK1A & CLK1 and a last group of selective inhibitors of CLK1. Then, our best submicromolar to nanomolar inhibitors were evaluated towards the closest members of the aforementioned kinases: DYRK1B and CLK4, as well as the subfamily CLK2-3. Several compounds appear to be particularly promising for the development of tools in the battle against Alzheimer's disease.
27672033	Assessment of free and cued recall in Alzheimer's disease and vascular and frontotemporal dementia with 24-item Grober and Buschke test.	Alzheimer's disease (AD), vascular dementia (VaD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) are the most common forms of dementia. It is well known that memory deficits in AD are different from those in VaD and FTD, especially with respect to cued recall. The aim of this clinical study was to compare the memory performance in 15 AD, 10 VaD and 9 FTD patients and 20 normal controls by means of a 24-item Grober-Buschke test [8]. The patients' groups were comparable in terms of severity of dementia. We considered free and total recall (free plus cued) both in immediate and delayed recall and computed an Index of Sensitivity to Cueing (ISC) [8] for immediate and delayed trials. We assessed whether cued recall predicted the subsequent free recall across our patients' groups. We found that AD patients recalled fewer items from the beginning and were less sensitive to cueing supporting the hypothesis that memory disorders in AD depend on encoding and storage deficit. In immediate recall VaD and FTD showed a similar memory performance and a stronger sensitivity to cueing than AD, suggesting that memory disorders in these patients are due to a difficulty in spontaneously implementing efficient retrieval strategies. However, we found a lower ISC in the delayed recall compared to the immediate trials in VaD than FTD due to a higher forgetting in VaD.
27671197	Toward sensitive immuno-based detection of tau protein by surface plasmon resonance coupled to carbon nanostructures as signal amplifiers.	Interest on Tau protein is fast increasing in Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis. There is the urgent need of highly sensitive and specific diagnostic platforms for its quantification, also in combination with the other AD hallmarks. Up to now, SPR has been poorly exploited for tau detection by immunosensing, due to sensitivity limits at nanomolar level, whereas the clinical requirement is in the picomolar range. Molecular architectures built in a layer-by-layer fashion, biomolecules and nanostructures (metallic or not) may amplify the SPR signal and improve the limit of detection to the desired sensitivity. Mostly gold nanostructures are widely employed to this aim, but great interest is also emerging in Multi Walled Carbon Nanotubes (MWCNTs). Here MWCNTs are modified and then decorated with the secondary antibody for tau protein. Eventually we took advantage from MWCNTs-antibody conjugate to obtain a sandwich-based bioassay with the capability to increase the SPR signal of about 102 folds compared to direct detection and conventional unconjugated sandwich. With respect to these results, we hope to give a strong impulse for further investigation on studying possible roles of carbon nanotubes in optical-based biosensing.
27665848	Inhibition of tissue transglutaminase promotes Abeta-induced apoptosis in SH-SY5Y cells.	AIM: Tissue transglutaminase (tTG) catalyzes proteins, including beta-amyloid (Abeta), to cross-link as a gamma-glutamyl-epsilon-lysine structure isopeptide, which is highly resistant to proteolysis. Thus, tTG plays an important role in protein accumulation in Alzheimer's disease (AD). In the present study, we examined the effect of an irreversible tTG inhibitor, NTU283, on Abeta mimic-induced AD pathogenesis in SH-SY5Y cells. METHODS: Western blot and in-cell Western analyses were used to detect tTG and isopeptide (representing the enzyme activity of tTG) protein levels. Moreover, Hoechst and PI co-staining was performed, and caspase-3 and caspase-7 activities and the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio were determined to evaluate the effects of NTU283 on apoptosis. RESULTS: The results confirmed that tTG activity was inhibited by NTU283 20-500 mumol/L in a concentration-dependent manner in SH-SY5Y cells. Contrary to our expectations, however, the isopeptide bonds were increased when cells were co-treated with Abeta and NTU283. In addition, NTU283 alone did not induce apoptosis in SH-SY5Y cells. However, when co-applied with Abeta, NTU283 promoted rather than inhibited Abeta-induced apoptosis. Consistent with the apoptotic rate, pretreating cells with different concentrations of NTU283 and Abeta significantly increased the activities of caspase-3 and caspase-7 as well as the ratio of Bax/Bcl-2. CONCLUSION: Irreversible inhibition of tTG activity did not block but rather promoted Abeta-induced apoptosis, which indicated that tTG has complex functions in AD pathogenesis.
27665668	Clinical Utility of the Envelope Task in Mild Cognitive Impairment and Dementia.	OBJECTIVE: Prospective memory (PM) is a cognitive function defined as the ability to perform an intention at an appropriate moment in the future. In the aging population, PM is essential for maintaining independent daily living. Introduced as a simple and quick way to assess PM in clinical settings, the envelope task has to date received very limited empirical and practical interest. METHODS: The present study investigated the task's clinical utility in detecting PM impairment in a sample composed of 49 healthy older adults (OA), 41 patients with Alzheimer's disease, and 64 individuals with amnestic and nonamnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) of heterogeneous etiology: 17 of idiopathic nature, 20 presenting an idiopathic rapid-eye movement sleep behaviour disorder, and 27 patients diagnosed with idiopathic Parkinson's disease. RESULTS: The envelope task was highly sensitive and specific in discriminating Alzheimer's disease patients from OA. Although it was specific in distinguishing MCI individuals from OA, its sensitivity was modest, especially in patients presenting a nonamnestic MCI subtype. CONCLUSIONS: Given its high specificity and simple low-cost administration procedure, the envelope task is a promising instrument for clinicians who seek to rapidly assess PM impairment in their daily practice.
27664362	[Announcement of the death of a loved one to a geriatric inpatient].	A geriatric inpatient may learn of the death of a loved one. The medical team must assess what is the kindest way to announce it to the patient who is already fragile. It will address the patient's relationship with the loved one, the right to information, and the position of the family. Accompanying the patient through this ordeal is also important. This delicate issue needs the reflection of the team.
27664360	[Serious game, a link between institution and home].	Serious game is a personal innovative technology to facilitate learning and social interaction. It can be used in a patient's home or in an institution. This training tool can also be developed for health professionals, especially accommodation facilities for the elderly. The objective is to integrate knowledge and know-how.
27664357	[Robotics and improvement of the quality of geriatric care].	New technologies offer innovations to improve the care of the elderly with Alzheimer's or and other forms of dementia. Robots, endowed with features such as monitoring of physiological parameters, cognitive training or occupational therapy, have appeared. They are not, however, intended to replace humans. Still underutilized, these robots are in development, much like the digital literacy of the elderly.
27660215	Multitasking Microglia and Alzheimer's Disease: Diversity, Tools and Therapeutic Targets.	Given the importance of microglia to inflammatory, phagocytic and synaptic modulatory processes, their function is vital in physiological and pathological brain. The impairment of microglia in Alzheimer's disease has been demonstrated on genetic, epigenetic, transcriptional and functional levels using unbiased systems level approaches. Recent studies have highlighted the immense phenotypic diversity of microglia, including the ability to adopt distinct and dynamic phenotypes in ageing and disease. We review the origins and functions of healthy microglia and the established and emerging models and techniques available for their study. Furthermore, we highlight recent advances on the role, heterogeneity and dysfunction of microglia in Alzheimer's disease and discuss the potential for therapeutic interventions targeting microglia. Microglia-selective molecular fingerprints will guide detailed functional analysis of microglial subsets and may aid in the development of therapies specifically targeting microglia.
27660144	Pharmacokinetic Evaluation of the Tau PET Radiotracer 18F-T807 (18F-AV-1451) in Human Subjects.	18F-T807 is a PET radiotracer developed for imaging tau protein aggregates, which are implicated in neurologic disorders including Alzheimer disease and traumatic brain injury (TBI). The current study characterizes 18F-T807 pharmacokinetics in human subjects using dynamic PET imaging and metabolite-corrected arterial input functions. Methods: Nine subjects (4 controls, 3 with a history of TBI, 2 with mild cognitive impairment due to suspected Alzheimer disease) underwent dynamic PET imaging for up to 120 min after bolus injection of 18F-T807 with arterial blood sampling. Total volume of distribution (VT) was estimated using compartmental modeling (1- and 2-tissue configurations) and graphical analysis techniques (Logan and multilinear analysis 1 [MA1] regression methods). Reference region-based methods of quantification were explored including Logan distribution volume ratio (DVR) and static SUV ratio (SUVR) using the cerebellum as a reference tissue. Results: The percentage of unmetabolized 18F-T807 in plasma followed a single exponential with a half-life of 17.0 +/- 4.2 min. Metabolite-corrected plasma radioactivity concentration fit a biexponential (half-lives, 18.1 +/- 5.8 and 2.4 +/- 0.5 min). 18F-T807 in gray matter peaked quickly (SUV > 2 at approximately 5 min). Compartmental modeling resulted in good fits, and the 2-tissue model with estimated blood volume correction (2Tv) performed best, particularly in regions with elevated binding. VT was greater in mild cognitive impairment subjects than controls in the occipital, parietal, and temporal cortices as well as the posterior cingulate gyrus, precuneus, and mesial temporal cortex. High focal uptake was found in the posterior corpus callosum of a TBI subject. Plots from Logan and MA1 graphical methods became linear by 30 min, yielding regional estimates of VT in excellent agreement with compartmental analysis and providing high-quality parametric maps when applied in voxelwise fashion. Reference region-based approaches including Logan DVR (t* = 55 min) and SUVR (80- to 100-min interval) were highly correlated with DVR estimated using 2Tv (R2 = 0.97, P < 0.0001). Conclusion:18F-T807 showed rapid clearance from plasma and properties suitable for tau quantification with PET. Furthermore, simplified approaches using DVR (t* = 55 min) and static SUVR (80-100 min) with cerebellar reference tissue were found to correlate highly with compartmental modeling outcomes.
27655307	Knowledge and pharmacological management of Alzheimer's disease by managing community pharmacists: a nationwide study.	Background Managing community pharmacists can play a leading role in supporting community dwelling individuals with Alzheimer's disease and their caregivers. Objective The main purpose of this study was to assess knowledge of managing community pharmacists towards Alzheimer's disease and its pharmacological management. Setting Community pharmacies in the Maltese islands. Method A nationwide survey was conducted with full-time managing community pharmacists in possession of a tertiary education degree in pharmacy studies. The level of knowledge was investigated using the Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Scale and the Alzheimer's Disease Pharmacotherapy Measure. Participants were also asked to rate a number of statements related to disease management. Results Maltese managing community pharmacists (57 % response rate) had inadequate knowledge on risk factors, caregiving issues and pharmacological management of Alzheimer's disease. Age and number of years working in a community pharmacy setting were found to be negatively correlated with increased knowledge. Conclusion The findings highlight the need of providing training and continued educational support to managing community pharmacists in order to provide quality advice to individuals with dementia and their caregivers in the community.
27655157	Cognitive profiles in degenerative dementia without evidence of small vessel pathology and small vessel vascular dementia.	Although a large number of studies have examined possible differences in cognitive performance between Alzheimer's disease (AD) and vascular dementia (VaD), the data in the literature are conflicting. The aims of this study were to analyze the neuropsychological pattern of subjects affected by degenerative dementia without evidence of small vessel pathology (DD) and small vessel VaD subjects in the early stages and to investigate differences in the progression of cognitive impairment. Seventy-five patients with probable VaD and 75 patients with probable DD were included. All the subjects underwent a standard neuropsychological evaluation, including the following test: Visual Search, Attentional matrices, Story Recall, Raven's Coloured Progressive Matrices, Phonological and Semantic Verbal Fluency, Token, and Copying Drawings. The severity of cognitive impairment was stratified according to the MMSE score. Fifteen subjects with probable DD and 10 subjects with probable VaD underwent a 12-month cognitive re-evaluation. No significant difference was found between DD and VaD subjects in any of the neuropsychological tests except Story Recall in the mild cognitive impairment (P < 0.001). The re-test value was significantly worse than the baseline value in the MMSE (P = 0.037), Corsi (P = 0.041), Story Recall (P = 0.032), Phonological Verbal Fluency (P = 0.02), and Copying Drawings (P = 0.043) in DD patients and in the Visual Search test (P = 0.036) in VaD subjects. These results suggest that a neuropsychological evaluation might help to differentiate degenerative dementia without evidence of small vessel pathology from small vessel VaD in the early stages of these diseases.
27650786	Chemical composition and biological activities of extracts and essential oil of Boswellia dalzielii leaves.	CONTEXT: Boswellia dalzielii Hutch. (Burseraceae) is an aromatic plant. The leaves are used for beverage flavouring. OBJECTIVE: This study investigates the chemical composition and biological activities of various extracts. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The essential oil was prepared via hydrodistillation. Identification and quantification were realized via GC-MS and GC-FID. Consecutive extractions (cyclohexane, dichloromethane, ethyl acetate and methanol) were carried out and various chemical groups (phenolics, flavonoids, tannins, antocyanins and sugar) were quantified. The volatile compounds of organic extracts were identified before and after derivatization. Antioxidant, antihyperuricemia, anti-Alzheimer, anti-inflammatory and anticancer activities were evaluated. RESULTS: In the essential oil, 50 compounds were identified, including 3-carene (27.72%) and alpha-pinene (15.18%). 2,5-Dihydroxy acetophenone and beta-d-xylopyranose were identified in the methanol extract. Higher phenolic (315.97 g GAE/kg dry mass) and flavonoid (37.19 g QE/kg dry mass) contents were observed in the methanol extract. The methanol extract has presented remarkable IC50 = 6.10 mg/L for antiDPPH, 35.10 mg/L for antixanthine oxidase and 28.01 mg/L for anti-5-lipoxygenase. For acetylcholinesterase inhibition, the best IC50 (76.20 and 67.10 mg/L) were observed, respectively, with an ethyl acetate extract and the essential oil. At 50 mg/L, the dichloromethane extract inhibited OVCAR-3 cell lines by 65.10%, while cyclohexane extract inhibited IGROV-1 cell lines by 92.60%. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Biological activities were fully correlated with the chemical groups of the extracts. The ethyl acetate and methanol extracts could be considered as potential alternatives for use in dietary supplements for the prevention or treatment of diseases because of these extracts natural antioxidant, antihyperuricemic and anti-inflammatory activities.
27650313	The NLRP3 inflammasome in pathogenic particle and fibre-associated lung inflammation and diseases.	The concept of the inflammasome, a macromolecular complex sensing cell stress or danger signals and initiating inflammation, was first introduced approximately a decade ago. Priming and activation of these intracellular protein platforms trigger the maturation of pro-inflammatory chemokines and cytokines, most notably, interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) and IL-18, to promulgate innate immune defenses. Although classically studied in models of gout, Type II diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, and multiple sclerosis, the importance and mechanisms of action of inflammasome priming and activation have recently been elucidated in cells of the respiratory tract where they modulate the responses to a number of inhaled pathogenic particles and fibres. Most notably, inflammasome activation appears to regulate the balance between tissue repair and inflammation after inhalation of pathogenic pollutants such as asbestos, crystalline silica (CS), and airborne particulate matter (PM). Different types of fibres and particles may have distinct mechanisms of inflammasome interaction and outcome. This review summarizes the structure and function of inflammasomes, the interplay between various chemokines and cytokines and cell types of the lung and pleura after inflammasome activation, and the events leading to the development of non-malignant (allergic airway disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asbestosis, silicosis) and malignant (mesothelioma, lung cancer) diseases by pathogenic particulates. In addition, it emphasizes the importance of communication between cells of the immune system, target cells of these diseases, and components of the extracellular matrix (ECM) in regulation of inflammasome-mediated events.
27647307	The Complex Role of Apolipoprotein E in Alzheimer's Disease: an Overview and Update.	Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) plays a crucial role in the homeostatic control of lipids in both the periphery and the central nervous system (CNS). In humans, ApoE exists in three different isoforms: epsilon2, epsilon3 and epsilon4. ApoE epsilon3 is the most common isoform, while the epsilon4 isoform confers the greatest genetic risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the mechanisms underlying how ApoE contributes to the pathogenesis of AD are still debated. ApoE has been shown to impact amyloid beta (Abeta) deposition and clearance in the brain. ApoE also has Abeta-independent pathways in AD, which has led to the discovery of new roles of ApoE ranging from mitochondria dysfunction to, most recently, iron metabolism. Here, we review the role of ApoE in health and in AD, with the view of identifying therapeutic approaches that could prevent the risk associated with the epsilon4 isoform.
27646012	The Paired Associates Learning (PAL) Test: 30 Years of CANTAB Translational Neuroscience from Laboratory to Bedside in Dementia Research.	The origins and rationale of the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) as a cross-species translational instrument suitable for use in human neuropsychopharmacological studies are reviewed. We focus on its use for the early assessment and detection of Alzheimer's disease, in particular the Paired Associates Learning (PAL) test. We consider its psychometric properties, neural validation, and utility, including studies on large samples of healthy volunteers, patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and Alzheimer's disease. We demonstrate how it can be applied in cross-species studies using experimental animals to bridge the cross-species translational 'gap'. We also show how the CANTAB PAL has bridged a second translational 'gap' through its application to the early detection of memory problems in primary care clinics, using iPad technology.
27645761	Neurologic Complications of Unprotected Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (from the Neuro-TAVI Trial).	Cerebral embolization during transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) can lead to a spectrum of clinically relevant manifestations, ranging from overt stroke to mild neurologic or cognitive deficits and subclinical cerebral infarcts. This study sought to determine the frequency of neurologic injury, cerebral ischemic lesions, and cognitive dysfunction in subjects undergoing contemporary commercial TAVI in the United States. Neuro-TAVR is the first prospective, multicenter study to use serial systematic neurologic and cognitive assessments and diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (at 4 +/- 2 days after procedure) to investigate the incidence and severity of neurologic injury after contemporary unprotected TAVI in the United States. A total of 44 consecutive patients underwent TAVI at 5 US sites. Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging lesions were detected in 94%, with a mean of 10.4 +/- 15.3 lesions per subject and a median total lesion volume of 295 mm3 (interquartile range 71.6 to 799.6 mm3). New neurologic impairment (worsening in National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score from baseline with new cerebral lesions) occurred in 22.6% (7 of 31) of subjects at discharge and 14.8% (4 of 27) at 30 days. In addition, cognitive decrements from baseline were identified by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment in 33% (12 of 36) of subjects at discharge and 41% (13 of 32) at 30 days. In conclusion, this contemporary cohort of US patients confirms that TAVI results in cerebral infarction in most patients and that 1 in 5 patients have measurable neurologic impairment and 1 in 3 patients have decrease in cognitive measures by Montreal Cognitive Assessment score after TAVI, reinforcing the need for methods to mitigate the risk of brain injury during TAVI.
27640605	Microbleeds in Alzheimer's Disease: A Neuropsychological Overview and Meta-Analysis.	The current literature on the role of brain microbleeds (MB) on the neuropsychological outcomes of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is heterogeneous. We therefore meta-analytically examined the neuropsychological literature pertaining to MBs in AD. Using a priori selected criteria, studies with cross-sectional neuropsychological assessment on MBs and AD were reviewed. Six of 122 studies met selection criteria and provided neuropsychological data on either AD with MB and without MB, or in contrast to healthy controls. The global neuropsychological difference between AD with MB and AD without MB based on random effect model was nonsignificant, heterogeneous, and small (Effect Size =-0.155; 95% confidence interval =-0.465 to 0.155; p value =0.326; Heterogenity: Q-value =12.744; degrees of freedom =5; p =0.026; I2 =61%). The contribution of MBs to cognitive deficits in AD remains unclear. Future studies of MB in AD should strive to use standardized neuroimaging techniques with high sensitivity for MB, a common standard for MB definition, and neuropsychological tests sensitive for detecting subtle cognitive impairment.
27639367	2-Arylbenzothiazoles labeled with [CpRe/99mTc(CO)3] and evaluated as beta-amyloid imaging probes.	An array of complexes, 99mTc/Re-labeled cyclopentadienyl tricarbonyl and 2-phenyl/pyridylbenzothiazoles, conjugated through an ester linkage were tested as potential beta-amyloid (Abeta) probes for SPECT imaging. The [CpRe/99mTc(CO)3] complexes were prepared by double ligand transfer reactions from ferrocene precursors, and the X-ray structure of one rhenium surrogate revealed a classical "piano stool" like geometry. Several of the rhenium complexes displayed high affinity for Abeta1-42 aggregates in in vitro inhibition assays, and they could intensely stain Abeta deposits on brain sections from transgenic mice and Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. Complex [99mTc]4h strongly binds to Abeta deposits in blood vessels of the brain section of AD patients in in vitro autoradiography. Biodistribution experiments in normal mice revealed that 99mTc-labeled tracers exhibited moderate degree of initial brain uptake (0.54%-1.06% ID/g at 2 min). These tracers targeting Abeta plaques of AD patients warrant further structure optimization to improve their ability to penetrate blood-brain barrier, moreover, they may be suitable for developing imaging probes for targeting amyloid aggregates outside of the brain.
27637956	Dementias.	This chapter will focus on the descriptive, analytic, and intervention-oriented epidemiology of dementia and its most frequent etiologic type due to Alzheimer's disease. The chapter opens with a brief presentation of the concept of dementia, followed by the presentation of dementia of the Alzheimer type (DAT), including natural history, clinical manifestation, neuropathology, medical prognosis, and management. Further, the chapter presents the prevalence and incidence of dementia, with special consideration of secular trends in prevalence and incidence of DAT, and prognosis of the socioeconomic impact of dementia. Thereafter the main risk factors for DAT are covered. The chapter also addresses the results of ongoing therapeutic and preventive intervention trials for DAT. Finally, the future challenges of the epidemiology of dementia with a focus on the impact of the new diagnostic criteria for neurocognitive disorders, as well as the development of biomarkers for DAT and other types of dementia, will be briefly discussed.
27637954	Use of "omics" technologies to dissect neurologic disease.	Over the past 5 years, the advent of massively parallel technologies for understanding disease at the molecular level accompanied by simultaneous rapid development of the computational tools needed to analyze and filter such data has revolutionized medical science. These "next-generation" "omics" technologies include next-generation sequencing technology for detection of disease-associated DNA sequence variants, RNA sequencing for transcriptome and noncoding RNA analysis, quantitative detection of epigenomic dynamics, and chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing analysis for DNA-protein interactions, interactome analysis for networks formed by protein-protein interactions, and metabolome analysis for metabolic systems. The analysis and integration of data derived from massively parallel technologies will significantly deepen our understanding of human disease, will inform functional studies, in vitro and in vivo model generation, and will advance the development of improved, personalized diagnostic tools and more effective therapeutic targets. In this chapter we review the classic genomic approaches for identifying mechanisms underlying human disease, and summarize the emerging "omics" technologies allowing massively parallel interrogation of biologic systems.
27637601	Translational Assays for Assessment of Cognition in Rodent Models of Alzheimer's Disease and Dementia.	Cognitive dysfunction appears as a core feature of dementia, which includes its most prevalent form, Alzheimer's disease (AD), as well as vascular dementia, frontotemporal dementia, and other brain disorders. AD alone affects more than 45 million people worldwide, with growing prevalence in aging populations. There is no cure, and therapeutic options remain limited. Gene-edited and transgenic animal models, expressing disease-specific gene mutations, illuminate pathogenic mechanisms leading to cognitive decline in AD and other forms of dementia. To date, cognitive tests in AD mouse models have not been directly relevant to the clinical presentation of AD, providing challenges for translation of findings to the clinic. Touchscreen testing in mice has enabled the assessment of specific cognitive domains in mice that are directly relevant to impairments described in human AD patients. In this review, we provide context for how cognitive decline is measured in the clinic, describe traditional methods for assessing cognition in mice, and outline novel approaches, including the use of the touchscreen platform for cognitive testing. We highlight the limitations of traditional memory-testing paradigms in mice, particularly their capacity for direct translation into cognitive testing of patients. While it is not possible to expect direct translation in testing methodologies, we can aim to develop tests that engage similar neural substrates in both humans and mice. Ultimately, that would enable us to better predict efficacy across species and therefore improve the chances that a treatment that works in mice will also work in the clinic.
27637430	Clinical impact and diagnostic accuracy of 2-[18F]-fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose positron-emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) brain imaging in patients with cognitive impairment: a tertiary centre experience in the UK.	AIM: To evaluate the clinical impact of combined 2-[18F]-fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose (FDG) positron-emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) brain imaging performed in selected patients with cognitive impairment at a tertiary referral centre in the UK, and to assess the accuracy of FDG PET/CT to correctly establish the diagnosis of Alzheimer's dementia (AD) in "real-world" clinical practice. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Using an institutional radiology database, 136 patients were identified for inclusion in the study. FDG PET/CT was performed using a standard technique and interpreted by dual-trained radiologists and nuclear medicine physicians. Standardised questionnaires were sent to the referring clinicians to establish the final clinical diagnosis and to obtain information about the clinical impact of FDG PET/CT. RESULTS: There was a 72% questionnaire return (98/136), with mean patient follow-up of 471 (standard deviation 205) days. FDG PET/CT had an impact on patient management in 81%, adding confidence to the pre-test diagnosis in 43%, changing the pre-test diagnosis in 35%, reducing the need for further investigations in 42%, and resulting in a change in therapy in 32%. There was substantial correlation between the PET/CT diagnosis and final clinical diagnosis with a correlation (k) coefficient of 0.78 (p<0.0001). The accuracy of FDG PET/CT in diagnosis of AD was 94% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 87-99), with a sensitivity of 87% (95% CI: 75-92) and a specificity of 97% (95% CI: 87-99). CONCLUSION: FDG PET/CT brain imaging has a significant clinical impact when performed selectively in patients with cognitive impairment and shows high accuracy in the diagnosis of AD in "real-world" clinical practice.
27637402	Repetitive Head Impacts and Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy.	Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a distinctive neurodegenerative disease that occurs as a result of repetitive head impacts. CTE can only be diagnosed by postmortem neuropathologic examination of brain tissue. CTE is a unique disorder with a pathognomonic lesion that can be reliably distinguished from other neurodegenerative diseases. CTE is associated with violent behaviors, explosivity, loss of control, depression, suicide, memory loss and cognitive changes. There is increasing evidence that CTE affects amateur athletes as well as professional athletes and military veterans. CTE has become a major public health concern.
27634418	Patient with rapidly evolving neurological disease with neuropathological lesions of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, Lewy body dementia, chronic subcortical vascular encephalopathy and meningothelial meningioma.	We report a case of rapidly evolving neurological disease in a patient with neuropathological lesions of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), Lewy body dementia (LBD), chronic subcortical vascular encephalopathy and meningothelial meningioma. The coexistence of severe multiple pathologies in a single patient strengthens the need to perform accurate clinical differential diagnoses in rapidly progressive dementias.
27633250	Positron emission tomography measurement of brain MAO-B inhibition in patients with Alzheimer's disease and elderly controls after oral administration of sembragiline.	PURPOSE: In Alzheimer's disease (AD), increased metabolism of monoamines by monoamine oxidase type B (MAO-B) leads to the production of toxic reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are thought to contribute to disease pathogenesis. Inhibition of the MAO-B enzyme may restore brain levels of monoaminergic neurotransmitters, reduce the formation of toxic ROS and reduce neuroinflammation (reactive astrocytosis), potentially leading to neuroprotection. Sembragiline (also referred as RO4602522, RG1577 and EVT 302 in previous communications) is a potent, selective and reversible inhibitor of MAO-B developed as a potential treatment for AD. METHODS: This study assessed the relationship between plasma concentration of sembragiline and brain MAO-B inhibition in patients with AD and in healthy elderly control (EC) subjects. Positron emission tomography (PET) scans using [11C]-L-deprenyl-D2 radiotracer were performed in ten patients with AD and six EC subjects, who received sembragiline each day for 6-15 days. RESULTS: At steady state, the relationship between sembragiline plasma concentration and MAO-B inhibition resulted in an Emax of approximately 80-90 % across brain regions of interest and in an EC50 of 1-2 ng/mL. Data in patients with AD and EC subjects showed that near-maximal inhibition of brain MAO-B was achieved with 1 mg sembragiline daily, regardless of the population, whereas lower doses resulted in lower and variable brain MAO-B inhibition. CONCLUSIONS: This PET study confirmed that daily treatment of at least 1 mg sembragiline resulted in near-maximal inhibition of brain MAO-B enzyme in patients with AD.
27631311	"Experience Keeps a Dear School": the Effects of Ethnicity and Caregiving Experience on Hiring a Healthcare Advocate.	In the present study, ethnic differences in evaluating the severity and associated needs of medical complications experienced by an elderly man and the likelihood of seeking professional assistance (i.e., hire a healthcare advocate [HCA]) to care for him, and for one's own family or parent should they become ill, as a function of previous caregiving experience, were investigated. The 974 participants were White, Black, Hispanic, or Asian/Pacific Islander. They read a hypothetical vignette about a 75-year-old man, Daryl, who was experiencing health problems. Participants were instructed to imagine that they were James, Daryl's son, and asked to indicate how severe his condition(s) were, how much medical assistance he would require, and how likely they would be to hire an HCA to assist him. They were also asked to report whether they previously had assisted a parent with activities of daily living (Assistance) and whether they would be likely to hire an HCA in the future if 1) a family member or 2) a parent, specifically, became ill. Two, 2 (Assistance) x 4 (Ethnicity) multivariate analyses of covariance (MANCOVA) were performed to assess differential responses among individuals of different ethnicities as a function of previous caregiver experience. A priori interaction contrasts were examined to determine whether Black, Hispanic, or Asian/Pacific Islander participants differed on the outcomes from White participants as a function of previous caregiver experience. There were no significant differences between Black or Asian/Pacific Islander and White participants, but Hispanic participants assigned significantly higher severity and need for medical assistance ratings and were significantly more likely to indicate that they would seek assistance from an HCA with respect to the vignette and for their own parents in the future if they had provided caregiving to a parent in the past, whereas White participants were less likely to seek assistance from an HCA if they had provided caregiving in the past to a parent. Although ethnic differences in evaluations of Daryl's condition and in the reported likelihoods of hiring an HCA in various contexts as a function of previous caregiving experience were limited, there are important inter-cultural differences to recognize. It may be important in future research to assess ethnic differences in the expectations and experiences of caregiving.
27631200	Is cerebral glucose metabolism related to blood-brain barrier dysfunction and intrathecal IgG synthesis in Alzheimer disease?: A 18F-FDG PET/CT study.	The aim of this study was to investigate the relationships between blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction, intrathecal IgG synthesis, and brain glucose consumption as detectable by means of serum/cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) albumin index (Qalb) and IgG index [(CSF IgG/serum IgG) x Serum albumin/CSF albumin)] and 2-deoxy-2-(F) fluoro-D-glucose (F-FDG) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) in a selected population affected by Alzheimer disease (AD). The study included 134 newly diagnosed AD patients according to the NINCDS-ADRDA criteria. The mean (+/-SD) age of the patients was 70 (+/-6) years; 60 were male and 64 were female. Mini mental State Examination was equal to 18.9 (+/-7.2). All patients underwent a CSF assay and magnetic resonance before F-FDG PET scanning. The relationships were evaluated by means of statistical parametric mapping (SPM8). We found a significant negative correlation between the increase of Qalb and F-FDG uptake in the Brodmann Area 42 and 22 that corresponds to the left superior temporal gyrus, with higher Qalb values being related to a reduced glucose consumption in these areas. No significant relationships have been found between brain glucose consumption and IgG index. The results of our study suggest that BBB dysfunction is related to reduction of cortical activity in the left temporal cortex in AD subjects.
27629855	The Role of Mast Cells in Alzheimer's Disease.	Immunity and inflammation are deeply involved in Alzheimer's disease. The most important properties of pathological Alzheimer's disease are the extracellular deposits of amyloid a-protein plaque aggregates along with other unknown mutated proteins, which are implicated in immunity and inflammation. Mast cells are found in the brain of all mammalian species and in the periphery, and their biological mediators, including cytokines/chemokines, arachidonic acid products and stored enzymes, play an import role in Alzheimer's disease. Cytokines/chemokines, which are generated mostly by microglia and astrocytes in Alzheimer's disease, contribute to nearly every aspect of neuroinflammation and amyloid a-protein plaque aggregates may induce in mast cells the release of a plethora of mediators, including pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines such as interleukin-1, interleukin-6, interleukin-8, interleukin-10, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, vascular endothelial growth factor, transforming growth factor beta, CXCL8 and CCL2-3-4. These proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines are prominent mediators of neuroinflammation in brain disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, and their inhibition may be associated with improved recovery. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge regarding the roles of mast cell mediators (stored and de novo synthesis) in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.
27629562	Interactions Between alpha-Synuclein and Tau Protein: Implications to Neurodegenerative Disorders.	Tau and alpha-Synuclein (alpha-Syn) are abundant brain proteins with distinct biological functions. Findings suggest that interactions between alpha-Syn and tau at the cellular level cause disruption of cytoskeletal organization, axonal transport defects, and aberrant synaptic organization. The ability of tau and alpha-Syn to affect each other directly or indirectly might contribute to the overlap in the clinical and pathological features of tauopathies and synucleinopathies. The interactions between alpha-Syn and tau, and the underlying molecular pathogenic mechanisms, including induction and spread of protein aggregates, still deserve further investigation.
27628699	People with dyslexia and heart, chest, skin, digestive, musculoskeletal, vision, learning, speech and mental disorders were more dissatisfied with neighbourhoods: Scottish Household Survey, 2007-2008.	Rarely do we know the perception toward neighbourhoods in people specifically with health conditions. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to understand the perception toward neighbourhoods among adults with a series of the existing health conditions in a country-wide and population-based setting. Data were retrieved from and analysed in Scottish Household Survey, 2007-2008. Information on demographics, self-reported health conditions and perception toward neighbourhoods and the surrounding facilities was obtained by household interview. Analysis including chi-square test, t test and logistic regression modelling were performed. Of 19,150 Scottish adults (aged 16-80) included in the study cohort, 1079 (7.7 %) people were dissatisfied with their living areas; particularly for those who experienced harassment (15.4 %), did not recycle or with dyslexia, chest, digestive, mental and musculoskeletal problems. Twenty to forty per cent reported common neighbourhood problems including noise, rubbish, disputes, graffiti, harassment and drug misuse. People with heart or digestive problems were more dissatisfied with the existing parks and open space. People with arthritis, chest or hearing problems were more dissatisfied with the waste management condition. People with dyslexia were more dissatisfied with the existing public transportation. People with heart problems were more dissatisfied with the current street cleaning condition. People with hearing, vision, speech, learning problems or dyslexia were also more dissatisfied with sports and recreational facilities. People with heart, chest, skin, digestive, musculoskeletal, vision, learning, speech and mental disorders and dyslexia were more dissatisfied with their current neighbourhood environments. Upgrading neighbourhood planning to tackle social environment injustice and put pleasant life experience as priorty would be suggested. Graphical abstract interrelations of individual health and neighbourhood health.
27624723	The Italian dementia with Lewy bodies study group (DLB-SINdem): toward a standardization of clinical procedures and multicenter cohort studies design.	Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) causes elevated outlays for the National Health Systems due to high institutionalization rate and patients' reduced quality of life and high mortality. Furthermore, DLB is often misdiagnosed as Alzheimer's disease. These data motivate harmonized multicenter longitudinal cohort studies to improve clinical management and therapy monitoring. The Italian DLB study group of the Italian Neurological Society for dementia (SINdem) developed and emailed a semi-structured questionnaire to 572 national dementia centers (from primary to tertiary) to prepare an Italian large longitudinal cohort. The questionnaire surveyed: (1) prevalence and incidence of DLB; (2) clinical assessment; (3) relevance and availability of diagnostic tools; (4) pharmacological management of cognitive, motor, and behavioural disturbances; (5) causes of hospitalization, with specific focus on delirium and its treatment. Overall, 135 centers (23.6 %) contributed to the survey. Overall, 5624 patients with DLB are currently followed by the 135 centers in a year (2042 of them are new patients). The percentage of DLB patients was lower (27 +/- 8 %) than that of Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal dementia (56 +/- 27 %) patients. The majority of the centers (91 %) considered the clinical and neuropsychological assessments as the most relevant procedure for a DLB diagnosis. Nonetheless, most of the centers has availability of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI; 95 %), electroencephalography (EEG; 93 %), and FP-CIT single photon emission-computerized tomography (SPECT; 75 %) scan for clinical applications. It will be, therefore, possible to recruit a large harmonized Italian cohort of DLB patients for future cross-sectional and longitudinal multicenter studies.
27622604	The effect of schooling on reported age of onset of cognitive decline: A collaborative study.	Higher education has been reported to be a protective factor against dementia. We suggest that the strength of a risk factor may be measured by the length of time by which it delays disease onset; therefore, we examined whether people with lower education develop cognitive decline at an earlier age than people with more schooling. The study population was based on patients referred to our Memory Clinics from 1994 to 2004. Analysis of covariance was used to evaluate the effect of schooling on the reported age of memory decline, in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and in patients diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease (AD). The mean reported age of onset of cognitive decline was unexpectedly lower in patients with higher education than in patients with fewer schooling years, with a relatively small effect size (beta=-0.6), and the effect was more marked in the MCI group. Every year of schooling advanced the reported age of onset by 6months among patients with MCI (t=-6.18, p<.001) and by 3months among patients with AD (t=-2.4, p=0.017). Education may affect the reported age of onset of cognitive decline, but its magnitude is small. It is possible that increased awareness in more educated people leads them to consult earlier; this could explain the paradoxical finding of earlier reported age of onset of cognitive decline in patients with higher education.
27618008	Physiological and Pathogenic Roles of Prolyl Isomerase Pin1 in Metabolic Regulations via Multiple Signal Transduction Pathway Modulations.	Prolyl isomerases are divided into three groups, the FKBP family, Cyclophilin and the Parvulin family (Pin1 and Par14). Among these isomerases, Pin1 is a unique prolyl isomerase binding to the motif including pSer/pThr-Pro that is phosphorylated by kinases. Once bound, Pin1 modulates the enzymatic activity, protein stability or subcellular localization of target proteins by changing the cis- and trans-formations of proline. Several studies have examined the roles of Pin1 in the pathogenesis of cancers and Alzheimer's disease. On the other hand, recent studies have newly demonstrated Pin1 to be involved in regulating glucose and lipid metabolism. Interestingly, while Pin1 expression is markedly increased by high-fat diet feeding, Pin1 KO mice are resistant to diet-induced obesity, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis and diabetic vascular dysfunction. These phenomena result from the binding of Pin1 to several key factors regulating metabolic functions, which include insulin receptor substrate-1, AMPK, Crtc2 and NF-kappaB p65. In this review, we focus on recent advances in elucidating the physiological roles of Pin1 as well as the pathogenesis of disorders involving this isomerase, from the viewpoint of the relationships between signal transductions and metabolic functions.
27617996	LC-MS Supported Studies on the in Vitro Metabolism of both Enantiomers of Flubatine and the in Vivo Metabolism of (+)-[(18)F]Flubatine-A Positron Emission Tomography Radioligand for Imaging alpha4beta2 Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptors.	Both enantiomers of [(18)F]flubatine are promising radioligands for neuroimaging of alpha4beta2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) by positron emission tomography (PET). To support clinical studies in patients with early Alzheimer's disease, a detailed examination of the metabolism in vitro and in vivo has been performed. (+)- and (-)-flubatine, respectively, were incubated with liver microsomes from mouse and human in the presence of NADPH (beta-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide 2'-phosphate reduced tetrasodium salt). Phase I in vitro metabolites were detected and their structures elucidated by LC-MS/MS (liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry). Selected metabolite candidates were synthesized and investigated for structural confirmation. Besides a high level of in vitro stability, the microsomal incubations revealed some species differences as well as enantiomer discrimination with regard to the formation of monohydroxylated products, which was identified as the main metabolic pathway in this assay. Furthermore, after injection of 250 MBq (+)-[(18)F]flubatine (specific activity > 350 GBq/mumol) into mouse, samples were prepared from brain, liver, plasma, and urine after 30 min and investigated by radio-HPLC (high performance liquid chromatography with radioactivity detection). For structure elucidation of the radiometabolites of (+)-[(18)F]flubatine formed in vivo, identical chromatographic conditions were applied to LC-MS/MS and radio-HPLC to compare samples obtained in vitro and in vivo. By this correlation approach, we assigned three of four main in vivo radiometabolites to products that are exclusively C- or N-hydroxylated at the azabicyclic ring system of the parent molecule.
27616286	Towards timely Alzheimer diagnosis: A self-powered amperometric biosensor for the neurotransmitter acetylcholine.	Serious brain disorders, such as the Alzheimer's Disease (AD), are associated with a marked drop in the levels of important neurotransmitters, such as acetylcholine (ACh). Real time monitoring of such biomarkers can therefore play a critical role in enhancing AD therapies by allowing timely diagnosis, verifications of treatment effectiveness, and developments of new medicines. In this study, we present the first acetylcholine/oxygen hybrid enzymatic fuel cell for the self-powered on site detection of ACh in plasma, which is based on the combination of an enzymatic anode with a Pt cathode. Firstly, an effective acetylcholinesterase immobilized electrode was developed and its electrochemical performance evaluated. Highly porous gold was used as the electrode material, and the enzyme was immobilized via a one step rapid and simple procedure that does not require the use of harsh chemicals or any electrode/enzyme pre-treatments. The resulting enzymatic electrode was subsequently used as the anode of a miniature flow-through membrane-less fuel cell and showed excellent response to varying concentrations of ACh. The peak power generated by the fuel cell was 4nW at a voltage of 260mV and with a current density of 9muAcm-2. The limit of detection of the fuel cell sensor was 10muM, with an average response time as short as 3min. These exciting results open new horizons for point-of-care Alzheimer diagnosis and provide an attractive potential alternative to established methods that require laborious and time-consuming sample treatments and expensive instruments.
27614804	Effects of Diabetes Mellitus on Cognitive Decline in Patients with Alzheimer Disease: A Systematic Review.	Basic and clinical research support a link between diabetes mellitus and Alzheimer disease (AD). However, the relationship with AD progression is unclear. This review focuses on the association between diabetes and cognitive decline in patients with AD. The literature published through May 2015 was searched in 3 databases: PubMed, Embase and Cochrane. Studies evaluating the effects of diabetes on patients with AD or cognitive decline were included, and extracted data were analyzed. A total of 10 articles met the inclusion criteria for review. The results of these studies were inconsistent in terms of the association between diabetes and cognitive decline. Only 2 studies demonstrated that the presence of diabetes was independently related to the progression of cognitive decline in the patients with AD, and 3 studies suggested that histories of diabetes were not correlated with the changes in cognitive function in patients with AD. Half of the included studies even indicated that histories of diabetes were associated with lesser declines in cognitive function in patients with AD. Current evidence indicates that the link between diabetes and cognitive decline in patients with AD is uncertain. Further clinical studies are needed, with larger samples, long-term follow up and an extended battery of cognitive assessments.
27613758	Renin-angiotensin system gene expression and neurodegenerative diseases.	HYPOTHESIS: Single nucleotide polymorphisms and altered gene expression of components of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) are associated with neurodegenerative diseases. INTRODUCTION: Drugs that interact with the RAS have been shown to affect the course of neurodegenerative disease, suggesting that abnormalities in the RAS may contribute to neurodegenerative disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies and gene expression data for 14 RAS-related proteins was carried out for five neurodegenerative diseases: Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, narcolepsy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and multiple sclerosis. RESULTS: No single nucleotide polymorphisms in any of the 14 RAS-related protein genes were significantly associated with the five neurodegenerative diseases investigated. There was an inverse association between expression of ATP6AP2, which encodes the (pro)renin receptor, and multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. An association of AGTR, which encodes the AT1 angiotensin II receptor, and Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease was also observed. CONCLUSIONS: To date, no single nucleotide polymorphisms in components of the RAS can be definitively linked to the neurodegenerative diseases evaluated in this study. However, altered gene expression of several components of the RAS is associated with several neurodegenerative diseases, which may indicate that the RAS contributes to the pathology of these diseases.
27610574	Lipid Biosynthesis Coordinates a Mitochondrial-to-Cytosolic Stress Response.	Defects in mitochondrial metabolism have been increasingly linked with age-onset protein-misfolding diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's. In response to protein-folding stress, compartment-specific unfolded protein responses (UPRs) within the ER, mitochondria, and cytosol work in parallel to ensure cellular protein homeostasis. While perturbation of individual compartments can make other compartments more susceptible to protein stress, the cellular conditions that trigger cross-communication between the individual UPRs remain poorly understood. We have uncovered a conserved, robust mechanism linking mitochondrial protein homeostasis and the cytosolic folding environment through changes in lipid homeostasis. Metabolic restructuring caused by mitochondrial stress or small-molecule activators trigger changes in gene expression coordinated uniquely by both the mitochondrial and cytosolic UPRs, protecting the cell from disease-associated proteins. Our data suggest an intricate and unique system of communication between UPRs in response to metabolic changes that could unveil new targets for diseases of protein misfolding.
27600432	Mitochondria and the NLRP3 inflammasome: physiological and pathological relevance.	The NLRP3 inflammasome is assembled and activated in certain types of myeloid cells upon sensing microbe-derived toxins or host-derived danger signals. Activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome by endogenous ligands has been discovered in various disorders, including metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, atherosclerosis, gout, reperfusion injury of the heart, neurodegeneration, such as Alzheimer's disease, chronic kidney diseases, and macular degeneration of the eyes. Despite the potential significance of the NLRP3 inflammasome in the pathogenesis of several diseases, details on the activation mechanism of the NLRP3 inflammasome by a variety of stimulators have yet to be reported. Emerging evidence suggests that mitochondrial events are associated with NLRP3 activation in disease conditions. Mitochondrial dysfunction acts upstream of NLRP3 activation by providing reactive oxygen species (ROS) to trigger NLRP3 oligomerization or by inducing alpha-tubulin acetylation to relocate mitochondria to the proximity of NLRP3. In addition, mitochondria work as a platform for inflammasome assembly. Mitochondrial events may also lie downstream of NLRP3 activation. While the molecular mechanisms of mitochondrial dysfunction associated with NLRP3 activation are still unclear, they may involve the perturbation of mitochondria by K+ efflux and subsequent intracellular disequilibrium. Thus, mitochondria and NLRP3 machinery appear to be closely interwoven at multiple levels.
27598794	The impact of educational experiences on nursing students' knowledge and attitudes toward people with Alzheimer's disease: A mixed method study.	BACKGROUND: As the population ages, the effects of Alzheimer's disease will be felt by all nurses. Providing proper care for people with Alzheimer's disease is difficult and requires specific skills, attitudes, and knowledge. Limited data exists regarding nursing students' attitudes and knowledge toward people with Alzheimer's disease, whether undergraduate education prepares students to care for this population, or the best methods to support students in learning in an innovative and interactive environment. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to determine the effect of different educational experiences on nursing students' knowledge and attitudes toward people with Alzheimer's disease and to explore nursing students' knowledge and attitudes surrounding the care of people with Alzheimer's disease. DESIGN: A convergent mixed method design. A three group (Alzheimer's disease clinical experience, online learning module, and no dementia-specific intervention), pretest and posttest design served as the quantitative arm of the study. A focus group discussion with themes extracted served as the qualitative piece of the study. SETTING: College of Nursing in North Texas. PARTICIPANTS: Convenience sample of 94 senior level nursing students enrolled in the undergraduate nursing program's Community Health course. METHOD: Students completed pre and posttest surveys which included Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Scale, Dementia Attitudes Scale, and demographic questionnaire. Content analysis was conducted on focus group responses to qualitative interview questions. RESULTS: The Alzheimer's disease clinical group experienced increased knowledge and improved attitudes toward people with Alzheimer's disease compared with students who completed the online module or had no dementia-specific intervention. Four themes emerged from focus group data: Basic Alzheimer's disease knowledge, need for Alzheimer's disease experiential learning, negative feelings related to behaviors, and appropriate responses to behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia. CONCLUSION: Experiential learning in the form of clinical placements increased knowledge and improved attitudes about Alzheimer's disease compared with an online module and no dementia-specific intervention.
27598108	Recent Advances in Neurogenic Small Molecules as Innovative Treatments for Neurodegenerative Diseases.	The central nervous system of adult mammals has long been considered as a complex static structure unable to undergo any regenerative process to refurbish its dead nodes. This dogma was challenged by Altman in the 1960s and neuron self-renewal has been demonstrated ever since in many species, including humans. Aging, neurodegenerative, and some mental diseases are associated with an exponential decrease in brain neurogenesis. Therefore, the controlled pharmacological stimulation of the endogenous neural stem cells (NSCs) niches might counteract the neuronal loss in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other pathologies, opening an exciting new therapeutic avenue. In the last years, druggable molecular targets and signalling pathways involved in neurogenic processes have been identified, and as a consequence, different drug types have been developed and tested in neuronal plasticity. This review focuses on recent advances in neurogenic agents acting at serotonin and/or melatonin systems, Wnt/beta-catenin pathway, sigma receptors, nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) and nuclear erythroid 2-related factor (Nrf2).
27597977	Genetic Association of CHAT rs3810950 and rs2177369 Polymorphisms with the Risk of Alzheimer's Disease: A Meta-Analysis.	Choline acetyltransferase (CHAT) rs3810950 and rs2177369 polymorphisms have been implicated in susceptibility to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Due to the inconsistent results from previous studies, a meta-analysis was performed to estimate the association between these polymorphisms and AD risk more precisely. Pooled results of our meta-analysis indicated CHAT rs2177369 polymorphism was correlated with decreasing AD risk in one of five genetic models (dominant: OR = 0.77, 95% CI: 0.62-0.96), while rs3810950 mutant was associated with AD development in three models (allelic: OR = 1.18, 95% CI: 1.01-1.37, homozygous: OR = 1.63, 95% CI: 1.09-2.42, and recessive: OR = 1.65, 95% CI: 1.20-2.26). In subgroup analysis by ethnicity, the association between CHAT rs3810950 polymorphism and AD risk was just found in the recessive model (OR = 1.47, 95% CI: 1.05-2.07) among Caucasians, while four genetic models (allelic: OR = 1.23, 95% CI: 1.01-1.48; homozygous: OR = 2.24, 95% CI: 1.48-3.39; dominant: OR = 1.21, 95% CI: 1.06-1.40; and recessive: OR = 2.18, 95% CI: 1.45-3.29) assumed this association in Asians. In conclusion, our meta-analysis indicated CHAT rs2177369 polymorphism might play a protective role in AD, while rs3810950 variant was a risk factor for AD but its single heterozygous mutations might not influence susceptibility to AD.
27597800	Plasma Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor as a Biomarker for the Main Types of Mild Neurocognitive Disorders and Treatment Efficacy: A Preliminary Study.	Decreased levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) are assumed to play a crucial role in the pathophysiology of mild neurocognitive disorders (MNCDs). In this study, we compared plasma BDNF levels (at baseline and after two months of treatment with escitalopram) in patients with the main types of MNCDs and normal controls. 21 patients met the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for possible MNCD due to Alzheimer's disease (MNCD-AD); 22 patients fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for subcortical vascular MNCD (ScVMNCD) according to Frisoni et al. (2002) and neuroimaging-supported probable diagnosis of vascular MNCD according to DSM-5; 16 subjects entered control group. At baseline, we detected lower BDNF levels in both MNCD groups, which was significant only in subjects with MNCD-AD. Moreover, plasma BDNF level of 21160 pg/mL showed high sensitivity (94%) to discriminate patients with MNCD-AD. Decreased plasma BDNF highly correlated with the severity of memory impairment and total MMSE score in MNCD-AD group. Escitalopram treatment in patients with MNCD-AD or ScVMNCD led to an increase of plasma BDNF concentrations and as a result to a decrease of cognitive, depressive, and anxiety symptom severity. In conclusion, plasma BDNF might be a reliable biomarker for the validation of MNCD-AD diagnosis and treatment efficacy.
27597412	Bis(indolyl)phenylmethane derivatives are effective small molecules for inhibition of amyloid fibril formation by hen lysozyme.	Amyloid or similar protein aggregates are the hallmarks of many disorders, including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Huntington's diseases and amyloidoses. The inhibition of the formation of these aberrant species by small molecules is a promising strategy for disease treatment. However, at present, all such diseases lack an appropriate therapeutic approach based on small molecules. In this work we have evaluated five bis(indolyl)phenylmethane derivatives to reduce amyloid fibril formation by hen egg white lysozyme (HEWL) and its associated cytotoxicity. HEWL is a widely used model system to study the fundamentals of amyloid fibril formation and is heterologous to human lysozyme, which forms amyloid fibrils in a familial form of systemic amyloidosis. HEWL aggregation was tested in the presence and absence of the five compounds, under conditions in which the protein is partially unfolded. To this purpose, various techniques were used, including Congo red and Thioflavin T binding assays, atomic force microscopy, Fourier-Transform Infrared spectroscopy and cell-based cytotoxicity assays, such as the MTT reduction test and the trypan blue test. It was found that all compounds inhibited the formation of amyloid fibrils and their associated toxicity, diverging the aggregation process towards the formation of large, morphologically amorphous, unstructured, nontoxic aggregates, thus resembling class I molecules defined previously. In addition, the five compounds also appeared to disaggregate pre-formed fibrils of HEWL, which categorizes them into class IA. The half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) was found to be ca 12.3 +/- 1.0 muM for the forefather compound.
27593248	Clinical PET/MR Imaging in Dementia and Neuro-Oncology.	The introduction of hybrid PET/MRI systems allows simultaneous multimodality image acquisition of high technical quality. This technique is well suited for the brain, and particularly in dementia and neuro-oncology. In routine use combinations of well-established MRI sequences and PET tracers provide the most optimal and clinically valuable protocols. For dementia the [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) has merit with a simultaneous four sequence MRI protocol of 20 min supported by supplementary statistical reading tools and quantitative measurements of the hippocampal volume. Clinical PET/MRI using [18F]-fluoro-ethyl-tyrosine (FET) also abide to the expectations of the adaptive and versatile diagnostic tool necessary in neuro-oncology covering both simple 20 min protocols for routine treatment surveillance and complicated 90 min brain and spinal cord protocols in pediatric neuro-oncology under general anesthesia. The clinical value of adding advanced MRI sequences in multiparametric imaging setting, however, is still undocumented.
27592396	New piperidine-hydrazone derivatives: Synthesis, biological evaluations and molecular docking studies as AChE and BChE inhibitors.	Hydrazones and the piperidine ring containing compounds were considered as beneficial substrates in drug design. Therefore, this study was aimed at the synthesis of new benzoyl hydrazones derived from ethyl 4-oxopiperidine-1-carboxylate and 2,6-diphenylpiperidin-4-one. The synthesized compounds (1-19) were screened for their antioxidant, anticholinesterase and anticancer activities. The antioxidant capacity of the compounds was evaluated by using four complementary tests. The results showed that compound 7 and 17 have the higher lipid peroxidation inhibitory activity than the other compounds. In DPPH scavenging assay, compounds 5, 6, 10, 14, 17 demonstrated better activity than that of standard BHT, while in ABTS+ scavenging assay compound 6 and 17 exhibited better activity among the other compounds. The CUPRAC assay disclosed that compound 2 displayed better activity than alpha-tocopherol. The anticholinesterase activity was performed against acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) enzymes. Compound 11 (IC50: 35.30 +/- 1.11 muM) inhibited BChE better than galantamine (IC50: 46.03 +/- 0.14 muM). We conclude that the compound 11 can be considered as a candidate for BChE inhibitor. Moreover docking method was applied to elucidate the AChE and BChE inhibitory mechanism of the compound 11. Molecular docking analysis revealed that compound 11 bound to BChE enzyme more efficiently when compared to the AChE due to its orientations and different types of interactions. In addition, the non-cytotoxic properties of the compounds brought them into prominence, although they did not show significant anticancer properties.
27591445	[The prevalence of chronic diseases and geriatric problems - a comparison of nursing home residents in the skilled and nonskilled long-term care facilities in Poland].	UNLABELLED: In Poland long-term care services are provided by skilled care and treatment facilities (ZOL) and nursing and care facilities (ZPO) both functioning within the health sector as well as by non-skilled nursing homes (DPS) situated in social care sector. Determinants of medical and nursing care provided by both sectors vary considerably in terms of organization (availability) and economic issues (costs of care). AIM: The aim of the study is to compare characteristics of residents in two types of long term care facilities (LTCFs) in Poland with a special focus on geriatric issues. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study sample comprised of 387 ZOL residents and 352 DPS residents living in 7 settings. Data was collected for 6 years period (2007-2013) using InterRAI-LTCF questionnaire. The data analysis was done with application of a Mann-Whitney U test, chisquare test and Fisher's exact test and using IBM SPSS Statistics 22. RESULTS: The DPS residents were significantly older than ZOL residents. Predominance of women (68,8%) in both LTCF types was observed. DPS residents significantly more often suffered from internal diseases: COPD (13,6% vs. 4,1%), overweight and obesity (56,1% vs. 34,9%), inflammatory polyarthropathies (4,0% vs. 0,8%), dorsopathies (8,9% vs. 1,3%), osteoporosis (7,1% vs. 1,6%), diseases of the digestive system (11,7% vs. 5,7%) and hyperplasia of prostate (4,3% vs. 0,5%). Among the residents living in ZOL more frequently were observed: significant cognitive impairment and impaired ability to perform activities of daily living (ADL), as well as significantly higher prevalence of neurological diseases (stroke 31,0% vs. 9,1%) and neurodegenerative diseases (Alzheimer's disease or dementia in 53,0% vs. 28,4%), hip fracture (8,5% vs. 2,0%) and geriatric problems (i.e. pressure ulcers 12,2% vs. 4,2%, bladder incontinence 89,9% vs. 39,6%, bowel incontinence 83,9% vs. 26,1%, and underweight BMI<18,5 kg/m2 in 17,2% vs. 2,8%). CONCLUSIONS: Significant differences between the ZOL and DPS residents in functional status and prevalence of diseases were observed. The results indicate considerable differences among the residents of different types of LTCFs, which should suggest physicians to adjust diagnostic and therapeutic approach in respect to those differences.
27589716	Extracts from Traditional Chinese Medicinal Plants Inhibit Acetylcholinesterase, a Known Alzheimer's Disease Target.	Inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is a common treatment for early stages of the most general form of dementia, Alzheimer's Disease (AD). In this study, methanol, dichloromethane and aqueous crude extracts from 80 Traditional Chinese Medical (TCM) plants were tested for their in vitro anti-acetylcholinesterase activity based on Ellman's colorimetric assay. All three extracts of Berberis bealei (formerly Mahonia bealei), Coptis chinensis and Phellodendron chinense, which contain numerous isoquinoline alkaloids, substantially inhibited AChE. The methanol and aqueous extracts of Coptis chinensis showed IC50 values of 0.031 microg/mL and 2.5 microg/mL, therefore having an up to 100-fold stronger AChE inhibitory activity than the already known AChE inhibitor galantamine (IC50 = 4.33 microg/mL). Combinations of individual alkaloids berberine, coptisine and palmatine resulted in a synergistic enhancement of ACh inhibition. Therefore, the mode of AChE inhibition of crude extracts of Coptis chinensis, Berberis bealei and Phellodendron chinense is probably due to of this synergism of isoquinoline alkaloids. All extracts were also tested for their cytotoxicity in COS7 cells and none of the most active extracts was cytotoxic at the concentrations which inhibit AChE. Based on these results it can be stated that some TCM plants inhibit AChE via synergistic interaction of their secondary metabolites. The possibility to isolate pure lead compounds from the crude extracts or to administer these as nutraceuticals or as cheap alternative to drugs in third world countries make TCM plants a versatile source of natural inhibitors of AChE.
27587706	Reference Tissue-Based Kinetic Evaluation of 18F-AV-1451 for Tau Imaging.	The goal of this paper was to evaluate the in vivo kinetics of the novel tau-specific PET radioligand 18F-AV-1451 in cognitively healthy control (HC) and Alzheimer disease (AD) subjects, using reference region analyses. METHODS: 18F-AV-1451 PET imaging was performed on 43 subjects (5 young HCs, 23 older HCs, and 15 AD subjects). Data were collected from 0 to 150 min after injection, with a break from 100 to 120 min. T1-weighted MR images were segmented using FreeSurfer to create 14 bilateral regions of interest (ROIs). In all analyses, cerebellar gray matter was used as the reference region. Nondisplaceable binding potentials (BPNDs) were calculated using the simplified reference tissue model (SRTM) and SRTM2; the Logan graphical analysis distribution volume ratio (DVR) was calculated for 30-150 min (DVR30-150). These measurements were compared with each other and used as reference standards for defining an appropriate 20-min window for the SUV ratio (SUVR). Pearson correlations were used to compare the reference standards to 20-min SUVRs (start times varied from 30 to 130 min), for all values, for ROIs with low 18F-AV-1451 binding (lROIs, mean of BPND + 1 and DVR30-150 < 1.5), and for ROIs with high 18F-AV-1451 binding (hROIs, mean of BPND + 1 and DVR30-150 > 1.5). RESULTS: SRTM2 BPND + 1 and DVR30-150 were in good agreement. Both were in agreement with SRTM BPND + 1 for lROIs but were greater than SRTM BPND + 1 for hROIs, resulting in a nonlinear relationship. hROI SUVRs increased from 80-100 to 120-140 min by 0.24 +/- 0.15. The SUVR time interval resulting in the highest correlation and slope closest to 1 relative to the reference standards for all values was 120-140 min for hROIs, 60-80 min for lROIs, and 80-100 min for lROIs and hROIs. There was minimal difference between methods when statistical significance between ADs and HCs was calculated. CONCLUSION: Despite later time periods providing better agreement between reference standards and SUVRs for hROIs, a good compromise for studying lROIs and hROIs is SUVR80-100. The lack of SUVR plateau for hROIs highlights the importance of precise acquisition time for longitudinal assessment.
27587069	The CITIRIVAD Study: CITIcoline plus RIVAstigmine in Elderly Patients Affected with Dementia Study.	BACKGROUND: Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AchEIs), such as rivastigmine, coadministered with cholinergic precursors, such as citicoline, could be effective in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and in mixed dementia (MD), because they are able to increase the intrasynaptic levels of acetylcholine more than the single drugs given alone. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to show the effectiveness of oral citicoline plus rivastigmine in patients with AD and MD. METHODS: The CITIRIVAD study was a retrospective case-control study on 174 consecutive outpatients aged >/=65 years, affected with AD or MD, mean age 81.3 +/- 4.5 years. Of the 174 patients, 92 had been treated with rivastigmine + citicoline 1000 mg/day given orally (group A); 82 patients had been treated with rivastigmine (group B). In both groups rivastigmine patch had been used for at least six months at the highest tolerated dosage. Group A comprised 62 patients affected with AD and 30 patients with MD. Group B comprised 53 patients affected with AD and 29 with MD. Cognitive functions had been assessed by Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), daily life functions by activities of daily living (ADL) and instrumental activities (IADL), behavioral symptoms by neuropsychiatric inventory (NPI), comorbidities by the Cumulative Illness Rating Scale and mood by geriatric depression scale (GDS)-short form tests, which had been administered at baseline, 3 and 9 months. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Data show the effectiveness of combined administration versus the AchEI alone, mainly in slowing disease progression and consequently in disease management, both in AD and in MD. No differences regarding the combined treatment were found between the two groups. Treatment with citicoline plus rivastigmine was safe and well tolerated.
27586004	Non-parametric Survival Analysis of EPG5 Gene with Age at Onset of Alzheimer's Disease.	Non-parametric methods such as Wilcoxon test have the advantages of no assumptions for the underlying survival distributions. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disease while the ectopic P-granules autophagy protein 5 homolog (EPG5 gene) is highly expressed in human brain and may implicate in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders. The present study explored the associations of 26 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the EPG5 gene with the age at onset (AAO) of AD using a family-based association test (FBAT)-Wilcoxon statistic in a family-based study. Then a replication study using a case-control sample was conducted to perform Wilcoxon test in Kaplan-Meier survival analysis of AAO. The results from FBAT-generalized estimating equations (FBAT-GEE) statistics and FBAT-Wilcoxon test showed that seven SNPs (top SNP rs495078 with p = 1.29 x 10-3) were significantly associated with the risk of AD, and eight SNPs (top SNP rs11082498 with p = 3.55 x 10-4) were associated with the AAO of AD in the family-based study (p < 0.05). In the replicated data, three SNPs were associated with AAO by using the Wilcoxon test, where the mean AAO was approximately 2.2 years earlier in individuals who had at least one minor allele of the top AAO-associated SNP rs9963463 (p = 0.0018) compared with those who were homozygous for the major allele. These findings from non-parametric survival analyses provide evidence for several genetic variants in EPG5 influencing the AAO of AD and will serve as a resource for replication in other populations.
27586003	Performance on the Cogstate Brief Battery Is Related to Amyloid Levels and Hippocampal Volume in Very Mild Dementia.	In a group of older adults with very mild dementia, we aimed to characterize the nature and magnitude of cognitive decline as measured by the Cogstate Brief Battery, in relation to Abeta levels and hippocampal volume. Participants were characterized according to their status on the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scale. A total of 308 individuals who were CDR 0 and had low cerebral Abeta levels (Abeta-), 32 individuals who were Abeta- and CDR 0.5, and 43 individuals who were Abeta+ and CDR 0.5 were included in this study. Participants completed the CogState brief battery at baseline, and at 18-, 36-, 54- and 72-month follow-up. Linear mixed model analyses indicated that relative to the Abeta- CDR 0 group, the Abeta+ CDR 0.5 group showed increased rates of memory decline and hippocampal volume loss. However, compared to the Abeta- CDR 0 group, the Abeta- CDR 0.5 group showed no changes in cognitive function or hippocampal volume over 72 months. The results of this study confirm that in individuals with very mild dementia, who also have biomarker confirmation of Abeta+, changes in cognitive function manifest primarily as deterioration in memory processing, and this is associated with hippocampal volume loss. Conversely, the absence of any cognitive decline or loss in hippocampal volume in individuals with very mild dementia but who are Abeta- suggests that some other non-AD disease process may underlie any static impairment in cognitive function.
27583919	The CYP19A1 rs3751592 variant confers susceptibility to Alzheimer disease in the Chinese Han population.	BACKGROUND: The CYP19A1 enzyme (aromatase) encoded by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 19A1 gene influences the final step in the biosynthesis of estrogen, which has been associated with Alzheimer disease (AD). It is possible that genetic polymorphisms in CYP19A1 could influence the risk of AD by altering the expression of CYP19A1. The epsilon4 allele of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene, which is the most significant known genetic risk factor for AD, may mask the effects of other loci. METHODS: To assess the potential association of CYP19A1 gene polymorphisms with the risk of AD, we conducted a case-control study in a Chinese Han population by recruiting 463 cases, including 207 patients diagnosed with AD and 256 healthy people matched for sex and age. RESULTS: In APOE epsilon4 carriers, the distributions of the G allele and the AG + GG genotype of CYP19A1 rs3751592 in patients differed significantly (P < 0.05) from those in healthy people. However, no difference was observed in the distribution of CYP19A1 rs1065778 between the patient and control populations, regardless of their APOE epsilon4 status. CONCLUSION: The results demonstrated that the rs3751592 A/G polymorphism of the CYP19A1 gene was associated with the incidence of AD in a Chinese Han population, which suggests that CYP19A1 rs3751592 is a predisposing genetic factor for AD.
27582220	The antibody aducanumab reduces Abeta plaques in Alzheimer's disease.	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by deposition of amyloid-beta (Abeta) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in the brain, accompanied by synaptic dysfunction and neurodegeneration. Antibody-based immunotherapy against Abeta to trigger its clearance or mitigate its neurotoxicity has so far been unsuccessful. Here we report the generation of aducanumab, a human monoclonal antibody that selectively targets aggregated Abeta. In a transgenic mouse model of AD, aducanumab is shown to enter the brain, bind parenchymal Abeta, and reduce soluble and insoluble Abeta in a dose-dependent manner. In patients with prodromal or mild AD, one year of monthly intravenous infusions of aducanumab reduces brain Abeta in a dose- and time-dependent manner. This is accompanied by a slowing of clinical decline measured by Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes and Mini Mental State Examination scores. The main safety and tolerability findings are amyloid-related imaging abnormalities. These results justify further development of aducanumab for the treatment of AD. Should the slowing of clinical decline be confirmed in ongoing phase 3 clinical trials, it would provide compelling support for the amyloid hypothesis.
27581368	Cholinesterase inhibitors do not alter the length of stay in nursing homes among patients with Alzheimer's disease: a prospective, observational study of factors affecting survival time from admission to death.	BACKGROUND: The survival time in nursing homes (NHs) in Alzheimer's disease (AD) might be affected by sociodemographic/clinical characteristics, rate of disease progression, and use of specific medications and community-based services. Whether different aspects of cholinesterase inhibitor (ChEI) therapy modify time spent in NHs is unclear. Therefore, we examined the relationship between these potential predictors and survival time in NHs. METHODS: This prospective, multicenter study of ChEI treatment in clinical practice included 220 deceased patients clinically diagnosed with mild-to-moderate AD who were admitted to NHs during the study. Cognitive and activities of daily living (ADL) performance, ChEI dose, and amount of services used/week were evaluated every 6 months over 3 years. Dates of nursing-home placement (NHP) and death were recorded. Variables that determined survival time in NHs were analyzed using general linear models. RESULTS: The mean survival time in NHs was 4.06 years (men, 2.78 years; women, 4.53 years; P < 0.001). The multivariate model showed that a shorter stay in NHs was associated with the interaction term male living with a family member, use of antihypertensive/cardiac therapy or anxiolytics/sedatives/hypnotics, and worse basic ADL at NHP, but not with age or cognitive and instrumental ADL capacities. CONCLUSIONS: Increased community-based care did not reduce the survival time in NHs among individuals with AD. Men living with family spent significantly less time in NHs compared with the corresponding women, which suggests that the situation of female spouses of AD patients may need attention and possibly support. There was no indication that different aspects of ChEI therapy, e.g., drug type, dose, or duration, alter survival time in NHs.
27581308	The role of diffusion tensor imaging and fractional anisotropy in the evaluation of patients with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus: a literature review.	OBJECTIVE Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) for the assessment of fractional anisotropy (FA) and involving measurements of mean diffusivity (MD) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) represents a novel, MRI-based, noninvasive technique that may delineate microstructural changes in cerebral white matter (WM). For example, DTI may be used for the diagnosis and differentiation of idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) from other neurodegenerative diseases with similar imaging findings and clinical symptoms and signs. The goal of the current study was to identify and analyze recently published series on the use of DTI as a diagnostic tool. Moreover, the authors also explored the utility of DTI in identifying patients with iNPH who could be managed by surgical intervention. METHODS The authors performed a literature search of the PubMed database by using any possible combinations of the following terms: "Alzheimer's disease," "brain," "cerebrospinal fluid," "CSF," "diffusion tensor imaging," "DTI," "hydrocephalus," "idiopathic," "magnetic resonance imaging," "normal pressure," "Parkinson's disease," and "shunting." Moreover, all reference lists from the retrieved articles were reviewed to identify any additional pertinent articles. RESULTS The literature search retrieved 19 studies in which DTI was used for the identification and differentiation of iNPH from other neurodegenerative diseases. The DTI protocols involved different approaches, such as region of interest (ROI) methods, tract-based spatial statistics, voxel-based analysis, and delta-ADC analysis. The most studied anatomical regions were the periventricular WM areas, such as the internal capsule (IC), the corticospinal tract (CST), and the corpus callosum (CC). Patients with iNPH had significantly higher MD in the periventricular WM areas of the CST and the CC than had healthy controls. In addition, FA and ADCs were significantly higher in the CST of iNPH patients than in any other patients with other neurodegenerative diseases. Gait abnormalities of iNPH patients were statistically significantly and negatively correlated with FA in the CST and the minor forceps. Fractional anisotropy had a sensitivity of 94% and a specificity of 80% for diagnosing iNPH. Furthermore, FA and MD values in the CST, the IC, the anterior thalamic region, the fornix, and the hippocampus regions could help differentiate iNPH from Alzheimer or Parkinson disease. Interestingly, CSF drainage or ventriculoperitoneal shunting significantly modified FA and ADCs in iNPH patients whose condition clinically responded to these maneuvers. CONCLUSIONS Measurements of FA and MD significantly contribute to the detection of axonal loss and gliosis in the periventricular WM areas in patients with iNPH. Diffusion tensor imaging may also represent a valuable noninvasive method for differentiating iNPH from other neurodegenerative diseases. Moreover, DTI can detect dynamic changes in the WM tracts after lumbar drainage or shunting procedures and could help identify iNPH patients who may benefit from surgical intervention.
27578514	Reference Intervals for Plasma Amyloid beta in Korean Adults Without Cognitive Impairment.	Amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides are important components of plaques in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recent studies suggest that a low plasma ratio of Abeta42 to Abeta40 may precede the development of the sporadic form of AD. The aim of this study was to establish reference intervals for plasma Abeta in Korean adults. A total of 370 apparently healthy individuals (181 males and 189 females aged 40-69 yr) without cognitive impairment were enrolled. Plasma concentrations of Abeta40 and Abeta42 were measured by using a human amyloid beta assay kit (Immuno-Biological Laboratories, Japan). Reference intervals were established according to the "CLSI guidelines for defining, establishing, and verifying reference intervals in the clinical laboratory". There was no need to partition the data with respect to gender or age group. The 95th percentile reference intervals for Abeta40 and Abeta42 were 127-331 pg/mL and 2.31-19.84 pg/mL, respectively. The reference interval for the Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio was 0.011-0.092. Plasma Abeta concentrations obtained in this study could be used as reference intervals for clinical purposes.

27574931	Limitations of Sacubitril/Valsartan in the Management of Heart Failure.	BACKGROUND: The PARADIGM-HF (Prospective comparison of ARNI with ACEI to Determine Impact on Global Mortality and morbidity in Heart Failure) trial was a double-blind trial that randomized 8442 patients with heart failure (HF) with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) to receive twice daily dosing of either 200 mg of LCZ696 or 10 mg of enalapril in addition to standard medical therapy for HF. AREAS OF UNCERTAINTY: Limitations of this trial include (1) sacubitril has not been tested by itself in the treatment of HFrEF; (2) the maximum recommended dose of valsartan for the treatment of HFrEF was used in this trial, but the maximum recommended dose of enalapril for the treatment of HFrEF was not used; (3) a run-in phase was used in this trial to test the tolerability of LCZ696, and patients who had adverse effects in this period were excluded from randomization; (4) the percent of blacks enrolled in this trial was only 5%; (5) LCZ696 caused a 14% incidence of hypotension; (6) neprilysin inhibition might favor the development of Alzheimer dementia, which was not assessed in the PARADIGM-HF trial; (7) patients with severe symptomatic HF were underrepresented in this trial; (8) major exclusions from this trial included an acute coronary event in the last 3 months, severe pulmonary disease, hepatic impairment, and an estimated glomerular filtration rate <30 mL per minute per 1.73 m. DATA SOURCES: Review of the PARADIGM-HF trial. RESULTS: At 27-month follow-up, the PARADIGM-HF trial showed that compared with enalapril, LCZ696 reduced the composite of cardiovascular death or hospitalization for HF 20% (absolute risk reduction 4.7%, P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The numerous limitations discussed under the areas of uncertainty should be considered when prescribing LCZ696 for the treatment of HFrEF.
27574726	Cognitive decline: A vitamin B perspective.	Cognitive decline is one of the major causes of disability in older people. A high level of homocysteine, a byproduct of vitamin B, has been linked to brain atrophy, which itself is a precursor to cognitive decline leading to dementia and Alzheimer's disease. In addition, a low level of vitamin B is often noted in patients with dementia and Alzheimer's disease and its supplementation has been shown to improve memory and to slow the progress of brain atrophy. This information may aid in the use of vitamin B as a preventative measure against severe cognitive decline, and thus reduce the onset of conditions such as dementia and Alzheimer's disease.
27570871	2016 Alzheimer's disease facts and figures.	This report describes the public health impact of Alzheimer's disease, including incidence and prevalence, mortality rates, costs of care, and the overall impact on caregivers and society. It also examines in detail the financial impact of Alzheimer's on families, including annual costs to families and the difficult decisions families must often make to pay those costs. An estimated 5.4 million Americans have Alzheimer's disease. By mid-century, the number of people living with Alzheimer's disease in the United States is projected to grow to 13.8 million, fueled in large part by the aging baby boom generation. Today, someone in the country develops Alzheimer's disease every 66 seconds. By 2050, one new case of Alzheimer's is expected to develop every 33 seconds, resulting in nearly 1 million new cases per year. In 2013, official death certificates recorded 84,767 deaths from Alzheimer's disease, making it the sixth leading cause of death in the United States and the fifth leading cause of death in Americans age >/= 65 years. Between 2000 and 2013, deaths resulting from stroke, heart disease, and prostate cancer decreased 23%, 14%, and 11%, respectively, whereas deaths from Alzheimer's disease increased 71%. The actual number of deaths to which Alzheimer's disease contributes is likely much larger than the number of deaths from Alzheimer's disease recorded on death certificates. In 2016, an estimated 700,000 Americans age >/= 65 years will die with Alzheimer's disease, and many of them will die because of the complications caused by Alzheimer's disease. In 2015, more than 15 million family members and other unpaid caregivers provided an estimated 18.1 billion hours of care to people with Alzheimer's and other dementias, a contribution valued at more than $221 billion. Average per-person Medicare payments for services to beneficiaries age >/= 65 years with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias are more than two and a half times as great as payments for all beneficiaries without these conditions, and Medicaid payments are 19 times as great. Total payments in 2016 for health care, long-term care and hospice services for people age >/= 65 years with dementia are estimated to be $236 billion. The costs of Alzheimer's care may place a substantial financial burden on families, who often have to take money out of their retirement savings, cut back on buying food, and reduce their own trips to the doctor. In addition, many family members incorrectly believe that Medicare pays for nursing home care and other types of long-term care. Such findings highlight the need for solutions to prevent dementia-related costs from jeopardizing the health and financial security of the families of people with Alzheimer's and other dementias.
27569389	Small molecule LX2343 ameliorates cognitive deficits in AD model mice by targeting both amyloid beta production and clearance.	AIM: Streptozotocin (STZ) is widely used to induce oxidative damage and to impair glucose metabolism, apoptosis, and tau/Abeta pathology, eventually leading to cognitive deficits in both in vitro and in vivo models of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this study, we constructed a cell-based platform using STZ to induce stress conditions mimicking the complicated pathologies of AD in vitro, and evaluated the anti-amyloid effects of a small molecule, N-(1,3-benzodioxol-5-yl)-2-[5-chloro-2-methoxy(phenylsulfonyl)anilino]acetamide (LX2343) in the amelioration of cognitive deficits in AD model mice. METHODS: Cell-based assays for screening anti-amyloid compounds were established by assessing Abeta accumulation in HEK293-APPsw and CHO-APP cells, and Abeta clearance in primary astrocytes and SH-SY5Y cells after the cells were treated with STZ in the presence of the test compounds. Autophagic flux was observed using confocal laser scanning microscopy. APP/PS1 transgenic mice were administered LX2343 (10 mg.kg-1.d-1, ip) for 100 d. After LX2343 administration, cognitive ability of the mice was evaluated using Morris water maze test, and senile plaques in the brains were detected using Thioflavine S staining. ELISA assay was used to evaluate Abeta and sAPPbeta levels, while Western blot analysis was used to measure the signaling proteins in both cell and animal brains. RESULTS: LX2343 (5-20 mumol/L) dose-dependently decreased Abeta accumulation in HEK293-APPsw and CHO-APP cells, and promoted Abeta clearance in SH-SY5Y cells and primary astrocytes. The anti-amyloid effects of LX2343 were attributed to suppressing JNK-mediated APPThr668 phosphorylation, thus inhibiting APP cleavage on one hand, and inhibiting BACE1 enzymatic activity with an IC50 value of 11.43+/-0.36 mumol/L, on the other hand. Furthermore, LX2343 acted as a non-ATP competitive PI3K inhibitor to negatively regulate AKT/mTOR signaling, thus promoting autophagy, and increasing Abeta clearance. Administration of LX2343 in APP/PS1 transgenic mice significantly ameliorated cognitive deficits and markedly ameliorated the Abeta pathology in their brains. CONCLUSION: LX2343 ameliorates cognitive dysfunction in APP/PS1 transgenic mice via both Abeta production inhibition and clearance promotion, which highlights the potential of LX2343 in the treatment of AD.
27568024	Inflammatory Cytokines and Alzheimer's Disease: A Review from the Perspective of Genetic Polymorphisms.	Neuroinflammatory processes are a central feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in which microglia are over-activated, resulting in the increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Moreover, deficiencies in the anti-inflammatory system may also contribute to neuroinflammation. Recently, advanced methods for the analysis of genetic polymorphisms have further supported the relationship between neuroinflammatory factors and AD risk because a series of polymorphisms in inflammation-related genes have been shown to be associated with AD. In this review, we summarize the polymorphisms of both pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines related to AD, primarily interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-6, tumor necrosis factor alpha, IL-4, IL-10, and transforming growth factor beta, as well as their functional activity in AD pathology. Exploration of the relationship between inflammatory cytokine polymorphisms and AD risk may facilitate our understanding of AD pathogenesis and contribute to improved treatment strategies.
27567617	Automated quantification of amyloid positron emission tomography: a comparison of PMOD and MIMneuro.	OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine and compare two automated quantitative software tools (PMOD and MIMneuro) for the quantification of amyloid positron emission tomography (PET). METHODS: A total of 30 subjects-15 Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and 15 cognitively normal age- and sex-matched controls-were enrolled. All subjects underwent structural volumetric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and amyloid PET scans with F-18 florbetaben. Regional standardized uptake value ratios (SUVRs) using the cerebellar cortex as a reference region were obtained using PMOD and MIMneuro. RESULTS: The SUVRs using both PMOD and MIMneuro showed high discriminatory power between the AD patients and cognitively normal controls. While PMOD and MIMneuro yielded significantly different SUVRs in some brain regions, the two methods had good overall agreement. CONCLUSION: MIMneuro provides comparable performance to PMOD without the need to acquire brain MRI. Therefore, MIMneuro might be suitable for clinical use to determine amyloid positivity.
27566070	Natural Compounds and Neuroprotection: Mechanisms of Action and Novel Delivery Systems.	Neurodegeneration characterizes pathologic conditions, ranging from Alzheimer's disease to glaucoma, with devastating social and economic effects. It is a complex process implicating a series of molecular and cellular events, such as oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, protein misfolding, excitotoxicity and inflammation. Natural compounds, because of their broad spectrum of pharmacological and biological activities, could be possible candidates for the management of such multifactorial morbidities. However, their therapeutic potential against neurodegenerative diseases has been hampered by their poor bioavailability and subsequent insufficient delivery to the brain. This article provides an overview of the molecular mechanisms through which natural compounds exert their neuroprotective effects, as well as the development of novel natural compound-loaded delivery systems that could improve their neuroavailability.
27565551	Impact of 2, 3, 5, 4'-tetrahydroxystilbene-2-O-beta-D-glucoside on cognitive deficits in animal models of Alzheimer's disease: a systematic review.	BACKGROUND: The efficacy of 2, 3, 5, 4'-tetrahydroxystilbene-2-O-beta-D-glucoside (TSG) treatment on cognitive decline in individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD) has not been investigated. Therefore, we systematically reviewed the effect of TSG on cognitive deficits in a rodent model of AD. METHODS: We identified eligible studies published from January 1980 to April 2015 by searching seven electronic databases. We assessed the study quality, evaluated the efficacy of TSG treatment, and performed a stratified meta-analysis and meta-regression analysis to assess the influence of study design on TSG efficacy. RESULTS: Among a total of 381 publications, 18 fulfilled our inclusion criteria. The overall methodological quality of these studies was poor. The meta-analysis revealed a statistically significant benefit of TSG on acquisition memory (standardized mean difference [SMD] = -1.46 (95 % CI: -1.81 to -1.10, P < 0.0001) and retention memory (SMD =1.93 (95 % CI: 1.40 to 2.46, P < 0.0001) in experimental models of AD. The stratified analysis revealed a significantly higher effect size for both acquisition and retention memory in studies that used mixed sex models and a significantly higher effect size for acquisition memory in studies that used transgenic models. CONCLUSIONS: Our meta-analysis highlights a significantly better treatment effect in rodent AD models that received TSG that in those that did not. These findings indicate a potential therapeutic role of TSG in AD therapy. However, additional well-designed and detailed experimental studies are needed to evaluate the safety of TSG.
27560284	New insights into selective PDE4D inhibitors: 3-(Cyclopentyloxy)-4-methoxybenzaldehyde O-(2-(2,6-dimethylmorpholino)-2-oxoethyl) oxime (GEBR-7b) structural development and promising activities to restore memory impairment.	Phosphodiesterase type 4D (PDE4D) has been indicated as a promising target for treating neurodegenerative pathologies such as Alzheimer's Disease (AD). By preventing cAMP hydrolysis, PDE4 inhibitors (PDE4Is) increase the cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) phosphorylation, synaptic plasticity and long-term memory formation. Pharmacological and behavioral studies on our hit GEBR-7b demonstrated that selective PDE4DIs could improve memory without causing emesis and sedation. The hit development led to new molecule series, herein reported, characterized by a catechol structure bonded to five member heterocycles. Molecular modeling studies highlighted the pivotal role of a polar alkyl chain in conferring selective enzyme interaction. Compound 8a showed PDE4D3 selective inhibition and was able to increase intracellular cAMP levels in neuronal cells, as well as in the hippocampus of freely moving rats. Furthermore, 8a was able to readily cross the blood-brain barrier and enhanced memory performance in mice without causing any emetic-like behavior. These data support the view that PDE4D is an adequate molecular target to restore memory deficits in different neuropathologies, including AD, and also indicate compound 8a as a promising candidate for further preclinical development.
27560283	Novel multi-target-directed ligands for Alzheimer's disease: Combining cholinesterase inhibitors and 5-HT6 receptor antagonists. Design, synthesis and biological evaluation.	As currently postulated, a complex treatment may be key to an effective therapy for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recent clinical trials in patients with moderate AD have shown a superior effect of the combination therapy of donepezil (a selective acetylcholinesterase inhibitor) with idalopirdine (a 5-HT6 receptor antagonist) over monotherapy with donepezil. Here, we present the first report on the design, synthesis and biological evaluation of a novel class of multifunctional ligands that combines a 5-HT6 receptor antagonist with a cholinesterase inhibitor. Novel multi-target-directed ligands (MTDLs) were designed by combining pharmacophores directed against the 5-HT6 receptor (1-(phenylsulfonyl)-4-(piperazin-1-yl)-1H-indole) and cholinesterases (tacrine or N-benzylpiperidine analogues). In vitro evaluation led to the identification of tacrine derivative 12 with well-balanced potencies against the 5-HT6 receptor (Kb = 27 nM), acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase (IC50hAChE = 12 nM, IC50hBuChE = 29 nM). The compound also showed good in vitro blood-brain-barrier permeability (PAMPA-BBB assay), which was confirmed in vivo (open field study). Central cholinomimetic activity was confirmed in vivo in rats using a scopolamine-induced hyperlocomotion model. A novel class of multifunctional ligands with compound 12 as the best derivative in a series represents an excellent starting point for the further development of an effective treatment for AD.
27558108	The Role of Presenilin in Protein Trafficking and Degradation-Implications for Metal Homeostasis.	An imbalance in metal homeostasis is a prominent feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD). A wealth of evidence from independent studies over the past two and half decades has found changes to the distribution of brain iron, zinc, and copper in AD patients and animal models of the disease. Early research focused on the association of these metals with amyloid beta (Abeta), particularly extraneuronal Abeta plaque pathology. In contrast, there are numerous studies that have demonstrated a loss of iron-, zinc-, or copper-dependent cellular functions in AD animal and cell models, highlighting the importance of metal homeostasis in maintaining healthy brain function. Characterizing the molecular pathways that are impacted by iron, zinc, or copper will shed light on how these metals affect neuoroprotection, and conversely, neurodegeneration. Of particular interest is the role that the AD-associated presenilins have on protein trafficking and degradation, as metal homeostasis is dependent on the efficient trafficking and recycling of specific metal transporters. This review summarizes what is currently known about presenilin-dependent protein trafficking and the role of presenilin in protein turnover, particularly via the autophagy-lysosomal system.
27557548	Inverse relationship between erythrocyte size and platelet reactivity in elderly.	Previous work indicates that erythrocytes (RBCs) accumulate beta-amyloid X-40 (Abeta40) in individuals with Alzheimer disease (AD) and to a lesser extent in healthy elderly. The toxin damages RBCs and increases their mean corpuscular volume (MCV). Furthermore, AD platelets demonstrate lower reactivity. This study investigated interactions between RBCs and platelets. Older individuals with moderate hypertension (n = 57) were classified into two groups, depending on MCV in whole blood: The MCVhigh group comprised individuals with higher MCV (n = 27; 97 +/- 3(SD) fl) and MCVlow group had relatively lower MCV (n = 30; 90 +/- 3(SD) fl). Flow cytometry was used to determine platelet reactivity, i.e., the surface binding of fibrinogen after provocation. Adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and a thrombin receptor-activating protein (TRAP-6) were used as agonists. Subsequently, blood cells were divided according to density into 17 subfractions. Intra-RBC Abeta40 content was analyzed and in all platelet populations surface-bound fibrinogen was determined to estimate platelet in vivo activity. We found Abeta40 inside RBCs of approximately 50% of participants, but the toxin did not affect MCV and platelet reactivity. In contrast, MCV associated inversely with platelet reactivity as judged from surface-attached fibrinogen after ADP (1.7 mumol/L) (p < 0.05) and TRAP-6 provocation (57 mumol/L (p = 0.01) and 74 mumol/L (p < 0.05)). In several density fractions (nos. 3, 4, 8, 11-13 (p < 0.05) and nos. 5-7 (p < 0.01)) MCV linked inversely with platelet-attached fibrinogen. In our community-dwelling sample, enhanced MCV associated with decreased platelet reactivity and lower in vivo platelet activity. It resembles RBCs and platelet behavior in AD-type dementia.
27557144	Perspectives for treating Alzheimer's disease: a review on promising pharmacological substances.	CONTEXT AND OBJECTIVE: Dementia is a syndrome characterized by functional and cognitive decline. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most common causes of dementia and has high prevalence among the elderly. It is known that there is no drug capable of interfering with the course of the disease. Research on treatments for AD has been marked by the appearance of new drugs and their abandonment. This study aimed to describe drugs that have been studied with regard to treating AD and which are capable of influencing the course of the disease. DESIGN AND SETTING: Narrative review on original articles published worldwide. METHODS: A systematized search was conducted in the PubMed/MEDLINE, Cochrane Library/Cochrane and SciELO/Bireme databases. The descriptors "Molecular Mechanisms of Pharmacological Action" and "Drug Therapy" were each combined with the descriptor "Alzheimer disease". All of these can be found in MeSH and DeCS. These descriptors were used alone or in combination, and a filter specifying publication between January 2009 and October 2015 in English, Spanish or Portuguese was set. RESULTS: 6,888 articles were found, of which 37 were included in this review; 70.3% of the articles selected were of good quality with low or unclear risk of bias. 86 drugs were considered promising for AD treatment and these were classified into 20 pharmacological categories. CONCLUSION: There are no drugs capable of influencing the course of AD such that treatments are safe and effective. However, immunomodulators stood out as promising, given their effectiveness and quality in the articles analyzed.
27556598	A Computerized Cognitive Assessment Method in a Nurse-Led Clinic: A Comparative Study With the Traditional Pencil-and-Paper Approach.	This article reports our experience in developing a computerized cognitive assessment method in a nurse-led clinic. The assessment and report-writing time and the accuracy of using a computer as an assessment medium were compared with assessments that use the traditional pencil-and-paper method. The attitudes of professionals and service users toward the computerized approach were also collected. The results found that the computerized approach not only helped to reduce the time spent making assessments and writing reports but also improved the accuracy of the assessment when compared with the pencil-and-paper method. Most of the professionals and service users who were interviewed responded positively toward computerized assessments. The experience gained in this study will also help us to standardize our assessment procedures, promote communication among members of the clinical team, and facilitate data management and clinical research.
27556046	Sodium Tanshinone IIA Sulfonate Attenuates Scopolamine-Induced Cognitive Dysfunctions via Improving Cholinergic System.	Sodium Tanshinone IIA sulfonate (STS) is a derivative of Tanshinone IIA (Tan IIA). Tan IIA has been reported to possess neuroprotective effects against Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, whether STS possesses effect on AD remains unclear. This study aims to estimate whether STS could protect against scopolamine- (SCOP-) induced learning and memory deficit in Kunming mice. Morris water maze results showed that oral administration of STS (10 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg) and Donepezil shortened escape latency, increased crossing times of the original position of the platform, and increased the time spent in the target quadrant. STS decreased the activity of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and increased the activity of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) in the hippocampus and cortex of SCOP-treated mice. Oxidative stress results showed that STS increased the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and decreased the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in hippocampus and cortex. In addition, western blot was carried out to detect the expression of apoptosis related proteins (Bcl-2, Bax, and Caspase-3). STS upregulated the protein expression of Bcl-2 and downregulated the proteins expression of Bax and Caspase-3. These results indicated that STS might become a promising therapeutic candidate for attenuating AD-like pathological dysfunction.
27554805	Therapeutic Strategies for Alzheimer's and Parkinson's Diseases by Means of Drug Delivery Systems.	Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases are prevalent neurodegenerative disorders worldwide, which are essentially related to aging. Within the remarkable era of nanomedicine, nowadays several delivery systems have been suggested to improve the treatment of these disorders, namely, liposomes, micelles, nanoparticles (polymeric, lipid, metallic and inorganic), exosomes, dendrimers and fullerenes. The advantage that has been claimed to these delivery systems is that they facilitate the passage of drugs through the blood brain barrier (BBB), enabling targeting before body degradation, and increasing therapeutic efficacy, comparied to conventional pharmaceutical dosage forms. This review article provides a state of the art regarding the drug delivery systems that have been studied for the treatment of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. It begins with a brief description of the central nervous system (CNS) and the mechanisms involved in the development of these diseases. Later, some examples of drugs used in the treatment of these neurodegenerative diseases are presented, which are currently available in conventional pharmaceutical dosage forms, and in new drug delivery systems that are under development.
27554665	Audiometric evaluation in patients with Alzheimer's disease.	The objective of this study is to assess the validity of ASSR as a complementary diagnostic test for peripheral hearing loss by proving a significant correlation between behavioral thresholds and ASSR. The design used in this study is monocentric prospective study from November 2014 to April 2015. The setting used in this study is the ENT-Head and Neck Surgery Department and Geriatrics Department in a French Regional and University Hospital. The participants are patients over 75 years with cognitive impairment (Alzheimer's disease or mild-cognitive impairment) with a Mini-Mental State Examination score under 27/30 and without hearing aids. Exclusion criteria were: otoscopic and middle ear abnormalities, retro-cochlear lesion, other types of dementia, and central nervous system disease altering cerebral lateralization. The intervention used in this study is pure-tone audiometry, speech audiometry, dichotic listening test, and auditory steady-state responses recording. The correlations between these exams were studied with Pearson's correlation coefficient and Student's t test. Results were significant if p < 0.05. Twenty-three ears were analyzed from 12 patients. There were six women and six men with cognitive impairment, mean age 82.1 (+/-4.6) years, and mean MMSE score that was 21.3/30 (+/-5.7). The correlation between pure-tone audiometry and ASSR was significant for all frequencies: r = 0.55 (p = 0.006) for 500 Hz, r = 0.58 (p = 0.005) for 1000 Hz, r = 0.61 (p = 0.003) for 2000 Hz, and r = 0.66 (p = 0.002) for 4000 Hz. There was no significant correlation between the MMSE and the difference between ASSR and PTA on each frequency. The dichotic listening test showed a right ear advantage (50.9 %, p = 0.039). The ASSR in patients with cognitive impairment and understanding troubles is a promising complementary technique to estimate the hearing thresholds.
27554450	Proteins behaving badly. Substoichiometric molecular control and amplification of the initiation and nature of amyloid fibril formation: lessons from and for blood clotting.	The chief and largely terminal element of normal blood clotting is considered to involve the polymerisation of the mainly alpha-helical fibrinogen to fibrin, with a binding mechanism involving 'knobs and holes' but with otherwise little change in protein secondary structure. We recognise, however, that extremely unusual mutations or mechanical stressing can cause fibrinogen to adopt a conformation containing extensive beta-sheets. Similarly, prions can change morphology from a largely alpha-helical to largely beta-sheet conformation, and the latter catalyses both the transition and the self-organising polymerisation of the beta-sheet structures. Many other proteins can also do this, where it is known as amyloidogenesis. When fibrin is formed in samples from patients harbouring different diseases it can have widely varying diameters and morphologies. We here develop the idea, and summarise the evidence, that in many cases the anomalous fibrin fibre formation seen in such diseases actually amounts to amyloidogenesis. In particular, fibrin can interact with the amyloid-beta (Abeta) protein that is misfolded in Alzheimer's disease. Seeing these unusual fibrin morphologies as true amyloids explains a great deal about fibrin(ogen) biology that was previously opaque, and provides novel strategies for treating such coagulopathies. The literature on blood clotting can usefully both inform and be informed by that on prions and on the many other widely recognised (beta-)amyloid proteins. A preprint has been lodged in bioRxiv (Kell and Pretorius, 2016).
27552136	The role of navigation instruction at intersections for older drivers and those with early Alzheimer's disease.	AIMS: Our purpose was to explore the effect of navigation instruction on older drivers' driving performance at left turn intersections. Left turns at intersections are particularly complex because they require many perceptive and cognitive abilities under considerable time pressure. METHODS: Fifty-four participants were recruited: 18 drivers with early-stage Alzheimer's disease (AD), 18 neurologically healthy older drivers and 18 younger individuals. Various cognitive processes were measured, and 9 left turn maneuvers with or without navigation instruction were evaluated during an in-traffic road test. The psychomotor, planning and decision-making components involved in left turn were also analyzed closely. RESULTS: Only older drivers (both healthy drivers and those with AD) were negatively affected by navigation instruction during the maneuver. The planning and decision-making components were more likely to be affected by the navigation instruction. CONCLUSION: This finding highlights the importance of carefully considering the use of navigation instructions when developing navigation systems. Adapting this instruction is necessary to simplify our understanding of the real-world driving environment and to avoid increasing the cognitive load of older drivers.
27551024	Assessment of Healthcare Decision-making Capacity.	It is often necessary for neuropsychologists, clinical psychologists, and other healthcare professionals to assess an individual's capacity to consent to treatment related to healthcare. This task can be challenging and requires a delicate balance of both respect for individuals' autonomy, as well as the protection of individuals with diminished capacity to make an autonomous decision. The purpose of the present review is to provide an overview of the conceptual model of decisional capacity as well as a brief summary of some of the currently available instruments designed to help evaluate medical decision making. In addition, current empirical literature on the relationship between neuropsychological abilities and decision-making capacity is discussed and a brief set of recommendations is provided to further aid clinicians or consultants when they are required to complete the ethically important but difficult task of making determinations about healthcare decision-making capacity.
27549097	Alzheimer's Drug Discovery Maze: A Snap View of the Past Decade's Diverse Pharmacological Targets for the Disorder.	The discovery of disease modifying anti-Alzheimer's molecules continues to be dared by: disease target multiplicity, downstream neurodegenerative biochemistry complexities, and genotype implications. A confluence of the above ingredients has contributed to a pipeline of creative molecules that regrettably underperform in clinical trials. Thus far, only five palliative pharmacotherapeutic agents, that is, four acetylcholine potentiating agents and an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist are clinically available. In this review we collectively describe the currently suggested targetable pathways for designing anti-Alzheimer's agents (palliative and/or disease modifying). We are prompted to contribute in this manner out of a desire to simplify and consolidate, to a certain extent, the divergent target literature on Alzheimer's drug discovery. We herein provide a summary update and perspective on realized and potentially druggable pharmacological targets for this CNS disorder. This article covers mostly the 2005-2015 medicinal chemistry/pharmacological/biological literature space on the subject.
27547756	Therapies for Prevention and Treatment of Alzheimer's Disease.	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia associated with a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, with a prevalence of 44 million people throughout the world in 2015, and this figure is estimated to double by 2050. This disease is characterized by blood-brain barrier disruption, oxidative stress, mitochondrial impairment, neuroinflammation, and hypometabolism; it is related to amyloid-beta peptide accumulation and tau hyperphosphorylation as well as a decrease in acetylcholine levels and a reduction of cerebral blood flow. Obesity is a major risk factor for AD, because it induces adipokine dysregulation, which consists of the release of the proinflammatory adipokines and decreased anti-inflammatory adipokines, among other processes. The pharmacological treatments for AD can be divided into two categories: symptomatic treatments such as acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists and etiology-based treatments such as secretase inhibitors, amyloid binders, and tau therapies. Strategies for prevention of AD through nonpharmacological treatments are associated with lifestyle interventions such as exercise, mental challenges, and socialization as well as caloric restriction and a healthy diet. AD is an important health issue on which all people should be informed so that prevention strategies that minimize the risk of its development may be implemented.
27546928	Pharmacogenetic effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors over age-related urea and creatinine variations in patients with dementia due to Alzheimer disease.	BACKGROUND: Renal function declines according to age and vascular risk factors, whereas few data are available regarding genetically-mediated effects of anti-hypertensives over renal function. OBJECTIVE: To estimate urea and creatinine variations in dementia due to Alzheimer disease (AD) by way of a pharmacogenetic analysis of the anti-hypertensive effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEis). METHODS: Consecutive outpatients older than 60 years-old with AD and no history of kidney transplant or dialytic therapy were recruited for prospective correlations regarding variations in fasting blood levels of urea and creatinine in one year, considering ACE genotypes of rs1800764 and rs4291 and their respective haplotypes, and treatment with ACEis along with blood pressure variations. RESULTS: For 190 patients, 152 had arterial hypertension, and 122 used ACEis. Minor allele frequencies were 0.492 for rs1800764-C and 0.337 for rs4291-T, both in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. There were no overall significant yearly variations in levels of urea and creatinine, but their concurrent variations were positively correlated (rho <0.0001). Each A allele of rs4291 led to an yearly urea increase of 3,074 mg/dL, and an yearly creatinine increase of 0.044 mg/dL, while the use of ACEis was protective regarding creatinine variations. The use of ACEis was also protective for carriers of rs1800764-CT/rs4291-AA, while carriers of rs1800764-CT/rs4291-AT had steeper reductions in creatinine levels, particularly when they were treated with ACEis. CONCLUSIONS: Effects of ACEis over creatinine variations are genetically mediated and independent of blood pressure variations in older people with AD.
27545218	MicroRNA-613 regulates the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor in Alzheimer's disease.	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive loss of memory and other cognitive functions and presents an increasing clinical challenge in terms of diagnosis and treatment. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) plays an important role in neuronal survival and proliferation. In the present study, the mRNA and protein expression level of BDNF was detected in serum, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), dementia of Alzheimer's type (DAT), and hippocampus in APP/PS1 mice. A significant decrease of BDNF mRNA and protein expression was observed in serum and CSF of patients and hippocampus in APP/PS1 mice compared with the corresponding controls. miR-613, which is predicted to target the 3'-UTR of BDNF, was also detected in patients and the mouse model. Opposite to the alteration of BDNF, miR-613 expression in serum, CSF and hippocampus were obviously increased compared to the controls. In conclusion, these findings showed that miR-613 may function in the development of AD and may provide new insights in diagnosis and treatment of AD.
27544960	Preventing and diagnosing dementia.	While dementia is an umbrella term for a range of degenerative brain disorders, many share similar presentations. Nurses are ideally placed to identify those at risk and empower them to access treatment and plan and prepare for their future needs--as such, they need up-to-date knowledge of the signs and symptoms of the different types of dementia to identify risk factors and make an informed diagnosis. This article, the third in a four-part series on dementia, examines the risk factors, signs, symptoms and diagnosis of dementia, as well as outlining lifestyle factors such as diet and exercise that may help to prevent the development of the condition.
27543772	The topography of cortical microbleeds in frontotemporal lobar degeneration: a post-mortem 7.0-tesla magnetic resonance study.	INTRODUCTION: Cerebrovascular lesions are rare in frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), in contrast to other neurodegenerative diseases. Cortical microbleeds (CoMBs) are frequent in Alzheimer's disease, in particular in cases associated with cerebral amyloid angiopathy. The present study investigates the gyral topographic distribution of CoMBs in post-mortem FTLD brains with 7.0-tesla magnetic resonance imaging. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The distribution of CoMBs in 11 post-mortem FTLD brains and in 12 control brains was compared on T2*-GRE MRI of six coronal sections of a cerebral hemisphere. The mean values of CoMBs were determined in twenty-two different gyri. The findings were correlated to those separately observed on neuropathological examination. RESULTS: As a whole there was a trend of more CoMBs in the prefrontal section of FTLD as well as of the control brains. CoMBs were significantly increased in the superior frontal gyrus and the insular cortex (p </= 0.001) and also in the inferior frontal gyrus and the superior temporal gyrus (p </= 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: CoMBs in FTLD are only increased in the regions mainly affected by the neurodegenerative lesions. They probably do not reflect additional cerebrovascular disease.
27543771	Survival in the pre-senile dementia frontotemporal lobar degeneration with TDP-43 proteinopathy: effects of genetic, demographic and neuropathological variables.	Factors associated with survival were studied in 84 neuropathologically documented cases of the pre-senile dementia frontotemporal dementia lobar degeneration (FTLD) with transactive response (TAR) DNA-binding protein of 43 kDa (TDP-43) proteinopathy (FTLD-TDP). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis estimated mean survival as 7.9 years (range: 1-19 years, SD = 4.64). Familial and sporadic cases exhibited similar survival, including progranulin (GRN) gene mutation cases. No significant differences in survival were associated with sex, disease onset, Braak disease stage, or disease subtype, but higher survival was associated with lower post-mortem brain weight. Survival was significantly reduced in cases with associated motor neuron disease (FTLD-MND) but increased with Alzheimer's disease (AD) or hippocampal sclerosis (HS) co-morbidity. Cox regression analysis suggested that reduced survival was associated with increased densities of neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions (NCI) while increased survival was associated with greater densities of enlarged neurons (EN) in the frontal and temporal lobes. The data suggest that: (1) survival in FTLD-TDP is more prolonged than typical in pre-senile dementia but shorter than some clinical subtypes such as the semantic variant of primary progressive aphasia (svPPA), (2) MND co-morbidity predicts poor survival, and (3) NCI may develop early and EN later in the disease. The data have implications for both neuropathological characterization and subtyping of FTLD-TDP.
27541017	miR-98-5p Acts as a Target for Alzheimer's Disease by Regulating Abeta Production Through Modulating SNX6 Expression.	Accumulation of amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) in the brain of Alzheimer disease (AD) patients is believed to be the main pathological feature of the disease. Meanwhile, miR-98-5p dysregulation was found in AD. However, whether miR-98-5p is involved in the accumulation of Abeta in AD, the underlying molecule mechanism remains unclear. In the present study, we confirmed that miR-98-5p negatively regulated sorting nexin 6 (SNX6) expression by targeting the 3'-UTR of SNX6 mRNA. Downregulation of miR-98-5p alleviated Abeta-induced viability inhibition and decreased apoptosis in SK-N-SH and SH-SY5Y cells by upregulating SNX6 expression. Furthermore, downregulation of miR-98-5p decreased SNX6-dependent levels of Abeta40, Abeta42, beta-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), soluble amyloid precursor protein beta (sAPPbeta), and membrane-associated APP beta-carboxyl terminal fragment (betaCTF) in SK-N-SH and HEK293 cells. Our findings demonstrate that miR-98-5p modulates SNX6 expression and thus plays a critical role in accumulation of Abeta. Therefore, miR-98-5p may be a novel therapeutic target for AD.
27540175	Cardiometabolic risk loci share downstream cis- and trans-gene regulation across tissues and diseases.	Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified hundreds of cardiometabolic disease (CMD) risk loci. However, they contribute little to genetic variance, and most downstream gene-regulatory mechanisms are unknown. We genotyped and RNA-sequenced vascular and metabolic tissues from 600 coronary artery disease patients in the Stockholm-Tartu Atherosclerosis Reverse Networks Engineering Task study (STARNET). Gene expression traits associated with CMD risk single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) identified by GWAS were more extensively found in STARNET than in tissue- and disease-unspecific gene-tissue expression studies, indicating sharing of downstream cis-/trans-gene regulation across tissues and CMDs. In contrast, the regulatory effects of other GWAS risk SNPs were tissue-specific; abdominal fat emerged as an important gene-regulatory site for blood lipids, such as for the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and coronary artery disease risk gene PCSK9 STARNET provides insights into gene-regulatory mechanisms for CMD risk loci, facilitating their translation into opportunities for diagnosis, therapy, and prevention.
27540165	How neuroinflammation contributes to neurodegeneration.	Neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and frontotemporal lobar dementia are among the most pressing problems of developed societies with aging populations. Neurons carry out essential functions such as signal transmission and network integration in the central nervous system and are the main targets of neurodegenerative disease. In this Review, I address how the neuron's environment also contributes to neurodegeneration. Maintaining an optimal milieu for neuronal function rests with supportive cells termed glia and the blood-brain barrier. Accumulating evidence suggests that neurodegeneration occurs in part because the environment is affected during disease in a cascade of processes collectively termed neuroinflammation. These observations indicate that therapies targeting glial cells might provide benefit for those afflicted by neurodegenerative disorders.
27539678	Sphingosine kinase inhibitors: a review of patent literature (2006-2015).	INTRODUCTION: Sphingosine kinase (SphK1 & SphK2) is the sole source of the pleiotropic lipid mediator, sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P). S1P has been implicated in a variety of diseases such as cancer, Alzheimer's disease, sickle cell disease and fibrosis and thus the biosynthetic route to S1P is a logical target for drug discovery. Areas covered: In this review, the authors consider the SphK inhibitor patent literature from 2006-2016 Q1 with the emphasis on composition of matter utility patents. The Espacenet database was queried with the search term 'sphingosine AND kinase' to identify relevant literature. Expert opinion: Early inhibitor discovery focused on SphK1 with a bias towards oncology indications. Structurally, the reported inhibitors occupy the sphingosine 'J-shaped' binding pocket. The lack of cytotoxicity with improved SphK1 inhibitors raises doubt about the enzyme as an oncology target. SphK2 inhibitors are featured in more recent patent applications. Interestingly, both SphK1 and SphK2 inhibition and gene 'knockout' share opposing effects on circulating S1P levels: SphK1 inhibition/gene ablation decreases, while SphK2 inhibition/gene ablation increases, blood S1P. As understanding of S1P's physiological roles increases and more drug-like SphK inhibitors emerge, inhibiting one or both SphK isotypes could provide unique strategies for treating disease.
27539488	No Association of Lower Hippocampal Volume With Alzheimer's Disease Pathology in Late-Life Depression.	OBJECTIVE: Hippocampal volume is commonly decreased in late-life depression. According to the depression-as-late-life-neuropsychiatric-disorder model, lower hippocampal volume in late-life depression is associated with neurodegenerative changes. The purpose of this prospective study was to examine whether lower hippocampal volume in late-life depression is associated with Alzheimer's disease pathology. METHOD: Of 108 subjects who participated, complete, good-quality data sets were available for 100: 48 currently depressed older adults and 52 age- and gender-matched healthy comparison subjects who underwent structural MRI, [18F]flutemetamol amyloid positron emission tomography imaging, apolipoprotein E genotyping, and neuropsychological assessment. Hippocampal volumes were defined manually and normalized for total intracranial volume. Amyloid binding was quantified using the standardized uptake value ratio in one cortical composite volume of interest. The authors investigated group differences in hippocampal volume (both including and excluding amyloid-positive participants), group differences in amyloid uptake and in the proportion of positive amyloid scans, and the association between hippocampal volume and cortical amyloid uptake. RESULTS: A significant difference was observed in mean normalized total hippocampal volume between patients and comparison subjects, but there were no group differences in cortical amyloid uptake or proportion of amyloid-positive subjects. The difference in hippocampal volume remained significant after the amyloid-positive subjects were excluded. There was no association between hippocampal volume and amyloid uptake in either patients or comparison subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Lower hippocampal volume was not related to amyloid pathology in this sample of patients with late-life depression. These data counter the common belief that changes in hippocampal volume in late-life depression are due to prodromal Alzheimer's disease.
27539377	Cognitive Reserve as a Modifier of Clinical Expression in Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy: A Preliminary Examination.	This study conducted a preliminary examination on cognitive reserve (CR) as a modifier of symptom expression in subjects with autopsy-confirmed chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). The sample included 25 former professional football players neuropathologically diagnosed with CTE stage III or IV. Next of kin interviews ascertained age at cognitive and behavioral/mood symptom onset and demographic/athletic characteristics. Years of education and occupational attainment defined CR. High occupational achievement predicted later age at cognitive (p=0.02) and behavioral/mood (p=0.02) onset. Education was not an individual predictor. These preliminary findings suggest that CR may forestall the clinical manifestation of CTE.
27537597	Education and risk of incident dementia during the premotor and motor phases of essential tremor (NEDICES).	Individuals with late-onset essential tremor (ET) (e.g., older adults) seem to have an increased prevalence of mild cognitive impairment and dementia, and a higher risk of incident dementia. It is well-known that education has a protective role against dementia in individuals without a pre-existing neurologic disorder, but evidence regarding the maintenance of this effect during the premotor and motor phases of ET is unknown. Our aim was to determine the influence of education on the risk of dementia in a population-based cohort of ET patients and controls. In a prospective study (Neurological Disorders in Central Spain), participants >/=65 years old were evaluated twice: at baseline (1994-1995) and at follow-up (1997-1998). There were 3 groups: premotor (i.e., participants first diagnosed with incident ET at follow-up), prevalent ET (i.e., participants diagnosed with ET at baseline and at follow-up), and controls. Participants were stratified into lower education (</=primary studies) versus higher education (>/=secondary studies) categories. Dementia risk was estimated using Cox proportional-hazards models (higher education control group = reference category). Among the participants, 3878 had a mean duration of follow-up of 3.2 years. Eight (16.7%) of 48 lower education premotor ET patients developed incident dementia versus 1 (3.3%) of 30 higher education premotor ET patients, 9 (7.1%) of 126 lower education prevalent ET patients, 7 (8.8%) of 80 higher education prevalent ET patients, and 92 (4.9%) of 1892 lower education controls (P < 0.001). In comparison to the higher education controls, the adjusted hazard ratios for incident dementia were 5.84 (lower education premotor ET, P < 0.001); 1.36 (higher education premotor ET, P = 0.76); 2.13 (lower education prevalent ET, P = 0.04); 2.79 (higher education prevalent ET, P = 0.01); and 1.66 (lower education controls, P = 0.01). Our results suggest that a higher educational attainment may ameliorate the risk of incident dementia during the premotor phase of ET, but not in the motor phase.
27537582	Growth differentiation factor-15 and white matter hyperintensities in cognitive impairment and dementia.	Vascular pathology plays an important role in the development of cognitive decline and dementia. In this context, growth differentiation factor-15 (GDF-15) has been suggested to be a biomarker due to its regulatory roles in inflammatory and trophic responses during tissue injury. However, limited data exist on the associations of GDF-15 with either cerebrovascular disease (CeVD) burden or the spectrum of cognitive impairment. Therefore, we aimed to study peripheral levels of GDF-15 incognitive impairment no dementia (CIND) or Alzheimer disease (AD) subjects assessed for CeVD using a case-control cohort design, with cases recruited from memory clinics and controls from memory clinics and the community. All subjects underwent detailed neuropsychological assessment, 3-Tesla magnetic resonance imaging, and venous blood draw. Subjects were classified as CIND or AD based on clinical criteria, while significant CeVD was defined as the presence of cortical infarcts and/or 2 lacunes or more, and/or confluent white matter hyperintensities (WMHs) in 2 or more brain regions. A total of 324 subjects were included in the study, of whom 80 had no cognitive impairment, 144 CIND and 100with AD. Higher GDF-15 levels were significantly associated with disease groups, especially in the presence of CeVD, namely, CIND with CeVD (odds ratios [OR]: 7.21; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.14-24.27) and AD with CeVD (OR: 21.87; 95% CI: 2.01-237.43). Among the different CeVD markers, only WMH was associated with higher GDF-15 levels (OR: 3.97; 95% CI: 1.79-8.83). The associations between GDF-15 and cognitive impairment as well as with WMH remained significant after excluding subjects with cardiovascular diseases. In conclusion, we showed that increased GDF-15 may be a biomarker for CIND and AD in subjects with WMH.
27528056	MicroRNAs: Key Players in Microglia and Astrocyte Mediated Inflammation in CNS Pathologies.	The significance of microglia and astrocytes in neural development, in maintaining synaptic connections and homeostasis in the healthy brain is well established. Microglia are dynamic immune cells of the brain that elicit an immune response during brain damage and also participate in tissue repair and regeneration, while astrocytes contribute to the local inflammatory response by producing proinflammatory cytokines and resolving neuronal damage through production of anti-inflammatory cytokines and neurotrophic factors. Recent efforts have focused on elucidating the epigenetic mechanisms which regulate glial cell behavior in normal and pathologic states. An important class of epigenetic regulators is microRNAs (miRNAs) which are small non-coding RNA molecules that regulate gene expression posttranscriptionally. Certain dysregulated miRNAs contribute to chronic microglial inflammation in the brain, thereby leading to progression of neurological diseases like Alzheimer's disease, traumatic injury, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and stroke. Further, several miRNAs are differentially expressed in astrocytes after ischemia and spinal cord injury. Despite knowledge about miRNAs in neuroinflammation, little is known about effective delivery routes and pharmacokinetic data for miRNA based therapeutics. This review summarizes the current research on the role of miRNAs in promoting and inhibiting inflammatory response of microglia and astrocytes in a disease-specific manner. In addition, miRNA delivery as a therapeutic strategy to treat neuroinflammation is discussed.
27525638	The Potential of Gonadal Hormone Signalling Pathways as Therapeutics for Dementia.	Dementia is an ever-expanding problem facing an ageing society. Currently, there is a sharp paucity of treatment strategies. It has long been known that sex hormones, namely 17beta-estradiol and testosterone, possess neuroprotective- and cognitive-enhancing qualities. However, certain lacunae in the knowledge underlying their molecular mechanisms have delayed their use as treatment strategies in dementia. With recent advancements in pharmacology and molecular biology, especially in the development of safer selective oestrogen receptor modulators and the recent discovery of the small-molecule brain-derived neurotrophic factor receptor agonist, 7,8-dihydroxyflavone, the exploitation of these signalling pathways for clinical use has become possible. This review aims to adumbrate the evidence and hurdles underscoring the use of sex hormones in the treatment of dementia as well as discussing some direction that is required to advance the translation of evidence into practise.
27524028	Immunosensor for diagnosis of Alzheimer disease using amyloid-beta 1-40 peptide and silk fibroin thin films.	Layer-by-Layer (LbL) films containing silk fibroin (SF) and the 40 aminoacid-long amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta1-40) were prepared with the purpose of developing a new prototype of an electrochemical immunosensor. The film showed a satisfactory growth in quartz substrate and screen-printed carbon electrodes, as observed by UV-vis spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetric, respectively. The peptide immobilized in LbL films in junction with SF shows secondary structure induced, as shown by circular dichroism measurements, favoring the interaction SF/peptide LbL film with the specific antibody. Immunosensor showed a linear response in the presence of the antibody with concentrations from 0 to 10ngmL(-1) both analyzed by current changes in 0.3V and voltammogram area. This system can be applied as a new prototype for preliminary diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.
27523508	Psychometric Properties of Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale for Mild Cognitive Impairment and Mild Alzheimer's Disease Patients in an Asian Context.	INTRODUCTION: The purpose of the current study is to assess the psychometric properties of Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog) on patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and mild Alzheimer's disease (AD) in a multicultural Asian context. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty-four mild AD patients (mean age +/- SD; 72.24 +/- 7.88 years), 80 MCI patients (66.44 +/- 7.45 years) and 125 healthy controls (HCs) (61.81 +/- 6.96 years) participated in the study. Participants underwent a clinical interview and serial neuropsychological testing. ADAS-Cog total and subtest scores were compared across the 3 groups. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis were performed and sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive values (PPVs) and negative predictive values (NPVs) were calculated. RESULTS: Patients with MCI attained significantly worse neuropsychological test scores than healthy controls but significantly better results than patients with mild AD on ADAS-Cog total score, subtest items, and the delayed recall item (P <0.001). The best cutoff score to differentiate between MCI and HC was >/=4 (sensitivity = 0.73, specificity = 0.69, PPV = 0.90, NPV = 0.40), while the best cutoff score to distinguish between MCI and mild AD was >/=12 (sensitivity = 0.86, specificity = 0.89, PPV = 0.99, NPV = 0.32). Evidence of internal consistency of the ADAS-Cog (Cronbach alpha = 0.85) as well as convergent validity with the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) (rho = -0.75) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) (rho = -0.81) (both P <0.001) was also found. CONCLUSION: The ADAS-Cog which is widely used in clinical trials is applicable to the Asian cohort. It is useful in the detection of MCI and mild AD as well as in distinguishing these 2 conditions.
27522696	New approaches to understanding dementia.	Improving understanding of brain disorders is likely to be one of the core aims of physiological research in the 21st century. This article, the second in a four-part series, looks at the main types of dementia and explores emerging theories about how the condition develops. These theories are improving our understanding of the neurodegeneration that characterises the most common forms of dementia, and will help improve care for those living with dementia.
27522594	Expression Profiles of SIRT1 and APP Genes in Human Neuroblastoma SK-N-SH Cells Treated with Two Epigenetic Agents.	In our previous studies, significant hypermethylation of the sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) gene and demethylation of the beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP) gene were found in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) compared with the normal population. Moreover, the expression of SIRT1 was significantly decreased while that of APP was increased in AD patients. These results indicated a correlation of DNA methylation with gene expression levels in AD patients. To further investigate the epigenetic mechanism of gene modulation in AD, we used two epigenetic drugs, the DNA methylation inhibitor 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (DAC) and the histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA), to treat human neuroblastoma SK-N-SH cells in the presence of amyloid beta-peptide Abeta25-35(Abeta25-35). We found that DAC and TSA had different effects on the expression trends of SIRT1 and APP in the cell model of amyloid toxicity. Although other genes, such as microtubule-associated protein tau, presenilin 1, presenilin 2, and apolipoprotein E, were up-regulated after Abeta25-35 treatment, no significant differences were found after DAC and/or TSA treatment. These results support the evidence in AD patients and reveal a strong correlation of SIRT1/APP expression with DNA methylation and/or histone modification, which may help understand the pathogenesis of AD.
27515055	Attenuation of Abeta toxicity by promotion of mitochondrial fusion in neuroblastoma cells by liquiritigenin.	Mitochondrial dynamics control mitochondrial morphology and function, and aberrations in these are associated with various neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. To identify novel regulators of mitochondrial dynamics, we screened a phytochemical library and identified liquiritigenin as a potent inducer of mitochondrial fusion. Treatment with liquiritigenin induced an elongated mitochondrial morphology in SK-N-MC cells. In addition, liquiritigenin rescued mitochondrial fragmentation induced by knockout of mitochondrial fusion mediators such as Mfn1, Mfn2, and Opa1. Furthermore, we found that treatment with liquiritigenin notably inhibited mitochondrial fragmentation and cytotoxicity induced by Abeta in SK-N-MC cells.
27515053	Activin A secreted by human mesenchymal stem cells induces neuronal development and neurite outgrowth in an in vitro model of Alzheimer's disease: neurogenesis induced by MSCs via activin A.	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by progressive loss of memory in addition to cortical atrophy. Cortical atrophy in AD brains begins in the parietal and temporal lobes, which are near the subventricular zone (SVZ). The aim of this study was to activate the neurogenesis in the SVZ of AD brains by human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs). Neural stem cells (NSCs) were isolated from SVZ of 4-month-old 5XFAD mice. Co-culture of hMSCs with SVZ-derived NSCs from 5XFAD mice induced neuronal development and neurite outgrowth. To examine the inducing factor of neurogenesis, human cytokine array was performed with co-cultured media, and revealed elevated release of activin A from hMSCs. Also, we confirmed that the mRNA levels of activin A and activin receptor in the SVZ of 5XFAD mice were significantly lower than normal mice. Treatment of human recombinant activin A in SVZ-derived NSCs from 5XFAD mice induced neuronal development and neurite outgrowth. These data suggest that use of hMSCs and activin A to recover neurogenesis in future studies of cortical regeneration to treat AD.
27514526	A Conceptualization of the Utility of Subjective Cognitive Decline in Clinical Trials of Preclinical Alzheimer's Disease.	This commentary outlines a conceptual model for subjective cognitive decline (SCD) in relation to Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers in the preclinical stages of disease and a framework for effectively utilizing SCD in secondary prevention clinical trials. Mounting evidence supports the notion that SCD is sensitive to encroaching Abeta-amyloid and neurodegeneration. SCD has also been shown to provide additive information of AD-dementia risk beyond what is known about the biomarker status of the individual. Thus, we provide recommendations for the implementing SCD measurement in clinical trials. We argue that SCD can be measured at three catch points within the course of the clinical trial: firstly, at the initial recruitment and screening phase; secondly, to create more robust estimates of rates of AD-dementia progression; and finally, to measure subjective experiences of cognitive change and quality of life over the course of the trial as a proxy of clinically meaningful functional improvement. We provide recommendations of how SCD can be approached at each of these points. SCD is an important component of the preclinical AD-dementia trajectory. Future studies need to elucidate the interactive influence of Abeta-amyloid and tau on SCD from a spatiotemporal perspective. Even as this evidence accrues, it is clear that SCD can provide unique and additive information about rates of progression and subjectively experienced cognitive change within clinical trials.
27511740	SolCos model-based individual reminiscence for older adults with mild to moderate dementia in nursing homes: a randomized controlled intervention study.	WHAT IS KNOWN ON THE SUBJECT?: To stimulate reminiscence of older adults with dementia performed individually or through group sessions is a well-known practice in nursing homes resulting in effects on behaviour and well-being as an alternative for medication. Robust scientific proof of the effectiveness of individual reminiscence therapy performed in nursing homes is sparse. WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS TO EXISTING KNOWLEDGE?: We have provided individual standardized reminiscence therapy to residents with dementia. The therapy was developed and tested in a previous study and performed in this study by trained nursing home volunteers. In comparison with a control group who received usual care, residents who received the reminiscence therapy showed significant less depressive symptoms. Moreover, residents were, in general, attentive, open and collaborative during the sessions and volunteers experienced the sessions as useful and pleasant. WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE?: Individual reminiscence therapy can be learned and used by nursing home volunteers to improve care in nursing homes. ABSTRACT: Aim To investigate the effect of a standardized individualized intervention based on the SolCos transformational reminiscence model on depressive symptoms (primary outcome), cognition and behaviour (secondary outcomes) for older people with mild to moderate dementia, performed by trained nursing home volunteers as facilitators. Background Because of limited pharmacological treatment options for older adults with dementia relevant physical, sensory, psychological or social interventions offer alternative opportunities. Method Randomized controlled trial (ISRCTN74355073) was set up in two nursing homes with 29 and 31 residents in the intervention and the control groups respectively. Eighteen nursing home volunteers were trained to perform the reminiscence therapy. Various assessment scales were measured pre- and post-sessions. Results Linear regression analysis showed an impact on depressive symptoms. However, no impact was identified on cognition and behaviour. Facilitators experienced the sessions as useful and pleasant, and study participants were, in general, attentive, open and collaborative. Discussion Study results showed that organizing standardized individual reminiscence therapy with nursing home volunteers was feasible and study participants' attention and participation were overall good. Further study initiatives to explore the potential of individual reminiscence therapy within a person-centred framework are recommended in order to improve care in nursing homes.
27511317	Potential fluid biomarkers for pathological brain changes in Alzheimer's disease: Implication for the screening of cognitive frailty.	Cognitive frailty (CF) overlaps with early neuropathological alterations associated with agingrelated major neurocognitive disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Fluid biomarkers for these pathological brain alterations allow for early diagnosis in the preclinical stages of AD, and for objective prognostic assessments in clinical intervention trials. These biomarkers may also be helpful in the screening of CF. The present study reviewed the literature and identified systematic reviews of cohort studies and other authoritative reports. The selection criteria for potentially suitable fluid biomarkers included: i) Frequent use in studies of fluidderived markers and ii) evidence of novel measurement techniques for fluidderived markers. The present study focused on studies that assessed these biomarkers in AD, mild cognitive impairment and nonAD demented subjects. At present, widely used fluid biomarkers include cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), total tau, phosphorylated tau and amyloidbeta levels. With the development of novel measurement techniques and improvements in understanding regarding the mechanisms underlying agingrelated major neurocognitive disorders, numerous novel biomarkers associated with various aspects of AD neuropathology are being explored. These include specific measurements of Abeta oligomer or monomer forms, tau proteins in the peripheral plasma and CSF, and novel markers of synaptic dysfunction, neuronal damage and apoptosis, neuronal activity alteration, neuroinflammation, blood brain barrier dysfunction, oxidative stress, metabolites, mitochondrial function and aberrant lipid metabolism. The proposed panels of fluid biomarkers may be useful in the early diagnosis of AD, prediction of the progression of AD from preclinical stages to the dementia stage, and the differentiation of AD from nonAD dementia. In combination with physical frailty, the present study surmised that these biomarkers may also be used as biomarkers for CF, thus contribute to discovering causes and informing interventions for cognitive impairment in individuals with CF.
27508398	Impairment of fine motor dexterity in mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease dementia: association with activities of daily living.	OBJECTIVE: Cognitive impairment is a hallmark of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease dementia (AD). Although the cognitive profile of these patients and its association with activities of daily living (ADLs) is well documented, few studies have assessed deficits in fine motor dexterity and their association with ADL performance. The objective of this research paper is to evaluate fine motor dexterity performance among MCI and AD patients and to investigate its association with different aspects of ADLs. METHODS: We assessed normal aging controls, patients with multiple- and single-domain amnestic MCI (aMCI), and patients with mild AD. Fine motor dexterity was measured with the Nine-Hole Peg Test and cognitive functioning by the Mattis Dementia Rating Scale. We analyzed the data using general linear models. RESULTS: Patients with AD or multiple-domain aMCI had slower motor responses when compared to controls. AD patients were slower than those with single-domain aMCI. We found associations between cognition and instrumental ADLs, and between fine motor dexterity and self-care ADLs. CONCLUSION: We observed progressive slowing of fine motor dexterity along the normal aging-MCI-AD spectrum, which was associated with autonomy in self-care ADLs.
27506761	Applied multimodal diagnostics in a case of presenile dementia.	BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia in the elderly. The possibility of disease-modifying strategies has evoked a need for early and accurate diagnosis. To improve the accuracy of the clinical diagnosis of AD, biomarkers like cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and neuroimaging techniques like magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) have been incorporated into the diagnostic guidelines of AD. CASE PRESENTATION: In this case report we outline in reference to one of our patients with presenile dementia the current approaches to the diagnosis of AD. The patient was a 59-year old woman presenting with progressive memory decline. CSF-Abeta42 was normal while P-tau was slightly increased. FDG-PET indicated a pattern typical for AD, amyloid-PET showed an extensive global amyloid load, and tau-PET depicted a pronounced hippocampal tracer accumulation. The MRI scan was rated as normal at routine diagnostics, however quantitative volumetric analysis revealed significant atrophy especially of the parietal lobe. The combination of biomarkers and neuroimaging techniques was therefore suggestive of an underlying AD pathology. CONCLUSIONS: To enable early and accurate diagnosis of AD and thereby also patient recruitment for anti-tau or anti-beta-amyloid therapeutic trials, a combination of biomarkers and neuroimaging techniques seems useful.
27506385	Predicting gene targets from integrative analyses of summary data from GWAS and eQTL studies for 28 human complex traits.	Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified hundreds of genetic variants associated with complex traits and diseases. However, elucidating the causal genes underlying GWAS hits remains challenging. We applied the summary data-based Mendelian randomization (SMR) method to 28 GWAS summary datasets to identify genes whose expression levels were associated with traits and diseases due to pleiotropy or causality (the expression level of a gene and the trait are affected by the same causal variant at a locus). We identified 71 genes, of which 17 are novel associations (no GWAS hit within 1 Mb distance of the genes). We integrated all the results in an online database ( http://www.cnsgenomics/shiny/SMRdb/ ), providing important resources to prioritize genes for further follow-up, for example in functional studies.
27505179	[Access to medicines for Alzheimer's disease provided by the Brazilian Unified National Health System in Minas Gerais State, Brazil].	This study evaluated barriers to access to treatment for Alzheimer's disease based on administrative cases involving cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEIs) and submitted to the Minas Gerais State Health Secretariat in Brazil in 2012 and 2013. Drawing on data from 165 randomly selected cases, the study addressed the following dimensions of access: geographic accessibility, accommodation, acceptability, availability, and affordability. The administrative processing to supply ChEIs took an average of 39 days and was influenced by characteristics of the path taken by the user. The majority of the prescribers met less than 80% of the required criteria in the Clinical Protocol and Therapeutic Guidelines (CPTG) for Alzheimer's disease. As a result, 38% of requests for medication were denied. Private treatment with ChEIs cost the equivalent of 21 days of the monthly minimum wage. In conclusion, bureaucratic administrative procedures and prescribers' difficulty in following the CPTG hindered access to treatment of Alzheimer's disease and imposed a heavy burden on patients' pockets.
27505094	Alzheimer's disease: presence and role of microRNAs.	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that accounts for the most cases of dementia. AD affects more than 25 million people globally and is predicted to affect nearly one in 85 people worldwide by 2050. AD is characterized by the accumulation of dense plaques of beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) and neurofibrillary tangles of hyperphosphorylated tau that cause impairment in memory, cognition, and daily activities. Although early-onset AD has been linked to several mutations, reliable genetic markers for late-onset AD are lacking. Further, the diagnosis of AD biomarkers has its limitations and cannot detect early-stage AD. The identification of accurate, early, and non-invasive biomarkers for AD is, therefore, an unmet challenge. Recently, microRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as a novel class of gene regulatory elements with conserved roles in development and disease. Recent discoveries have uncovered roles of miRNAs in several model organisms during aging and have identified potential miRNAs biomarkers of AD. Here we will discuss this emerging field of miRNAs associated with AD and prospects for the future.
27503326	Inhibition of ADAM10 promotes the clearance of Abeta across the BBB by reducing LRP1 ectodomain shedding.	BACKGROUND: Transport across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is an important mediator of beta-amyloid (Abeta) accumulation in the brain and a contributing factor in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). One of the receptors responsible for the transport of Abeta in the BBB is the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1). LRP1 is susceptible to proteolytic shedding at the cell surface, which prevents endocytic transport of ligands. Previously, we reported a strong inverse correlation between LRP1 shedding in the brain and Abeta transit across the BBB. Several proteases contribute to the ectodomain shedding of LRP1 including the alpha-secretase, a desintegrin and metalloproteinase domain containing protein 10 (ADAM10). METHODS: The role of ADAM10 in the shedding of LRP1 and Abeta BBB clearance was assessed through pharmacological inhibition of ADAM10 in an in vitro model of the BBB and through the use of ADAM10 endothelial specific knock-out mice. In addition, an acute treatment paradigm with an ADAM10 inhibitor was also tested in an AD mouse model to assess the effect of ADAM10 inhibition on LRP1 shedding and Abetabrain accumulation. RESULTS: In the current studies, inhibition of ADAM10 reduced LRP1 shedding in brain endothelial cultures and increased Abeta42 transit across an in vitro model of the BBB. Similarly, transgenic ADAM10 endothelial knockout mice displayed lower LRP1 shedding in the brain and significantly enhanced Abeta clearance across the BBB compared to wild-type animals. Acute treatment with the ADAM10-selective inhibitor GI254023X in an AD mouse model substantially reduced brain LRP1 shedding and increased Abeta40 levels in the plasma, indicating enhanced Abeta transit from the brain to the periphery. Furthermore, both soluble and insoluble Abeta40 and Abeta42 brain levels were decreased following GI254023X treatment, but these effects lacked statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS: These studies demonstrate a role for ADAM10 in the ectodomain shedding of LRP1 in the brain and the clearance of Abeta across the BBB, which may provide a novel strategy for attenuating Abeta accumulation in the AD brain.
27502303	Update on Vascular Dementia.	Vascular dementia (VaD) is a major contributor to the dementia syndrome and is described as having problems with reasoning, planning, judgment, and memory caused by impaired blood flow to the brain and damage to the blood vessels resulting from events such as stroke. There are a variety of etiologies that contribute to the development of vascular cognitive impairment and VaD, and these are often associated with other dementia-related pathologies such as Alzheimer disease. The diagnosis of VaD is difficult due to the number and types of lesions and their locations in the brain. Factors that increase the risk of vascular diseases such as stroke, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and smoking also raise the risk of VaD. Therefore, controlling these risk factors can help lower the chances of developing VaD. This update describes the subtypes of VaD, with details of their complex presentation, associated pathological lesions, and issues with diagnosis, prevention, and treatment.
27502301	Parkinson Disease and Dementia.	Dementia is a frequent complication of Parkinson disease (PD) with a yearly incidence of around 10% of patients with PD. Lewy body pathology is the most important factor in the development of Parkinson disease dementia (PDD) and there is evidence for a synergistic effect with beta-amyloid. The clinical phenotype in PDD extends beyond the dysexecutive syndrome that is often present in early PD and encompasses deficits in recognition memory, attention, and visual perception. Sleep disturbances, hallucinations, neuroleptic sensitivity, and fluctuations are often present. This review provides an update on current knowledge of PDD including aspects of epidemiology, pathology, clinical presentation, management, and prognosis.
27502300	Imaging in Dementia With Lewy Bodies: An Overview.	Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) while common in older age can present a diagnostic challenge to clinicians and is often misdiagnosed as Alzheimer disease (AD). Imaging studies have improved our understanding of the neurobiological changes in DLB during life and how they differ from AD. This has led to significant advances in the development of new techniques, such as dopaminergic imaging, which can aid the clinical diagnosis. Other functional imaging methods also show promise in helping to assess the influence of differing pathologies in DLB, most notably, AD-related and vascular pathology during life. This article will provide an overview of the main imaging findings in DLB.
27502299	Revisiting DLB Diagnosis: A Consideration of Prodromal DLB and of the Diagnostic Overlap With Alzheimer Disease.	Efforts to clinically diagnose cases having dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) identify those with a characteristic clinical syndrome (probable DLB) at the expense of missing an equal, if not greater, number of cases who have atypical presentations thought to be associated with coexisting Alzheimer pathologies. This article argues that further efforts should now be made to characterize this atypical group that constitutes cases previously identified postmortem as the Lewy body variant of Alzheimer disease (AD) or as AD with Lewy bodies. Since such fine distinction is unlikely to be achieved on clinical grounds alone, this new diagnostic category will require robust biomarker validation. Turning to a consideration of early/prodromal diagnosis of both typical and atypical DLB cases, it is suggested that there will be at least 3 prototypical forms-a mild cognitive impairment variant, associated with early visuoperceptual and attentional deficits; a delirium onset DLB with provoked or spontaneous delirium as the presenting features; and a psychiatric disorder DLB with its primary presentation as a late-onset affective disorder or psychosis.
27499322	Less invasive surgery using external fixator for the treatment of subtrochanteric femur fracture in a high-risk geriatric patient.	A 90-year-old female patient was admitted to our clinic complaining of pain in her left hip which occurred due to fall from a chair. Her medical history included memory loss and mental changes associated with Alzheimer's disease and depression. Patient's cooperation and orientation were weak. Range of motion of the left hip was restricted and painful. Radiographs of the left hip demonstrated subtrochanteric comminuted fracture of femur. Laboratory tests revealed anemia and liver insufficiency. Departments of internal medicine and anesthesiology reported high risk for surgery. Surgery was performed under spinal anesthesia on radiolucent table and in supine position. Using fluoroscopy, subtrochanteric comminuted fracture of femur was reduced. Proximally, two Schanz screws were placed through femoral neck and head in axial plane, and distally, three Schanz screws were placed through femoral shaft in coronal plane. Finally, fixation of the screws was achieved with an external fixator which was made of carbon fiber rods. Patient was allowed to sit in the bed and move around with a wheelchair as of the day of surgery. No infection or loosening of fixator occurred.
27498879	Metals in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's Disease: Relevance to Dementia with Lewy Bodies.	Despite being a common form of dementia, dementia with Lewy bodies is relatively under-researched when compared with Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. This has arisen from the fact that dementia with Lewy bodies has been historically difficult to diagnose resulting in a lack of well-defined clinical cohorts and post-mortem tissue available for scientific research. Dementia with Lewy bodies shares clinical and pathological features with both Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease so it is therefore likely that it also has similar pathogenic mechanisms leading to disease. This review will discuss the role of biological metals in Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease and whether there are indications that metals may also be involved in dementia with Lewy bodies.
27498201	The Neurobiology and Age-Related Prevalence of the epsilon4 Allele of Apolipoprotein E in Alzheimer's Disease Cohorts.	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterised by amyloid beta (Abeta) plaques and tau neurofibrillary tangles in the brain. Human apolipoprotein E (ApoE) is a lipid transport protein coded by the polymorphic APOE gene, with three major alleles: epsilon2, epsilon3 and epsilon4. After age, the epsilon4 allele is the greatest risk factor for developing sporadic AD, conferring an increased risk of 3-4 and 8-12 times for one or two copies of the allele, respectively. This risk is reported to vary by demographic factors including sex, ethnicity and geography. In order to understand the risk of ApoE epsilon4 in relation to age, the primary risk factor for developing AD, we need to understand how the prevalence of APOE genotypes changes with age. Here, we present the first data on age-related prevalence of APOE epsilon4 in AD in three AD cohorts in Australia and the USA. There is a significant association between age and epsilon4 prevalence, particularly for epsilon4 homozygotes, such that as age increases the prevalence of epsilon4 decreases. Further studies on a random, population-based sample of the population are needed to provide more generalizable data, particularly in the >90-year-old age group.
27497990	Polymorphisms of dopamine receptor genes and risk of visual hallucinations in Parkinson's patients.	BACKGROUND: Visual hallucinations (VHs) are frequent non-motor complication of Parkinson's disease (PD), associated to a negative prognosis. Previous studies showed an association between dopamine receptor (DR) gene (DR) variants and psychosis in Alzheimer's disease, addictions, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder. However, there are only a few studies on DR variants and VHs in PD, which did not provide conclusive results. OBJECTIVES: The present study aimed to determine whether genetic differences of DR are associated with visual hallucinations (VHs) in a cohort of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. METHODS: A case-control study of 84 PD subjects, 42 with and 42 without VHs,that were matched for age, gender, disease duration, and dopaminergic medication was conducted. Polymerase chain reaction for SNPs in both D1-like (DRD1A-48G [rs4532] and C62T [rs686], DRD5T798C [rs6283]) and D2-like DR (DRD2G2137A [rs1800497] and C957T [rs6277], DRD3G25A [rs6280] and G712C [rs1800828], DRD4C616G [rs747302] and nR VNTR 48bp) analyzed genomic DNA. RESULTS: Patients carrying allele T at DRD1C62T had an increased risk of VHs, expressed as OR (95 % CI, p value), of 10.7 (2.9-40, p = 0.0001). Moreover, patients with DRD1-48 GG and 62TT genotype displayed shorter time to VHs, whereas a longer time to VHs was found in subjects carrying the DRD4 CG alleles. CONCLUSIONS: PD patients with VHs display higher frequency of DR SNPs associated with increased D1-like activity and decreased D2-like activity. Our data are in line with associations reported in other neurodegenerative and psychiatric conditions. Results likely provide valuable information for personalizing pharmacological therapy in PD patients.
27497913	Parkinson's disease: Autoimmunity and neuroinflammation.	Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disease that causes the death of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. The resulting dopamine deficiency in the basal ganglia leads to a movement disorder that is characterized by classical parkinsonian motor symptoms. Parkinson's disease is recognized as the most common neurodegenerative disorder after Alzheimer's disease. PD ethiopathogenesis remains to be elucidated and has been connected to genetic, environmental and immunologic conditions. The past decade has provided evidence for a significant role of the immune system in PD pathogenesis, either through inflammation or an autoimmune response. Several autoantibodies directed at antigens associated with PD pathogenesis have been identified in PD patients. This immune activation may be the cause of, rather than a response to, the observed neuronal loss. Parkinsonian motor symptoms include bradykinesia, muscular rigidity and resting tremor. The non-motor features include olfactory dysfunction, cognitive impairment, psychiatric symptoms and autonomic dysfunction. Microscopically, the specific degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra and the presence of Lewy bodies, which are brain deposits containing a substantial amount of alpha-synuclein, have been recognized. The progression of Parkinson's disease is characterized by a worsening of motor features; however, as the disease progresses, there is an emergence of complications related to long-term symptomatic treatment. The available therapies for Parkinson's disease only treat the symptoms of the disease. A major goal of Parkinson's disease research is the development of disease-modifying drugs that slow or stop the neurodegenerative process. Drugs that enhance the intracerebral dopamine concentrations or stimulate dopamine receptors remain the mainstay treatment for motor symptoms. Immunomodulatory therapeutic strategies aiming to attenuate PD neurodegeneration have become an attractive option and warrant further investigation.
27497733	Functional induction of P-glycoprotein efflux pump by phenyl benzenesulfonamides: Synthesis and biological evaluation of T0901317 analogs.	N-(2,2,2-Trifluoroethyl)-N-[4-[2,2,2-trifluoro-1-hydroxy-1-(trifluoromethyl)ethyl ]phenyl]-benzenesulfonamide (T0901317, 6) is a potent activator of pregnane-X-receptor (PXR), which is a nuclear receptor controlling P-gp expression. Herein, we aimed to investigate P-gp induction activity of T0901317 and establish its structure-activity relationship. T0901317 along with a series of N-triazolyl-methylene-linked benzenesulfonamides were synthesized and screened for P-gp induction activity using a rhodamine-123 based efflux assay in the P-gp overexpressing human adenocarcinoma LS-180 cells, wherein several compounds showed potent P-gp induction activity at 5 muM. Treatment with benzene sulphonamides led to the decrease in intracellular accumulation of a fluorescent P-gp substrate rhodamine-123 up to 48% (control 100%). In the western-blot studies, T0901317 (6) and its triazole linked analog 26e at 5 muM displayed induction of P-gp expression in LS180 cells. These compounds were non-toxic in LS-180 and human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells (IC50 > 50 muM). The compound 26e showed significant P-gp induction even at 0.3 muM, indicating an excellent therapeutic window. These results clearly indicate promise of this class of compounds as potential agents to enhance amyloid-beta clearance in Alzheimers patients.
27493973	An Update on Inflamm-Aging: Mechanisms, Prevention, and Treatment.	Inflamm-aging is a challenging and promising new branch of aging-related research fields that includes areas such as immunosenescence. Increasing evidence indicates that inflamm-aging is intensively associated with many aging diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, atherosclerosis, heart disease, type II diabetes, and cancer. Mounting studies have focused on the role of inflamm-aging in disease progression and many advances have been made in the last decade. However, the underlying mechanisms by which inflamm-aging affects pathological changes and disease development are still unclear. Here, we review studies of inflamm-aging that explore the concept, pathological features, mechanisms, intervention, and the therapeutic strategies of inflamm-aging in disease progression.
27490211	Tideglusib induces apoptosis in human neuroblastoma IMR32 cells, provoking sub-G0/G1 accumulation and ROS generation.	Neuroblastoma is the most common tumor amongst children amounting to nearly 15% of cancer deaths. This cancer is peculiar in its characteristics, exhibiting differentiation, maturation and metastatic transformation leading to poor prognosis and low survival rates among children. Chemotherapy, though toxic to normal cells, has shown to improve the survival of the patient with emphasis given more towards targeting angiogenesis. Recently, Tideglusib was designed as an 'Orphan Drug' to target the neurodegenerative Alzheimer's disease and gained significant momentum in its function during clinical trials. Duffy et al. recently reported a reduction in cell viability of human IMR32 neuroblastoma cells when treated with Tideglusib at varying concentrations. We investigated the effects of Tideglusib, at various concentrations, compared to Lithium chloride at various concentrations, on IMR32 cells. Lithium, a known GSK-3 inhibitor, was used as a standard to compare the efficiency of Tideglusib in a dose-dependent manner. Cell viability was assessed by MTT assay. The stages of apoptosis were evaluated by AO/EB staining and nuclear damage was determined by Hoechst 33258 staining. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsim) were assessed by DCFDA dye and Rhodamine-123 dye, respectively. Tideglusib reported a significant dose-dependent increase in pro-apoptotic proteins (PARP, Caspase-9, Caspase-7, Caspase-3) and tumor-related genes (FasL, TNF-alpha, Cox-2, IL-8, Caspase-3). Anti-GSK3 beta, pGSK3 beta, Bcl-2, Akt-1, p-Akt1 protein levels were observed with cells exposed to Tideglusib and Lithium chloride. No significant dose-dependent changes were observed for the mRNA expression of collagenase MMP-2, the tumor suppressor p53, or the cell cycle protein p21. Our study also reports Tideglusib reducing colony formation and increasing the level of sub-G0/G1 population in IMR32 cells. Our investigations report the significance of Tideglusib as a promising apoptotic inducer in human neuroblastoma IMR32 cells. Our study also reports that LiCl reduced cell viability in IMR32 cells inducing apoptosis mediated by ROS generation.
27488857	Decreased in vivo availability of the cannabinoid type 2 receptor in Alzheimer's disease.	PURPOSE: The cannabinoid type 2 receptor (CB2R) is expressed by immune cells such as monocytes and macrophages. In the brain, CB2R is primarily found on microglia. CB2R upregulation has been reported in animal models of Alzheimer's disease, with a preferential localization near amyloid beta (Abeta) plaques, and in patients post mortem. We performed in vivo brain imaging and kinetic modelling of the CB2R tracer [11C]NE40 in healthy controls (HC) and in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) to investigate whether higher CB2R availability regionally colocalized to Abeta deposits is present in vivo. METHODS: Dynamic 90-min [11C]NE40 PET scans were performed in eight HC and nine AD patients with full kinetic modelling using arterial sampling and metabolite correction and partial volume correction. All AD patients received a static [11C]PIB scan 40 min after injection. In four HC, a retest scan with [11C]NE40 PET was performed within 9 weeks to investigate test-retest characteristics. RESULTS: [11C]NE40 was metabolized quickly leading to 50 % of intact tracer 20 min after injection and 20 % at 90 min. A two-tissue kinetic model fitted most of the time-activity curves best; both binding potential (BPND) and distribution volume (V T) parameters could be used. Brain uptake was generally low with an average K 1 value of 0.07 ml/min/ml tissue. V T and BPND were in the range of 0.7 - 1.8 and 0.6 - 1.6, respectively. Test values in HC were about 30 % for V T and BPND. AD patients showed overall significantly lower CB2R binding. No relationship was found between regional or global amyloid load and CB2R availability. CONCLUSION: Kinetic modelling of [11C]NE40 is possible with a two-tissue reversible model. In contrast to preclinical and post-mortem data, [11C]NE40 PET shows lower CB2R availability in vivo in AD patients, with no relationship to Abeta plaques. A possible explanation for these findings is that [11C]NE40 binds to CB2R with lower affinity and/or selectivity than to CB1R.
27487889	Texture analyses of quantitative susceptibility maps to differentiate Alzheimer's disease from cognitive normal and mild cognitive impairment.	PURPOSE: Although a number of studies have focused on finding anatomical regions in which iron concentrations are high, no study has been conducted to examine the overall variations in susceptibility maps of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The objective of this study, therefore, was to differentiate AD from cognitive normal (CN) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) using a texture analysis of quantitative susceptibility maps (QSMs). METHODS: The study was approved by the local institutional review board, and informed consent was obtained from all subjects. In each participant group-CN, MCI, and AD-18 elderly subjects were enrolled. A fully first-order flow-compensated 3D gradient-echo sequence was run to obtain axial magnitudes and phase images and to produce QSM data. Sagittal structural 3D T1-weighted (3DT1W) images were also obtained with the magnetization-prepared rapid acquisition of gradient-echo sequence to obtain brain tissue images. The first- and second-order texture parameters of the QSMs and 3DT1W images were obtained to evaluate group differences using a one-way analysis of covariance. RESULTS: For the first-order QSM analysis, mean, standard deviation, and covariance of signal intensity separated the subject groups (F = 5.191, p = 0.009). For the second-order analysis, angular second moment, contrast, and correlation separated the subject groups (F = 6.896, p = 0.002). Finally, a receiver operating characteristic curve analysis differentiated MCI from CN in white matter on the QSMs (z = 3.092, p = 0.0020). CONCLUSIONS: This was the first study to evaluate the textures of QSM in AD, which overcame the limitations of voxel-based analyses. The QSM texture analysis successfully distinguished both AD and MCI from CN and outperformed the voxel-based analysis using 3DT1-weighed images in separating MCI from CN. The first-order textures were more efficient in differentiating MCI from CN than did the second-order.
27486021	Neuregulin-1 (Nrg1) signaling has a preventive role and is altered in the frontal cortex under the pathological conditions of Alzheimer's disease.	Alzheimer's disease (AD), one of the neurodegenerative disorders that may develop in the elderly, is characterized by the deposition of betaamyloid protein (Abeta) and extensive neuronal cell death in the brain. Neuregulin1 (Nrg1)mediated intercellular and intracellular communication via binding to ErbB receptors regulates a diverse set of biological processes involved in the development of the nervous system. In the present study, a linear correlation was identified between Nrg1 and phosphorylated ErbB (pNeu and pErbB4) receptors in a human cortical tissue microarray. In addition, increased expression levels of Nrg1, but reduced pErbB receptor levels, were detected in the frontal lobe of a patient with AD. Western blotting and immunofluorescence staining were subsequently performed to uncover the potential preventive role of Nrg1 in cortical neurons affected by the neurodegenerative processes of AD. It was observed that the expression of Nrg1 increased as the culture time of the cortical neurons progressed. In addition, H2O2 and Abeta142, two inducers of oxidative stress and neuronal damage, led to a dosedependent decrease in Nrg1 expression. Recombinant Nrg1beta, however, was revealed to exert a pivotal role in preventing oxidative stress and neuronal damage from occurring in the mouse cortical neurons. Taken together, these results suggest that changes in Nrg1 signaling may influence the pathological development of AD, and exogenous Nrg1 may serve as a potential candidate for the prevention and treatment of AD.
27485706	Elevated DRD4 promoter methylation increases the risk of Alzheimer's disease in males.	Aberrant promoter methylation of multiple genes is associated with various diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). The goal of the present study was to determine whether dopamine receptor D4 (DRD4) promoter methylation is associated with AD. In the current study, the methylation levels of the DRD4 promoter were measured in 46 AD patients and 61 controls using bisulfite pyrosequencing technology. The results of the present study demonstrated that DRD4 promoter methylation was significantly higher in AD patients than in controls. A further breakdown analysis by gender revealed that there was a significant association of DRD4 promoter methylation with AD in males (23 patients and 45 controls). In conclusion, the results of the present study demonstrated that elevated DRD4 promoter methylation was associated with AD risk in males.
27484543	Computer model sheds light on amyloid plaque formation.	Researchers from the University of Cambridge's department of chemistry have shown that it may be possible to control the mechanism that leads to the rapid build-up of amyloid plaques - a key hallmark of Alzheimer's disease.
27484515	Synthesis and structure-activity relationship study of tacrine-based pyrano[2,3-c]pyrazoles targeting AChE/BuChE and 15-LOX.	A series of tacrine-based pyrazolo[4',3':5,6]pyrano[2,3-b]quinolines and related compounds were designed and synthesized for targeting AChE, BuChE and 15-LOX enzymes in the field of Alzheimer's disease therapy. Most of compounds showed potent activity against cholinesterases and mild potency toward 15-LOX enzyme. In particular, compounds 29, 32 and 40 displayed inhibition at nano-molar level against AChE and BuChE (IC50s = 0.005-0.08 muM), being more potent than reference drug tacrine. Moreover, compound 32 with IC50 value of 31 muM was the most potent compound against 15-LOX. The cytotoxicity assay on HepG2 cells revealed that compounds 29 and 32 showed no significant cytotoxic activity even at concentration of 50 muM. The cytotoxicity of compounds 29 and 32 was significantly less than that of tacrine at higher concentrations.
27484514	Rational modification of donepezil as multifunctional acetylcholinesterase inhibitors for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.	A series of novel donepezil derivatives was designed, synthesized and evaluated as multifunctional acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The screening results indicated that most of the compounds exhibited potent inhibition of AChE with IC50 values in the nanomolar range. Moreover, these derivatives displayed good antioxidant, Abeta interaction, blood-brain barrier penetration (PAMPA-BBB+) and ADMET properties (in silico). Among them, 5c demonstrated excellent AChE inhibition (IC50: 85 nM for eeAChE, 73 nM for hAChE), metal chelation, and inhibitory effects on self-induced, hAChE-induced and Cu(2+)-induced Abeta1-42 aggregation (18.5%, 72.4% and 46.3%, at 20 muM). Kinetic analysis and molecular modeling studies suggested that 5c could bind simultaneously to the catalytic active site (CAS) and peripheral anionic site (PAS) of AChE. More importantly, 5c exhibited significant neuroprotective potency against Abeta1-42-induced PC12 cell injury. Furthermore, the step-through passive avoidance test showed 5c significantly reversed scopolamine-induced memory deficit and no hepatotoxicity in mice. These results indicated that 5c might be a promising drug candidate for AD therapy.
27481385	Parkinson's disease in the older patient.	Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most commonly encountered neurodegenerative condition in clinical practice and probably offers a significantly greater variety of challenges than the management of Alzheimer's disease. As with most neurodegenerative diseases, age represents the leading risk factor for the development of PD. Current estimates would suggest that PD affects 1-2% of people over the age of 65 years and each decade sees an increasing number of cases. In addition, it is well recognised that most industrialised nations have an increasing proportion of individuals living longer. For example, recent data from Australia indicates that the prevalence of PD is anticipated to rise by 80% over the next 20 years and as such, we must all strive towards improving our clinical management of this common condition. In this article, we will attempt to highlight the issues that should be actively sought out and, where possible, addressed. We hope that an improved level of understanding will lead to better outcomes in older patients with PD.
27480759	123I-FP-CIT SPECT findings and its clinical relevance in prodromal dementia with Lewy bodies.	PURPOSE: Evidence for the prodromal stage of dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is very limited. To address this issue, we investigate the 123I-FP-CIT SPECT measure of dopamine transporter binding finding and its clinical relevance. METHODS: We enrolled subjects into a prodromal DLB group (PRD-DLB) (n = 20) and clinical DLB group (CLIN-DLB) (n = 18) and compared these groups with an Alzheimer's disease control group (AD) (n = 10). PRD-DLB was defined as patients having the non-motor symptoms associated with Lewy body disease (LBD) [i.e. REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD), olfactory dysfunction, autonomic dysfunction, and depression] and showing characteristic diffuse occipital hypometabolism in 18F-FDG PET. CLIN-DLB was defined as patients fulfilling the established criteria of probable DLB. Striatal specific binding ratio (SBR) of 123I-FP-CIT SPECT was used for objective group comparisons. The correlations between SBR and cognitive function (MMSE), motor symptoms (UPDRS3), and duration of LBD-associated non-motor symptoms were compared between the two DLB groups. RESULTS: Mean SBR scores of both PRD-DLB and CLIN-DLB were significantly lower than those of AD. No correlation was found between SBR and MMSE scores. Both in the CLIN-DLB and total DLB groups, SBR scores were negatively correlated with UPDRS3 scores, whereas no correlation was found in PRD-DLB. Among the LBD-related non-motor symptoms, duration of olfactory dysfunction, and RBD demonstrated negative correlation with SBR scores in PRD-DLB. CONCLUSION: 123I-FP-CIT SPECT may play a role for detecting DLB among the subjects in prodromal stage. During this stage, long-term olfactory dysfunction and/or RBD may indicate more severe degeneration of the nigro-striatal dopaminergic pathway.
27478825	Elderly and Nonelderly Use of a Dedicated Ambulance Corps' Emergency Medical Services in Taiwan.	Backgrounds and Aim. Taiwan's population is gradually aging; however, there are no comparative data on emergency medical services (EMS) use between the elderly and nonelderly. Methods. We analyzed the emergency calls dealt with between January 1 and April 4, 2014, by EMS in one city in Taiwan. All calls were divided into two groups: elderly (>/=65 years) and nonelderly (<65 years). Nontransport and transport calls were compared between the groups for demographic characteristics, transport time, reasons for calling EMS, vital signs, and emergency management. Results. There were 1,001 EMS calls: 226 nontransport and 775 transport calls. The elderly accounted for significantly (P < 0.05) fewer (28 (9.2%)) nontransport calls than did the nonelderly (136 (21.4%)). In the transport calls, 276 (35.6%) were the elderly. The elderly had a higher proportion of histories for cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, end-stage renal disease, cancer, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease. In addition, the elderly had significantly longer total transport time, more nontrauma reasons, and poorer consciousness levels and lower oxygen saturation and needed more respiratory management and more frequent resuscitation during transport than did the nonelderly. Conclusion. The elderly have more specific needs than do the nonelderly. Adapting EMS training, operations, and government policies to aging societies is mandatory and should begin now.
27478326	Forecasting Cause-Specific Mortality in Korea up to Year 2032.	Forecasting cause-specific mortality can help estimate the future burden of diseases and provide a clue for preventing diseases. Our objective was to forecast the mortality for causes of death in the future (2013-2032) based on the past trends (1983-2012) in Korea. The death data consisted of 12 major causes of death from 1983 to 2012 and the population data consisted of the observed and estimated populations (1983-2032) in Korea. The modified age-period-cohort model with an R-based program, nordpred software, was used to forecast future mortality. Although the age-standardized rates for the world standard population for both sexes are expected to decrease from 2008-2012 to 2028-2032 (males: -31.4%, females: -32.3%), the crude rates are expected to increase (males: 46.3%, females: 33.4%). The total number of deaths is also estimated to increase (males: 52.7%, females: 41.9%). Additionally, the largest contribution to the overall change in deaths was the change in the age structures. Several causes of death are projected to increase in both sexes (cancer, suicide, heart diseases, pneumonia and Alzheimer's disease), while others are projected to decrease (cerebrovascular diseases, liver diseases, diabetes mellitus, traffic accidents, chronic lower respiratory diseases, and pulmonary tuberculosis). Cancer is expected to be the highest cause of death for both the 2008-2012 and 2028-2032 time periods in Korea. To reduce the disease burden, projections of the future cause-specific mortality should be used as fundamental data for developing public health policies.
27478060	Ensembles of Deep Learning Architectures for the Early Diagnosis of the Alzheimer's Disease.	Computer Aided Diagnosis (CAD) constitutes an important tool for the early diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease (AD), which, in turn, allows the application of treatments that can be simpler and more likely to be effective. This paper explores the construction of classification methods based on deep learning architectures applied on brain regions defined by the Automated Anatomical Labeling (AAL). Gray Matter (GM) images from each brain area have been split into 3D patches according to the regions defined by the AAL atlas and these patches are used to train different deep belief networks. An ensemble of deep belief networks is then composed where the final prediction is determined by a voting scheme. Two deep learning based structures and four different voting schemes are implemented and compared, giving as a result a potent classification architecture where discriminative features are computed in an unsupervised fashion. The resulting method has been evaluated using a large dataset from the Alzheimer's disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Classification results assessed by cross-validation prove that the proposed method is not only valid for differentiate between controls (NC) and AD images, but it also provides good performances when tested for the more challenging case of classifying Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) Subjects. In particular, the classification architecture provides accuracy values up to 0.90 and AUC of 0.95 for NC/AD classification, 0.84 and AUC of 0.91 for stable MCI/AD classification and 0.83 and AUC of 0.95 for NC/MCI converters classification.
27477351	Vitamin D2 suppresses amyloid-beta 25-35 induced microglial activation in BV2 cells by blocking the NF-kappaB inflammatory signaling pathway.	AIMS: Present emerging world is emphasizing the implication of vitamin D deficiency associated with development of inflammation and neurodegenerative disorder like Alzheimer's disease (AD). The chief neuropathological hallmark of AD is aggregation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides surrounding microglial cells in human brain. Microglial activation plays a key role in inflammatory response and neuronal injury. Naturally abundant vitamin D2 (VD2) exhibiting anti-inflammatory activities are yet to explore more. This study has investigated the inhibitory effect of VD2 on inflammatory activities of BV2 microglial cells. MAIN METHODS: Cellular compatibility of VD2 and Abeta25-35 protein in treated BV2 microglial cells were measured by CCK-8 assay. Induction of iNOS, COX-2 and NF-kappaB signaling cascade were measured by western blotting, whereas pro-inflammatory cytokines were measured by ELISA. In addition, generation of ROS was detected by fluorescence intensity. KEY FINDINGS: Morphological observations showed that Abeta25-35 induced BV2 cells stimulation noticeably got reduced in VD2 pre-treated group at 24h time period. Anti-inflammatory activities of VD2 was observed demonstrating the inhibition of up-regulated iNOS and COX-2 protein expression further confirmed by attenuating the activated microglia released pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1beta, IL-6, TNF- alpha and ROS, while blocking the phosphorylation of NF-kappaB p65 in nucleus by preventing IkappaB-alpha degradation and phosphorylation in cytosol. SIGNIFICANCE: The present study revealed that VD2 blocked the phosphorylation of NF-kappaB inflammatory signaling pathway in Abeta25-35 induced activated BV2 microglial cells by suppressing ROS generation and inflammatory cytokines. Our finding suggests that vitamin D2 has therapeutic potential against inflammation and Alzheimer's disease.
27475320	Total intracranial and lateral ventricle volumes measurement in Alzheimer's disease: A methodological study.	Measuring of brain and its compartments' sizes from magnetic resonance (MR) images is an effective way to assess disease progression in neurodegenerative disorders, particularly Alzheimer's disease (AD). The objective of this study was to compare total intracranial volume (TIV) and lateral ventricle volume (LVV) in patients with Alzheimer's disease with those in elderly control subjects, and to compare an automated method (automatic lateral ventricle delineation [ALVIN]) and a manual method (ImageJ). MRI of the brain was performed on 20 patients with Alzheimer's disease and 18 control subjects. The TIV was calculated by a manual method and the LVV was calculated by using two methods: an automated and manual method. We found a significant increase in LVVs in Alzheimer's disease patients compared to control subjects, but no difference in TIV between the two groups. A perfect agreement, with 0.989 (0.973-0.996) intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and 0.978 (0.946-0.991) concordance correlation coefficient (CCC), was observed between the manual and automatic lateral ventricle measurements in Alzheimer patients. The results revealed that LVV measure has predictive performance in AD. We demonstrated that ALVIN and ImageJ are both effective in determining lateral ventricular volume, providing an objective tool for quantitative assessment of AD.
27475317	The association of renin-angiotensin system blockade use with the risks of cognitive impairment of aging and Alzheimer's disease: A meta-analysis.	A quantitative meta-analysis was performed to evaluate the association of renin-angiotensin system blockade (RASB) use with the incidence of cognitive impairment of aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Pubmed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases were searched up to October 2015. Ten studies that assessed the relationship between RASB use and the incidence of cognitive impairment of aging or AD were included. When randomized trials and observational studies were combined, the use of RASB was significantly associated with a reduced risk of AD (risk ratio [RR], 0.80; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.68-0.92) and cognitive impairment of aging (RR, 0.65; 95% CI 0.35-0.94) compared no use of RASB. Meanwhile, in an analysis of subgroups, both subjects with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) and angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) use were lower incidence of AD (RR, 0.87; 95% CI 0.74-1.00; RR, 0.69; 95% CI 0.44-0.93, respectively) than those without, whereas, indirect comparison between ACEI and ARB revealed no significance in the risk of AD (RR, 1.27, 95% CI 0.85-1.89, p=0.245). In an analysis of cognitive impairment of aging, ARB use (RR, 0.40; 95% CI 0.02-0.78), rather than ACEI use (RR, 0.72; 95% CI 0.36-1.09), was shown to decrease the risk of cognitive impairment of aging. In conclusion, RASB treatments, regardless of the drug class, have benefits on prevention of AD, and the effects of ACEI may analogous to ARB. However, the benefit differs according to drug classes for cognitive impairment of aging, with ARB use, rather than ACEI use, being a potential treatment for reducing the incidence of cognitive impairment of aging.
27475058	Case report of Lewy body disease mimicking Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in a 44-year-old man.	BACKGROUND: Few patients are reported with dementia with Lewy bodies before fifty years-old, which may partly reflect the difficulty of accurate diagnosis in young population. We report the case of a 44-year-old male with pathologically confirmed sporadic dementia with Lewy bodies, who did not fulfil the revised clinical criteria for this disease. CASE PRESENTATION: We document this atypical case with clinical and cognitive evaluation, imaging, biochemistry, genetics and pathology investigations. Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease was first suspected in this patient with no previous medical history, who developed acute and rapid cognitive impairment, L-dopa-non-responsive parkinsonism, and delusion. Positive 14-3-3 protein was initially detected in cerebrospinal fluid and until the late stages of the disease. Severe atrophy with no diffusion hypersignal was found on structural MRI as well as an extensive hypometabolism on (18)F-FDG-PET, in comparison to age-matched healthy volunteers. Genetic investigation found no alpha-synuclein gene mutation. The patient died within 5 years, and post-mortem examination found numerous Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites consistent with pure Lewy body disease. CONCLUSIONS: This comprehensively described case illustrates that dementia with Lewy bodies can occur in young patients with atypical clinical presentation. Biochemistry and neuroimaging investigations can sometimes be insufficient to allow accurate diagnostic. More specific markers to support such diagnosis are needed.
27474841	Validation of a new assay for alpha-synuclein detection in cerebrospinal fluid.	BACKGROUND: Abnormal alpha-synuclein aggregation and deposition is the pathological hallmark of Parkinson's disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), but is also found in Alzheimer disease (AD). Therefore, there is a gaining interest in alpha-synuclein in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) as potential biomarker for these neurodegenerative diseases. To broaden the available choices of alpha-synuclein measurement in CSF, we developed and validated a new assay for detecting total alpha-synuclein. METHODS: This novel ELISA uses commercially available antibodies and is based on electrochemiluminescence technology. The assay protocol is straightforward, with short and simple incubation steps, and requires only small amounts of CSF. We validated this assay for precision, parallelism, dilution linearity, specificity, and spike recovery. We further compared it to the newly validated alpha-synuclein assay from BioLegend by analyzing a set of 50 CSF samples with both assays. RESULTS: The new assay quantifies alpha-synuclein in CSF with a lower limit of detection of 36.3 pg/mL and shows no cross-reactivity with human beta- and gamma-synuclein. Results of dilution linearity, parallelism, spike recovery, and precision classify this assay as well suited for alpha-synuclein detection in human CSF samples. CONCLUSIONS: We present a novel assay based on freely available components to quantify total alpha-synuclein in CSF as an additional method for alpha-synuclein as a biomarker in neurodegenerative diseases. The assay convinces with its simple and convenient protocol paired with high sensitivity.
27473960	Cranberry extract supplementation exerts preventive effects through alleviating Abeta toxicity in Caenorhabditis elegans model of Alzheimer's disease.	Cranberry extract (CBE) rich in polyphenols are potent to delay paralysis induced by alleviating beta-amyloid (Abeta) toxicity in C. elegans model of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In order to better apply CBE as an anti-AD agent efficiently, we sought to deterrmine whether preventive or therapeutic effect contributes more prominently toward CBE's anti-AD activity. As the level of Abeta toxicity and memory health are two major pathological parameters in AD, in the present study, we compared the effects of CBE on Abeta toxicity and memory health in the C. elegans AD model treated with preventive and therapeutic protocols. Our results revealed that CBE prominently showed the preventive efficacy, providing a basis for further investigation of these effects in mammals.
27470305	The economic burden of the care and treatment for people with Alzheimer's disease: the outlook for the Czech Republic.	The aim of this paper is to specify the cost of treatment and care for people with Alzheimer's disease (AD) in the Czech Republic and also with a view to the future. Data availability is evaluated as well as the quality of cost comparison with other developed countries. Data for the Czech Republic will include data from the health insurance company regarding medicines and treatment, as well as a selected home caring for people with dementia and, ultimately, the Social Security Administration. The basic methods include an analysis of data from publicly available sources, direct interviews with the representatives of nursing homes caring for people with dementia and the representative of the Social Security Administration of the Czech Republic. Items will be specified within the category of direct costs. For the study, the indirect costs related to the loss of patient as well as caring person productivity are not considered. Costs for treatment and care are based from the data on 4162 patients, the costs of a bed from data on 391 beds in homes for the elderly. The average annual cost per patient with AD in the Czech Republic was calculated and came to the amount of 12,783 EUR. These items include outpatient care, inpatient care in a medical facility, inpatient care in homes and medications. In terms of share of these items on the direct costs, the largest item are services provided by special homes which contributes to the direct costs by 94 %, medications create 1 % and treatment (both outpatient and inpatient) 5 %. In the case of home care the total costs are lower at 4698 EUR. The Czech Republic as well as other developed countries are faced with the problem of unified accounting cost of people suffering from Alzheimer's disease. This then causes the calculation of the economic burden to be very difficult and indicative values.
27464225	Memory Impairment, Dementia, and Alzheimer's Disease in Classical and Contemporary Traditional Chinese Medicine.	OBJECTIVES: To identify and analyze records of the treatment of dementia and memory disorders in the classical Chinese medical literature that were consistent with the signs and symptoms of Alzheimer's disease (AD), with the aim of determining which traditional medicines have histories of use for these disorders. METHODS: Encyclopedia of Traditional Chinese Medicine (Zhong Hua Yi Dian), a database of more than 1000 classical and premodern Chinese medical books, was systematically searched. Search terms were identified from dictionaries, medical nomenclatures, guidelines, and specialist clinical manuals on aging, neurology, or brain disorders. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were used to identify citations of conditions whose signs and symptoms were consistent with the clinical features of AD. Passages of text identified by these terms were copied to Microsoft Excel spreadsheets, together with the identity of the source book and all relevant information on the disorder and the intervention. Each distinct passage of text was considered a citation. The frequencies of the traditional formulas used as interventions and their constituent ingredients were calculated. RESULTS: The selection criteria identified 1498 citations of dementia and memory impairments derived from 277 different books written from circa 363 to 1945 AD. In 91 of these citations, memory impairment was associated with aging and was broadly consistent with the clinical features of AD. Although the interventions varied in name, Poria cocos, Polygala tenuifolia, Rehmannia glutinosa, Panax ginseng, and Acorus species consistently appeared as ingredients in multiple formulas for memory impairment in the context of aging. CONCLUSIONS: Memory impairment in older age was a recognized condition in the classical literature. Many of the traditional medicines frequently used as ingredients in classical formulas for memory impairment consistent with clinical features of AD remain in contemporary use, and experimental studies suggest biological activities relevant to AD.
27464072	Pharmacogenetics in Neurodegenerative Diseases: Implications for Clinical Trials.	BACKGROUND: Pharmacogenetics has become extremely important over the last 20 years for identifying individuals more likely to be responsive to pharmacological interventions. The role of genetic background as a predictor of drug response is a young and mostly unexplored field in neurodegenerative diseases. SUMMARY: Mendelian mutations in neurodegenerative diseases have been used as models for early diagnosis and intervention. On the other hand, genetic polymorphisms or risk factors for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD) or other neurodegenerative diseases, probably influencing drug response, are hardly taken into account in randomized clinical trial (RCT) design. The same is true for genetic variants in cytochrome P450 (CYP), the principal enzymes influencing drug metabolism. A better characterization of individual genetic background may optimize clinical trial design and personal drug response. This chapter describes the state of the art about the impact of genetic factors in RCTs on neurodegenerative disease, with AD, frontotemporal dementia, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Huntington's disease as examples. Furthermore, a brief description of the genetic bases of drug response focusing on neurodegenerative diseases will be conducted. KEY MESSAGES: The role of pharmacogenetics in RCTs for neurodegenerative diseases is still a young, unexplored, and promising field. Genetic tools allow increased sophistication in patient profiling and treatment optimization. Pharmaceutical companies are aware of the value of collecting genetic data during their RCTs. Pharmacogenetic research is bidirectional with RCTs: efficacy data are correlated with genetic polymorphisms, which in turn define subjects for treatment stratification.
27463974	Cerebrospinal Fluid Biomarkers for Target Engagement and Efficacy in Clinical Trials for Alzheimer's and Parkinson's Diseases.	BACKGROUND: Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is increasingly being used to detect biochemical changes that occur in different neurological conditions. In Alzheimer's disease (AD), three CSF biomarkers (Abeta42, total tau, and phosphorylated tau) are used in clinical practice to support the diagnosis in the prodromal stages of the disease. In Parkinson's disease (PD), the investigation is following the pathway of AD research and some promising markers have been identified, with the main aim to favor an early diagnosis, i.e. in the premotor phase. Some of these CSF markers have also been incorporated in AD and PD clinical trials to demonstrate target engagement of the drug and/or to enrich the patient populations. In this chapter, we will review the main CSF biomarkers for AD and PD and their potential application to clinical trials. SUMMARY: In clinical trials assessing the efficacy of disease-modifying agents for AD, CSF biomarkers are currently used both as a diagnostic criterion for inclusion and for monitoring the biochemical impact of the drug on the upstream neurodegenerative mechanisms. Accordingly, recent trials devoted to PD are following such a procedure, although in this neurodegenerative disorder CSF biomarkers are not ready yet for routine clinical use. KEY MESSAGES: AD and PD are neurodegenerative disorders that share a long asymptomatic/prodromal phase in which neurodegenerative phenomena already take place in the brain. Clinical trials assessing the efficacy of disease-modifying agents should include the CSF measurement of related biomarkers as biochemical proof of the underlying pathology as well as of the impact of the drug on these pathogenic mechanisms.
27463686	Peculiarities of Neurological Disorders and Study Designs.	BACKGROUND: Neurological disorders are heterogeneous clinical conditions with variable course and outcome. SUMMARY: The basic aspects of the commonest neurological disorders are addressed along with the proposed structure of randomized clinical trials (RCTs). Dementing disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), are clinical conditions in which altered cognitive functions are associated with behavioral and personality changes. Parkinson's disease (PD) is a multisystem disorder characterized by motor dysfunction associated with dysautonomia, sleep and olfactory disturbances, cognitive changes, and depression. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is an invariably fatal clinical condition involving motor neurons. The available treatments are purely symptomatic for PD but virtually ineffective for AD and ALS. Headache disorders, multiple sclerosis, and epilepsy, three diseases characterized by recurrent symptoms and chronic or episodic course, can be fairly easily controlled by current treatments, but cannot be prevented nor cured. The objectives of treatments of neurodegenerative disorders include primary prevention, slowing or arrest of disease progression, and control of symptoms. Stroke is an acute clinical condition causing frequent disability and death, with only one approved treatment. There are many challenges to acute stroke clinical trials; among them, the very short therapeutic window and the issue of stroke heterogeneity. In this chapter, only the core elements of the study designs are outlined. KEY MESSAGES: The design of an RCT must be adapted to the basic characteristics of each clinical condition.
27463684	Biomarkers in Randomized Clinical Trials: Magnetic Resonance Imaging.	BACKGROUND: It is essential that randomized clinical trials (RCTs) incorporate biomarkers of disease progression that would be sensitive to the effects of disease-modifying treatments. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be safely repeated over time, and is routinely performed in clinical centers, making it an ideal modality to be incorporated into RCTs. SUMMARY: This chapter discusses potential structural MRI biomarkers that have been proposed for a number of different neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), progressive supranuclear palsy syndrome (PSPS), and Parkinson's disease (PD). All of these disorders represent targets for ongoing and future RCTs. Rates of hippocampal atrophy and ventricular expansion provide excellent biomarkers of disease progression in AD, and may also provide biomarkers in prodromal and preclinical phases of the disease, as well as in DLB. Rates of ventricular expansion also perform well in FTD, although regional frontal and temporal measurements could also be useful. Rates of midbrain atrophy provide the most feasible MRI biomarker in PSPS. In contrast, PD is not associated with specific patterns of cerebral atrophy and further work is needed in order to define useful MRI biomarkers. Sample size calculations using these MRI biomarkers are presented and discussed. KEY MESSAGES: Rates of cerebral atrophy provide valuable potential biomarkers of disease progression in neurodegenerative disorders, and have already begun to be utilized as outcome measures in RCTs. Measurements from other structural and functional MRI modalities require more longitudinal validation, but may prove to be useful in the future.

27462146	Electroencephalography-driven approach to prodromal Alzheimer's disease diagnosis: from biomarker integration to network-level comprehension.	Decay of the temporoparietal cortex is associated with prodromal Alzheimer's disease (AD). Additionally, shrinkage of the temporoparietal cerebral area has been connected with an increase in alpha3/alpha2 electroencephalogram (EEG) power ratio in prodromal AD. Furthermore, a lower regional blood perfusion has been exhibited in patients with a higher alpha3/alpha2 proportion when contrasted with low alpha3/alpha2 proportion. Furthermore, a lower regional blood perfusion and reduced hippocampal volume has been exhibited in patients with higher alpha3/alpha2 when contrasted with lower alpha3/alpha2 EEG power ratio. Neuropsychological evaluation, EEG recording, and magnetic resonance imaging were conducted in 74 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Estimation of cortical thickness and alpha3/alpha2 frequency power ratio was conducted for each patient. A subgroup of 27 patients also underwent single-photon emission computed tomography evaluation. In view of alpha3/alpha2 power ratio, the patients were divided into three groups. The connections among cortical decay, cerebral perfusion, and memory loss were evaluated by Pearson's r coefficient. Results demonstrated that higher alpha3/alpha2 frequency power ratio group was identified with brain shrinkage and cutdown perfusion inside the temporoparietal projections. In addition, decay and cutdown perfusion rate were connected with memory shortfalls in patients with MCI. MCI subgroup with higher alpha3/alpha2 EEG power ratio are at a greater risk to develop AD dementia.
27459196	Conservation of Distinct Genetically-Mediated Human Cortical Pattern.	The many subcomponents of the human cortex are known to follow an anatomical pattern and functional relationship that appears to be highly conserved between individuals. This suggests that this pattern and the relationship among cortical regions are important for cortical function and likely shaped by genetic factors, although the degree to which genetic factors contribute to this pattern is unknown. We assessed the genetic relationships among 12 cortical surface areas using brain images and genotype information on 2,364 unrelated individuals, brain images on 466 twin pairs, and transcriptome data on 6 postmortem brains in order to determine whether a consistent and biologically meaningful pattern could be identified from these very different data sets. We find that the patterns revealed by each data set are highly consistent (p<10-3), and are biologically meaningful on several fronts. For example, close genetic relationships are seen in cortical regions within the same lobes and, the frontal lobe, a region showing great evolutionary expansion and functional complexity, has the most distant genetic relationship with other lobes. The frontal lobe also exhibits the most distinct expression pattern relative to the other regions, implicating a number of genes with known functions mediating immune and related processes. Our analyses reflect one of the first attempts to provide an assessment of the biological consistency of a genetic phenomenon involving the brain that leverages very different types of data, and therefore is not just statistical replication which purposefully use very similar data sets.
27459153	Old and new acetylcholinesterase inhibitors for Alzheimer's disease.	INTRODUCTION: To date, pharmacological treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD) includes Acetylcholinesterase Inhibitors (AChEIs) for mild-to-moderate AD, and memantine for moderate-to-severe AD. AChEIs reversibly inhibit acetylcholinesterase (AChE), thus increasing the availability of acetylcholine in cholinergic synapses, enhancing cholinergic transmission. These drugs provide symptomatic short-term benefits, without clearly counteracting the progression of the disease. AREAS COVERED: On the wake of successful clinical trials which lead to the marketing of AChEIs donepezil, rivastigmine and galantamine, many compounds with AChEI properties have been developed and tested mainly in Phase I-II clinical trials in the last twenty years. Here, we review clinical trials initiated and interrupted, and those ongoing so far. EXPERT OPINION: Despite many clinical trials with novel AChEIs have been carried out after the registration of those currently used to treat mild to moderate AD, none so far has been successful in a Phase III trial and marketed. Alzheimer's disease is a complex multifactorial disorder, therefore therapy should likely address not only the cholinergic system but also additional neurotransmitters. Moreover, such treatments should be started in very mild phases of the disease, and preventive strategies addressed in elderly people.
27457486	APOE genotype and stress response - a mini review.	The APOE gene is one of currently only two genes that have consistently been associated with longevity. Apolipoprotein E (APOE) is a plasma protein which plays an important role in lipid and lipoprotein metabolism. In humans, there are three major APOE isoforms, designated APOE2, APOE3, and APOE4. Of these three isoforms, APOE3 is most common while APOE4 was shown to be associated with age-related diseases, including cardiovascular and Alzheimer's disease, and therefore an increased mortality risk with advanced age. Evidence accumulates, showing that oxidative stress and, correspondingly, mitochondrial function is affected in an APOE isoform-dependent manner. Accordingly, several stress response pathways implicated in the aging process, including the endoplasmic reticulum stress response and immune function, appear to be influenced by the APOE genotype. The investigation and development of treatment strategies targeting APOE4 have not resolved any therapeutic yet that could be entirely recommended. This mini-review provides an overview on the state of research concerning the impact of the APOE genotype on stress response-related processes, emphasizing the strong interconnection between mitochondrial function, endoplasmic reticulum stress and the immune response. Furthermore, this review addresses potential treatment strategies and associated pitfalls as well as lifestyle interventions that could benefit people with an at risk APOE4 genotype.
27456313	Functions of the Alzheimer's Disease Protease BACE1 at the Synapse in the Central Nervous System.	Inhibition of the protease beta-site amyloid precursor protein-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) is a promising treatment strategy for Alzheimer's disease, and a number of BACE inhibitors are currently progressing through clinical trials. The strategy aims to decrease production of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide from the amyloid precursor protein (APP), thus reducing or preventing Abeta toxicity. Over the last decade, it has become clear that BACE1 proteolytically cleaves a number of substrates in addition to APP. These substrates are not known to be involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease but have other roles in the developing and/or mature central nervous system. Consequently, BACE inhibition and knockout in mice results in synaptic and other neuronal dysfunctions and the key substrates responsible for these deficits are still being elucidated. Of the BACE1 substrates that have been validated to date, a number may contribute to the synaptic deficits seen with BACE blockade, including neuregulin 1, close homologue of L1 and seizure-related gene 6. It is important to understand the impact that BACE blockade may have on these substrates and other proteins detected in substrate screens and, if necessary, develop substrate-selective BACE inhibitors.
27455905	Potential Therapeutic Effects of Oleuropein Aglycone in Alzheimer's Disease.	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age-associated neurodegenerative amyloid disease and is considered a social and clinical problem the last decades, particularly in the Western countries. Amyloid diseases are characterized by the deposition of typically aggregated protein/peptides in tissues that are associated with brain degeneration and progressive cognitive impairment. The amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles arise as a result of self-assembly into fibrillar material of amyloid-beta protein and hyperphosphorylated tau, respectively. Moreover, mounting evidence shows that oxidative and nitrosative stress plays a central role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders such as AD. Oleuropein belongs to a specific group of polyphenols, the secoiridoids, which are abundant in Oleaceae. Oleuropein aglycone is abundant in extra virgin olive oil and it is generated as a product of a glucosidase released when olive fruits are crushed. This secoiridoid compound has radical-scavenging activity and antioxidative effects and it is considered a promising target to prevent amyloid toxicity as an inhibitor of the oligomer nucleation and growth. The neuroprotective and antioxidant effects of flavonoids have been found to strongly depend on their structure and functional groups. Oleuropein aglycone counteracts amyloid aggregation and toxicity affecting different pathways: amyloid precursor protein processing, amyloid-beta peptide and tau aggregation, autophagy impairment, and neuroinflammation. In the current work, available literature on oleuropein aglycone effects as antioxidant and inhibitor of amyloid deposits in AD is reviewed. Moreover, we discuss the chemistry, food sources and bioavailability of oleuropein aglycone.
27455834	Gd-nanoparticles functionalization with specific peptides for ss-amyloid plaques targeting.	BACKGROUND: Amyloidoses are characterized by the extracellular deposition of insoluble fibrillar proteinaceous aggregates highly organized into cross-beta structure and referred to as amyloid fibrils. Nowadays, the diagnosis of these diseases remains tedious and involves multiple examinations while an early and accurate protein typing is crucial for the patients' treatment. Routinely used neuroimaging techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) using Pittsburgh compound B, [(11)C]PIB, provide structural information and allow to assess the amyloid burden, respectively, but cannot discriminate between different amyloid deposits. Therefore, the availability of efficient multimodal imaging nanoparticles targeting specific amyloid fibrils would provide a minimally-invasive imaging tool useful for amyloidoses typing and early diagnosis. In the present study, we have functionalized gadolinium-based MRI nanoparticles (AGuIX) with peptides highly specific for Abeta amyloid fibrils, LPFFD and KLVFF. The capacity of such nanoparticles grafted with peptide to discriminate among different amyloid proteins, was tested with Abeta(1-42) fibrils and with mutated-(V30M) transthyretin (TTR) fibrils. RESULTS: The results of surface plasmon resonance studies showed that both functionalized nanoparticles interact with Abeta(1-42) fibrils with equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) values of 403 and 350 microM respectively, whilst they did not interact with V30M-TTR fibrils. Similar experiments, performed with PIB, displayed an interaction both with Abeta(1-42) fibrils and V30M-TTR fibrils, with Kd values of 6 and 10 microM respectively, confirming this agent as a general amyloid fibril marker. Thereafter, the ability of functionalized nanoparticle to target and bind selectively Abeta aggregates was further investigated by immunohistochemistry on AD like-neuropathology brain tissue. Pictures clearly indicated that KLVFF-grafted or LPFFD-grafted to AGuIX nanoparticle recognized and bound the Abeta amyloid plaque localized in the mouse hippocampus. CONCLUSION: These results constitute a first step for considering these functionalized nanoparticles as a valuable multimodal imaging tool to selectively discriminate and diagnose amyloidoses.
27455809	[Link between aluminum neurotoxicity and neurodegenerative disorders].	Aluminum is an old element that has been known for a long time, but some of its properties are only now being discovered. Although environmentally abundant, aluminum is not essential for life; in fact, because of its specific chemical properties, aluminum inhibits more than 200 biologically important functions and exerts various adverse effects in plants, animals, and humans. Aluminum is a widely recognized neurotoxin. It has been suggested that there is a relationship between exposure to aluminum and neurodegenerative diseases, including dialysis encephalopathy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and parkinsonism dementia in the Kii Peninsula and Guam, as well as Alzheimer' s disease: however, this claim remains to be verified. In this chapter, we review the detailed characteristics of aluminum neurotoxicity and the link between Alzheimer' s disease and other neurodegenerative diseases, based on recent findings on metal-metal interactions and the functions of metalloproteins in synapses.
27455222	Synthesis, Biological Evaluation and Molecular Modelling of 2'-Hydroxychalcones as Acetylcholinesterase Inhibitors.	A series of 2'-hydroxy- and 2'-hydroxy-4',6'-dimethoxychalcones was synthesised and evaluated as inhibitors of human acetylcholinesterase (AChE). The majority of the compounds were found to show some activity, with the most active compounds having IC50 values of 40-85 microM. Higher activities were generally observed for compounds with methoxy substituents in the A ring and halogen substituents in the B ring. Kinetic studies on the most active compounds showed that they act as mixed-type inhibitors, in agreement with the results of molecular modelling studies, which suggested that they interact with residues in the peripheral anionic site and the gorge region of AChE.
27454859	Using Multicountry Ecological and Observational Studies to Determine Dietary Risk Factors for Alzheimer's Disease.	UNLABELLED: Rates of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are rising worldwide. The most important risk factors seem to be linked to diet. For example, when Japan made the nutrition transition from the traditional Japanese diet to the Western diet, AD rates rose from 1% in 1985 to 7% in 2008. Foods protective against AD include fruits, vegetables, grains, low-fat dairy products, legumes, and fish, whereas risk factors include meat, sweets, and high-fat dairy products. The evidence comes from ecological and observational studies as well as investigations of the mechanisms whereby dietary factors affect risk. The mechanisms linking dietary risk factors to AD are fairly well known and include increased oxidative stress from metal ions such as copper as well as from advanced glycation end products associated with high-temperature cooking, increased homocysteine concentrations, and cholesterol and its effects on amyloid beta, insulin resistance, and obesity. Lower 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations also are associated with increased risk of AD. In addition to reviewing the journal literature, a new ecological study was conducted using AD prevalence from 10 countries (Brazil, Chile, Cuba, Egypt, India, Mongolia, Nigeria, Republic of Korea, Sri Lanka, and the United States) along with dietary supply data 5, 10, and 15 years before the prevalence data. Dietary supply of meat or animal products less milk 5 years before AD prevalence had the highest correlations with AD prevalence in this study. Thus, reducing meat consumption could significantly reduce the risk of AD as well as of several cancers, diabetes mellitus type 2, stroke, and, likely, chronic kidney disease. TEACHING POINTS: * Single-country ecological data can be used to find links between diet and AD because the national diet changes, such as during the nutrition transition to a Western diet. * Multicountry ecological studies can be used to find links between dietary factors and risk of AD. * Prospective observational studies are useful in linking dietary components and patterns to risk of AD. * The most important dietary link to AD appears to be meat consumption, with eggs and high-fat dairy also contributing. * Diets high in grains, fruits, vegetables, and fish are associated with reduced risk of AD, but these factors cannot counter the effects of meat, eggs, and high-fat dairy. * Higher vitamin D status is associated with reduced risk of AD.
27454111	EUROPAEM EMF Guideline 2016 for the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of EMF-related health problems and illnesses.	Chronic diseases and illnesses associated with non-specific symptoms are on the rise. In addition to chronic stress in social and work environments, physical and chemical exposures at home, at work, and during leisure activities are causal or contributing environmental stressors that deserve attention by the general practitioner as well as by all other members of the health care community. It seems necessary now to take "new exposures" like electromagnetic fields (EMF) into account. Physicians are increasingly confronted with health problems from unidentified causes. Studies, empirical observations, and patient reports clearly indicate interactions between EMF exposure and health problems. Individual susceptibility and environmental factors are frequently neglected. New wireless technologies and applications have been introduced without any certainty about their health effects, raising new challenges for medicine and society. For instance, the issue of so-called non-thermal effects and potential long-term effects of low-dose exposure were scarcely investigated prior to the introduction of these technologies. Common electromagnetic field or EMF sources: Radio-frequency radiation (RF) (3 MHz to 300 GHz) is emitted from radio and TV broadcast antennas, Wi-Fi access points, routers, and clients (e.g. smartphones, tablets), cordless and mobile phones including their base stations, and Bluetooth devices. Extremely low frequency electric (ELF EF) and magnetic fields (ELF MF) (3 Hz to 3 kHz) are emitted from electrical wiring, lamps, and appliances. Very low frequency electric (VLF EF) and magnetic fields (VLF MF) (3 kHz to 3 MHz) are emitted, due to harmonic voltage and current distortions, from electrical wiring, lamps (e.g. compact fluorescent lamps), and electronic devices. On the one hand, there is strong evidence that long-term exposure to certain EMFs is a risk factor for diseases such as certain cancers, Alzheimer's disease, and male infertility. On the other hand, the emerging electromagnetic hypersensitivity (EHS) is more and more recognized by health authorities, disability administrators and case workers, politicians, as well as courts of law. We recommend treating EHS clinically as part of the group of chronic multisystem illnesses (CMI), but still recognizing that the underlying cause remains the environment. In the beginning, EHS symptoms occur only occasionally, but over time they may increase in frequency and severity. Common EHS symptoms include headaches, concentration difficulties, sleep problems, depression, a lack of energy, fatigue, and flu-like symptoms. A comprehensive medical history, which should include all symptoms and their occurrences in spatial and temporal terms and in the context of EMF exposures, is the key to making the diagnosis. The EMF exposure is usually assessed by EMF measurements at home and at work. Certain types of EMF exposure can be assessed by asking about common EMF sources. It is very important to take the individual susceptibility into account. The primary method of treatment should mainly focus on the prevention or reduction of EMF exposure, that is, reducing or eliminating all sources of high EMF exposure at home and at the workplace. The reduction of EMF exposure should also be extended to public spaces such as schools, hospitals, public transport, and libraries to enable persons with EHS an unhindered use (accessibility measure). If a detrimental EMF exposure is reduced sufficiently, the body has a chance to recover and EHS symptoms will be reduced or even disappear. Many examples have shown that such measures can prove effective. To increase the effectiveness of the treatment, the broad range of other environmental factors that contribute to the total body burden should also be addressed. Anything that supports homeostasis will increase a person's resilience against disease and thus against the adverse effects of EMF exposure. There is increasing evidence that EMF exposure has a major impact on the oxidative and nitrosative regulation capacity in affected individuals. This concept also may explain why the level of susceptibility to EMF can change and why the range of symptoms reported in the context of EMF exposures is so large. Based on our current understanding, a treatment approach that minimizes the adverse effects of peroxynitrite - as has been increasingly used in the treatment of multisystem illnesses - works best. This EMF Guideline gives an overview of the current knowledge regarding EMF-related health risks and provides recommendations for the diagnosis, treatment and accessibility measures of EHS to improve and restore individual health outcomes as well as for the development of strategies for prevention.
27453981	Homogeneous clusters of Alzheimer's disease patient population.	BACKGROUND: Identification of biomarkers for the Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a challenge and a very difficult task both for medical research and data analysis. METHODS: We applied a novel clustering tool with the goal to identify subpopulations of the AD patients that are homogeneous in respect of available clinical as well as in respect of biological descriptors. RESULTS: The main result is identification of three clusters of patients with significant problems with dementia. The evaluation of properties of these clusters demonstrates that brain atrophy is the main driving force of dementia. The unexpected result is that the largest subpopulation that has very significant problems with dementia has besides mild signs of brain atrophy also large ventricular, intracerebral and whole brain volumes. Due to the fact that ventricular enlargement may be a consequence of brain injuries and that a large majority of patients in this subpopulation are males, a potential hypothesis is that such medical status is a consequence of a combination of previous traumatic events and degenerative processes. CONCLUSIONS: The results may have substantial consequences for medical research and clinical trial design. The clustering methodology used in this study may be interesting also for other medical and biological domains.
27453073	Unfoldomics of prostate cancer: on the abundance and roles of intrinsically disordered proteins in prostate cancer.	Prostatic diseases such as prostate cancer and benign prostatic hyperplasia are highly prevalent among men. The number of studies focused on the abundance and roles of intrinsically disordered proteins in prostate cancer is rather limited. The goal of this study is to analyze the prevalence and degree of disorder in proteins that were previously associated with the prostate cancer pathogenesis and to compare these proteins to the entire human proteome. The analysis of these datasets provides means for drawing conclusions on the roles of disordered proteins in this common male disease. We also hope that the results of our analysis can potentially lead to future experimental studies of these proteins to find novel pathways associated with this disease.
27450461	Pharmacotherapeutic strategies in the treatment of severe Alzheimer's disease.	INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a slowly progressive neurodegenerative disease. Patients with severe AD often require assistance with daily functioning and have a substantially higher probability of admission to nursing homes compared to the general population. AREAS COVERED: Medications approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of severe AD include the cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEIs), donepezil (10 and 23 mg/day) and rivastigmine (transdermal patch, 13.3 mg/24 hours), and the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist memantine (immediate- and extended-release formulations). This article will review the efficacy, safety, and tolerability data of these agents in the treatment of severe AD. Issues related to combination therapy, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and treatment discontinuation are also discussed. EXPERT OPINION: AD therapeutics provide benefits on measures of cognition, functioning, behavior, and global status even in the severe stages of AD. Combination therapy with memantine and ChEIs may provide additive benefits compared with ChEI monotherapy. Decisions regarding discontinuation of these medications should be made on a case-by-case basis, with some evidence suggesting that discontinuation may worsen cognition and functional impairment. It is recommended that patients entering the terminal stages of AD discontinue all medications not necessary for comfort.
27450064	Increased serum concentrations of transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) in patients with Guillain-Barre syndrome.	BACKGROUND: Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) is an acquired demyelinating peripheral neuropathy. It has shown that macrophage activation contribute to the pathogenesis of GBS. Therefore macrophage-mediated factors could be the potential markers for disease diagnosis and status of GBS. METHODS: We measured serum concentrations of 4 macrophage-mediated factors, including interleukin-6 (IL-6), transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1), vascular cell adhesion protein 1 (VCAM-1) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), in 23 chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP), 28 GBS, 11 Miller-Fisher syndrome (MFS), 40 multiple sclerosis (MS), and 12 Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients, as well as 15 healthy controls. RESULTS: Serum TGF-beta1 concentration of GBS patients (35.94+/-2.55ng/ml) was significantly higher compared with CIDP (25.46+/-1.40ng/ml, P<0.001), MFS (25.32+/-2.31ng/ml, P=0.010), MS (21.35+/-0.90ng/ml, P<0.001) and AD patients (22.92+/-1.82ng/ml, P<0.001), as well as healthy controls (23.12+/-1.67ng/ml, P<0.001). A positive correlation between serum TGF-beta1 concentrations and Hughes' functional grading scales was observed in GBS patients. Serum concentrations of IL-6, VCAM-1 and VEGF were similar between the studied groups. CONCLUSION: The high serum concentrations of TGF-beta1 and the correlation between serum TGF-beta1 concentration and disease severity highlight the potential of TGF-beta1 as a biomarker of GBS.
27443846	Tocilizumab's effect on cognitive deficits induced by intracerebroventricular administration of streptozotocin in Alzheimer's model.	Neuroinflammation plays pivotal roles in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). IL-6 is pleiotropic cytokine which plays significant pathological role in inflammatory diseases and causes prolonged inflammation. Additionally, IL-6 activates microglia cells and enhances the accumulation of amyloid-beta peptides. Moreover, IL-6 signal transduction is mediated by membrane-bound and soluble IL-6 receptors. Tocilizumab which is a humanized anti-human IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) monoclonal antibody binds to both of these receptors and inhibits IL-6 signaling by this route. The objective was to investigate tocilizumab's potential effects in the treatment of AD. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into three groups: sham (control), streptozotocin (STZ), and tocilizumab-STZ. We used a single dose of intracerebroventricular (ICV) tocilizumab, beginning 1 h prior to injection of STZ for 3 weeks. The rats in STZ and tocilizumab-STZ groups were given ICV-STZ (3 mg/kg). Behavioral parameters were evaluated on days 17-20 and the rats were sacrificed on day-21 to examine histopathological changes. STZ injection caused significant decrease in the mean escape latency in passive avoidance and also declined the performance improvement in Morris water maze tests. Tocilizumab-STZ group significantly improved learning and spatial memory functions by increasing RLT in the passive avoidance and by shortening escape latency in reaching the platform in the Morris water maze. Histopathological changes were examined using hematoxylin and eosin and immunohistochemical (IHC) stainings. IHC analysis revealed that while protein expressions of amyloid-ss (3.5 +/- 0.2) and IL-6 (2.9 +/- 0.4) showed intense immune-positivity in STZ group, amyloid-ss (1.3 +/- 0.1) and IL-6 (1.5 +/- 0.2) immunoreactivities were substantially decreased in tocilizumab treatment group. We conclude that tocilizumab treatment attenuated significantly STZ-induced cognitive impairment and histopathological changes. Further studies would be desirable to investigate clinically relevant protective effects of tocilizumab in AD.
27443496	Meta-analysis of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) 765G>C polymorphism and Alzheimer's disease.	The cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) 765G>C polymorphism has been extensively investigated for association with Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, results of different studies have been inconsistent. The aim of the present meta-analysis was to evaluate the association between the 765G>C polymorphism of the COX-2 gene and susceptibility to AD. We searched all related subjects in PubMed, Embase, SinoMed, and China Knowledge Resource Integrated Database and identified seven studies that reported a relationship between the COX-2 765G>C polymorphism and AD. A total of 1260 cases and 1112 controls were included in the seven studies. Our data suggest that the COX-2 765G>C polymorphism may decrease the risk of AD in five genetic models. As a result, this meta-analysis suggests the 765G>C polymorphism of the COX-2 gene may be a protective factor for AD. As our sample size was limited, large-scale, well-designed studies are necessary to validate the association between the COX-2 765G>C polymorphism and AD.
27443047	Over-Prescribed Medications, Under-Appreciated Risks: A Review of the Cognitive Effects of Anticholinergic Medications in Older Adults.	Anticholinergic medications are associated with adverse cognitive effects in cognitively normal and impaired individuals, with a greater magnitude of effect observed in individuals with preexisting cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer disease.
27440465	Deep Learning Representation from Electroencephalography of Early-Stage Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease and Features for Differentiation from Rapidly Progressive Dementia.	A novel technique of quantitative EEG for differentiating patients with early-stage Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) from other forms of rapidly progressive dementia (RPD) is proposed. The discrimination is based on the extraction of suitable features from the time-frequency representation of the EEG signals through continuous wavelet transform (CWT). An average measure of complexity of the EEG signal obtained by permutation entropy (PE) is also included. The dimensionality of the feature space is reduced through a multilayer processing system based on the recently emerged deep learning (DL) concept. The DL processor includes a stacked auto-encoder, trained by unsupervised learning techniques, and a classifier whose parameters are determined in a supervised way by associating the known category labels to the reduced vector of high-level features generated by the previous processing blocks. The supervised learning step is carried out by using either support vector machines (SVM) or multilayer neural networks (MLP-NN). A subset of EEG from patients suffering from Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and healthy controls (HC) is considered for differentiating CJD patients. When fine-tuning the parameters of the global processing system by a supervised learning procedure, the proposed system is able to achieve an average accuracy of 89%, an average sensitivity of 92%, and an average specificity of 89% in differentiating CJD from RPD. Similar results are obtained for CJD versus AD and CJD versus HC.
27439681	Frontotemporal dementia-related gene mutations in clinical dementia patients from a Chinese population.	Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) are two common forms of primary neurodegenerative dementia that show overlapping clinical symptoms. The aim of this study was to perform genetic analyses on GRN, VCP, CHMP2B, FUS, TARDBP, C9orf72 and MAPT genes in Chinese AD and FTD patients. We performed gene sequencing of the GRN, VCP, CHMP2B, FUS, TARDBP, MAPT and C9orf72 genes in 61 clinical AD and 38 FTD Chinese patients. We identified a known mutation of MAPT (p.Pro301Leu, c.902C>T) in four patients from an autosomal dominant FTD family with behavioral variant FTD (bvFTD) and progressive nonfluent aphasia (PNFA) phenotypes, and a novel mutation in MAPT (p.Leu48Val, c.142 G>C) in a sporadic progressive supranuclear palsy patient. Two novel variations in VCP (p.Thr127Ala, c. 379A>G; p.Asn401Ser, c.1202A>G) were present in both a sporadic FTD and an AD case, and a novel deletion in GRN (560del p.Leufs) was found in a sporadic primary progressive aphasia patient. Mutations of VCP, GRN and MAPT genes are present in Chinese FTD cases. In the case of the MAPT mutation, the family presented with both bvFTD and PNFA phenotypes, while the VCP mutation was also related to an early-onset AD phenotype.
27438830	Behavioral Abnormality Induced by Enhanced Hypothalamo-Pituitary-Adrenocortical Axis Activity under Dietary Zinc Deficiency and Its Usefulness as a Model.	Dietary zinc deficiency increases glucocorticoid secretion from the adrenal cortex via enhanced hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis activity and induces neuropsychological symptoms, i.e., behavioral abnormality. Behavioral abnormality is due to the increase in glucocorticoid secretion rather than disturbance of brain zinc homeostasis, which occurs after the increase in glucocorticoid secretion. A major target of glucocorticoids is the hippocampus and their actions are often associated with disturbance of glutamatergic neurotransmission, which may be linked to behavioral abnormality, such as depressive symptoms and aggressive behavior under zinc deficiency. Glucocorticoid-mediated disturbance of glutamatergic neurotransmission in the hippocampus is also involved in the pathophysiology of, not only psychiatric disorders, such as depression, but also neurodegenerative disorders, e.g., Alzheimer's disease. The evidence suggests that zinc-deficient animals are models for behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD), as well as depression. To understand validity to apply zinc-deficient animals as a behavioral abnormality model, this paper deals with the effect of antidepressive drugs and herbal medicines on hippocampal dysfunctions and behavioral abnormality, which are induced by enhanced HPA axis activity under dietary zinc deficiency.
27437942	Magnetic Resonance Imaging of Vascular Contributions to Cognitive Impairment and Dementia.	Cerebral ischaemic and haemorrhagic lesions are commonly visualised on MRI studies in older patients. Although there is evidence for their association with cognitive outcome in large series, the utility of their detection for individual prognostication is limited at this stage. Studies which evaluate these findings as a comprehensive suite, with due attention to alternative pathological conditions, especially Alzheimer disease, may improve the understanding of the precise contribution of cerebrovascular disease towards cognitive impairment and dementia, and the potential interdependence of this contribution on the presence and severity of alternative brain pathology.
27435367	Feasibility and acceptance of simultaneous amyloid PET/MRI.	PURPOSE: Established Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarker concepts classify into amyloid pathology and neuronal injury biomarkers, while recent alternative concepts classify into diagnostic and progression AD biomarkers. However, combined amyloid positron emission tomography/magnetic resonance imaging (PET/MRI) offers the chance to obtain both biomarker category read-outs within one imaging session, with increased patient as well as referrer convenience. The aim of this pilot study was to investigate this matter for the first time. METHODS: 100 subjects (age 70 +/- 10 yrs, 46 female), n = 51 with clinically defined mild cognitive impairment (MCI), n = 44 with possible/probable AD dementia, and n = 5 with frontotemporal lobe degeneration, underwent simultaneous [18F]florbetaben or [11C]PIB PET/MRI (3 Tesla Siemens mMR). Brain amyloid load, mesial temporal lobe atrophy (MTLA) by means of the Scheltens scale, and other morphological brain pathologies were scored by respective experts. The patients/caregivers as well as the referrers were asked to assess on a five-point scale the convenience related to the one-stop-shop PET and MRI approach. RESULTS: In three subjects, MRI revealed temporal lobe abnormalities other than MTLA. According to the National Institute on Aging-Alzheimer's Association classification, the combined amyloid-beta PET/MRI evaluation resulted in 31 %, 45 %, and 24 % of the MCI subjects being categorized as "MCI-unlikely due to AD", "MCI due to AD-intermediate likelihood", and "MCI due to AD-high likelihood", respectively. 50 % of the probable AD dementia patients were categorized as "High level of evidence of AD pathophysiological process", and 56 % of the possible AD dementia patients as "Possible AD dementia - with evidence of AD pathophysiological process". With regard to the International Working Group 2 classification, 36 subjects had both positive diagnostic and progression biomarkers. The patient/caregiver survey revealed a gain of convenience in 88 % of responders as compared to a theoretically separate PET and MR imaging. In the referrer survey, an influence of the combined amyloid-beta PET/MRI on the final diagnosis was reported by 82 % of responders, with a referrer acceptance score of 3.7 +/- 1.0 on a 5-point scale. CONCLUSION: Simultaneous amyloid PET/MRI is feasible and provides imaging biomarkers of all categories which are able to supplement the clinical diagnosis of MCI due to AD and that of AD dementia. Further, patient and referrer convenience is improved by this one-stop-shop imaging approach.
27434853	1950 MHz radiofrequency electromagnetic fields do not aggravate memory deficits in 5xFAD mice.	The increased use of mobile phones has generated public concern about the impact of radiofrequency electromagnetic fields (RF-EMF) on health. In the present study, we investigated whether RF-EMFs induce molecular changes in amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing and amyloid beta (Abeta)-related memory impairment in the 5xFAD mouse, which is a widely used amyloid animal model. The 5xFAD mice at the age of 1.5 months were assigned to two groups (RF-EMF- and sham-exposed groups, eight mice per group). The RF-EMF group was placed in a reverberation chamber and exposed to 1950 MHz electromagnetic fields for 3 months (SAR 5 W/kg, 2 h/day, 5 days/week). The Y-maze, Morris water maze, and novel object recognition memory test were used to evaluate spatial and non-spatial memory following 3-month RF-EMF exposure. Furthermore, Abeta deposition and APP and carboxyl-terminal fragment beta (CTFbeta) levels were evaluated in the hippocampus and cortex of 5xFAD mice, and plasma levels of Abeta peptides were also investigated. In behavioral tests, mice that were exposed to RF-EMF for 3 months did not exhibit differences in spatial and non-spatial memory compared to the sham-exposed group, and no apparent change was evident in locomotor activity. Consistent with behavioral data, RF-EMF did not alter APP and CTFbeta levels or Abeta deposition in the brains of the 5xFAD mice. These findings indicate that 3-month RF-EMF exposure did not affect Abeta-related memory impairment or Abeta accumulation in the 5xFAD Alzheimer's disease model.

27432682	Genetic and degenerative disorders primarily causing dementia.	Neuroimaging comprises a powerful set of instruments to diagnose the different causes of dementia, clarify their neurobiology, and monitor their treatment. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) depicts volume changes with neurodegeneration and inflammation, as well as abnormalities in functional and structural connectivity. MRI arterial spin labeling allows for the quantification of regional cerebral blood flow, characteristically altered in Alzheimer's disease, diffuse Lewy-body disease, and the frontotemporal dementias. Positron emission tomography allows for the determination of regional metabolism, with similar abnormalities as flow, and for the measurement of beta-amyloid and abnormal tau deposition in the brain, as well as regional inflammation. These instruments allow for the quantification in vivo of most of the pathologic features observed in disorders causing dementia. Importantly, they allow for the longitudinal study of these abnormalities, having revealed, for instance, that the deposition of beta-amyloid in the brain can antecede by decades the onset of dementia. Thus, a therapeutic window has been opened and the efficacy of immunotherapies directed at removing beta-amyloid from the brain of asymptomatic individuals is currently being tested. Tau and inflammation imaging, still in their infancy, combined with genomics, should provide powerful insights into these disorders and facilitate their treatment.
27431356	Global and regional effects of potentially modifiable risk factors associated with acute stroke in 32 countries (INTERSTROKE): a case-control study.	BACKGROUND: Stroke is a leading cause of death and disability, especially in low-income and middle-income countries. We sought to quantify the importance of potentially modifiable risk factors for stroke in different regions of the world, and in key populations and primary pathological subtypes of stroke. METHODS: We completed a standardised international case-control study in 32 countries in Asia, America, Europe, Australia, the Middle East, and Africa. Cases were patients with acute first stroke (within 5 days of symptom onset and 72 h of hospital admission). Controls were hospital-based or community-based individuals with no history of stroke, and were matched with cases, recruited in a 1:1 ratio, for age and sex. All participants completed a clinical assessment and were requested to provide blood and urine samples. Odds ratios (OR) and their population attributable risks (PARs) were calculated, with 99% confidence intervals. FINDINGS: Between Jan 11, 2007, and Aug 8, 2015, 26 919 participants were recruited from 32 countries (13 447 cases [10 388 with ischaemic stroke and 3059 intracerebral haemorrhage] and 13 472 controls). Previous history of hypertension or blood pressure of 140/90 mm Hg or higher (OR 2.98, 99% CI 2.72-3.28; PAR 47.9%, 99% CI 45.1-50.6), regular physical activity (0.60, 0.52-0.70; 35.8%, 27.7-44.7), apolipoprotein (Apo)B/ApoA1 ratio (1.84, 1.65-2.06 for highest vs lowest tertile; 26.8%, 22.2-31.9 for top two tertiles vs lowest tertile), diet (0.60, 0.53-0.67 for highest vs lowest tertile of modified Alternative Healthy Eating Index [mAHEI]; 23.2%, 18.2-28.9 for lowest two tertiles vs highest tertile of mAHEI), waist-to-hip ratio (1.44, 1.27-1.64 for highest vs lowest tertile; 18.6%, 13.3-25.3 for top two tertiles vs lowest), psychosocial factors (2.20, 1.78-2.72; 17.4%, 13.1-22.6), current smoking (1.67, 1.49-1.87; 12.4%, 10.2-14.9), cardiac causes (3.17, 2.68-3.75; 9.1%, 8.0-10.2), alcohol consumption (2.09, 1.64-2.67 for high or heavy episodic intake vs never or former drinker; 5.8%, 3.4-9.7 for current alcohol drinker vs never or former drinker), and diabetes mellitus (1.16, 1.05-1.30; 3.9%, 1.9-7.6) were associated with all stroke. Collectively, these risk factors accounted for 90.7% of the PAR for all stroke worldwide (91.5% for ischaemic stroke, 87.1% for intracerebral haemorrhage), and were consistent across regions (ranging from 82.7% in Africa to 97.4% in southeast Asia), sex (90.6% in men and in women), and age groups (92.2% in patients aged </=55 years, 90.0% in patients aged >55 years). We observed regional variations in the importance of individual risk factors, which were related to variations in the magnitude of ORs (rather than direction, which we observed for diet) and differences in prevalence of risk factors among regions. Hypertension was more associated with intracerebral haemorrhage than with ischaemic stroke, whereas current smoking, diabetes, apolipoproteins, and cardiac causes were more associated with ischaemic stroke (p<0.0001). INTERPRETATION: Ten potentially modifiable risk factors are collectively associated with about 90% of the PAR of stroke in each major region of the world, among ethnic groups, in men and women, and in all ages. However, we found important regional variations in the relative importance of most individual risk factors for stroke, which could contribute to worldwide variations in frequency and case-mix of stroke. Our findings support developing both global and region-specific programmes to prevent stroke.

27431327	A comparison of health utility scores calculated using United Kingdom and Canadian preference weights in persons with alzheimer's disease and their caregivers.	BACKGROUND: The use of the EQ-5D to asses the economic benefits of health technologies has led to questions about the cross-population transferability of preference weights to calculate health utility scores. The aim of this study is to investigate whether the use of UK and Canadian preference weights will lead to the calculation of different health utility scores in a sample of persons with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and their primary informal caregivers. METHODS: We recruited 216 patient-caregiver dyads from nine geriatric and memory clinics across Canada. Participants used the EQ-5D-3L to rate their health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL). EQ-5D-3L responses were transformed into health utility scores using UK and Canadian preference weights. The levels of agreement between the two sets of scores were assessed using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs). Bland-Altman plots depicted individual-level differences between the two sets of scores. Differences in health utility scores were tested using the Wilcoxon signed rank sum test. A generalized linear model with a gamma distribution was used to examine whether participants' socio-demographic characteristics were associated with their health utility scores. RESULTS: The distributions of health utility scores derived from both the UK and Canadian preference weights were skewed to the left. The intraclass correlation coefficient was 0.94 (95 % CI: 0.92, 0.95) for persons with AD and 0.92 (95 % CI: 0.88, 0.94) for the caregivers. The Canadian weights yielded slightly higher median health utility scores than the UK weights for caregivers (median difference: 0.009; 95 % confidence interval: 0.007, 0.013). This finding persisted after stratifying by disease severity. Few socio-demographic characteristics were associated with the two sets of health utility scores. CONCLUSIONS: Health utility scores exhibited small and clinically unimportant differences when calculated with UK versus Canadian preference weights in persons with AD and their caregivers. The original UK and Canadian population samples used to obtain the preference weights valued health states similarly.
27430976	The association between caregiver well-being and care provided to persons with Alzheimer's disease and related disorders.	BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease and related disorders (ADRD) are some of the leading causes of morbidity in developed nations. Unpaid family caregivers are primarily responsible for providing the care and support needed by persons with ADRD. In the process of caring for their loved ones with ADRD, caregivers often have to deal with multiple challenges, including their own deteriorating well-being and overall quality-of-life (QoL). A recent systematic review showed that very little research has been undertaken to study the relationship between AD caregiver QoL and the level or quality of care that caregivers provide to their loved ones. In this study, we investigate the relationships between caregiver well-being and the care provided to persons with ADRD. METHODS: We used 12-month follow-up data from the Philadelphia site (n = 125) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) multi-site study, Resources for Enhancing Alzheimer's Caregiver Health (REACH I) to examine the relationship between caregiver well-being and the level or quality of care provided while adjusting for important covariates (e.g., age, income, and years since caregiving). Caregivers who participated in REACH I had to be at least 21 years of age and they had to be providing at least 4 h of care per day for 6 months or more to a live-in loved one with ADRD. Linear regression analysis was used to examine the relationships between well-being and the level or quality of care provided to persons with ADRD. RESULTS: Of the 255 caregivers who participated in the REACH I study, 125 (49.0 %) remained after 12 months of follow-up. Comparisons of participants at the 12-month follow-up and participants who were lost to follow-up showed that these two sets of participants were not statistically significantly different on any of the variables examined in this study. Linear regression analysis showed that there was no statistically significant association between caregiver well-being and level or quality of care provided. CONCLUSIONS: Further research is required to investigate the factors associated with level and quality of care provided to persons with ADRD, and whether caregiver well-being (or QoL in general) is a contributor.
27430946	Characterization of the radiolabeled metabolite of tau PET tracer 18F-THK5351.	PURPOSE: 18F-THK5351 is a novel radiotracer developed for in vivo imaging of tau pathology in the brain. For the quantitative assessment of tau deposits in the brain, it is important that the radioactive metabolite does not enter the brain and that it does not bind to tau fibrils. The purpose of the study was to identify a radiolabeled metabolite of 18F-THK5351 in blood samples from human subjects and to characterize its pharmacological properties. METHODS: Venous blood samples were collected from three human subjects after injection of 18F-THK5351 and the plasma metabolite was measured by high performance thin layer chromatography. In addition, mass spectrometry analysis and enzymatic assays were used to identify this metabolite. Mice were used to investigate the blood-brain barrier permeability of the radioactive metabolite. Furthermore, the binding ability of the metabolite to tau aggregates was evaluated using autoradiography and binding assays using human brain samples. RESULTS: About 13 % of the unmetabolized radiotracer was detectable in human plasma at 60 min following the injection of 18F-THK5351. The isolated radiometabolite of 18F-THK5351 was the sulphoconjugate of THK5351. This metabolite could be produced in vitro by incubating THK5351 with liver but not brain homogenates. The metabolite did not penetrate the blood-brain barrier in mice, and exhibited little binding to tau protein aggregates in post-mortem human brain samples. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the sole metabolite detectable in plasma seems to be generated outside the brain and does not cross into the brain, which does not affect quantitative analysis of PET images.
27430453	Imaging of neurodegenerative cognitive and behavioral disorders: practical considerations for dementia clinical practice.	This chapter reviews clinical applications and imaging findings useful in medical practice relating to neurodegenerative cognitive/dementing disorders. The preponderance of evidence and consensus guidelines support an essential role of multitiered neuroimaging in the evaluation and management of neurodegenerative cognitive/dementia syndrome that range in severity from mild impairments to frank dementia. Additionally, imaging features are incorporated in updated clinical and research diagnostic criteria for most dementias, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), Frontotemporal Lobar Degenerations/Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD), and Vascular Cognitive Impairment (VCI). Best clinical practices dictate that structural imaging, preferably with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) when possible and computed tomography when not, be obtained as a first-tier approach during the course of a thorough clinical evaluation to improve diagnostic confidence and assess for nonneurodegenerative treatable conditions that may cause or substantially contribute to cognitive/behavioral symptoms or which may dictate a substantial change in management. These conditions include less common structural (e.g., mass lesions such as tumors and hematomas; normal-pressure hydrocephalus), inflammatory, autoimmune and infectious conditions, and more common comorbid contributing conditions (e.g., vascular cerebral injury causing leukoaraiosis, infarcts, or microhemorrhages) that can produce a mixed dementia syndrome. When, after appropriate clinical, cognitive/neuropsychologic, and structural neuroimaging assessment, a dementia specialist remains in doubt regarding etiology and appropriate management, second-tier imaging with molecular methods, preferably with fluorodexoyglucose positron emission tomography (PET) (or single-photon emission computed tomography if PET is unavailable) can provide more diagnostic specificity (e.g., help differentiate between atypical AD and FTD as the etiology for a frontal/dysexecutive syndrome). The potential clinical utility of other promising methods, whether already approved for use (e.g., amyloid PET) or as yet only used in research (e.g., tau PET, functional MRI, diffusor tensor imaging), remains to be proven for widespread use in community practice. However, these constitute unreimbursed third-tier options that merit further study for clinical and cost-effective utility. In the future, combination use of imaging methods will likely improve diagnostic accuracy.
27429982	CX3CL1/CX3CR1 in Alzheimer's Disease: A Target for Neuroprotection.	CX3C chemokine ligand 1 (CX3CL1) is an intriguing chemokine belonging to the CX3C family. CX3CL1 is secreted by neurons and plays an important role in modulating glial activation in the central nervous system after binding to its sole receptor CX3CR1 which mainly is expressed on microglia. Emerging data highlights the beneficial potential of CX3CL1-CX3CR1 in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), a common progressive neurodegenerative disease, and in the progression of which neuroinflammation plays a vital role. Even so, the importance of CX3CL1/CX3CR1 in AD is still controversial and needs further clarification. In this review, we make an attempt to present a concise map of CX3CL1-CX3CR1 associated with AD to find biomarkers for early diagnosis or therapeutic interventions.
27429978	Tau-Centric Targets and Drugs in Clinical Development for the Treatment of Alzheimer's Disease.	The failure of several Phase II/III clinical trials in Alzheimer's disease (AD) with drugs targeting beta-amyloid accumulation in the brain fuelled an increasing interest in alternative treatments against tau pathology, including approaches targeting tau phosphatases/kinases, active and passive immunization, and anti-tau aggregation. The most advanced tau aggregation inhibitor (TAI) is methylthioninium (MT), a drug existing in equilibrium between a reduced (leuco-methylthioninium) and oxidized form (MT(+)). MT chloride (methylene blue) was investigated in a 24-week Phase II clinical trial in 321 patients with mild to moderate AD that failed to show significant positive effects in mild AD patients, although long-term observations (50 weeks) and biomarker studies suggested possible benefit. The dose of 138 mg/day showed potential benefits on cognitive performance of moderately affected AD patients and cerebral blood flow in mildly affected patients. Further clinical evidence will come from the large ongoing Phase III trials for the treatment of AD and the behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia on a new form of this TAI, more bioavailable and less toxic at higher doses, called TRx0237. More recently, inhibitors of tau acetylation are being actively pursued based on impressive results in animal studies obtained by salsalate, a clinically used derivative of salicylic acid.
27427537	Taste detection and recognition thresholds in Japanese patients with Alzheimer-type dementia.	OBJECTIVE: Alzheimer-type dementia (AD) is pathologically characterized by massive neuronal loss in the brain, and the taste cortex is thought to be affected. However, there are only a few reports regarding the gustatory function of AD patients, and the conclusions of this research are inconsistent. METHODS: This prospective study enrolled 22 consecutive patients with mild to moderately severe Alzheimer-type dementia (AD) with mean age of 84.0 years, and 49 elderly volunteers without dementia with mean age of 71.0 years as control subjects. The control subjects were divided into two groups according to age: a younger group (N=28, mean age: 68.5) and an older group (N=21, mean age: 83.0). The gustatory function was investigated using the filter paper disc method (FPD) and electrogustometry (EGM). RESULTS: The gustatory function as measured by the FPD was significantly impaired in patients with AD as compared with age-matched control subjects; no such difference was found between the younger and the older control groups. On the other hand, as for the EGM thresholds, there were no differences between the AD patient group and the age-matched controls. CONCLUSION: The FPD method demonstrated decreased gustatory function in AD patients beyond that of aging. On the other hand, EGM thresholds did not differ between the AD patient group and the age-matched controls. These results suggest that failure of taste processing in the brain, but not taste transmission in the peripheral taste system, occurs in patients with AD.
27423359	(1)H-MRS asymmetry changes in the anterior and posterior cingulate gyrus in patients with mild cognitive impairment and mild Alzheimer's disease.	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia worldwide. Amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) is often the prodromal stage to AD. Most patients with aMCI harbor the pathologic changes of AD and demonstrate transition to AD at a rate of 10%-15% per year. Patients with AD and aMCI experience progressive brain metabolite changes. Accumulating evidence indicates that the asymmetry changes of left and right brain happen in the early stage of AD. However, the features of asymmetry changes in both anterior cingulate gyrus (ACG) and posterior cingulate gyrus (PCG) are still unclear. Here, we examine the left-right asymmetry changes of metabolites in ACG and PCG. Fifteen cases of mild AD patients meeting criteria for probable AD of NINDS-ADRDA, thirteen cases of aMCI according to the Mayo Clinic Alzheimer's Disease Research Center criteria, and sixteen cases of age-matched normal controls (NC) received Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS) for measurement of NAA/mI, NAA/Cr, Cho/Cr, and mI/Cr ratios in the PCG and ACG bilaterally. We analyzed (1)H-MRS data by paired t-test to validate the left-right asymmetry of (1)H-MRS data in the PCG and ACG. In AD, there was a significant difference in mI/Cr between the left and right ACG (P<0.001) and the left and right PCG (P=0.007). In aMCI, there was a significant difference in mI/Cr between the left and right ACG (P<0.001). In NC, there were no differences in the ratio value of metabolites NAA/mI, NAA/Cr, Cho/Cr, and mI/Cr between the left and right ACG and PCG. Thus, the left-right asymmetry of mI/Cr in the ACG and PCG may be an important biological indicator of mild AD.
27422544	p53 and mitochondrial dysfunction: novel insight of neurodegenerative diseases.	Mitochondria are organelles responsible for vital cell functions. p53 is a transcription factor that regulates the DNA stability and cell growth normality. Recent studies revealed that p53 can influence mitochondrial function changing from normal condition to abnormal condition under different stress levels. In normal state, p53 can maintain mitochondrial respiration through transactivation of SCO2. When stress stimuli presents, SCO2 overexpresses and leads to ROS generation. ROS promotes p53 inducing MALM (Mieap-induced accumulation of lysosome-like organelles within mitochondria) to repair dysfunctional mitochondria and MIV (Mieap-induced vacuole) to accomplish damaged mitochondria degradation. If stress or damage is irreversible, p53 will translocate to mitochondria, leading into apoptosis or necrosis. Neurodegenerative diseases including Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease and Alzheimer's disease are still lack of clear explanations of mechanisms, but more studies have revealed the functional relationship between mitochondria and p53 towards the pathological development of these diseases. In this review, we discuss that p53 plays the vital role in the function of mitochondria in the aspect of pathological change metabolism. We also analyze these diseases with novel targeted treating molecules which are related to p53 and mitochondria, hoping to present novel therapies in future clinic.
27420981	Applying the Fisher score to identify Alzheimer's disease-related genes.	Biologists and scientists can use the data from Alzheimer's disease (AD) gene expression microarrays to mine AD disease-related genes. Because of disadvantages such as small sample sizes, high dimensionality, and a high level of noise, it is difficult to obtain accurate and meaningful biological information from gene expression profiles. In this paper, we present a novel approach for utilizing AD microarray data to identify the morbigenous genes. The Fisher score, a classical feature selection method, is utilized to evaluate the importance of each gene. Genes with a large between-classes variance and small within-class variance are selected as candidate morbigenous genes. The results using an AD dataset show that the proposed approach is effective for gene selection. Satisfactory accuracy can be achieved by using only a small number of selected genes.
27419676	[Family dynamics in face of Alzheimer's in one of its member].	OBJECTIVE: To understand the family dynamics when there is a member in the residence with Alzheimer's disease. METHOD: A study of qualitative approach, using the creative sensitive method (CSM), and with participation of two families who had a member with Alzheimer's disease at home. RESULTS: Three categories emerged: Effects of Alzheimer's disease and the family dynamics; Development process of Alzheimer's disease and Coping strategies in face of the disease. CONCLUSION: It was possible to know the manifestations and consequences of Alzheimer's disease in the family, such as mutual help, the mobilization of resources to activate memories of the past, spirituality and faith. There was also understanding of the structure of family dynamics.
27418812	Long noncoding RNAs and Alzheimer's disease.	Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are typically defined as transcripts longer than 200 nucleotides. lncRNAs can regulate gene expression at epigenetic, transcriptional, and posttranscriptional levels. Recent studies have shown that lncRNAs are involved in many neurological diseases such as epilepsy, neurodegenerative conditions, and genetic disorders. Alzheimer's disease is a neurodegenerative disease, which accounts for >80% of dementia in elderly subjects. In this review, we will highlight recent studies investigating the role of lncRNAs in Alzheimer's disease and focus on some specific lncRNAs that may underlie Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology and therefore could be potential therapeutic targets.
27418712	Discovery of Novel Biomarkers for Alzheimer's Disease from Blood.	Blood-based biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease would be very valuable because blood is a more accessible biofluid and is suitable for repeated sampling. However, currently there are no robust and reliable blood-based biomarkers for practical diagnosis. In this study we used a knowledge-based protein feature pool and two novel support vector machine embedded feature selection methods to find panels consisting of two and three biomarkers. We validated these biomarker sets using another serum cohort and an RNA profile cohort from the brain. Our panels included the proteins ECH1, NHLRC2, HOXB7, FN1, ERBB2, and SLC6A13 and demonstrated promising sensitivity (>87%), specificity (>91%), and accuracy (>89%).
27417070	Cross-Ethnic Differences in the Severity of Neuropsychiatric Symptoms in Persons With Mild Cognitive Impairment and Alzheimer's Disease.	In this cross-sectional study, we examined the neuropsychiatric profile of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire (NPI-Q). Data were available on 875 controls, 339 MCI cases, and 975 AD participants. Surprisingly, differences in neuropsychiatric symptom (NPS) severity by ethnicity in subjects with AD, but not with MCI, were found. More so, in Hispanics with AD, a higher frequency in most of the individual NPI-Q symptom items of the scale was observed, except for apathy. After adjustment for clinical features, some individual NPI-Q symptoms also showed an association with Hispanic ethnicity in the control group that nearly reached statistical significance. There may be cross-ethnic differences in the neuropsychiatric presentation of AD in Hispanics versus non-Hispanic whites. Future studies are needed to clarify the etiology of these differences, and to assess the need for ethnicity-specific treatment and care-giving interventions.
27416935	Chinese Herbal Medicine for Mild Cognitive Impairment: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Cognitive Outcomes.	Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a condition that may be prodromal to the development of dementia. There remain, as yet, no approved pharmaceutical interventions for MCI. Chinese herbal medicines (CHMs) have a long history of use for cognitive impairments and some plant ingredients have shown neuroprotective actions in experimental studies. This review assesses the current clinical evidence from controlled clinical trials for the effects of CHMs on cognitive outcomes as measured by Mini-mental state examination (MMSE) or Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog). Fifty one studies (4026 participants) were included. These compared CHM with placebo, supportive care, pharmaceutical treatment or combined CHM with a pharmaceutical in an integrative setting. For the eight randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of comparisons with placebo, MMSE was significantly higher in the CHM groups (MD 1.56 [0.78, 2.34] I2 = 85%, n = 503), similarly for eight RCTs of comparisons with supportive care (MD 1.77 [1.33, 2.21] I2 = 0%, n = 555). Benefits were also evident in comparisons with some pharmaceuticals and with integrative treatment. The small size of most studies and methodological weaknesses mean that these results should be interpreted with caution. Further studies employing rigorous methods are required to investigate the potential benefits of these CHMs for MCI. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
27414248	Potential therapeutic action of natural products from traditional Chinese medicine on Alzheimer's disease animal models targeting neurotrophic factors.	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder in which the death of brain cells leads to memory loss and cognitive decline. To reduce the death rate and improve the biological activity of neurocytes, neurotrophic factors (NTFs) exhibit therapeutic effect on AD. However, therapeutic application of exogenous NTFs in treatment of AD is largely limited due to short half-life, poor stability, etc. Various extracts of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) have been shown to exhibit therapeutic effects on AD, and some of these effects are associated with regulation on the expression of nerve growth factor, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and their associated receptors. This article reviews the progress on promotion of Panax ginseng, Rehmannia glutinosa Libosch., Epimedium, Polygala tenuifolia Willd, and seven other TCMs on secretion of NTFs during AD, with a view to preparation development and clinical application of these TCMs on AD.
27413743	A Novel Homozygous p.L539F Mutation Identified in PINK1 Gene in a Moroccan Patient with Parkinsonism.	Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder after Alzheimer's disease. Ten of fifteen causative genes linked to familial forms of PD have been reported to cause autosomal recessive forms. Among them, mutations in the PTEN-induced kinase 1 (PINK1) gene were shown to be responsible for a phenotype characterized by early onset, good response to levodopa, and a benign course. Using chromosomal microarray analysis and Sanger sequencing, we identified a homozygous G/C substitution in a 58-year-old Moroccan man diagnosed with recessive inherited Parkinson's disease. This G-to-C transition occurred at position 1617 leading to an amino acid change L/F at position 539 located in highly conserved motif in the C terminal sequence of PINK1. Interestingly, the c.1617G>C substitution is absent in 192 ethnically matched control chromosomes. Our findings have shown that the p.L539F is a novel mutation located in the C terminal sequence of the PINK1 protein that could be pathogenic and responsible for a clinical phenotype resembling idiopathic Parkinson's disease with rapid progression and early cognitive impairment.
27413420	Biological Activities of 2,3,5,4'-Tetrahydroxystilbene-2-O-beta-D-Glucoside in Antiaging and Antiaging-Related Disease Treatments.	2,3,5,4'-Tetrahydroxystilbene-2-O-beta-D-glucoside (THSG) is active component of the Chinese medicinal plant Polygonum multiflorum Thunb. (THSG). Pharmacological studies have demonstrated that THSG exhibits numerous biological functions in treating atherosclerosis, lipid metabolism, vascular and cardiac remodeling, vascular fibrosis, cardiac-cerebral ischemia, learning and memory disorders, neuroinflammation, Alzheimer and Parkinson diseases, diabetic complications, hair growth problems, and numerous other conditions. This review focuses on the biological effects of THSG in antiaging and antiaging-related disease treatments and discusses its molecular mechanisms.
27412874	MicroRNAs in glaucoma and neurodegenerative diseases.	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) constitute a class of short, non-coding RNAs, which have important role in post-transcriptional regulation of genes expression by base-pairing with their target messenger RNA (mRNA). In recent years, miRNAs biogenesis, gene silencing mechanism and implication in various diseases have been thoroughly investigated. Many scientific findings indicate the altered expression of specific miRNA in the brains of patients affected by neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and Huntington disease. The progressive optic nerve neuropathy associated with changed miRNA profile was also observed during glaucoma development. This suggests that the miRNAs may have a crucial role in these disorders, contributing to the neuronal cell death. A better understanding of molecular mechanism of these disorders will open a new potential way of ND treatment. In this review, the miRNAs role in particular neurodegenerative disorders and their possible application in medicine was discussed.
27411668	An autopsy case of a centenarian with the pathology of senile dementia of the neurofibrillary tangle type.	A Japanese woman showed slowly progressive memory disturbance since the age of 85 years. Later, disorientation gradually appeared. Head computed tomography revealed severe hippocampal atrophy, particularly in the posterior portion, and lateral ventricular dilatation, particularly in the inferior horn at the age of 99 years. The amygdala was relatively preserved from atrophy, and atrophy of the frontal lobe was relatively mild for her age. Apolipoprotein E gene analysis showed the epsilon3 homozygous phenotype. The woman died at the age of 101 years, and her clinical diagnosis was mild Alzheimer's disease. No apparent behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia were observed during the disease course. Autopsy revealed severe hippocampal atrophy with numerous neurofibrillary tangles and ghost tangles, particularly in the hippocampal region, but senile plaques were rarely observed in the brain. The pathological findings were compatible with senile dementia of the neurofibrillary tangle type, whereas other neurodegenerative disorders were not recognized. The clinicopathologic findings of the present case are considered significant for the clinical diagnosis and pathogenesis of senile dementia of the neurofibrillary tangle type.
27410241	Population Normative Data for the CERAD Word List and Victoria Stroop Test in Younger- and Middle-Aged Adults: Cross-Sectional Analyses from the Framingham Heart Study.	BACKGROUND/STUDY CONTEXT: To provide baseline normative data on tests of verbal memory and executive function for nondemented younger- and middle-aged adults. METHODS: The Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease word list memory task (CERAD-WL) and Victoria Stroop Test (VST) were administered to 3362 Framingham Heart Study (FHS) volunteer participants aged 24-78 years. Analyses of the effects of age, gender, and education were conducted. Normative data on traditional measures and error responses are reported for each test. RESULTS: Traditional measures were significantly associated with both age and education in this cohort. Error responses also evidenced significant age and education effects. CONCLUSION: These data provide a normative comparison for assessment of verbal memory and executive functioning capabilities in younger- and middle-aged adults and may be utilized as a tool for preclinical studies of disease in this population.
27406225	Evaluating genotoxic risks in Brazilian public health agents occupationally exposed to pesticides: a multi-biomarker approach.	This is the first study demonstrating genotoxic effects and whole transcriptome analysis on community health agents (CHAs) occupationally exposed to pesticides in Central Brazil. For the transcriptome analysis, we found some genes related to Alzheimer's disease (LRP1), an insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF2R), immunity genes (IGL family and IGJ), two genes related to inflammatory reaction (CXCL5 and CCL3), one gene related to maintenance of cellular morphology (NHS), one gene considered to be a strong apoptosis inductor (LGALS14), and several transcripts of the neuroblastoma breakpoint family (NBPF). Related to comet assay, we demonstrated a significant increase in DNA damage, measured by the olive tail moment (OTM), in the exposed group compared to the control group. Moreover, we also observed a statistically significant difference in OTM values depending on GSTM1 genotypes. Therefore, Brazilian epidemiological surveillance, an organization responsible for the assessment and management of health risks associated to pesticide exposure to CHA, needs to be more proactive and considers the implications of pesticide exposure for CHA procedures and processes.
27406068	Phytochemical and biological investigations of Amaryllidaceae alkaloids: a review.	Amaryllidaceae is a family that includes 75 genera and about 1100 species, which have a long history of medicinal use. Many plants have been proven to possess efficacy for neurological injury and inflammatory conditions. This article summarizes 357 Amaryllidaceae alkaloids, and cites 166 174 references over the last three decades. These alkaloids are classified into 14 skeleton types, and their abundant sources are also included. Modern pharmacology studies demonstrate that alkaloids that exclusively occur in Amaryllidaceae plant possess wide-ranging pharmacological actions, especially effects on the central nervous system, as well as antitumor, antimicrobial, and anti-inflammatory activities. Effective monomeric compounds from Amaryllidaceae screened for pharmacological activity in vivo and in vitro are also summarized.
27405156	[Effects of resveratrol-induced cellular autophagy in control of neurodegenerative diseases].	Cellular autophagy is a major degradative pathway for clearance of aggregate-prone proteins and damaged organelles. It plays an important role in regulating cellular homeostasis, cell growth and development, and disease development. Dysfunctional autophagy contributes to the pathology of various neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and Huntington's disease, in which specific pathological protein accumulation occurs. A growing body of evidence suggests that resveratrol plays a significantly role in the regulation of autophagy and clearance of pathological proteins. Resveratrol is a potential drug for neurodegenerative diseases therapy. This review focuses on the effects of resveratrol on cellular autophagy and clinical application in the control of neurodegenerative diseases.
27403908	[Evaluation of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation effectiveness in treatment of psychiatric and neurologic diseases].	Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a treatment option with proved effectiveness especially in drug resist depression. It is used in functional brain mapping before neurosurgery operations and diagnostic of corticospinal tract transmission. Many studies are performed to evaluate rTMS using in treatment of obsessive - compulsive disorder, schizophrenia, autism, strokes, tinnitus, Alzheimer and Parkinson diseases, cranial traumas. Moreover rTMS was used in treatment of multiple sclerosis, migraine, dystonia. Electromagnetical field generated by rTMS penetrate skin of the scalp and infiltrate brain tissues to a depth of 2 cm, cause neurons depolarization and generating motor, cognitive and affective effects. Depending on the stimulation frequency rTMS can stimuli or inhibit brain cortex. rTMS mechanism of action remains elusive. Probably it is connected with enhancement of neurotransmitters, modulation of signals transductions pathways in Central Nervous System, gene transcription and release of neuroprotective substances. Studies with use of animals revealed that rTMS stimulation can generate brain changes similar to those seen after electric shock therapy without provoking seizures. The aim of presenting study was to analyze actual researches evaluating rTMS use in treatment of psychiatric and neurological diseases.
27400251	Chemical modifications of amyloid-beta(1-42) have a significant impact on the repertoire of brain amyloid-beta(1-42) binding proteins.	The amyloid-beta peptide(1-42) (Abeta) is a key player in the development and progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although much attention is paid to its role in formation of extracellular amyloid plaques and protein aggregates as well as to corresponding mechanisms of their toxicity, good evidence exists that intracellular Abeta can accumulate intraneuronally and interact with intracellular target proteins. However, intracellular Abeta binding proteins as well as conditions favoring their interactions with Abeta are poorly characterized. In this study we have investigated the effect of two known pathogenic Abeta modifications, isomerization of Asp7 and phosphorylation of Ser8, on the proteomic profiles of mouse brain Abeta binding proteins. Phosphorylation of Ser8 and especially isomerization of Asp7 significantly extended the repertoire of mouse brain Abeta binding proteins. However, there were 61 proteins, common for three types of the affinity ligands. They obviously represent potential targets for direct interaction with all Abeta species. Taking into consideration spontaneous mode of Asp7 isomerization and reports on initial accumulation of phosphorylated Abeta species inside neurons it is reasonable to suggest that these modifications of intracellular Abeta peptides causing the significant increase in the repertoire of Abeta binding proteins represent a primary pathogenic effect that precedes formation of extracellular pathogenic oligomerization/aggregation of Abeta peptides well described in the literature.
27399239	Multimodality Review of Amyloid-related Diseases of the Central Nervous System.	Amyloid-beta (Abeta) is ubiquitous in the central nervous system (CNS), but pathologic accumulation of Abeta results in four distinct neurologic disorders that affect middle-aged and elderly adults, with diverse clinical presentations ranging from chronic debilitating dementia to acute life-threatening intracranial hemorrhage. The characteristic imaging patterns of Abeta-related CNS diseases reflect the pathophysiology of Abeta deposition in the CNS. Abeta is recognized as a key component in the neuronal damage that characterizes the pathophysiology of Alzheimer disease, the most common form of dementia. Targeted molecular imaging shows pathologic accumulation of Abeta and tau protein, and fluorine 18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography and anatomic imaging allow differentiation of typical patterns of neuronal dysfunction and loss in patients with Alzheimer disease from those seen in patients with other types of dementia. Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is an important cause of cognitive impairment and spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage in the elderly. Hemorrhage and white matter injury seen at imaging reflect vascular damage caused by the accumulation of Abeta in vessel walls. The rare forms of inflammatory angiopathy attributed to Abeta, Abeta-related angiitis and CAA-related inflammation, cause debilitating neurologic symptoms that improve with corticosteroid therapy. Imaging shows marked subcortical and cortical inflammation due to perivascular inflammation, which is incited by vascular Abeta accumulation. In the rarest of the four disorders, cerebral amyloidoma, the macroscopic accumulation of Abeta mimics the imaging appearance of tumors. Knowledge of the imaging patterns and pathophysiology is essential for accurate diagnosis of Abeta-related diseases of the CNS. ((c))RSNA, 2016.
27399073	Long-term clinical outcomes of laparoscopy-assisted distal gastrectomy versus open distal gastrectomy for early gastric cancer: A comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized control trials.	The objective of this study was to compare long-term surgical outcomes and complications of laparoscopy-assisted distal gastrectomy (LADG) with open distal gastrectomy (ODG) for the treatment of early gastric cancer (EGC) based on a review of available randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluated using the Cochrane methodology.RCTs comparing LADG and ODG were identified by a systematic literature search in PubMed, Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Scopus, and the China Knowledge Resource Integrated Database, for papers published from January 1, 2003 to July 30, 2015. Meta-analyses were performed to compare the long-term clinical outcomes.Our systematic literature search identified 8 eligible RCTs including 732 patients (374 LADGs and 358 ODGs), with low overall risk of bias. Long-term mortality and relapse rate were comparable for both techniques. The long-term complication rate was 8.47% in LADG groups and 13.62% in the ODG group, indicating that LADG was associated with lower risk for long-term complications (RR = 0.63; 95%CI = 0.39-1.00; P = 0.03).In the treatment of EGC, LADG lowered the rate of long- and short-term complications and promoted earlier recovery, with comparable oncological outcomes to ODG.
27397807	[An 87-year-old-man with late-onset frontotemporal dementia: a case-study].	An 87-year-old man showed behavioral disinhibition and nocturnal restlessness as well as short-term memory problems. We diagnosed late-onset frontotemporal dementia (LO-FTD), a relatively rare disease. Based on the course of the disease progress, we ruled out medication-induced mania and bipolar disorder. Given the results of the CT-scan, we also dismissed the possibility that the patient was suffering from dementia based on Alzheimer's disease and vascular factors that followed an atypical course. Our article illustrates the complexity of the diagnostic process investigating LO-FTD.
27396589	Cognitive Function and the Ageing Process: The Peculiar Role of Mild Thyroid Failure.	BACKGROUND: Over the last decades an increasing body of evidence suggested a possible relationship between thyroid hormone (TH) and the ageing process, and several efforts have been made to determine the actual role of TH dynamic during human life. It is still unclear whether the serum level shift of Thyroid Stimulating Hormone toward higher value, observed during ageing, is a normal adaptive response associated with senescence or an actual mild thyroid dysfunction. A growing body of evidence supports the hypothesis of a reset of the hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid axis in order to contrast the catabolic status of the ageing process. On the other hand, several meta-analyses showed a direct link between subclinical hypothyroidism (sHT) and cardiovascular events (both ischemic heart disease and stroke), although mainly in individuals younger than 65 years. Similarly, a recent meta-analysis documented consistent data on a positive relationship between sHT and cognitive impairment, but only in individuals younger than 75 years. CONCLUSION: The available data suggest a complex relationship between mild thyroid failure and the ageing process as well as the development and progression of several cardiovascular and neurological diseases. In this paper, we reviewed the scientific English literature on sHT and the ageing process focusing on experimental evidences related to cognitive impairment and dementia. Moreover, we focused on new patents of treatments potentially able to improve the care of sHT patients, especially in the elderly, where treatment drawbacks may have negative impact on the long term outcome.
27396304	MicroRNAs in Neurocognitive Dysfunctions: New Molecular Targets for Pharmacological Treatments?	BACKGROUND: Neurodegenerative and cognitive disorders are multifactorial diseases (i.e., involving neurodevelopmental, genetic, age or environmental factors) characterized by an abnormal development that affects neuronal function and integrity. Recently, an increasing number of studies revealed that the dysregulation of microRNAs (miRNAs) may be involved in the etiology of cognitive disorders as Alzheimer, Parkinson, and Huntington's diseases, Schizophrenia and Autism spectrum disorders. METHODS: From an extensive search in bibliographic databases of peer-reviewed research literature, we identified relevant published studies related to specific key words such as memory, cognition, neurodegenerative disorders, neurogenesis and miRNA. We then analysed, evaluated and summerized scientific evidences derived from these studies. RESULTS: We first briefly summarize the basic molecular events involved in memory, a process inherent to cognitive disease, and then describe the role of miRNAs in neurodevelopment, synaptic plasticity and memory. Secondly, we provide an overview of the impact of miRNA dysregulation in the pathogenesis of different neurocognitive disorders, and lastly discuss the feasibility of miRNA-based therapeutics in the treatment of these disorders. CONCLUSION: This review highlights the molecular basis of neurodegenerative and cognitive disorders by focusing on the impact of miRNAs dysregulation in these pathological phenotypes. Altogether, the published reports suggest that miRNAs-based therapy could be a viable therapeutic alternative to current treatment options in the future.
27396229	Cholinesterase Inhibitors and Behavioral & Psychological Symptoms of Alzheimer's Disease.	OBJECTIVE: Examine the effect of cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEIs) on behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), and compared the dosages of antipsychotics and SSRIs or SNRIs used to treat BPSD in patients with and without ChEIs. MATERIAL AND METHOD: The cross-sectional study of Alzheimer patients who had been taking ChEls for at least six months (ChEI+) or had never been on any ChEIs (ChEI-) were enrolled from the Memory Clinic, Ramathibodi hospital between September 1, 2014 and February 28, 2015. All of these patients were evaluated with Mini-Mental Status Exam (MMSE) for cognitive function, Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Questionnaire (NPI-Q) for BPSD, and psychotropic dosage used. RESULTS: Fifty-one Alzheimer patients were enrolled, 31 patients in the ChEI+ group and 20 patients in the ChEI- group. Mean and SD of MMSEs in ChEI+ and ChEI- were 13.6 +/- 1.2 and 11.75 +/- 1.4, respectively (p-value = 0.33). The Mean and SD of NPI scores in ChEI+ and ChEI- were 15.68 +/- 14.31 and 19.5 +/- 20.1, respectively (p-value = 0.43). Patients in ChEI + had tend to had a lower depression severity score (p = 0.10) and lower burden from aggression/agitation (p = 0.08). The differences were not statistically signifcant. Mean highest dosages per day (olanzapine equivalence) in the ChEI+ and ChEI- were 1.6 mg and 3.1 mg, respectively (p-value = 0.07). CONCLUSION: The total off NPI score between the ChEI+ and ChEI- groups were not different, but there were report the trends toward lower depression severity score, aggression/agitation distress score, and antipsychotic dosages use in the ChEI+.
27395469	[Late-onset Neurodegenerative Diseases Following Traumatic Brain Injury: Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE) and Alzheimer's Disease Secondary to TBI (AD-TBI)].	Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a neurodegenerative disease, which is associated with mild repetitive traumatic brain injury (TBI). This long-term and progressive symptom due to TBI was initially called punch-drunk syndrome or dementia pugilistica, since it was believed to be associated with boxing. However, serial neuropathological studies of mild repetitive TBI in the last decade have revealed that CTE occurs not only in boxers but also in a wider population including American football players, wrestlers, and military personnel. CTE has gained large public interest owing to dramatic cases involving retired professional athletes wherein serious behavioral problems and tragic incidents were reported. Unlike mild repetitive TBI, a single episode of severe TBI can cause another type of late-onset neuropsychiatric disease including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Several epidemiological studies have shown that a single episode of severe TBI is one of the major risk factors of AD. Pathologically, both AD and CTE are characterized by abnormal accumulations of hyperphosphorylated tau proteins. However, recent neuropathological studies revealed that CTE demonstrates a unique pattern of tau pathology in neurons and astrocytes, and accumulation of other misfolded proteins such as TDP-43. Currently, no reliable biomarkers of late-onset neurodegenerative diseases following TBI are available, and a definitive diagnosis can be made only via postmortem neuropathological examination. Development in neuroimaging techniques such as tau and amyloid positron emission tomography imaging might not only enable early diagnosis of CTE, but also contribute to the interventions for prevention of late-onset neurodegenerative diseases following TBI. Further studies are necessary to elucidate the mechanisms of neurodegeneration in the living brain of patients with TBI.
27395468	[Environmental Risk Factors for Dementia].	Owing to recent advancements in imaging techniques and biomarker research, the natural history of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has become clear from the very first preclinical stage. According to the study, more than 20 years before the onset of AD, Abeta starts to accumulate in the brain. This induces neurofibrillary tangle formation in the cerebral isocortex, leading to cognitive decline. If this process is suppressed, disease activity can be controlled. However, at this point, the best and most realistic way to deal with AD is to target the environmental factors that have been identified as risk factors by epidemiological studies.
27395466	[Alcohol and the Risk of Dementia].	This article reviews studies examining the relationship between alcohol consumption and dementia. Several studies have found that light to moderate alcohol consumption might be associated with decreased dementia risk compared to alcohol abstention. However, not all studies drew the same conclusion and there is no consensus regarding decreased dementia risk related to light to moderate alcohol consumption. The methodological limitations of these studies also need to be considered. For example, definition of alcohol consumption varies with studies. Some studies defined no drinking as never consuming alcohol, while other studies defined it as currently not consuming alcohol. Estimates of dementia risk related to alcohol consumption should be significantly altered by these definitions. Therefore, based on the current evidence, alcohol should not be used as a means to decrease the risk of developing dementia. This article also describes the pathophysiology of alcohol-related dementia, the relationship between Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome and alcohol-related dementia, clinical characteristics, and the prevalence of alcohol-related dementia. Finally, we document a couple of articles examining the relationship between mortality and alcohol consumption in patients with mild Alzheimer's disease and the impact of alcohol abstention on cognitive decline in patients with Alzheimer's disease.
27395465	[Prevention of Alzheimer's Disease and Nutrients].	The dietary recommendations for the prevention and management of Alzheimer's disease (AD), are the Mediterranean diet and the Japanese-style diet, both of which contain well-balanced nutrients from fish and vegetables. These diets are rich in vitamin E, carotenes, antioxidant flavonoids, vitamin B12, folate, and n-3PUFA. According to recent review supplementation of folate and vitamin E may protect against elderly people's cognitive decline when the serum folate is <12 nmol/L or the vitamin E intake is <6.1 mg/day. Another nutritional topic with regard to dementia and diet is the association of type-2 diabetes and hyperinsulinemia with AD. Expression array data of the brain tissue of AD patients in the Hisayama study strongly suggests a disturbance in insulin signaling in the AD brain. The dysfunction of insulin signaling could directly lead to disrupted glucose utilization in the AD brain. Instead of improperly utilized glucose, the medium chain triglyceride ketone bodies can be an alternative energy resource for the AD brain. In conclusion, the dietary recommendations for the prevention and management of AD are a high consumption of fish, vegetables, and low glycemic index fruits; a moderate amount of meat and dairy products; and a lower amount of carbohydrates and refined sugar.
27395462	[Sleep Problem as a Prodrome and Risk Factor for Dementia].	Dementia, including Alzheimer's disease, is often associated with various sleep disorders such as insomnia, hypersomnia, circadian rhythm sleep disorders, sleep-disordered breathing and sleep debt due to organic damages of sleep/wake-promoting nucleus and circadian center (suprachiasmatic nucleus). These sleep disorders reduce the quality of life of individuals with dementia, and increase the care burden, which are major social issues. Recent studies have revealed that sleep deterioration is not only a comorbid symptom but also a prodrome and a risk factor for the development of dementia.
27395458	[Dyslipidemia and Dementia].	Several lines of evidences support a possible involvement of serum cholesterol in the development of dementia/Alzheimer's disease (AD), with hypercholesterolemia as one of the risk factors that can be targeted by therapeutic interventions. It has also been suggested that statins, prescribed as lipid-lowering drugs to patients at risk for cardiovascular conditions, may be useful in both the prevention and treatment of AD. Currently, conflicting evidences from epidemiological studies indicate a controversial association between dyslipidemia and dementia/AD risk. In randomized clinical trials, virtually no beneficial effect of statin therapy has been observed. On the other hand, in vitro and in vivo animal experiments have revealed that statins suppress amyloid beta protein (Abeta) generation. All these findings suggest that statins can be potentially used as preventive or therapeutic agents for AD. In addition, currently the pathophysiological process of AD is thought to begin many years before the diagnosis of AD dementia. Then, statin treatment as well as some disease-modifying therapies may be more efficacious at an early stage of AD including preclinical AD or mild cognitive impairment due to AD.
27395456	[Epidemiology of Diabetes and Risk of Dementia].	The association between diabetes and the risk of developing dementia has received much attention in epidemiological studies. An accurate population-based prospective cohort study has been conducted in the elderly population of the town of Hisayama in Japan since 1985 aiming to elucidate the secular trends in the prevalence of dementia and examine risk and protective factors for dementia in the Japanese population. The prevalence of all-cause dementia significantly increased from 1985 to 2012. In regard to subtypes of dementia, a similar trend was observed for Alzheimer's disease (AD). In a prospective study of risk factors for dementia in Hisayama elder residents without dementia, diabetes was identified as a significant risk factor for developing all-cause dementia, especially AD. Moreover, 2-hour post-load glucose levels were closely associated with increased risk of all-cause dementia, AD, and vascular dementia. In a pathological study of Hisayama residents, higher levels of 2-hour post-load glucose, fasting insulin, and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) were significantly associated with increased risk of neuritic plaques. The steep increase in the frequency of diabetes could lead to the increasing trend in the prevalence of dementia, especially AD, in the Japanese elderly.
27395454	[Multifunctional Roles of APOE in Alzheimer's Disease Pathogenesis].	Numerous epidemiological studies have shown that the apolipoprotein E gene (APOE) is a strong genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD) among people from various ethnic backgrounds. ApoE occurs as three isoforms that differ at two amino acids residues (112 and 158): ApoE epsilon2, epsilon3, and epsilon4. The epsilon4 allele is responsible for a genetic predisposition to AD, increasing the risk of AD by approximately 4-fold compared to the common epsilon3 allele. In contrast, the epsilon2 allele shows a protective effect against AD. APOE epsilon4 is known to affect the age at onset of AD in a dose-dependent manner. In addition to the role of genetic risk, increasing evidence suggests that the substantial effects of APOE genotypes on cognitive function, imaging and biomarker findings, have been reported in cognitively normal individuals in an age-dependent manner. A high frequency of amyloid deposition among cognitively normal, aged individuals carrying the APOE epsilon4 allele has been demonstrated. This suggests that APOE epsilon4 facilitates amyloid deposition during the very early phase of AD pathogenesis. Preventive intervention by using disease-modifying drugs is now being investigated through an exploratory clinical trial for the cognitively normal, aged individuals with the APOE epsilon4 allele.
27394443	Neuroprotective Effect of Osthole on Neuron Synapses in an Alzheimer's Disease Cell Model via Upregulation of MicroRNA-9.	Accumulation of beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) in the brain plays an important role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). It has been reported that osthole exerts its neuroprotective effect on neuronal synapses, but its exact mechanism is obscure. Recently, microRNAs have been demonstrated to play a crucial role in inducing synaptotoxicity by Abeta, implying that targeting microRNAs could be a therapeutic approach of AD. In the present study, we investigated the neuroprotective effects of osthole on a cell model of AD by transducing APP695 Swedish mutant (APP695swe, APP) into mouse cortical neurons and human SH-SY5Y cells. In this study, the cell counting kit CCK-8, apoptosis assay, immunofluorescence analysis, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, and Western blot assay were used. We found that osthole could enhance cell viability, prevent cell death, and reverse the reduction of synaptic proteins (synapsin-1, synaptophysin, and postsynaptic density-95) in APP-overexpressed cells, which was attributed to increases in microRNA-9 (miR-9) expression and subsequent decreases in CAMKK2 and p-AMPKalpha expressions. These results demonstrated that osthole plays a neuroprotective activity role in part through upregulating miR-9 in AD.
27394151	Category learning in Alzheimer's disease and normal cognitive aging depends on initial experience of feature variability.	Semantic category learning is dependent upon several factors, including the nature of the learning task, as well as individual differences in the quality and heterogeneity of exemplars that an individual encounters during learning. We trained healthy older adults (n=39) and individuals with a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease or Mild Cognitive Impairment (n=44) to recognize instances of a fictitious animal, a "crutter". Each stimulus item contained 10 visual features (e.g., color, tail shape) which took one of two values for each feature (e.g., yellow/red, curly/straight tails). Participants were presented with a series of items (learning phase) and were either told the items belonged to a semantic category (explicit condition) or were told to think about the appearance of the items (implicit condition). Half of participants saw learning items with higher similarity to an unseen prototype (high typicality learning set), and thus lower between-item variability in their constituent features; the other half learned from items with lower typicality (low typicality learning set) and higher between-item feature variability. After the learning phase, participants were presented with test items one at a time that varied in the number of typical features from 0 (antitype) to 10 (prototype). We examined between-subjects factors of learning set (lower or higher typicality), instruction type (explicit or implicit), and group (patients vs. elderly control). Learning in controls was aided by higher learning set typicality: while controls in both learning set groups demonstrated significant learning, those exposed to a high-typicality learning set appeared to develop a prototype that helped guide their category membership judgments. Overall, patients demonstrated more difficulty with category learning than elderly controls. Patients exposed to the higher-typicality learning set were sensitive to the typical features of the category and discriminated between the most and least typical test items, although less reliably than controls. In contrast, patients exposed to the low-typicality learning set showed no evidence of learning. Analysis of structural imaging data indicated a positive association between left hippocampal grey matter density in elderly controls but a negative association in the patient group, suggesting differential reliance on hippocampal-mediated learning. Contrary to hypotheses, learning did not differ between explicit and implicit conditions for either group. Results demonstrate that category learning is improved when learning materials are highly similar to the prototype.
27393798	Extraction of sulcal medial surface and classification of Alzheimer's disease using sulcal features.	BACKGROUND: Recent advancements in medical imaging have resulted in a significant growth in diagnostic possibilities of neurodegenerative disorders. Neuroanatomical abnormalities of the cerebral cortex in Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most frequent type of dementia in the elderly, can be observed in morphology analysis of cortical sulci, and used to distinguish between cognitively normal (CN) subjects and subjects with AD. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this paper was to extract sulcal features by means of computing a sulcal medial surface for AD/CN classification. METHODS: 24 distinct sulci per subject were extracted from 210 subjects from the ADNI database by the BrainVISA sulcal identification pipeline. Sulcal medial surface features (depth, length, mean and Gaussian curvature, surface area) were computed for AD/CN classification with a support vector machine (SVM). RESULTS: The obtained 10-fold cross-validated classification accuracy was 87.9%, sensitivity 90.0%, and specificity 86.7%, based on ten features. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was 0.89. CONCLUSIONS: The sulcal medial surface features can be used as biomarkers for cortical neuroanatomical abnormalities in AD. All the features were located in the left hemisphere, which had previously been reported to be more severely affected in AD and to lose grey matter faster than the right hemisphere.
27392529	Novel series of tacrine-tianeptine hybrids: Synthesis, cholinesterase inhibitory activity, S100B secretion and a molecular modeling approach.	Tianeptine was linked to various 9-aminoalkylamino-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroacridines using EDC.HCl/HOBt to afford a series of tacrine-tianeptine hybrids. The hybrids were tested for their ability to inhibit AChE and BuChE and IC50 values in the nanomolar concentration scale were obtained. AChE molecular modeling studies of these hybrids indicated that tacrine moiety interacts in the bottom of the gorge with the catalytic active site (CAS) while tianeptine binds to peripheral anionic site (PAS). Furthermore, the compounds 2g and 2e were able to reduce the in vitro basal secretion of S100B, suggesting its therapeutic action in some cases or stages of Alzheimer's disease.
27392055	[What is the place of a geriatric follow-up ambulatory care unit in the structures developed by the 2008/2012 Alzheimer Plan?].	UNLABELLED: The French 2008/2012 Alzheimer Plan is designed to improve the support given to elderly patients and their families. Objective: To describe the typology of the patients managed in a Geriatric multidimensional rehabilitation ambulatory care unit between 2008 and 2012. METHODS: Programme de medicalisation des systemes d'information database concerning the number of concomitant diseases and several specific indicators. RESULTS: The number of patients increased between 2008 (109) and 2009 (293) but then remained stable (about 300). The differences between 2008 and subsequent years were statically significant for the number of concomitant diseases (p < 0.001) and the number of days/patients (p < 0.01), but not for 2009-2012. CONCLUSION: The variations seem to be related to implementation of the Alzheimer Plan and a change in the organization of French gerontology health networks.
27389080	Cerebral microbleeds in early Alzheimer's disease.	We hypothesize that cerebral microbleeds (CMB) in patients with different neuropsychological profiles (amnestic or non-amnestic) and MRI features of vascular damage could provide important information on the underlying pathological process in early Alzheimer's disease. The study was performed at two trial sites. We studied 136 outpatients with cognitive decline. MRI was performed using a magnetic field of 1.5 and 3 T. Neuropsychological assessment included Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Montreal Cognitive Assessment scale (MoCA), Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination (ACE-R), Cambridge Cognitive Examination battery (CAMCOG) (Part 3), Clock Drawing Test, fluency test and the visual memory test (SCT). CSF was examined for standard parameters such as tau, phosphorylated tau, amyloid-beta 1-40 and 42 and Qalbumin, in accordance with established protocols and genotype. In 61 patients (45 %), at least 1 CMB was found. Most of the CMBs were described in the amnestic profile (67 %). In 86 % of the cases, multiple CMB were observed. The ratio of Abeta1-40/42 in non-amnestic patients with CMB was significantly lower (mean 0.6) than in patients without CMB (mean 1.2). A notable difference in the albumin ratio as an indicator of the BBB was observed between groups with and without CMB. In the CMP-positive group, the E2 genotype was observed more frequently, and the E4 genotype less frequently, than in the CMB-negative group. Based on the cerebrospinal fluid-serum albumin ratio, we were able to show that patients with CMB present several features of BBB dysfunction. According to logistic regression, the predictive factors for CMB in patients with cognitive decline were age, WMHs score and albumin ratio. We found a significant reduction in the Abeta-amyloid ratio in the non-amnestic profile group with CMB (particularly in the cortical region) in comparison to those without CMB. While this is an interesting finding, its significance needs to be assessed in a prospective follow-up.
27384289	Synthesis and pharmacological evaluation of donepezil-based agents as new cholinesterase/monoamine oxidase inhibitors for the potential application against Alzheimer's disease.	In a continuing effort to develop multitargeted compounds as potential treatment agents against Alzheimer's disease (AD), a series of donepezil-like compounds were designed, synthesized and evaluated. In vitro studies showed that most of the designed compounds displayed potent inhibitory activities toward AChE, BuChE, MAO-B and MAO-A. Among them, w18 was a promising agent with balanced activities, which exhibited a moderate cholinesterase inhibition (IC50, 0.220 muM for eeAChE; 1.23 muM for eqBuChE; 0.454 muM for hAChE) and an acceptable inhibitory activity against monoamine oxidases (IC50, 3.14 muM for MAO-B; 13.4 muM for MAO-A). Moreover, w18 could also be a metal-chelator, and able to cross the blood-brain barrier with low cell toxicity on PC12 cells. Taken together, these results suggested that w18 might be a promising multitargeted compound for AD treatment.
27383874	A Prospectus of Tenomodulin.	Tenomodulin is a type II transmembrane glycoprotein that can regulate growth of tendon. The human tenomodulin encoding gene is mapped to capital HA, Cyrillic chromosome and encodes a polypeptide consisting of 317 alpha amino acids. The protein is located on the cell surface as N-glycosylated or non-N-glycosylated polypeptide with molecular mass of 45 and 40 kDa, respectively. The molecule consists of three domains and a short cytoplasmic tail at N-terminus. Tenomodulin is predominantly expressed in dense connective hypovascularized tissues such as tendons, skeletal muscle epimysium, and ligaments. Furthermore, tenomodulin is an efficient marker of tenocyte differentiation and plays an important role in the regulation of tenocyte proliferation, tendon development, and angiogenesis inhibition. A number of tenomodulin gene polymorphisms have been recently associated with a risk of obesity, diabetes, systemic immune mediators, cholesterol levels, Alzheimer disease, and age-related macular degeneration. Tenomodulin is involved in cell adhesion, determination of cell morphology, cell aging and bone mineral density. It is expected to play an important role in tendon recovery, tendon tissue engineering, anti-tumor therapy, treatment of chordal disruption, and remodeling of extracellular matrix.
27382914	Diagnosing young onset dementia can be challenging.	Although the risk of developing dementia increases with age, onset can be as early as the third or fourth decade of life. Genetic influences play a more important role in younger than in older people with dementia, so young onset dementia may cluster in families. Diagnosing young onset dementia is challenging. The range of possible presenting features is broad, encompassing behavioural, cognitive, psychiatric and neurological domains, and symptoms are often subtle initially. Frequently the complaints are misattributed to stress or depression, and the patient is falsely reassured that they are too young to have dementia. The most common causes of young onset dementia are early onset forms of adult neurodegenerative conditions and alcohol. Vascular dementia is the second most common cause of young onset dementia after Alzheimer's disease. Conventional vascular risk factors may be absent and diagnosis relies on imaging evidence of cerebrovascular disease. Obtaining a detailed history remains the most important part of the workup and usually requires corroboration by a third party. Undertaking a basic neurological examination is also important. Those with suspected young onset dementia should be referred to a neurology-led cognitive disorders clinic where available as the differenti diagnosis is considerably broader tha in older adults and requires specialist investigation.
27381850	An overview of circulating cell-free microRNAs as putative biomarkers in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's Diseases.	Circulating cell-free microRNAs (miRNAs) are stable in many biological fluids and their expression profiles can suffer changes under different physiological and pathological conditions. In the last few years, miRNAs have been proposed as putative noninvasive biomarkers in diagnosis, prognosis and response to treatment for several diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). Cognitive and/or motor impairments are usually considered for establishing clinical diagnosis, and at this stage, the majority of the neurons may already be lost making difficult attempts of novel therapies. In this review, we intend to survey the circulating cell-free miRNAs found as dysregulated in cerebrospinal fluid, serum and plasma samples in AD and PD patients, and show how those miRNAs can be useful for early and differential diagnosis. Beyond that, we highlighted the miRNAs that are possibly related to common molecular mechanisms in the neurodegeneration process, as well those miRNAs related to specific disease pathways.
27380342	Effect of Deutetrabenazine on Chorea Among Patients With Huntington Disease: A Randomized Clinical Trial.	IMPORTANCE: Deutetrabenazine is a novel molecule containing deuterium, which attenuates CYP2D6 metabolism and increases active metabolite half-lives and may therefore lead to stable systemic exposure while preserving key pharmacological activity. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate efficacy and safety of deutetrabenazine treatment to control chorea associated with Huntington disease. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Ninety ambulatory adults diagnosed with manifest Huntington disease and a baseline total maximal chorea score of 8 or higher (range, 0-28; lower score indicates less chorea) were enrolled from August 2013 to August 2014 and randomized to receive deutetrabenazine (n = 45) or placebo (n = 45) in a double-blind fashion at 34 Huntington Study Group sites. INTERVENTIONS: Deutetrabenazine or placebo was titrated to optimal dose level over 8 weeks and maintained for 4 weeks, followed by a 1-week washout. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Primary end point was the total maximal chorea score change from baseline (the average of values from the screening and day-0 visits) to maintenance therapy (the average of values from the week 9 and 12 visits) obtained by in-person visits. This study was designed to detect a 2.7-unit treatment difference in scores. The secondary end points, assessed hierarchically, were the proportion of patients who achieved treatment success on the Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) and on the Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGIC), the change in 36-Item Short Form- physical functioning subscale score (SF-36), and the change in the Berg Balance Test. RESULTS: Ninety patients with Huntington disease (mean age, 53.7 years; 40 women [44.4%]) were enrolled. In the deutetrabenazine group, the mean total maximal chorea scores improved from 12.1 (95% CI, 11.2-12.9) to 7.7 (95% CI, 6.5-8.9), whereas in the placebo group, scores improved from 13.2 (95% CI, 12.2-14.3) to 11.3 (95% CI, 10.0-12.5); the mean between-group difference was -2.5 units (95% CI, -3.7 to -1.3) (P < .001). Treatment success, as measured by the PGIC, occurred in 23 patients (51%) in the deutetrabenazine group vs 9 (20%) in the placebo group (P = .002). As measured by the CGIC, treatment success occurred in 19 patients (42%) in the deutetrabenazine group vs 6 (13%) in the placebo group (P = .002). In the deutetrabenazine group, the mean SF-36 physical functioning subscale scores decreased from 47.5 (95% CI, 44.3-50.8) to 47.4 (44.3-50.5), whereas in the placebo group, scores decreased from 43.2 (95% CI, 40.2-46.3) to 39.9 (95% CI, 36.2-43.6), for a treatment benefit of 4.3 (95% CI, 0.4 to 8.3) (P = .03). There was no difference between groups (mean difference of 1.0 unit; 95% CI, -0.3 to 2.3; P = .14), for improvement in the Berg Balance Test, which improved by 2.2 units (95% CI, 1.3-3.1) in the deutetrabenazine group and by 1.3 units (95% CI, 0.4-2.2) in the placebo group. Adverse event rates were similar for deutetrabenazine and placebo, including depression, anxiety, and akathisia. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among patients with chorea associated with Huntington disease, the use of deutetrabenazine compared with placebo resulted in improved motor signs at 12 weeks. Further research is needed to assess the clinical importance of the effect size and to determine longer-term efficacy and safety. TRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT01795859.
27379655	Circulating insulin-like growth factor 1 and insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3 level in Alzheimer's disease: a meta-analysis.	It has been reported that the associations between circulating insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) are controversial. Thus, present meta-analysis was carried out to confirm the probable associations. We searched "PubMed", "Springer" and "Medline" databases using the term ("insulin-like growth factor-1" or "IGF-1" or "insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3" or "IGFBP-3") and ("Alzheimer's disease") until April 2016. Furthermore, standard mean differences (SMDs) were calculated. A total of seven reports involving 1342 percipients were pooled. SMDs were -0.25 (P = 0.22) and -0.33 (P = 0.08) for IGF-1 and IGFBP-3, respectively. Furthermore, the circulating IGF-1 levels in AD patients were lower than controls when studies with the difference of mean age </=1 year (SMD -0.57, P = 0.007) or 2 years (SMD -0.58, P = 0.02) or difference of mean MMSE scores </=10 scores (SMD -0.94, P < 0.00001), or studies from Europe (SMD -0.89, P < 0.00001) were excluded. In addition, the circulating IGFBP-3 levels in AD patients were lower than controls when studies with the difference of mean age </=2 years (SMD -0.62, P = 0.006) or difference of mean MMSE scores </=6 scores (SMD -0.48, P = 0.0004), 7 scores (SMD -0.58, P = 0.02), or 8 scores (SMD -0.80, P = 0.03) were excluded. Even though no significant difference of circulating IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 levels in AD patients comparing with controls was found in present meta-analysis, the current study provided the evidence that the circulating IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 level in AD patients were influenced by the difference of mean age as well as MMSE scores. Furthermore, circulating IGFBP-3 levels in AD patients may be decreased earlier than IGF-1.
27379355	Atypical presentation of infective endocarditis.	The HACEK group of organisms are one of the infrequent causes of infective endocarditis. Infective endocarditis should be recognized and treated promptly to prevent excessive morbidity and mortality associated with the disease. Sometimes the diagnosis is delayed due to vague and subtle presentation. Through this case report, risk factors of Cardiobacterium hominis endocarditis and its atypical presentation is illustrated to increase the recognition of infective endocarditis as one of the differential diagnosis.

27378745	MTHFR (C677T) CT genotype and CT-apoE3/3 genotypic combination predisposes the risk of ischemic stroke.	The predisposition to ischemic stroke (IS) might involve interactions of several genes and environmental factors. The present study was aimed to evaluate the influence of polymorphisms in methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR-C677T) and apolipoprotein-E (apo-E) as risk factors for IS patients in south Indian population. 200 IS patients and 193 age and sex matched controls were genotyped for MTHFR-C677T and apoE by Polymerase Chain Reaction-Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method. Statistically significant association was observed for MTHFR CT genotype (IS-Pooled: OR=4.29; p=5.01x10(-5); IS-Males: OR=4.13; p=0.001; IS-Females: OR=8.62; p=0.027; IS-Large Vessel Disease (LVD)- Pooled: OR=4.14; p=0.0002) and T allele (IS-Pooled: OR=4.82; p=1.49x10(-5); IS-Males: OR=4.33; p=0.0002; IS-Females: OR=7.99; p=0.031; IS-LVD-Pooled: OR=4.13; p=0.0001). Further, reduced frequencies of CC genotype (IS-Pooled: OR=0.20; p=9.80x10(-6); IS-Males: OR=0.25; p=0.001; IS-Females: OR=0.12; p=0.027; IS-LVD-Pooled: OR=0.23; p=0.0001) and C allele (IS-Pooled: OR=0.21; p=1.49x10(-5); IS-Males: OR=0.23; p=0.0002; IS-Females: OR=0.13; p=0.031; IS-LVD-Pooled: OR=0.24; p=0.0001) were observed in IS patients than the controls. No association was observed for apoE genotypes/alleles in IS/LVD cases. Our study demonstrated the presence of risk for MTHFR CT genotype/T allele and 'CT-3/3' (n=33 vs. 5; OR=7.42; p=0.001) genotypic combination in the development of IS in south India. Further, follow-up study of these stroke cases i.e., in later stages of the disease whether they are developing the neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and vascular dementia (VaD) is needed to draw a fruitful conclusion in connection between neurological disorders and with these two polymorphisms, before translating it into clinical practice.
27378307	Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase a novel hope on a blood-based diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a multi-factorial neurodegenerative disorder that numerous factors have key properties in the development of this proteopathy. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) is the most common form of enzymopathy. We have examined G6PD enzyme activity levels in the serum of newly diagnosed AD patients compared with control subjects without dementia from the both sexes. Serum G6PD levels were found to be significantly higher (approximately two times) in AD patients compared to control geriatric subjects in both sexes. We have concluded that G6PD seems to play an integral role in the progress and/or prevention of AD.
27376495	Avarol derivatives as competitive AChE inhibitors, non hepatotoxic and neuroprotective agents for Alzheimer's disease.	Avarol is a marine sesquiterpenoid hydroquinone, previously isolated from the marine sponge Dysidea avara Schmidt (Dictyoceratida), with antiinflammatory, antitumor, antioxidant, antiplatelet, anti-HIV, and antipsoriatic effects. Recent findings indicate that some thio-avarol derivatives exhibit acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitory activity. The multiple pharmacological properties of avarol, thio-avarol and/or their derivatives prompted us to continue the in vitro screening, focusing on their AChE inhibitory and neuroprotective effects. Due to the complex nature of Alzheimer's disease (AD), there is a renewed search for new, non hepatotoxic anticholinesterasic compounds. This paper describes the synthesis and in vitro biological evaluation of avarol-3'-thiosalicylate (TAVA) and thiosalycil-prenyl-hydroquinones (TPHs), as non hepatotoxic anticholinesterasic agents, showing a good neuroprotective effect on the decreased viability of SHSY5Y human neuroblastoma cells induced by oligomycin A/rotenone and okadaic acid. A molecular modeling study was also undertaken on the most promising molecules within the series to elucidate their AChE binding modes and in particular the role played by the carboxylate group in enzyme inhibition. Among them, TPH4, bearing a geranylgeraniol substituent, is the most significant Electrophorus electricus AChE (EeAChE) inhibitor (IC50 = 6.77 +/- 0.24 muM), also endowed with a moderate serum horse butyrylcholinesterase (eqBuChE) inhibitory activity, being also the least hepatotoxic and the best neuroprotective compound of the series. Thus, TPHs represents a new family of synthetic compounds, chemically related to the natural compound avarol, which has been discovered for the potential treatment of AD. Findings prove the relevance of TPHs as a new possible generation of competitive AChE inhibitors pointing out the importance of the salycilic substituents on the hydroquinone ring. Since these compounds do not belong to the class of alkaloids, which are notorious for their capability to inhibit AChE while exhibiting side effects, they may constitute novel active AChE inhibitors with fewer side effects.
27376271	Novel NSAID-Derived Drugs for the Potential Treatment of Alzheimer's Disease.	Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been suggested for the potential treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Prolonged use of NSAIDs, however, produces gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity. To overcome this serious limitation, the aim of this study was to develop novel NSAID-derived drug conjugates (Anti-inflammatory-Lipoyl derivatives, AL4-9) that preserve the beneficial effects of NSAIDS without causing GI problems. As such, we conjugated selected well-known NSAIDs, such as (S)-naproxen and (R)-flurbiprofen, with (R)-alpha-lipoic acid (LA) through alkylene diamine linkers. The selection of the antioxidant LA was based on the proposed role of oxidative stress in the development and/or progression of AD. Our exploratory studies revealed that AL7 containing the diaminoethylene linker between (R)-flurbiprofen and LA had the most favorable chemical and in vitro enzymatic stability profiles among the synthesized compounds. Upon pretreatment, this compound exhibited excellent antioxidant activity in phorbol 12-miristate 13-acetate (PMA)-stimulated U937 cells (lymphoblast lung from human) and Abeta(25-35)-treated THP-1 cells (leukemic monocytes). Furthermore, AL7 also modulated the expression of COX-2, IL-1beta and TNF-alpha in these cell lines, suggesting anti-inflammatory activity. Taken together, AL7 has emerged as a potential lead worthy of further characterization and testing in suitable in vivo models of AD.
27374996	The effectiveness of neurofeedback on cognitive functioning in patients with Alzheimer's disease: Preliminary results.	OBJECTIVES: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia. In quantified EEG (qEEG), the AD patients have a greater amount of theta activity compared with normal elderly individuals. Little is known about the effect of neurofeedback in patients with dementia. The objective of this study was to examine whether neurofeedback has a positive effect on cognitive performance in patients with AD. METHODS: Ten patients with qEEG meeting criteria for AD received neurofeedback training. Participants were aged between 61 and 90 years. All patients underwent the CAMCOG test designed to assess cognitive functioning pre- and post-treatment. RESULTS: The individual results, analyzed with a reliable change index (RCI), showed that patients who received neurofeedback treatment had stable cognitive functions. These patients showed improvement in memory after neurofeedback and other cognitive functions were stable. In addition, an improvement was observed in recall of information and recognition. CONCLUSION: Patients with AD who received neurofeedback treatment had stable or improved cognitive performance. Future research should focus on the design of high quality randomized controlled trials to assess whether neurofeedback has a place in the treatment of AD.
27372904	Visinin-Like Protein-3 Modulates the Interaction Between Cytochrome b 5 and NADH-Cytochrome b 5 Reductase in a Ca2+-Dependent Manner.	Visinin-like proteins (VILIPs) belong to the calcium sensor protein family. VILIP-1 has been examined as a cerebrospinal fluid biomarker and as a potential indicator for cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, little is known about VILIP-3 protein biochemistry. We performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments to examine whether VILIP-3 can interact with reduced nicotine adenine dinucleotide (NADH)-cytochrome b 5 reductase. We also evaluated the specificity of cytochrome b 5 within the visinin-like protein subfamily and identified cytochrome P450 isoforms in the brain. In this study, we show that cytochrome b 5 has an affinity for hippocalcin, neurocalcin-delta, and VILIP-3, but not visinin-like protein-1. VILIP-3 was also shown to interact with NADH-cytochrome b 5 reductase in a Ca2+-dependent manner. These results suggest that VILIP-3, hippocalcin, and neurocalcin-delta provide a Ca2+-dependent modulation to the NADH-dependent microsomal electron transport. The results also suggest that future therapeutic strategies that target calcium-signaling pathways and VILIPs may be of value.
27372450	Hearing and dementia.	Hearing deficits associated with cognitive impairment have attracted much recent interest, motivated by emerging evidence that impaired hearing is a risk factor for cognitive decline. However, dementia and hearing impairment present immense challenges in their own right, and their intersection in the auditory brain remains poorly understood and difficult to assess. Here, we outline a clinically oriented, symptom-based approach to the assessment of hearing in dementias, informed by recent progress in the clinical auditory neuroscience of these diseases. We consider the significance and interpretation of hearing loss and symptoms that point to a disorder of auditory cognition in patients with dementia. We identify key auditory characteristics of some important dementias and conclude with a bedside approach to assessing and managing auditory dysfunction in dementia.
27372368	Exploring interest and goals for videoconferencing delivered cognitive rehabilitation with rural individuals with mild cognitive impairment or dementia.	BACKGROUND: Goal oriented cognitive rehabilitation is a promising intervention for individuals diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia due to Alzheimer Disease (AD). Videoconferencing delivered cognitive rehabilitation is a potential avenue for increasing accessibility for rural patients and their families. OBJECTIVE: First, we were concerned with the accessibility of the treatment for individuals in rural and remote areas. Second, client-centered goal setting was explored by asking this sample about their goals for cognitive rehabilitation. METHOD: We mailed questions to all active patients with diagnoses of MCI or dementia due to AD of a rural memory clinic and compare features of the responders versus the non-responders. We asked about interest in videoconferencing delivered treatment and about goals for cognitive rehabilitation, which were thematically analyzed. RESULTS: The responders (N = 25) were similar to non-responders in severity, depression, and caregiver burden. Of the responders, 80% were interested in videoconferencing developed treatment. A thematic analysis coded 95% of responses as amenable to cognitive rehabilitation. Participants' goals were focused on memory, household activities, other cognitive domains, recreation, and higher order tasks. CONCLUSIONS: This work informs the development of both in-person and videoconferencing delivered cognitive rehabilitation for individuals diagnosed with MCI or dementia.
27372210	A sensitive LC-MS/MS method for the quantification of urinary 8-iso-prostaglandin F2alpha (8-iso-PGF2alpha) including pediatric reference interval.	BACKGROUND: Oxidative stress has been implicated in numerous diseases, including arthritis, atherosclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, cancer, diabetes, hypertension, and inflammation. 8-iso-prostaglandin F2alpha, a member of the F2 isoprostane family, has been well-accepted as a valuable biomarker for the assessment of oxidative stress. METHODS: We report the development and validation of an ultra-sensitive LC-MS/MS assay for urinary 8-iso-PGF2alpha measurements in pediatric population. RESULTS: The assay was linear from 0.024 to 20nmol/l (R(2)=0.99). Recoveries were above 85% and matrix effects were below 5%. The variability was determined at nmol/l concentration: the intra-day variability (%CV) ranged from 3.9% to 4.5% (n=20); and the inter-day variability ranged from 4.3% to 5.7% (n=20). The accuracy of our laboratory developed test was evaluated with a clinical reference laboratory (n=39), and a correlation coefficient of 0.9257 was observed. Reference interval were established to be <0.5ng/mg creatinine in a group of pediatric population (2months-18years, n=123). CONCLUSIONS: The precision of the assay will allow for accurate assessment of oxidative stress, and is acceptable for patient testing, particularly in pediatric population.
27370940	The role of the Wnt canonical signaling in neurodegenerative diseases.	The Wnt/beta-catenin or Wnt canonical pathway controls multiple biological processes throughout development and adult life. Growing evidences have suggested that deregulation of the Wnt canonical pathway could be involved in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. The Wnt canonical signaling is a pathway tightly regulated, which activation results in the inhibition of the Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3beta (GSK-3beta) function and in increased beta-catenin activity, that migrates into the nucleus, activating the transcription of the Wnt target genes. Conversely, when the Wnt canonical pathway is turned off, increased levels of GSK-3beta promote beta-catenin degradation. Hence, GSK-3beta could be considered as a key regulator of the Wnt canonical pathway. Of note, GSK-3beta has also been involved in the modulation of inflammation and apoptosis, determining the delicate balance between immune tolerance/inflammation and neuronal survival/neurodegeneration. In this review, we have summarized the current acknowledgements about the role of the Wnt canonical pathway in the pathogenesis of some neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease, cerebral ischemia, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, multiple sclerosis and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, with particular regard to the main in vitro and in vivo studies in this field, by reviewing 85 research articles about.
27370938	Neurochemical correlation between major depressive disorder and neurodegenerative diseases.	Major depressive disorder (MDD) is one of the most prevalent and life-threatening forms of mental illnesses affecting elderly people and has been associated with poor cognitive function. Recent evidence suggests a strong relationship between MDD and neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD), Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), as well as natural processes of aging. Changes in the neuroplasticity, morphology, and neurotransmission in the brain are seem to be associated to both, MDD and neurodegenerative diseases. In addition, there is evidence that psychological stress and MDD are associated with molecular and cellular signs of accelerated aging. This review will highlight the relationship between MDD, the aging process, and neurodegenerative diseases, emphasizing the neurochemical processes involved.
27370065	[Hoarding Behaviour in Three Different Types of Dementia Cases].	INTRODUCTION: Hoarding behaviour, which is generally defined as collecting and keeping unnecessary, cheap objects or things that can not be used, is more common in elderly than young people. The prevelance of hoarding behaviour in dementia was reported as 22%. In this paper, three different types of dementia cases are presented in order to emphasize the clinical awareness for hoarding disorder, which is common in the elderly, especially those with dementia. CASES: The first case is a patient with a diagnosis of frontotemporal dementia who was collecting old things before the appearance of bahavioural changes like verbal and physical agitation. The second one is a patient who was admitted with complaints of forgetting, diagnosed as having Alzheimer's Disease and presented with paper hoarding behavior in his clinical follow-up. The last patient was presented with visual hallucinations, forgetting, collecting old things and depressive symptoms. He received a diagnosis of Lewy body dementia. DISCUSSION: It is prominent that all three different dementia cases hoarding behavior at early stages of dementia. It should be kept in mind that hoarding behavior which begins at late life might be a sign of dementia or it might appear in the dementia process.
27369684	[Validity and Reliability Studies of Modified Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE-E) For Turkish Illiterate Patients With Diagnosis of Alzheimer Disease].	OBJECTIVE: To investigate the validity and reliability of modified Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE-E) for illiterate patients in a Turkish population with Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHOD: A total of 107 illiterate patients with Alzheimer's Disease (women: 65, men: 42) and 68 illiterate healthy volunteer subjects (women: 36, men: 32) were included in the study. MMSE-I and Geriatrics Depression Scale were performed on all subjects, Alzheimer patients were also administered Basic Activities of Daily Living (B- ADL). Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) was used to determine the severity of disease, while a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed to analyze the cut-off scores of MMSE-I, and the positive/negative predictive values that were calculated for the optimal cut-off scores. Internal consistency was measured using Cronbach's coef fi cient . Additionally, correlations between total MMSE-I score and the CDR, B-ADL, and GDS scores were examined. RESULTS: The MMSE-I scores signi fi cantly and inversely correlated with CDR (-0.82, p=0.000) and B-ADL scores (-0.051, p=0.000). The optimal cut-off points of MMSE-I were 23/24, which yielded a sensitivity of 99.0% - %100.0, a specificity of 98.5% - 97.0%, and an AUC of 1.0/1.0, respectively. Reliability of the MMSE-I was high alpha = 0.70). CONCLUSION: The total MMSE-I score was able to differentiate the AD group from the control group.
27368096	Sorting Out Presenilins in Alzheimer's Disease.	Mutations in the presenilins that cause familial Alzheimer's disease alter the activity of these proteases to increase generation of an aggregation-prone isoform of the amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta). How these mutations do so has been unclear. Sannerud et al. now show that regulation of subcellular localization plays a central role, advancing our understanding of the cell biology of Alzheimer's disease.
27367978	Demographic and clinical characteristics related to cognitive decline in Alzheimer disease in China: A multicenter survey from 2011 to 2014.	Alzheimer disease (AD) is the most frequent cause of dementia. AD diagnosis, progression, and treatment have not been analyzed nationwide in China. The primary aim of this study was to analyze demographic and clinical characteristics related to cognitive decline in AD patients treated at outpatient clinics in China.We performed a retrospective study of 1993 AD patients at 10 cognitive centers across 8 cities in China from March 2011 to October 2014. Of these, 891 patients were followed for more than 1 year.The mean age at diagnosis was 72.0 +/- 10.0 years (range 38-96 years), and the mean age at onset of AD was 69.8 +/- 9.5 years. Most patients (65.1%) had moderate to severe symptoms at the time of diagnosis, and mean Mini-Mental State Examination at diagnosis was 15.7 +/- 7.7. AD patients showed significant cognitive decline at 12 months after diagnosis. Having more than 9 years of formal education was an independent risk factor related to rapid cognitive decline [odds ratio (OR) = 1.80; 95% confidence interval (95% CI): 1.11-2.91]. Early-onset AD patients experienced more rapid cognitive decline than late-onset patients (OR = 1.83; 95% CI: 1.09-3.06).Most AD patients in China had moderate to severe symptoms at the time of diagnosis and experienced significant cognitive decline within 1 year. Rapid cognitive decline in AD was related to having a higher educational level and younger age of onset.
27365216	Clusterin expression is upregulated following acute head injury and localizes to astrocytes in old head injury.	There is mounting evidence linking traumatic brain injury (TBI) to neurodegeneration. Clusterin (apolipoprotein J or ApoJ) is a complement inhibitor that appears to have a neuroprotective effect in response to tissue damage and has been reported to be upregulated in Alzheimer's disease. Here we investigated the time course and cellular expression pattern of clusterin in human TBI. Tissue from 32 patients with TBI of varying survival times (from under 30 min to 10 months) was examined using immunohistochemistry for clusterin alongside other markers of neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation. TBI cases were compared to ischemic brain damage, Alzheimer's disease and controls. Double immunofluorescence was carried out in order to examine cellular expression. Clusterin was initially expressed in an axonal location less than 30 min following TBI and increased in intensity and the frequency of deposits with increasing survival time up to 24 h, after which it appeared to reduce in intensity but was still evident several weeks after injury. Clusterin was first evident in astrocytes after 45 min, being increasingly seen up to 48 h but remaining intense in TBI cases with long survival times. Our results suggest clusterin plays a role in modulating the inflammatory response of acute and chronic TBI and that it is a useful marker for TBI, particularly in cases with short survival times. Its prominent accumulation in astrocytes, alongside a mounting inflammatory response and activation of microglial cells supports a potential role in the neurodegenerative changes that occur as a result of TBI.
27364791	Characteristics of Agraphia in Chinese Patients with Alzheimer's Disease and Amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment.	BACKGROUND: Patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) manifest progressive decline in writing abilities. Most studies on agraphia in AD have been performed in the alphabetic system, such as English. However, these findings may not be applicable to other written language systems. The unique features of the Chinese written script could affect the patterns of agraphia in Chinese AD patients. The aim of this study was to explore the features of writing errors in Chinese patients with AD and amnestic mild cognitive impairment (a-MCI), as well as to study the relationship between their writing errors and neuropsychological functions. METHODS: In this study, we performed an observational study in a group of subjects including 17 AD patients, 14 patients with a-MCI, and 16 elderly healthy controls. We analyzed the writing errors in these subjects and also studied the relationship between their writing errors and neuropsychological functions. RESULTS: Our study showed that in patients whose mother tongue is Chinese, writing ability was comparatively well preserved in the MCI phase but significantly impaired when the disease progressed to the stage of AD. The writing errors showed corresponding increase with the severity of cognition decline, both in the types of errors and rate of occurrence. Analysis of the writing errors showed that word substitution and unintelligible words were the most frequent error types that occurred in all the three study groups. The occurrence rate of unintelligible words was significantly higher in the AD group compared with the a-MCI group (P = 0.024) and control group (P = 0.018). In addition, the occurrence rates of word substitution were also significantly higher in AD (P = 0.013) and a-MCI groups (P = 0.037) than that of control group. However, errors such as totally no response, visuospatial impairment, paragraph agraphia, ideograph, and perseverative writing errors were only seen in AD group. Besides, we also found a high occurrence rate of visuoconstructional errors (13.3%) in our AD group. CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirmed that agraphia is an important feature in patients with AD. The writing error profile in patients whose native language is Chinese was unique compared to patients using the alphabetic language system.
27363265	[Total flavones derived from Lagotis brevituba maxim reduce the levels of inflammatory cytokines in cerebral cortex and hippocampus of Alzheimer's disease mice].	Objective To investigate the mechanism behind the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD) with total flavones derived from Lagotis brevituba maxim (TF-LBM). Methods Fifty SAMP8 mice (aged 8 months) were randomly divided into 5 groups, (150, 300, 600) mg/kg TF-LBM groups, 0.65 g/kg donepezil HCl group and AD model group; 10 SAMR1 mice (aged 8 months) were used as a control group of normal aging. The AD model group and the normal aging control group were given the same volume of distilled water as TF-LBM groups. Eight weeks after intragastric administration, Morris water maze experiment was conducted to calculate the latency of place navigation. After the behavioral experiment, the brain cortical tissue and hippocampus (CA1 region) of the mice from various groups were taken to observe the morphological changes of the cortical tissue and hippocampus and test IL-1beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha content. Results Compared with the model group, the escape latency of the normal aging group, the high-dose TF-LBM group and the donepezil HCl group were evidently shortened; compared with the normal aging group, IL-1beta, IL-6, TNF-alphaof the model group increased significantly; compared with the model group, IL-1beta content of the low-dose TF-LBM group had no obvious difference, while IL-1beta content of the median-dose and high-dose TF-LBM groups and the donepezil HCl group decreased significantly; IL-6 content decreased in all TF-LBM groups and the donepezil HCl group; TNF-alpha level in the low-dose and median-dose TF-LBM groups had no evident difference, while it was reduced significantly in the high-dose TF-LBM group and the donepezil HCl group. Compared with the normal aging group, IL-1beta, IL-6 and TNF-alpha content of the model group increased significantly; compared with the model group, IL-1beta, IL-6 and TNF-alpha content of all TF-LBM groups and the donepezil HCl group decreased. Conclusion TF-LBM can improve the behavior change of SAMP8 mice with AD. TF-LBM can reduce the content of IL-6, IL-1beta and TNF-alpha in cerebral cortex and hippocampus CA1.
27357856	Vitamin D deficiency might pose a greater risk for ApoEvarepsilon4 non-carrier Alzheimer's disease patients.	Vitamin D is a secosteroid hormone that shares a synthetic pathway with cholesterol. ApoE, which is involved in the transport of cholesterol, is the most significant genetic risk factor for sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD). Surprisingly, recent studies have indicated the presence of an evolutionary juncture between these two molecules. To demonstrate this possible relationship, we investigated serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin-D3 (25OHD) in patients with early onset-AD (EOAD; n:22), late onset-AD (LOAD; n:72), mild cognitive impairment (MCI; n:32) and in healthy subjects (n:70). We then analyzed the correlation between 25OHD and cytokines, BDNF and Hsp90 with respect to ApoE alleles, as these molecules were investigated in our previous studies. The LOAD patients had low levels of 25OHD, but these low levels originated only from ApoEvarepsilon4 non-carrier patients. Negative correlations were observed between serum 25OHD and TNFalpha, IL-1beta or IL-6 levels in healthy subjects or MCI patients, but these same correlations were positive in LOAD patients. ApoE alleles indicated that these positive correlations exist only in varepsilon4 carrier LOAD patients. Consequently, our results indicate that vitamin D deficiency presents a greater risk for ApoEvarepsilon4 non-carrier AD patients than for varepsilon4 carriers. Therefore, it might be beneficial to monitor the vitamin D status of ApoEvarepsilon4 allele non-carrier AD patients.
27356540	Neurotrophins' Modulation by Olive Polyphenols.	BACKGROUND: Polyphenols are probably the most known and investigated molecules of nutritional interest as micronutrients present in abundance in our diet. Some of the most important food sources of polyphenols in the Mediterranean diet are olives and olive oil. A growing body of evidence from animal models to clinical studies indicates that polyphenol compounds may have neuroprotective effects in several pathologies of the nervous system through the control of oxidative stress, inflammation, apoptosis and mitochondrial dysfunction. OBJECTIVE: Based on the most recent scientific literature, dietary intake of polyphenols attenuates oxidative stress and reduces risk for related neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, stroke, multiple sclerosis and Huntington's disease. Also at the peripheral level, they act as antioxidant, defending tissues against oxidative damage and scavenging free radicals. RESULTS: Recent findings in animal models and humans show that polyphenols may have a role in regulating neurotrophins levels, in particular nerve growth factor (NGF) and brainderived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), suggesting that polyphenols may also induce their protective effects through the potentiation of neurotrophins action. NGF and BDNF, primarily known as biological mediators stimulating neuron growth, proliferation, survival and differentiation are recently studied also as metabotrophic factors, acting on glucose and energy metabolism, pancreatic beta cells and cardiovascular homeostasis. CONCLUSION: In this context, a better understanding of the effects of polyphenols on neurotrophins and their receptors (TrkA, TrkB, p75NTR) could certainly generate interest for drug discovery and also for the potential dietary prevention of several neurological and cardiometabolic diseases.
27356191	Theory of Mind (ToM) and language: stimulating metalinguistic skills in people with dementia.	PURPOSE: The purpose of this paper was to assess the use of the Metalinguistic Skills Stimulation Program in Theory of Mind (ToM) in people with dementia. METHODS: An experimental research design was developed. Forty-two subjects, 28 women and 14 men, aged 61 to 87 participated in the study. The three following groups were created: Experimental Group and Control Group - both composed of people with dementia, and Normal Group - consisting of people without dementia or any medical and psychological disorders that keep them from living a normal life. All subjects in the sample were evaluated using the MMSE30 Test and the MetAphAs Test. The stimulation program was used with the Experimental Group in 40-minute sessions held twice a week for five months. After the program, a second evaluation or retest was performed. The data obtained were compared statistically and qualitatively, individually and between the different groups. RESULTS: A clear effect of the treatment was observed: most of the patients improved their average scores in the performance of various tasks and on the MetAphAs Test. Significant differences were observed when comparing the Experimental Group with the Control Group. CONCLUSIONS: The evolution of each patient presents a multifactorial etiology, and it was influenced by different variables related to the patients and their psychosocial environment. The data encourage the development of further research with larger samples in order to achieve more conclusive results.
27354189	A Structural Parametrization of the Brain Using Hidden Markov Models-Based Paths in Alzheimer's Disease.	The usage of biomedical imaging in the diagnosis of dementia is increasingly widespread. A number of works explore the possibilities of computational techniques and algorithms in what is called computed aided diagnosis. Our work presents an automatic parametrization of the brain structure by means of a path generation algorithm based on hidden Markov models (HMMs). The path is traced using information of intensity and spatial orientation in each node, adapting to the structure of the brain. Each path is itself a useful way to characterize the distribution of the tissue inside the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) image by, for example, extracting the intensity levels at each node or generating statistical information of the tissue distribution. Additionally, a further processing consisting of a modification of the grey level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) can be used to characterize the textural changes that occur throughout the path, yielding more meaningful values that could be associated to Alzheimer's disease (AD), as well as providing a significant feature reduction. This methodology achieves moderate performance, up to 80.3% of accuracy using a single path in differential diagnosis involving Alzheimer-affected subjects versus controls belonging to the Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative (ADNI).
27353431	Standardization, Clinical Validation, and Typicality Norms of a New Test Assessing Semantic Verbal Fluency.	OBJECTIVE: Semantic verbal fluency (SVF) tests are widely used in clinical neuropsychology. We propose the standardization and clinical validation of a new SVF test based on the production of names of birds and articles of furniture (Birds and Articles of Furniture test-BAF). METHODS: A sample of 268 subjects aged 40 years or more underwent the test. The clinical validation was conducted on subjects affected by amnesic Mild Cognitive Impairment (aMCI; N = 106), mild (N = 178), and moderate (N = 114) Alzheimer's disease (AD). RESULTS: The BAF total score was influenced by both age and education, whereas the single scores obtained on BAF were also influenced by gender. The percentage of subjects with pathological score on BAF increased from aMCI (19%) to mild (45.5%) and moderate (71.1%) AD, and receiver operating characteristic curves analysis showed that the BAF may be highly reliable in distinguishing aMCI and AD patients from healthy subjects. We also provide typicality norms for birds and articles of furniture that could be useful in the assessment of qualitative features of words produced in semantic fluency tests. CONCLUSIONS: The BAF test could be a valid and reliable tool in both clinical practice and research on subjects affected by cognitive impairment.
27351907	Pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of inositol(s) in health and disease.	INTRODUCTION: Inositol and its derivatives comprise a huge field of biology. Myo-inositol is not only a prominent component of membrane-incorporated phosphatidylinositol, but participates in its free form, with its isomers or its phosphate derivatives, to a multitude of cellular processes, including ion channel permeability, metabolic homeostasis, mRNA export and translation, cytoskeleton remodeling, stress response. AREAS COVERED: Bioavailability, safety, uptake and metabolism of inositol is discussed emphasizing the complexity of interconnected pathways leading to phosphoinositides, inositol phosphates and more complex molecules, like glycosyl-phosphatidylinositols. EXPERT OPINION: Besides being a structural element, myo-inositol exerts unexpected functions, mostly unknown. However, several reports indicate that inositol plays a key role during phenotypic transitions and developmental phases. Furthermore, dysfunctions in the regulation of inositol metabolism have been implicated in several chronic diseases. Clinical trials using inositol in pharmacological doses provide amazing results in the management of gynecological diseases, respiratory stress syndrome, Alzheimer's disease, metabolic syndrome, and cancer, for which conventional treatments are disappointing. However, despite the widespread studies carried out to identify inositol-based effects, no comprehensive understanding of inositol-based mechanisms has been achieved. An integrated metabolomics-genomic study to identify the cellular fate of therapeutically administered myo-inositol and its genomic/enzymatic targets is urgently warranted.
27349146	Challenges for the pharmacological treatment of neurological and psychiatric disorders: Implications of the Ca(2+)/cAMP intracellular signalling interaction.	In 2013, we discovered that the entitled "calcium paradox" phenomenon, which means a paradoxical sympathetic hyperactivity produced by l-type Ca(2+) channel blockers (CCBs), used in antihypertensive therapy, is due to interaction between the intracellular signalling pathways mediated by Ca(2+) and cAMP (Ca(2+)/cAMP interaction). In 2015, we proposed that the pharmacological manipulation of this interaction could be a new therapeutic strategy for increasing neurotransmission in psychiatric disorders, and producing neuroprotection in the neurodegenerative diseases. Besides the paradoxical sympathetic hyperactivity produced by CCBs, several clinical studies have been demonstrating pleiotropic effects of CCBs, including neuroprotective effects. CCBs genuinely exhibit cognitive-enhancing abilities and reduce the risk of dementia, including Alzheimer's, Parkinson s disease and others. The molecular mechanisms involved in these pleiotropic effects remain under debate. Our recent discovery that the "calcium paradox" phenomenon is due to Ca(2+)/cAMP interaction may provide new insights for the pharmacological treatment of neurological and psychiatric disorders, including enhancement of current therapies mainly by reducing adverse effects, and improving effectiveness of modern medicines. Whether Ca(2+)/cAMP interaction is involved in CCBs pleiotropic effects also deserves special attention. Then, the pharmacological manipulation of the Ca(2+)/cAMP interaction could be a more efficient therapeutic strategy for increasing neurotransmission in psychiatric disorders, and producing neuroprotection in the neurodegenerative diseases. Thus, in this review we summarize the current knowledge of this field, making new directions and future perspectives.
27348951	The Impending Oral Health Crisis.	Last May, the New York State Dental Association and the New York State Dental Foundation convened the first "Oral Health Stakeholders' Summit on the Future of Special Needs Dentistry, Hospital Dentistry and Dental Education." The summit was chaired by David J. Miller, then NYSDA President Elect, and Carl H. Tegtmeier, then chair of the NYSDA Council on Dental Health Planning and Hospital Dentistry. It brought together experts, called to frame the issues and provide information necessary for a reasoned response. And it sought input from attendees to develop recommendations to ensure that patients with intellectual and developmental disabilities, as well as an aging population with Alzheimer's disease and dementia, have access to appropriate oral health care in the years ahead. Over 100 participants, representing dentistry, hospital training programs, third-party payers, state government offices and related patient support associations, attended the two-day event in Albany. They focused on the impact of reductions in funding, the transition of Medicaid services into a managed care model, a loss of service providers and the need for expanded training programs. They heard from speakers epresenting a broad spectrum of those involved in he oral health care of patients with intellectual and evelopmental disabilities, the Alzheimer's Association, dental educators and researchers, hospital dentistry and the benefits industry, whose presentations focused on a looming oral health crisis threatening access to dental care for patients with disabilities.
27345998	Generation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from an Alzheimer's disease patient carrying a M146I mutation in PSEN1.	Skin fibroblasts were obtained from a 46-year-old symptomatic man carrying a M146I mutation in the presenilin 1 gene (PSEN1), responsible for causing Alzheimer's disease (AD). Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) were derived via transfection with episomal vectors carrying hOCT4, hSOX2, hKLF2, hL-MYC, hLIN28 and shTP53 genes. M146I-iPSCs were free of genomically integrated reprogramming genes, had the specific mutation but no additional genomic aberrancies, expressed the expected pluripotency markers and displayed in vitro differentiation potential to the three germ layers. The reported M146I-iPSCs line may be a useful resource for in vitro modeling of familial AD.
27345973	Generation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from an Alzheimer's disease patient carrying an A79V mutation in PSEN1.	Skin fibroblasts were obtained from a 48-year-old presymptomatic woman carrying a A79V mutation in the presenilin 1 gene (PSEN1), causing Alzheimer's disease (AD). Induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSCs) were derived via transfection with episomal vectors carrying hOCT4, hSOX2, hKLF2, hL-MYC, hLIN28 and shTP53 genes. A79V-iPSCs were free of genomically integrated reprogramming genes, had the specific mutation but no additional genomic aberrancies, expressed the expected pluripotency markers and displayed in vitro differentiation potential to the three germ layers. The reported A79V-iPSCs line may be a useful resource for in vitro modeling of familial AD.
27345971	Peripheral blood mononuclear cell-converted induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from an early onset Alzheimer's patient.	Improvement in transduction efficiency makes it possible to convert blood cells into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC). In this study, we generated an iPSC line from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) donated by a patient who exhibited memory deficit at age 59; outcome of positron emission tomography scan is consistent with a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. Integration-free CytoTune-iPS Sendai Reprogramming factors which include Sendai virus particles of the four Yamanaka factors Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc were introduced to PBMC to convert them to iPSCs without retention of virus. Three germ layer differentiation was induced to demonstrate the pluripotency of these iPSCs.
27345793	Lymphoblast-derived integration-free iPS cell line from a 65-year-old Alzheimer's disease patient expressing the TREM2 p.R47H variant.	Human lymphoblast cells from a male patient diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease (AD) expressing the TREM2 p.R47H variant were used to generate integration-free induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells employing episomal plasmids expressing OCT4, SOX2, NANOG, LIN28, c-MYC and L-MYC. The iPS cells retained the TREM2 mutation, and were defined as pluripotent based on (i) expression of pluripotent-associated markers, (ii) embryoid body-based differentiation into cell types representative of the three germ layers and (iii) the similarity between the transcriptomes of the iPS cell line and the human embryonic stem cell line H1 with a Pearson correlation of 0.966.
27345792	Generation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from an Alzheimer's disease patient carrying a L150P mutation in PSEN-1.	Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) were generated from skin fibroblasts isolated from a 58-year old male with a L150P mutation in the presenilin 1 (PSEN-1) gene, which is responsible for the majority of familial cases of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The iPSCs were established by co-electroporation with episomal plasmids containing hOCT4, hSOX2, hL-MYC, hKLF4, hNANOG, hLIN28, and short hairpin RNA against TP53. The iPSCs contained the specific heterozygous mutation c.449C>T, had normal karyotype, expressed the expected pluripotency genes and displayed in vitro differentiation potential to the three germ layers. The iPSCs may be useful for studying familial AD pathology in vitro.
27343850	Design, synthesis and evaluation of 4-dimethylamine flavonoid derivatives as potential multifunctional anti-Alzheimer agents.	A new series of 4-dimethylamine flavonoid derivatives were designed and synthesized as potential multifunctional anti-Alzheimer agents. The inhibition of cholinesterase activity, self-induced beta-amyloid (Abeta) aggregation, and antioxidant activity by these derivatives was investigated. Most of the compounds exhibited potent acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) inhibitory activity. A Lineweaver-Burk plot and molecular modeling study showed that these compounds targeted both the catalytic active site (CAS) and peripheral anionic site (PAS) of AChE. The derivatives showed potent self-induced Abeta aggregation inhibition and peroxyl radical absorbance activity. Moreover, compound 6d significantly protected PC12 neurons against H2O2-induced cell death at low concentrations. Thus, these compounds could become multifunctional agents for further development for the treatment of AD.
27342368	An electrochemical sensor for detection of neurotransmitter-acetylcholine using metal nanoparticles, 2D material and conducting polymer modified electrode.	An essential biological sensor for acetylcholine (ACh) detection is constructed by immobilizing enzymes, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and choline oxidase (ChO), on the surface of iron oxide nanoparticles (Fe2O3NPs), poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT)-reduced graphene oxide (rGO) nanocomposite modified fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO). The qualitative and quantitative measurements of nanocomposites properties were accomplished by scanning electron microscope (SEM), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and cyclic voltammetry (CV). This prepared biological sensor delineated a wide linear range of 4.0nM to 800muM with a response time less than 4s and detection limit (based on S/N ratio) of 4.0nM. The sensor showed perfect sensitivity, excessive selectivity and stability for longer period of time during storage. Besides its very high-sensitivity, the biosensor has displayed a low detection limit which is reported for the first time in comparison to previously reported ACh sensors. By fabricating Fe2O3NPs/rGO/PEDOT modified FTO electrode for determining ACh level in serum samples, the applicability of biosensor has increased immensely as the detection of the level neurotransmitter is first priority for patients suffering from memory loss or Alzheimer's disease (AD).
27341566	Being Dementia Smart (BDS): A Dementia Nurse Education Journey in Scotland.	There is a global demographic transition secondary to population ageing. The number of older people living with multimorbidities including dementia has been significantly rising both in developed and developing countries. It is estimated that there would be 74.7 million people living with dementia by 2030 that would escalate to 135.46 million by 2050. 62% of people with dementia currently live in low and middle income countries that are very poorly resourced to cope with this epidemic. Dementia is now duly recognised as a national priority within the UK and a global priority at the 2013 G8 Summit. Management and care of an individual with dementia requires a multidisciplinary approach with expertise and a competent skill base. Nurses are central to the delivery of dementia care delivery in hospitals, community and residential care settings. It is against this background that this pre-registration integrated dementia curriculum was developed to build capacity and capability with dementia expertise among the future nursing workforce in Scotland in line with the National Dementia Strategy.
27341411	Diagnostic role of 11C-Pittsburgh compound B retention patterns and glucose metabolism by fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose PET/CT in amnestic and nonamnestic mild cognitive impairment patients.	OBJECTIVE: Amyloid imaging clinically is usually reported as positive or negative, and the role of amyloid topography has not been studied before. To evaluate in a clinical setting the regional distribution patterns of C-Pittsburgh compound B (C-PIB) and the fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose (F-FDG) uptake in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), we designed this study. METHODS: We studied 81 consecutive MCI patients, 64 amnestic (A-MCI) and 17 nonamnestic (NA-MCI) by C-PIB and F-FDG PET/computed tomography, by visual analysis. PIB retention was classified according to the regional distribution into the following patterns: A (frontal, lateral temporal, basal ganglia and anterior cingulate) and B (global retention). F-FDG images were considered positive only if temporoparietal hypometabolism consistent with Alzheimer's disease was observed. RESULTS: In 42 of the 64 A-MCI, C-PIB was positive. Twelve of the 42 positive A-MCI showed an A-pattern, all F-FDG negative, and 30 a B-pattern, 10 F-FDG positive and 20 F-FDG negative. Of the 17 NA-MCI, C-PIB was positive in three and F-FDG was positive in one. The different proportion of C-PIB positivity in A-MCI and NA-MCI was highly significant (P<0.001). CONCLUSION: Two different C-PIB patterns were observed in MCI patients and for the A-pattern, glucose hypometabolism consistent with Alzheimer's disease is highly unlikely. These findings may contribute towards a better selection of patients for future potential treatments and also to optimize the use of F-FDG-PET/CT.
27340665	Intracellular Calcium Dysregulation: Implications for Alzheimer's Disease.	Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive neuronal loss. AD is associated with aberrant processing of the amyloid precursor protein, which leads to the deposition of amyloid-beta plaques within the brain. Together with plaques deposition, the hyperphosphorylation of the microtubules associated protein tau and the formation of intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangles are a typical neuropathological feature in AD brains. Cellular dysfunctions involving specific subcellular compartments, such as mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum (ER), are emerging as crucial players in the pathogenesis of AD, as well as increased oxidative stress and dysregulation of calcium homeostasis. Specifically, dysregulation of intracellular calcium homeostasis has been suggested as a common proximal cause of neural dysfunction in AD. Aberrant calcium signaling has been considered a phenomenon mainly related to the dysfunction of intracellular calcium stores, which can occur in both neuronal and nonneuronal cells. This review reports the most recent findings on cellular mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of AD, with main focus on the control of calcium homeostasis at both cytosolic and mitochondrial level.
27338353	Neuroprotective and Therapeutic Strategies against Parkinson's Disease: Recent Perspectives.	Parkinsonism is a progressive motor disease that affects 1.5 million Americans and is the second most common neurodegenerative disease after Alzheimer's. Typical neuropathological features of Parkinson's disease (PD) include degeneration of dopaminergic neurons located in the pars compacta of the substantia nigra that project to the striatum (nigro-striatal pathway) and depositions of cytoplasmic fibrillary inclusions (Lewy bodies) which contain ubiquitin and alpha-synuclein. The cardinal motor signs of PD are tremors, rigidity, slow movement (bradykinesia), poor balance, and difficulty in walking (Parkinsonian gait). In addition to motor symptoms, non-motor symptoms that include autonomic and psychiatric as well as cognitive impairments are pressing issues that need to be addressed. Several different mechanisms play an important role in generation of Lewy bodies; endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress induced unfolded proteins, neuroinflammation and eventual loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra of mid brain in PD. Moreover, these diverse processes that result in PD make modeling of the disease and evaluation of therapeutics against this devastating disease difficult. Here, we will discuss diverse mechanisms that are involved in PD, neuroprotective and therapeutic strategies currently in clinical trial or in preclinical stages, and impart views about strategies that are promising to mitigate PD pathology.
27338164	Tau-positive nuclear indentations in P301S tauopathy mice.	Increased incidence of neuronal nuclear indentations is a well-known feature of the striatum of Huntington's disease (HD) brains and, in Alzheimer's disease (AD), neuronal nuclear indentations have recently been reported to correlate with neurotoxicity caused by improper cytoskeletal/nucleoskeletal coupling. Initial detection of rod-shaped tau immunostaining in nuclei of cortical and striatal neurons of HD brains and in hippocampal neurons of early Braak stage AD led us to coin the term "tau nuclear rods (TNRs)." Although TNRs traverse nuclear space, they in fact occupy narrow cytoplasmic extensions that fill indentations of the nuclear envelope and we will here refer to this histological hallmark as Tau-immunopositive nuclear indentations (TNIs). We reasoned that TNI formation is likely secondary to tau alterations as TNI detection in HD correlates with an increase in total tau, particularly of the isoforms with four tubulin binding repeats (4R-tau). Here we analyze transgenic mice that overexpress human 4R-tau with a frontotemporal lobar degeneration-tau point mutation (P301S mice) to explore whether tau alteration is sufficient for TNI formation. Immunohistochemistry with various tau antibodies, immunoelectron microscopy and double tau-immunofluorescence/DAPI-nuclear counterstaining confirmed that excess 4R-tau in P301S mice is sufficient for the detection of abundant TNIs that fill nuclear indentations. Interestingly, this does not correlate with an increase in the number of nuclear indentations, thus suggesting that excess total tau or an isoform imbalance in favor of 4R-tau facilitates tau detection inside preexisting nuclear indentations but does not induce formation of the latter. In summary, here we demonstrate that tau alteration is sufficient for TNI detection and our results suggest that the neuropathological finding of TNIs becomes a possible indicator of increased total tau and/or increased 4R/3R-tau ratio in the affected neurons apart from being an efficient way to monitor pathology-associated nuclear indentations.
27335008	Phycoerythrin averts intracellular ROS generation and physiological functional decline in eukaryotes under oxidative stress.	In vitro antioxidant virtue and life-prolonging effect of phycoerythrin (PE; a pigment protein isolated from Phormidium sp. A09DM) have been revealed in our previous reports (Sonani et al. in Age 36:9717, 2014a; Sonani et al. in Process Biochem 49:1757-1766, 2014b). It has been hypothesized that the PE expands life span of Caenorhabditis elegans (bears large resemblance with human aging pathways) due to its antioxidant virtue. This hypothesis is tested in present study by checking the effect of PE on intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and associated physiological deformities using mouse and human skin fibroblasts, C. elegans, and Drosophila melanogaster Oregon R + and by divulging PE's structural attributes responsible for its antioxidant asset. PE treatment displayed noteworthy decrease of 67, 48, and 77 % in ROS level in mouse fibroblast (3T3-L1), human fibroblast, and C. elegans N2, respectively, arisen under chemical-induced oxidative stress. PE treatment delayed the development of paraquat-induced Alzheimer phenotype by 14.5 % in C. elegans CL4176. Furthermore, PE improved the locomotion of D. melanogaster Oregon R + under oxidative stress with simultaneous up-regulation in super-oxide dismutase and catalase activities. The existence of 52 Glu + Asp + His + Thr residues (having metal ion sequestration capacity), 5 phycoerythrobilin chromophores (potential electron exchangers) in PE's primary structure, and significant hydrophobic patches on the surface of its alpha- and beta-subunits are supposed to collectively contribute in the antioxidant virtues of PE. Altogether, results support the hypothesis that it is the PE's antioxidant asset, which is responsible for its life-prolonging effect and thus could be exploited in the therapeutics of ROS-associated abnormalities including aging and neurodegeneration in eukaryotes.
27334799	Long-term safety and tolerability of bapineuzumab in patients with Alzheimer's disease in two phase 3 extension studies.	BACKGROUND: Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies that target amyloid beta has been under investigation as a treatment for patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). The 3000 and 3001 phase 3 clinical studies of intravenous bapineuzumab assessed safety and efficacy in patients with mild to moderate AD recruited in over 26 countries. This article describes the long-term safety and tolerability of bapineuzumab in the extension studies for these two protocols. METHODS: The long-term safety and tolerability of intravenous-administered bapineuzumab in patients with AD was evaluated in apolipoprotein E epsilon4 allele noncarriers (Study 3002, extension of Study 3000) and apolipoprotein E epsilon4 allele carriers (Study 3003, extension of Study 3001). Those receiving bapineuzumab in the parent study were continued at the same dose; if receiving placebo, patients began bapineuzumab. Bapineuzumab doses were 0.5 mg/kg in both studies and also 1.0 mg/kg in the noncarrier study. Clinical efficacy of bapineuzumab was also assessed in exploratory analyses. RESULTS: Because of lack of efficacy in two other phase 3 trials, the parent protocols were stopped early. As a result, Studies 3002 and 3003 were also terminated. In total, 492 and 202 patients were enrolled in Studies 3003 and 3002, respectively. In apolipoprotein E epsilon4 carriers (Study 3003), treatment-emergent adverse events occurred in 70.7% of the patients who originally received placebo and 66.9% of those who originally received bapineuzumab. In noncarriers, treatment-emergent adverse events occurred in 82.1% and 67.6% of patients who received placebo + bapineuzumab 0.5 mg/kg and placebo + bapineuzumab 1.0 mg/kg, respectively, and in 72.7% and 64.3% of those who received bapineuzumab + bapineuzumab 0.5 mg/kg and 1.0 mg/kg, respectively. Amyloid-related imaging abnormalities with edema or effusions were the main bapineuzumab-associated adverse events in both studies, occurring in approximately 11% of placebo + bapineuzumab and 4% of bapineuzumab + bapineuzumab groups overall. Exploratory analyses of clinical efficacy were not significantly different between groups in either study. CONCLUSIONS: In these phase 3 extension studies, intravenous bapineuzumab administered for up to approximately 3 years showed no unexpected safety signals and a safety profile consistent with previous bapineuzumab trials. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Noncarriers (Study 3002): ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00996918 . Registered 14 October 2009. Carriers (Study 3003): ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00998764 . Registered 16 October 2009.
27334014	Lower cerebral blood flow is associated with faster cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease.	OBJECTIVE: To determine whether lower cerebral blood flow (CBF) is associated with faster cognitive decline in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHODS: We included 88 patients with dementia due to AD from the Amsterdam Dementia Cohort. Mean follow-up was 2 +/- 1 years. Linear mixed models were used to determine associations of lower whole brain and regional pseudo-continuous arterial spin labelling measured CBF with rate of cognitive decline as measured with repeated mini-mental state examination (MMSE). Model 1 was adjusted for age, sex, and education. Model 2 was additionally adjusted for normalized gray matter volume, medial temporal lobe atrophy, white matter hyperintensities, microbleeds, and lacunes. Analyses were repeated after partial volume correction (PVC) of CBF. Statistical significance was set at p </= 0.05. RESULTS: Patients were 65 +/- 7 years old, 44 (50 %) were women, and mean baseline MMSE was 22 +/- 4. Annual decline (beta[SE]) on the MMSE was estimated at -2.11 (0.25) points per year. Lower whole brain (beta[SE]-0.50[0.25]; p </= 0.05) and parietal (beta[SE]-0.59[0.25]; p < 0.05) CBF were associated with faster cognitive decline. PVC cortical CBF was not associated with cognitive decline. CONCLUSIONS: Lower CBF, in particular in the posterior brain regions, may have value as a prognostic marker for rate of cognitive decline in AD. KEY POINTS: * In AD, lower CBF is associated with more rapid cognitive decline. * Decreasing CBF does not reach a plateau early in AD. * PcASL-CFB has additive value to conventional structural MRI measures in AD.
27333745	[SIRT1].	Silent information regulator 2 homolog 1 (SIRT1), a product of the so called "longevity gene", is a protein deacetylase that has been reported to suppress cardiovascular pathologies such as myocardial infarction, and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Parkinson's disease via anti-apoptosis, anti-inflammation, or increasing mitochondrial biogenesis in model organisms. In addition, SIRT1 can counter cerebral hypoperfusion and ischemia through deacetylating anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic molecules and also through deacetylating endothelial nitric oxide synthase and inducing arterial dilation. Since cerebral hypoperfusion/ischemia, inflammation, and apoptosis can induce vascular cognitive impairment, SIRT1 potentiation may provide molecular targets for future therapeutic intervention of vascular cognitive impairment and cerebral infarction.
27333635	Expressions of Sense of Self Among Individuals With Alzheimer's Disease.	Recent research has challenged the previously held view that people with Alzheimer's disease (AD) lack a sense of self, with several studies demonstrating that the sense of self is partially preserved, even in late stages of AD. The aim of this study was to examine how people with AD express their sense of self (Self 1-3) using the social constructionist theory of selfhood described by Harre (1998). Personal interviews were analyzed deductively. The participants narrated fragments of their life stories and expressed the fear of becoming a burden to family members and of nursing home placement. They expressed Self 1 (personal singularity or personal identity) without any problems, whereas their Self 2 (self-concept) attributes had undergone changes that they had learned to live with. The participants expressed surprisingly few problems with their narratives of Self 3 (social personae), that is, their accounts of interactions with other people. They reported being received positively when they were open about their diagnosis. These results provide further nuances that broaden our understanding of the process of preserving the sense of self, that is, simultaneously being the same and a different person.
27333034	ADAM30 Downregulates APP-Linked Defects Through Cathepsin D Activation in Alzheimer's Disease.	Although several ADAMs (A disintegrin-like and metalloproteases) have been shown to contribute to the amyloid precursor protein (APP) metabolism, the full spectrum of metalloproteases involved in this metabolism remains to be established. Transcriptomic analyses centred on metalloprotease genes unraveled a 50% decrease in ADAM30 expression that inversely correlates with amyloid load in Alzheimer's disease brains. Accordingly, in vitro down- or up-regulation of ADAM30 expression triggered an increase/decrease in Abeta peptides levels whereas expression of a biologically inactive ADAM30 (ADAM30(mut)) did not affect Abeta secretion. Proteomics/cell-based experiments showed that ADAM30-dependent regulation of APP metabolism required both cathepsin D (CTSD) activation and APP sorting to lysosomes. Accordingly, in Alzheimer-like transgenic mice, neuronal ADAM30 over-expression lowered Abeta42 secretion in neuron primary cultures, soluble Abeta42 and amyloid plaque load levels in the brain and concomitantly enhanced CTSD activity and finally rescued long term potentiation alterations. Our data thus indicate that lowering ADAM30 expression may favor Abeta production, thereby contributing to Alzheimer's disease development.
27333028	Structure-Based Drug Discovery for Prion Disease Using a Novel Binding Simulation.	The accumulation of abnormal prion protein (PrP(Sc)) converted from the normal cellular isoform of PrP (PrP(C)) is assumed to induce pathogenesis in prion diseases. Therefore, drug discovery studies for these diseases have focused on the protein conversion process. We used a structure-based drug discovery algorithm (termed Nagasaki University Docking Engine: NUDE) that ran on an intensive supercomputer with a graphic-processing unit to identify several compounds with anti-prion effects. Among the candidates showing a high-binding score, the compounds exhibited direct interaction with recombinant PrP in vitro, and drastically reduced PrP(Sc) and protein-aggresomes in the prion-infected cells. The fragment molecular orbital calculation showed that the van der Waals interaction played a key role in PrP(C) binding as the intermolecular interaction mode. Furthermore, PrP(Sc) accumulation and microgliosis were significantly reduced in the brains of treated mice, suggesting that the drug candidates provided protection from prion disease, although further in vivo tests are needed to confirm these findings. This NUDE-based structure-based drug discovery for normal protein structures is likely useful for the development of drugs to treat other conformational disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease.
27332627	Transdermal Rivastigmine Delivery for Alzheimer Disease: Amenability of Exposure Predictions of Rivastigmine and Metabolite, NAP226-90, by Linear Regression Model Using Limited Samples.	PURPOSE: Although an optimized delivery of rivastigmine for management of Alzhiemer disease (AD) is provided by the transdermal patch, it is critical to establish a limited sampling strategy for the measurement of exposure of rivastigmine/NAP226-90. METHODS: The relationship Cmax versus AUC0-24h for rivastigmine/NAP226-90 was established by regression models. The derived regression equations enabled the prediction AUC0-24h for rivastigmine and NAP226-90. Models were evaluated using statistical criteria. Mixed model was used to predict AUC0-24h for rivastigmine/NAP226-90 from time points such as 8 (C8h), 12 (C12h), and 18 (C18h) hours. RESULTS: Excellent correlation was established for between Cmax and AUC0-24h for rivastigmine and NAP226-90. AUC0-24h predictions of either rivastigmine or NAP226-90 were within 0.8- to 1.25-fold difference. The RMSE in the AUC0-24h predictions ranged from 17.6% to 21.9%, and the R for prediction were greater than 0.96 for both rivastigmine and NAP226-90. Use of mixed model for C8h, C12h, and C18h resulted in AUC0-24h within 1.5-fold difference for rivastigmine or NAP226-90. CONCLUSIONS: Cmax of rivastigmine and NAP226-90 was highly correlated with the corresponding AUC0-24h values confirming the role of a time point closer to Cmax for an effective AUC measurement of rivastigmine or the metabolite.
27331236	[The use of transcranial focused ultrasound in CNS diseases].	Transcranial focused ultrasound is a modern medical technique, which provides non-invasive impact on the brain. Current development stage of this technique is no longer than 20 years and many possible applications of this technique are still at pre-clinical stage. The greatest progress has been made in the field of functional neurosurgery. Focused ultrasound enables non-invasive MRI-guided formation of small destruction foci in the relevant targets, providing therapeutic neuromodulating effects in patients with Parkinson's disease, essential tremor, pain syndromes, obsessive-compulsive disorders, and other diseases. So far, this treatment was carried out in more than 300 patients. Several cases of ultrasound thermal destruction of intracranial neoplasms were published. There are attempts to perform third ventriculostomy using ultrasound in animals. A separate area focuses on the enhancement of the permeability of the blood-brain barrier to various substances driven by focused ultrasound. The possibilities of enhancing the permeability to chemotherapeutic agents, immune drugs, and other substances are being investigated in laboratories. A large number of studies focus on treatment of Alzheimer's disease. clinical trials aimed at enhancing the permeability of the blood-brain barrier to chemotherapeutic agents have been initiated. Reversible neuromodulating, stimulating, and inhibiting effect of focused ultrasound on the nervous system structures is another non-destructive effect, which is currently being actively investigated in animals. Furthermore, laboratory studies demonstrated the ability of focused ultrasound to destroy blood clots and thrombi. Transcranial focused ultrasound provides numerous unique possibilities for scientific and practical medicine. Large-scale research is required prior to the widespread clinical implementation. Nevertheless, we can already state that implementation of this technique will significantly enhance diagnostic and therapeutic potential of neurosurgery and neurology.
27323891	Plasma levels of soluble receptor for advanced glycation end products in Alzheimer's disease.	BACKGROUND: A decreased plasma level of soluble form of the receptor for advanced glycation end products (sRAGE) in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been reported. However, no evidence has shown whether the sRAGE plasma level of AD patients may differentiate from other types of dementia. METHODS: Our study assessed sRAGE concentrations in the following 121 individuals in Chongqing area: 36 patients with AD, 12 with vascular dementia (VaD), 14 with mixed dementia (MD), 24 with other dementia (OD) including Parkinson's disease dementia, frontotemporal dementia, paralytic dementia and 35 cognitively normal controls. The total plasma level of sRAGE was determined using sandwich ELISA method. RESULTS: sRAGE concentration in AD is significantly decreased compared with healthy controls. However, the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis of sRAGE between the AD and the control shows a low diagnostic accuracy. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that sRAGE may assist the diagnosis of AD from normal individuals, but cannot differentiate AD from VaD, MD or OD.
27323437	[Effects of Acupuncture Stimulation of Bilateral "Hegu" (LI 4) and "Taichong" (LR 3) on Learning-memory Ability, Hippocampal AP 42 Expression and Inflammatory Cytokines in Rats with Alzheimer's Disease].	OBJECTIVE: To observe the effect of acupuncture stimulation of bilateral "Hegu" (LI 4) and "Taichong" (LR 3, the so-called "Four Gate Points") on learning-memory ability, hippocampal interleukin-1 (IL-1) P and IL-2 and amyloid beta (Abeta) 42 levels in Alzheimer's disease (AD) rats,so as to reveal its underlying mechanism in improving AD. METHODS: Male SD rats were randomly divided into sham operation, model, medication and acupuncture groups (n = 12 rats in each group). The AD model was created by microinjection of streptozotocin (10 pL, 3 mg/kg) into the lateral ventricle (repeated the microinjection once two days later). Bilateral LR 3 and LI 4 were punctured with filiform needles and stimulated manually, once a day, 6 days a week for 4 weeks. The rats of the medication group were intragastric perfusion of Donepezil HOI (0.045 mg/kg), once a day for 4 weeks. The learning-memory ability was detected by Morris water maze swimming tests. The immunoactivity of hippocampal Abeta 42 was detected by immunohistochemistry, and the contents of IL-1 P and IL-2 in the hippocampus tissue were determined by ELISA. RESULTS: After modeling, the average escape latency of Morris water navigation task was significantly increased, and the target-platform crossing times of space probe trials were significantly reduced in the model group (P<0.05), suggesting a g-memory ability. After acupuncture intervention, the increased escape latency and the decreased target-platform crossing times were reversed, suggesting an improvement of the learning-memory. The hippocampal Abeta 42 immunoactivity and IL-1 beta content were significantly higher in the model group than in the sham operation group (P<0.05), but the hippocampal IL-2 content was markedly decreased in the model group (P<0. 05). Following the interventions, the increased Abeta 42 expression and IL-1 beta contents, and the decreased IL-2 contents in the hippocampus were also reversed in both the acupuncture and medication groups (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: Acupuncture may improve learning-memory ability in AD rats, which may be associated with its effects in reducing hippocampal Abeta13 42 expression and IL-1beta content and in up-regulating IL-2 level.
27322475	Changes in Neurocognitive Architecture in Patients with Obstructive Sleep Apnea Treated with Continuous Positive Airway Pressure.	BACKGROUND: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a chronic, multisystem disorder that has a bidirectional relationship with several major neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's dementia. Treatment with Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) offers some protection from the effects of OSA, although it is still unclear which populations should be targeted, for how long, and what the effects of treatment are on different organ systems. We investigated whether cognitive improvements can be achieved as early as one month into CPAP treatment in patients with OSA. METHODS: 55 patients (mean (SD) age: 47.6 (11.1) years) with newly diagnosed moderate-severe OSA (Oxygen Desaturation Index: 36.6 (25.2) events/hour; Epworth sleepiness score (ESS): 12.8 (4.9)) and 35 matched healthy volunteers were studied. All participants underwent neurocognitive testing, neuroimaging and polysomnography. Patients were randomized into parallel groups: CPAP with best supportive care (BSC), or BSC alone for one month, after which they were re-tested. FINDINGS: One month of CPAP with BSC resulted in a hypertrophic trend in the right thalamus [mean difference (%): 4.04, 95% CI: 1.47 to 6.61], which was absent in the BSC group [-2.29, 95% CI: -4.34 to -0.24]. Significant improvement was also recorded in ESS, in the CPAP plus BSC group, following treatment [mean difference (%): -27.97, 95% CI: -36.75 to -19.19 vs 2.46, 95% CI: -5.23 to 10.15; P=0.012], correlated to neuroplastic changes in brainstem (r=-0.37; P=0.05), and improvements in delayed logical memory scores [57.20, 95% CI: 42.94 to 71.46 vs 23.41, 95% CI: 17.17 to 29.65; P=0.037]. INTERPRETATION: One month of CPAP treatment can lead to adaptive alterations in the neurocognitive architecture that underlies the reduced sleepiness, and improved verbal episodic memory in patients with OSA. We propose that partial neural recovery occurs during short periods of treatment with CPAP.
27322314	Age and Alzheimer's Disease.	A recent review article published in Nutrients by Brewer [1] attracted the attention of the readers on the role of copper toxicity as major factor in Alzheimer's disease.[...].
27322235	Synthesis of Bioactive 2-(Arylamino)thiazolo[5,4-f]-quinazolin-9-ones via the Hugershoff Reaction or Cu- Catalyzed Intramolecular C-S Bond Formation.	A library of thirty eight novel thiazolo[5,4-f]quinazolin-9(8H)-one derivatives (series 8, 10, 14 and 17) was prepared via the Hugershoff reaction and a Cu catalyzed intramolecular C-S bond formation, helped by microwave-assisted technology when required. The efficient multistep synthesis of the key 6-amino-3-cyclopropylquinazolin-4(3H)-one (3) has been reinvestigated and performed on a multigram scale from the starting 5-nitroanthranilic acid. The inhibitory potency of the final products was evaluated against five kinases involved in Alzheimer's disease and showed that some molecules of the 17 series described in this paper are particularly promising for the development of novel multi-target inhibitors of kinases.
27321278	Inhibitory activities of major anthraquinones and other constituents from Cassia obtusifolia against beta-secretase and cholinesterases.	ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Semen Cassiae has been traditionally used as an herbal remedy for liver, eye, and acute inflammatory diseases. Recent pharmacological reports have indicated that Cassiae semen has neuroprotective effects, attributable to its anti-inflammatory actions, in ischemic stroke and Alzheimer's disease (AD) models. AIM OF THE STUDY: The basic goal of this study was to evaluate the anti-AD activities of C. obtusifolia and its major constituents. Previously, the extract of C. obtusifolia seeds, was reported to have memory enhancing properties and anti-AD activity to ameliorate amyloid beta-induced synaptic dysfunction. However, the responsible components of C. obtusifolia seeds in an AD are currently still unknown. In this study, we investigated the inhibitory effects of C. obtusifolia and its constituents against acetylcholinesterase (AChE), butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), and beta-site amyloid precursor protein (APP) cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) enzyme activity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In vitro cholinesterase enzyme assays by using AChE, BChE, and BACE1 were performed. We also scrutinized the potentials of Cassiae semen active component as BACE1 inhibitors via enzyme kinetics and molecular docking simulation. RESULTS: In vitro enzyme assays demonstrated that C. obtusifolia and its major constituents have promising inhibitory potential against AChE, BChE, and BACE1. All Cassiae semen constituents exhibited potent inhibitory activities against AChE and BACE1 with IC50 values of 6.29-109microg/mL and 0.94-190microg/mL, whereas alaternin, questin, and toralactone gentiobioside exhibited significant inhibitory activities against BChE with IC50 values of 113.10-137.74microg/mL. Kinetic study revealed that alaternin noncompetitively inhibited, whereas cassiaside and emodin showed mixed-type inhibition against BACE1. Furthermore, molecular docking simulation results demonstrated that hydroxyl group of alaternin and emodin tightly interacted with the active site residues of BACE1 and their relevant binding energies (-6.62 and -6.89kcal/mol), indicating a higher affinity and tighter binding capacity of these compounds for the active site of BACE1. CONCLUSION: The findings of the present study suggest the potential of C. obtusifolia and its major constituents for use in the development of therapeutic or preventive agents for AD, especially through inhibition of AChE, BChE and BACE1 activities.
27320328	Rexinoids as Therapeutics for Alzheimer's Disease: Role of APOE.	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by amyloid plaques, composed of amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) and neurofibrillary tangles, composed of aberrantly phosphorylated tau. APOE4 is the greatest genetic risk factor for AD, increasing risk up to 12- fold with a double allele compared to APOE3. In contrast, APOE2 reduces AD risk ~2-fold per allele. Accumulating evidence demonstrates that apolipoprotein E4 (apoE4) plays a multifactorial role in AD pathogenesis, although the exact mechanisms remain unclear. Further data support roles for apoE4 as a toxic gain of function or loss of positive function in AD, a discrepancy that has significant implications for the future of apoE-directed therapeutics. However, recent evidence repurposing retinoid X receptor (RXR) agonists, or rexinoids, for the treatment of AD demonstrates conflicting, though potentially beneficial effects in familial AD-transgenic (FAD-Tg) mouse models. Of particular note is bexarotene (Targretin(R)), a selective rexinoid previously utilized in cancer treatment emerging as a viable candidate for AD clinical trials. However, the mechanism of action of bexarotene and similar rexinoids remains controversial, particularly in the context of human APOE. In addition, rexinoids demonstrate distinct adverse event profiles in humans that may have greater detrimental effects in an elderly AD population. Therefore, this special issue review discusses the implications for rexinoiddirected therapeutic strategies in AD, the potential mechanistic targets, and future directions for the improvement of rexinoid-based therapies in AD.
27318120	Neuroprotective effect of synthetic chalcone derivatives as competitive dual inhibitors against mu-calpain and cathepsin B through the downregulation of tau phosphorylation and insoluble Abeta peptide formation.	A series of chalcone derivatives were synthesized and evaluated for their mu-calpain and cathepsin B inhibitory activities. Among the tested chalcone derivatives, two compounds, 7 and 11, showed potent inhibitory activities against mu-calpain and cathepsin B and were selected for further evaluation. Compounds 7 and 11 showed enzyme inhibitory activities at the cellular level and displayed neuroprotective effects against oxidative stress-induced apoptosis in SH-SY5Y cells, a human neuroblastoma cell line. Moreover, compounds 7 and 11 reduced p25 formation, tau phosphorylation and insoluble Abeta peptide formation. Enzyme kinetic experiments and docking studies revealed that compounds 7 and 11 competitively inhibited both mu-calpain and cathepsin B enzymes.
27314984	Neurogenesis-based epigenetic therapeutics for Alzheimer's disease (Review).	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a worldwide health problem with multiple pathogenic causes including aging, and genetic and environmental factors. As the interfaces between genes and the environment, epigenetic mechanisms, including DNA methylation, histone modification and microRNAs, are also involved in the pathogenesis of AD. Neurogenesis occurs throughout life in the normal adult brain of mammals. The neurogenic process, consisting of the proliferation, differentiation and maturation of neural stem cells (NSC), is regulated via epigenetic mechanisms by controlling the expression of specific sets of genes. In the pathology of AD, due to impairments in epigenetic mechanisms, the generation of neurons from NSCs is damaged, which exacerbates the loss of neurons and the deficits in learning and memory function associated with AD. Based on neurogenesis, a number of therapeutic strategies have shown capability in promoting neuronal generation to compensate for the neurons lost in AD, thereby improving cognitive function through epigenetic modifications. This provides potential for the treatment of AD by stimulating neurogenesis using epigenetic strategies. The present review discusses the epigenetics of AD and adult neurogenesis, and summarizes the neurogenesis-based epigenetic therapies targeted at AD. Such a review may offer information for the guidance of future developments of therapeutic strategies for AD.
27313396	Pain in Neurodegenerative Disease: Current Knowledge and Future Perspectives.	Neurodegenerative diseases are going to increase as the life expectancy is getting longer. The management of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other dementias, Parkinson's disease (PD) and PD related disorders, motor neuron diseases (MND), Huntington's disease (HD), spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA), and spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), is mainly addressed to motor and cognitive impairment, with special care to vital functions as breathing and feeding. Many of these patients complain of painful symptoms though their origin is variable, and their presence is frequently not considered in the treatment guidelines, leaving their management to the decision of the clinicians alone. However, studies focusing on pain frequency in such disorders suggest a high prevalence of pain in selected populations from 38 to 75% in AD, 40% to 86% in PD, and 19 to 85% in MND. The methods of pain assessment vary between studies so the type of pain has been rarely reported. However, a prevalent nonneuropathic origin of pain emerged for MND and PD. In AD, no data on pain features are available. No controlled therapeutic trials and guidelines are currently available. Given the relevance of pain in neurodegenerative disorders, the comprehensive understanding of mechanisms and predisposing factors, the application and validation of specific scales, and new specific therapeutic trials are needed.
27312549	Telomere Shortening in Alzheimer's Disease Patients.	BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Sporadic Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is considered an age-related disease, and telomere length has been shown to decrease with age in animal and human studies. Shortening of telomere length has also been reported to beis associated with numerous neurodegenerative diseases, including AD. The aim of this study is to confirm and further elucidate the relationship between peripheral telomere length and Alzheimer's disease, cognitive function, and duration of Alzheimer's disease. METHODS: In this study, we recruited 165 Han Chinese subjects, consisting of 79 normal controls and 86 patients with AD without family history of AD or vascular dementia cases. We measured telomere length (T/S ratio) at baseline using quantitative PCR. RESULTS: Our data showed that the negative correlation between telomere length and age become much stronger in AD patients (n=86, r=-0.382, p<0.001) compared to the control group (n=79, r=-0.024, p=0.833), presenting an estimated telomere loss rate of 0.003 T/S ratio/year (p<0.001). Moreover, we observed that the duration of AD is significantly negatively correlated with telomere length (n=86, r=-0.224, p=0.039), especially in female patients (n=43, r=-0.375, p=0.013) and ApoE4-noncarrier patients (n=52, r=-0.368, p=0.007). We also had some unexpected results, namely that in AD patients, higher Minimum Mental State Examination (MMSE) score were associated with shorter telomere length (n=76, r=-0.281, p=0.014). CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed an accelerated rate of telomere shortening in AD, as well as strong influence of gender and ApoE status on telomere length in the context of this disease.
27312378	A review of clinical trial designs used to detect a disease-modifying effect of drug therapy in Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease.	BACKGROUND: Disease-modification clinical trials in neurodegenerative disorders have struggled to separate symptomatic effects of putative agents from disease-modification. In response, a variety of clinical trial designs have been developed. A systematic review was undertaken to examine which trial designs have been used in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) to detect disease-modifying, as opposed to symptomatic, drug effects. In addition we aimed to identify novel clinical trial designs used in the past or planned for use in the future. We aimed to critique whether the methods used would have identified true disease-modification. METHODS: MEDLINE, Embase and CENTRAL (1980-2015) were searched to identify papers meriting review in full. ClinicalTrials.gov was searched to identify unpublished or planned randomised controlled trials (RCTs). We included RCTs in PD or AD which aimed to demonstrate the disease-modifying properties of drug therapy and differentiate that benefit from any symptomatic effect. RESULTS: 128 RCTs were finally included: 84 in AD (59 published, 25 unpublished); 44 in PD (36 published, 8 unpublished). A variety of clinical trial designs were applied including long-term follow-up, wash-in and wash-out analyses, randomised delayed-start, the use of time-to-event outcome measures and surrogate disease progression biomarkers. Deficiencies in each of these design strategies, the quantity of missing data in included RCTs and the methods used to deal with missing data, meant that none of the included studies convincingly demonstrated disease-modification. No truly novel clinical trial designs were identified. CONCLUSION: We currently believe that the best clinical trial design available to demonstrate disease-modification is a long-term follow-up study, in which an examination is made for sustained divergence in outcome measures between treatment arms over the study period.
27312282	Professor Alois Alzheimer (1864-1915): Lest we forget.	December 19(th) 2015 marks the centennial anniversary of the death of the great Bavarian psychiatrist and neuropathologist, Alois Alzheimer (1864-1915), a man immortalised by the still incurable dementing process described by him in 1906 and firmly established in his name. Notwithstanding the great wealth of research into the history of Alzheimer's disease and legacy, the life of this exemplary clinician remains less than widely appreciated today, and it is the purpose of this brief reminiscence to retell the story of the pioneering neuropsychiatrist in this centenary year of his passing.
27311284	[Clinical Application of Analytical and Medical Instruments Mainly Using MS Techniques].	Analytical instruments for clinical use are commonly required to confirm the compounds and forms related to diseases with the highest possible sensitivity, quantitative performance, and specificity and minimal invasiveness within a short time, easily, and at a low cost. Advancements of technical innovation for Mass Spectrometer (MS) have led to techniques that meet such requirements. Besides confirming known substances, other purposes and advantages of MS that are not fully known to the public are using MS as a tool to discover unknown phenomena and compounds. An example is clarifying the mechanisms of human diseases. The human body has approximately 100 thousand types of protein, and there may be more than several million types of protein and their metabolites. Most of them have yet to be discovered, and their discovery may give birth to new academic fields and lead to the clarification of diseases, development of new medicines, etc. For example, using the MS system developed under "Contribution to drug discovery and diagnosis by next generation of advanced mass spectrometry system," one of the 30 projects of the "Funding Program for World-Leading Innovative R&D on Science and Technology" (FIRST program), and other individual basic technologies, we succeeded in discovering new disease biomarker candidates for Alzheimer's disease, cancer, etc. Further contribution of MS to clinical medicine can be expected through the development and improvement of new techniques, efforts to verify discoveries, and communications with the medical front.
27308863	The Effect of Changes in Selected Age-specific Causes of Death on Non-Hispanic White Life Expectancy Between 2000 and 2014.	KEY FINDINGS: Data from the National Vital Statistics System, Mortality *Between 2000 and 2014, life expectancy increased by 3.6, 2.6, and 1.4 years, respectively, for non-Hispanic black, Hispanic, and non-Hispanic white persons. *The 1.4-year increase in life expectancy for non-Hispanic white persons would have been greater if not for increases in death rates due to unintentional injuries, suicide, Alzheimer's disease, chronic liver disease, and hypertension. *Increases in death rates due to unintentional injuries, suicide, and chronic liver disease were large enough to increase all-cause non-Hispanic white death rates for ages 25-34, 35-44, and 45-54. *Increases in death rates due to unintentional poisonings for ages 25-34, 35-44, and 45-54 had the greatest impact on the change in life expectancy for non-Hispanic white persons.
27307130	The Prevalence and Incidence of Frontotemporal Dementia: a Systematic Review.	BACKGROUND: Population-based prevalence and incidence studies are essential for understanding the burden of frontotemporal dementia (FTD). METHODS: The MEDLINE and EMBASE databases were searched to identify population-based publications from 1985 to 2012, addressing the incidence and/or prevalence of FTD. References of included articles and prior systematic reviews were searched for additional studies. Two reviewers screened all abstracts and full-text reviews, abstracted data and performed quality assessments. RESULTS: Twenty-six studies were included. Methodological limitations led to wide ranges in the estimates for prevalence (point prevalence 0.01-4.6 per 1000 persons; period prevalence 0.16-31.04 per 1000 persons) and incidence (0.0-0.3 per 1000 person-years). FTD accounted for an average of 2.7% (range 0-9.1%) of all dementia cases among prevalence studies that included subjects 65 and older compared to 10.2% (range 2.8-15.7%) in studies restricted to those aged less than 65. The cumulative numbers of male (373 [52.5%]) and female (338 [47.5%]) cases from studies reporting this information were nearly equal (p=0.18). The behavioural variant FTD (bvFTD) was almost four times as common as the primary progressive aphasias. CONCLUSIONS: Population-based estimates for the epidemiology of FTD varied widely in the included studies. Refinements in the diagnostic process, possibly by the use of validated biomarkers or limiting case ascertainment to specialty services, are needed to obtain more precise estimates of the prevalence and incidence of FTD.
27307128	The Prevalence and Incidence of Dementia Due to Alzheimer's Disease: a Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.	BACKGROUND: Updated information on the epidemiology of dementia due to Alzheimer's disease (AD) is needed to ensure that adequate resources are available to meet current and future healthcare needs. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the incidence and prevalence of AD. METHODS: The MEDLINE and EMBASE databases were searched from 1985 to 2012, as well as the reference lists of selected articles. Included articles had to provide an original population-based estimate for the incidence and/or prevalence of AD. Two individuals independently performed abstract and full-text reviews, data extraction and quality assessments. Random-effects models were employed to generate pooled estimates stratified by age, sex, diagnostic criteria, location (i.e., continent) and time (i.e., when the study was done). RESULTS: Of 16,066 abstracts screened, 707 articles were selected for full-text review. A total of 119 studies met the inclusion criteria. In community settings, the overall point prevalence of dementia due to AD among individuals 60+ was 40.2 per 1000 persons (CI95%: 29.1-55.6), and pooled annual period prevalence was 30.4 per 1000 persons (CI95%: 15.6-59.1). In community settings, the overall pooled annual incidence proportion of dementia due to AD among individuals 60+ was 34.1 per 1000 persons (CI95%: 16.4-70.9), and the incidence rate was 15.8 per 1000 person-years (CI95%: 12.9-19.4). Estimates varied significantly with age, diagnostic criteria used and location (i.e., continent). CONCLUSIONS: The burden of AD dementia is substantial. Significant gaps in our understanding of its epidemiology were identified, even in a high-income country such as Canada. Future studies should assess the impact of using such newer clinical diagnostic criteria for AD dementia such as those of the National Institute on Aging-Alzheimer's Association and/or incorporate validated biomarkers to confirm the presence of Alzheimer pathology to produce more precise estimates of the global burden of AD.
27306508	Alterations in Glucose Metabolism in Alzheimer's Disease.	BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most frequent type of dementia in people over 65 years of age; type 2 diabetes mellitus is a metabolic condition affecting 382 million of adults worldwide. Glucose is the main substrate for energy for the brain, which consumes 25% of the body's glucose. Glucose metabolism, evaluated using Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scanning using 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose ([18F]-FDG) is commonly used for diagnosis and follow up in AD. Epidemiological and pathophysiological studies showed a link between AD and diabetes, particularly in relation to insulin resistance. OBJECTIVE: In this paper, we discuss how [18F] FDG is a marker of glucose metabolism, how insulin resistance is related to diabetes, the link between diabetes and AD, and how novel treatments for diabetes could be beneficial in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. We also review few recent patents in the field, suggesting both diagnostic and therapeutic potential approaches. METHODS: The electronic searches were performed in MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases. We also manually searched abstract books and reviewed available recent patents on specific websites. RESULTS: The impaired glucose metabolism in the brain of subject with AD is a widely recognised early feature of the disease; in vivo evaluation with PET is a useful diagnostic tool. The link between diabetes and neurodegeneration is widely recognized and offer a target for novel therapeutic strategies. CONCLUSIONS: Early diagnosis and early therapeutic intervention are needed to approach this devastating disease. Important studies targeting different aspect of the disease are currently ongoing.
27305963	E-pharmacophore-based virtual screening to identify GSK-3beta inhibitors.	Glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta) is a serine/threonine kinase which has attracted significant attention during recent years in drug design studies. The deregulation of GSK-3beta increased the loss of hippocampal neurons by triggering apoptosis-mediating production of neurofibrillary tangles and alleviates memory deficits in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Given its role in the formation of neurofibrillary tangles leading to AD, it has been a major therapeutic target for intervention in AD, hence was targeted in the present study. Twenty crystal structures were refined to generate pharmacophore models based on energy involvement in binding co-crystal ligands. Four common e-pharmacophore models were optimized from the 20 pharmacophore models. Shape-based screening of four e-pharmacophore models against nine established small molecule databases using Phase v3.9 had resulted in 1800 compounds having similar pharmacophore features. Rigid receptor docking (RRD) was performed for 1800 compounds and 20 co-crystal ligands with GSK-3beta to generate dock complexes. Interactions of the best scoring lead obtained through RRD were further studied with quantum polarized ligand docking (QPLD), induced fit docking (IFD) and molecular mechanics/generalized Born surface area. Comparing the obtained leads to 20 co-crystal ligands resulted in 18 leads among them, lead1 had the lowest docking score, lower binding free energy and better binding orientation toward GSK-3beta. The 50 ns MD simulations run confirmed the stable nature of GSK-3beta-lead1 docking complex. The results from RRD, QPLD, IFD and MD simulations confirmed that lead1 might be used as a potent antagonist for GSK-3beta.
27305800	[PROPOSAL OF AN OBSERVATION GRID TO DECRYPT CAPABILITIES. AN ILLUSTRATION IN AN ORGANIZATION FOR ALZHEIMER'S PATIENTS].	The capability approach (Sen, 2000) is a relevant theoretical choice to be interested in the lives of people with disabilities and/or loss of independence. However, this promising approach to social problems remain shaded by methodological problems. Thus, although its founder emphasizes the need to understand the meaning that the actors give their lives and their choices in the environment that is theirs, there is clearly rooted in a positivist approach, objectivist, quantitatively. This article's objective is to present a methodology for observation grid to overcome this pitfall. Its deployment allows us to understand the relationship of the individual to others, space, time and objects in a social situation. For illustration, we build a grid to a social situation "lunch" in a space welcoming people with Alzheimer's disease.
27302727	Natural Compounds Preventing Neurodegenerative Diseases Through Autophagic Activation.	Neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) are a group of intractable diseases that significantly affect human health. To date, the pathogenesis of NDDs is still poorly understood and effective disease-modifying therapies for NDDs have not been established. NDDs share the common morphological characteristic of the deposition of abnormal proteins in the nervous system, including neurons. Autophagy is one of the major processes by which damaged organelles and abnormal proteins are removed from cells. Impairment of autophagy has been found to be involved in the pathogenesis of NDDs, and the regulation of autophagy may become a therapeutic strategy for NDDs. In recent years, some active compounds from plants have been found to regulate autophagy and exert neuroprotection against NDDs, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy, spinocerebellar ataxia 3, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, via activating autophagy. In this paper, we review recent advances in the use of active ingredients from plants for the regulation of autophagy and treatment of NDDs.
27301257	Reliability, validity and clinical correlates of the Quality of Life in Alzheimer's disease (QoL-AD) scale in medical inpatients.	BACKGROUND: There is a lack of standardisation in quality of life (QoL) measurements to be used in older multimorbid patients. An ideal QoL measurement should be reliable, valid, subjective, multidimensional, feasible and generic. We hypothesised that the QoL-AD (Quality of Life in Alzheimer's Disease) scale could have these properties. Our aim was to determine the psychometric properties and clinical correlations of QoL-AD in a population of elderly, multimorbid medical inpatients. METHODS: QoL-AD was performed in 200 medical inpatients, and available caregivers. Reliability was determined using cronbach's alpha and corrected item-total correlations. The agreement between patient and proxy ratings were examined using intra-class correlations (ICC). Correlations between QoL-AD and demographic data, comorbidity, cognitive tests, ADL (activities of daily living) and depression were examined. To characterise the underlying constructs of QoL-AD, an exploratory factor analysis was performed. RESULTS: In total, 199 patients fulfilled the QoL-AD rating, with 139 proxy ratings. Cronbach's alpha (95 % CI) was 0.74 (0.68-0.79) for patients and 0.86 (0.83-0.90) for proxies. Patient-proxy ICC (95 % CI) was 0.31 (0.16-0.46). Lower QoL was correlated to depression, cognitive impairment, ADL impairment and solitary living, but not with comorbidity. The factor analysis gave a three-factor solution, with factors representing phsyical, social and psychological well-being. CONCLUSION: The QoL-AD scale showed some promising properties but more research is needed before it can be recommended in this setting. If replicated, the finding that cognitive impairment, depression and ADL impairment were more associated with lower QoL than somatic comorbidity could have clinical implications for further studies aiming to improve QoL in this population.
27301161	The Impact of Alzheimer's Disease in an Aging Rural Population.	West Virginia already has a large elderly population, and it is expected to increase along with the elderly population of the nation as a whole. Since the most important risk factor for Alzheimer's disease is older age, it is not surprising that the prevalence of Alzheimer's disease is projected to increase significantly over the next thirty-five years. This paper discusses the prevalence of Alzheimer's disease in West Virginia, programs available to assist people and caregivers affected by the disease, and the associated economic burden of the disease.
27299428	Need for palliative care for neurological diseases.	The new concept of palliative care supports the idea of palliation as an early approach to patients affected by disabling and life-limiting disease which focuses on the patient's quality of life along the entire course of disease. This model moves beyond the traditional concept of palliation as an approach restricted to the final stage of disease and widens the fields of intervention. There is a growing awareness of the importance of palliative care not only in oncological diseases but also in many other branches of medicine, and it appears particularly evident in the approach to many of the most frequent neurological diseases that are chronic, incurable and autonomy-impairing illnesses. The definition and implementation of palliative goals and procedures in neurology must take into account the specific features of these conditions in terms of the complexity and variability of symptoms, clinical course, disability and prognosis. The realization of an effective palliative approach to neurological diseases requires specific skills and expertise to adapt the concept of palliation to the peculiarities of these diseases; this approach should be realized through the cooperation of different services and the action of a multidisciplinary team in which the neurologist should play a central role to identify and face the patient's needs. In this view, it is paramount for the neurologist to be trained in these issues to promote the integration of palliative care in the care of neurological patients.
27294953	Challenges in Analyzing the Biological Effects of Resveratrol.	The suggested health effects (e.g., disease prevention) of dietary bioactive compounds such as resveratrol are challenging to prove in comparison to man-made drugs developed for therapeutic purposes. Dietary bioactive compounds have multiple cellular targets and therefore have a variety of biological effects. Extrapolating the biological effects of dietary compounds from in vitro and in vivo animal experiments to humans may lead to over- or under-estimation of the effect and role of these compounds. The present paper will discuss a few of these challenges and suggest directions for future research. Questions we address include: (1) Is the combinatorial effect of resveratrol and other compounds real? (2) What are the real and relevant doses of resveratrol after administration? and (3) Is it possible to estimate the preventive effect of resveratrol by clinical trials using standard experimental designs? The examples concerning resveratrol taken from the scientific literature are mainly from 2010 and later. The challenges pointed out in this review are similar to most naturally occurring bioactive compounds.
27294919	Flavonoids as Cytokine Modulators: A Possible Therapy for Inflammation-Related Diseases.	High levels of cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-1beta, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and IL-6, are associated with chronic diseases like rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, atherosclerosis, Alzheimer's disease and cancer; therefore cytokine inhibition might be an important target for the treatment of these diseases. Most drugs used to alleviate some inflammation-related symptoms act by inhibiting cyclooxygenases activity or by blocking cytokine receptors. Nevertheless, these drugs have secondary effects when used on a long-term basis. It has been mentioned that flavonoids, namely quercetin, apigenin and luteolin, reduce cytokine expression and secretion. In this regard, flavonoids may have therapeutical potential in the treatment of inflammation-related diseases as cytokine modulators. This review is focused on current research about the effect of flavonoids on cytokine modulation and the description of the way these compounds exert their effect.
27294268	Self-reported and informant-reported memory functioning and awareness in patients with mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer s disease.	BACKGROUND: Awareness of subjective memory is an important factor for adequate treatment of patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study served to find out whether awareness of subjective memory complies with objective performance, if differences in awareness are observed longitudinally and whether decrease of awareness can serve as a predictor of AD in MCI patients. METHODS: Thirty-four patients with MCI seeking help in a memory outpatient clinic were included. All participants underwent thorough neuropsychological examination. Awareness of subjective memory was obtained by calculating difference scores between patient and informant ratings on a 16-item questionnaire concerning complaints about loss of memory in every-day life. Retesting was performed after a mean follow-up period of 24 months. RESULTS: Whole group analyses showed that awareness remained relatively stable across time. Self-reported memory complaints correlated with episodic memory at baseline and with performance on a language task at follow-up. Retests displayed decrease of awareness. At group level differences in awareness between both times of assessment were not significant for MCI and MCI patients converting to mild AD at follow-up. The predictive value of awareness was low. CONCLUSIONS: Awareness of subjective memory deficit is linked to episodic memory function and decreases with decline of cognitive ability. Further studies evaluating predictive power of awareness of subjective memory should include a larger patient sample.
27294139	Deposition of BACE-1 Protein in the Brains of APP/PS1 Double Transgenic Mice.	The main causes of Alzheimer's disease remain elusive. Previous data have implicated the BACE-1 protein as a central player in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. However, many inhibitors of BACE-1 have failed during preclinical and clinical trials for AD treatment. Therefore, uncovering the exact role of BACE-1 in AD may have significant impact on the future development of therapeutic agents. Three- and six-month-old female APP/PS1 double transgenic mice were used to study abnormal accumulation of BACE-1 protein in brains of mice here. Immunofluorescence, immunohistochemistry, and western blot were performed to measure the distributing pattern and expression level of BACE-1. We found obvious BACE-1 protein accumulation in 3-month-old APP/PS1 mice, which had increased by the time of 6 months. Coimmunostaining results showed BACE-1 surrounded amyloid plaques in brain sections. The abnormal protein expression might not be attributable to the upregulation of BACE-1 protein, as no significant difference of protein expression was observed between wild-type and APP/PS1 mice. With antibodies against BACE-1 and CD31, we found a high immunoreactive density of BACE-1 protein on the outer layer of brain blood vessels. The aberrant distribution of BACE-1 in APP/PS1 mice suggests BACE-1 may be involved in the microvascular abnormality of AD.
27293189	Restricted Location of PSEN2/gamma-Secretase Determines Substrate Specificity and Generates an Intracellular Abeta Pool.	gamma-Secretases are a family of intramembrane-cleaving proteases involved in various signaling pathways and diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Cells co-express differing gamma-secretase complexes, including two homologous presenilins (PSENs). We examined the significance of this heterogeneity and identified a unique motif in PSEN2 that directs this gamma-secretase to late endosomes/lysosomes via a phosphorylation-dependent interaction with the AP-1 adaptor complex. Accordingly, PSEN2 selectively cleaves late endosomal/lysosomal localized substrates and generates the prominent pool of intracellular Abeta that contains longer Abeta; familial AD (FAD)-associated mutations in PSEN2 increased the levels of longer Abeta further. Moreover, a subset of FAD mutants in PSEN1, normally more broadly distributed in the cell, phenocopies PSEN2 and shifts its localization to late endosomes/lysosomes. Thus, localization of gamma-secretases determines substrate specificity, while FAD-causing mutations strongly enhance accumulation of aggregation-prone Abeta42 in intracellular acidic compartments. The findings reveal potentially important roles for specific intracellular, localized reactions contributing to AD pathogenesis.
27293063	DatSCAN In Differential Diagnostics of Lewy Body Disease.	Differential diagnosis between Lewy body disease and Alzheimer s disease might be difficult because of similarities of clinical symptoms in both neurodegenerative diseases. DatSCAN is a modern functional neuroimmaging method which differentiates between this similar diseases and helps in correct treatment strategy. We report our positive experience with DatSCAN in differentiating Lewy body disease from Alzheimer s disease. This is a case report of a woman with Lewy body disease, initially diagnosed as Alzheimer s disease. DatSCAN neuroimmaging method was used in differential diagnosis of dementia. Memory impairment, impaired activities of daily living, sleep and behavioral disturbances were present in our case. Donepezil was well tolerated, but haloperidol administration was followed by development of severe dystonia. DatSCAN showed deficient dopaminergic presynaptic transport in substantia nigra and striatum. This finding is typical for Lewy body disease not for Alzheimer s disease. DatSCAN neuroimmaging is a suitable method for differentiating Lewy body disease from Alzheimer s disease. Deficient dopaminergic presynaptic transport in substantia nigra and striatum is typical for Lewy body disease.
27290706	[Comparison of naming impairment among patients with Parkinson's disease without dementia, Parkinson's disease dementia and Alzheimer's disease].	OBJECTIVE: To compare the characteristics of naming impairment in Parkinson's disease (PD) without dementia, Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHODS: All participants came from outpatient clinic or inpatients of our hospital during 2011-2013. Object and action naming tests were evaluated among patients with PD without dementia (n=60), PDD (n=60), AD (n=60) and healthy control group (n=60). RESULTS: The object naming score of PD without dementia group was 40.2+/-2.8, PDD group was 36.0+/-3.1, AD group was 31.6+/-4.0 and healthy control group was 44.1+/-2.2, while the action naming score of PD without dementia group was 27.3+/-2.6, PDD group was 20.5+/-4.0, AD group was 22.5+/-2.7 and healthy control group was 31.6+/-1.4. The object and action naming were both impaired in PD without dementia, PDD and AD patients compared with healthy control group (P<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: PD patients without dementia have slight object and action naming impairments with more impairments in action naming. Action naming is more impaired in PDD patients, while object naming is more impaired in AD patients.
27288938	Tip-loaded dissolving microneedles for transdermal delivery of donepezil hydrochloride for treatment of Alzheimer's disease.	Donepezil hydrochloride (DPH) is often used in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. A new treatment method was developed by encapsulating high DPH content in the tips of dissolving microneedles for rapid, transdermal delivery of a predetermined dose of DPH. The microneedles were prepared by a micromolding method using a hydroxy-propyl-methyl-cellulose (HPMC)-ethanol/water mixture (80:20, v/v) for the tips and carboxy-methyl cellulose (CMC)-water for the base of the needles. The micromolding method involved centrifuging a DPH-HPMC-ethanol/water mixture at 10 degrees C to obtain tips with sufficient mechanical strength. To test their mechanical strength, microneedles with different DPH content were inserted into porcine skin. Then the amount of DPH encapsulated in the microneedles was measured using high-performance liquid chromatography. The efficiency of administering DPH tip-loaded microneedles was investigated using four administrations of a pharmacokinetic test: (1) two oral administration groups (283mug/kg and 692mug/kg) and (2) two microneedle administration groups (283mug/kg and 692mug/kg). High DPH content (up to 78%, w/w) was encapsulated in the microneedle tips without serious loss of mechanical strength by using a mixture of hydroxy-propyl-methyl-cellulose (HPMC) and ethanol/water mixture (80:20, v/v). Because of the distribution of DPH in the tips, 95% of the DPH was delivered into porcine skin after 5min of insertion. As measured by Cmax and AUC, transdermal delivery of DPH tip-loaded microneedles was more effective compared to oral administration of the same dose of DPH. Transdermal delivery could replace oral administration of DPH.
27288815	Self-reported physical activity in essential tremor: Relationship with tremor, balance, and cognitive function.	BACKGROUND: Physical inactivity may be the result of medical comorbidities. Inactivity itself may also lead to important health consequences, especially in older patients. Essential tremor (ET) patients may have a variety of physical and cognitive problems that could detrimentally impact on level of physical activity. Yet, to our knowledge, there have been no studies of physical activity in these patients. METHODS: Self-reported physical activity was assessed using the Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly (PASE) in 100 ET cases (mean age 80.5years) enrolled in a clinical study. Additional clinical measures were the total tremor score, Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA) score and number of steps taken off of the straight line during tandem gait (a measure of balance). RESULTS: Lower PASE score was associated with older age, more tandem gait difficulty, higher total tremor score and lower MOCA score (all p<0.05). In a linear regression model that included total tremor score, MOCA score, number of steps off of the straight line during tandem gait, and age, higher total tremor score (p=0.046) and more steps off of the straight line during tandem gait (p=0.014) were independently associated with reductions in physical activity. CONCLUSIONS: Several of the motor features of ET (tremor and imbalance) are independently associated with reductions in level of physical activity.
27288798	The incidence of post-mortem neurodegenerative and cerebrovascular pathology in mixed dementia.	BACKGROUND: The clinical picture of dementia in most aged patients is due to a combination of different neurodegenerative processes and frequently associated to cerebrovascular lesions. They are called mixed dementia (MixD) cases, to be differentiated from those with pure vascular dementia (VaD) and those with Alzheimer's dementia (AD). The present study compares the frequency of different associated lesions in these disease groups. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Out of a series of 252 autopsied patients 36 with MixD, 20 with VaD and 64 with AD disease were compared concerning the frequency of the associated lesions. Small cerebrovascular lesions were evaluated on a large coronal section of a cerebral hemisphere. Mean values of frequency and severity were compared between the 3 groups. RESULTS: Of the 120 examined brains 30% were classified as MixD, 17% as VaD and 53% as AD. In 20% of the AD patients Lewy body pathology (LBP) was observed with a low incidence of cerebrovascular lesions, except for cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). The MixD patients had more severe CAA and were significantly older than those with VaD and AD. Lacunar infarcts, on the other hand, were significantly more frequent in the VaD patients. DISCUSSION: The most responsible vascular lesions in MixD and VaD are different. There is an inverse correlation between the presence of LBP and vascular pathology. MixD has to be considered as the end stage of AD.
27288790	Upstream regulators and downstream effectors of NF-kappaB in Alzheimer's disease.	Since Alzheimer's disease (AD) is becoming the prevalent dementia in the whole world, more underlying mechanisms are emerging. Long time has the transcription factor NF-kappaB been identified to participate in AD pathogenesis, various studies have focused on the causes and effects of AD that are linked to NF-kappaB. In this review we discuss diverse environmental stimuli including oxidative stress, neuroinflammation and metabolism, involved signaling pathways such as PI3K/AKT, MAPK and AGE/RAGE/GSK-3 and newly found ncRNAs that mediate neuron toxicity or neuron protection through NF-kappaB activation and the following response associated with the same factors in AD. These may provide future orientation of investigation at transcription level and support efficient treatment to AD by a better understanding of the upstream regulators and downstream effectors of NF-kappaB.
27288741	The role of magnetic resonance imaging in the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease: a review.	Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease after Alzheimer's in elderly people. Different structural and functional neuroimaging methods play a great role in the early diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases. This review discusses the role of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the diagnosis of PD. MRI provides clinicians with structural and functional information of human brain noninvasively. Advanced quantitative MRI techniques have shown promise for detecting pathological changes related to different stages of PD. Collectively, advanced MRI techniques at high and ultrahigh magnetic fields aid in better understanding of the nature and progression of PD.
27287230	Comprehensive promoter level expression quantitative trait loci analysis of the human frontal lobe.	BACKGROUND: Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analysis is a powerful method to detect correlations between gene expression and genomic variants and is widely used to interpret the biological mechanism underlying identified genome wide association studies (GWAS) risk loci. Numerous eQTL studies have been performed on different cell types and tissues of which the majority has been based on microarray technology. METHODS: We present here an eQTL analysis based on cap analysis gene expression sequencing (CAGEseq) data created from human postmortem frontal lobe tissue combined with genotypes obtained through genotyping arrays, exome sequencing, and CAGEseq. Using CAGEseq as an expression profiling technique combined with these different genotyping techniques allows measurement of the molecular effect of variants on individual transcription start sites and increases the resolution of eQTL analysis by also including the non-annotated parts of the genome. RESULTS: We identified 2410 eQTLs and show that non-coding transcripts are more likely to contain an eQTL than coding transcripts, in particular antisense transcripts. We provide evidence for how previously identified GWAS loci for schizophrenia (NRGN), Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease (PARK16 and MAPT loci) could increase the risk for disease at a molecular level. Furthermore, we demonstrate that CAGEseq improves eQTL analysis because variants obtained from CAGEseq are highly enriched for having a functional effect and thus are an efficient method towards the identification of causal variants. CONCLUSION: Our data contain both coding and non-coding transcripts and has the added value that we have identified eQTLs for variants directly adjacent to TSS. Future eQTL studies would benefit from combining CAGEseq with RNA sequencing for a more complete interpretation of the transcriptome and increased understanding of eQTL signals.
27283588	The central role of heat shock factor 1 in synaptic fidelity and memory consolidation.	Networks of neuronal synapses are the fundamental basis for making and retaining memory. Reduced synapse number and quality correlates with loss of memory in dementia. Heat shock factor 1 (HSF1), the major transcription factor regulating expression of heat shock genes, plays a central role in proteostasis, in establishing and sustaining synaptic fidelity and function, and in memory consolidation. Support for this thesis is based on these observations: (1) heat shock induces improvements in synapse integrity and memory consolidation; (2) synaptic depolarization activates HSF1; (3) activation of HSF1 alone (independent of the canonical heat shock response) augments formation of essential synaptic elements-neuroligands, vesicle transport, synaptic scaffolding proteins, lipid rafts, synaptic spines, and axodendritic synapses; (4) HSF1 coalesces and activates memory receptors in the post-synaptic dendritic spine; (5) huntingtin or alpha-synuclein accumulation lowers HSF1 while HSF1 lowers huntingtin and alpha-synuclein aggregation-a potential vicious cycle; and (6) HSF1 agonists (including physical activity) can improve cognitive function in dementia models. Thus, via direct gene expression of synaptic elements, production of HSPs that assure high protein fidelity, and activation of other neuroprotective signaling pathways, HSF1 agonists could provide breakthrough therapy for dementia-associated disease.
27281130	Myeloperoxidase as a Target for the Treatment of Inflammatory Syndromes: Mechanisms and Structure Activity Relationships of Inhibitors.	Inflammation is an initial response of the body to a harmful stimuli and it is achieved by the increased movement of leukocytes (especially granulocytes) from blood into injured tissues. It is required for healing wounds and infections. Despite their indispensable role in microbial killing, the inflammation reactions may also cause diseases to a host such as hay fever, atherosclerosis, and rheumatoid arthritis. The enzymes and oxidizing species released during the inflammatory process can cause damages to the host tissues which lead to inflammatory syndromes. The role of myeloperoxidase (MPO) in the inflammatory reactions is well documented. It contributes in killing the pathogens but it is also implicated in several inflammatory syndromes such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease and atherosclerosis. Thus, this enzyme has attracted more attention of the scientists and it has become a target for drug designing. In the last decade, several reversible and irreversible MPO inhibitors were identified as very high potent inhibitors such as fluoroalkylindole, aromatic hydroxamic acid, thioxanthine and benzoic acid hydrazide derivatives. In this review, we tried to illustrate the MPO inhibitors and highlight their structure activity relationship (SAR). In this paper we also discussed the mechanism of the inhibitory effect of the most potent compounds.
27277332	Upregulation of microRNA-206 enhances lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammation and release of amyloid-beta by targeting insulin-like growth factor 1 in microglia.	Activated microglia are capable of facilitating amyloid-beta (Abeta) accumulation via the release of inflammatory factors, thus resulting in the exacerbation of Alzheimer's disease (AD). MicroRNAs (miRs) participate in the activation of microglia, which is associated with AD. Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) is a neuroprotective, anti-inflammatory factor, which is able to accelerate clearance of Abeta peptides. The present study aimed to investigate the precise role of miR206 and IGF1 in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)induced microglial inflammation. The expression levels of miR206 and IGF1 were detected in 60 peripheral blood samples from patients with AD and matched age subjects using quantitative polymerase chain reaction. A dual luciferase reporter gene assay was used to indicate the relationship between miR206 and IGF1. In addition, the role of miR206 was determined by gain and loss of function experiments in LPStreated microglia. The results demonstrated that miR206 upregulation enhanced LPSinduced inflammation and Abeta release in microglia by directly targeting the 3'-untranslated region of IGF1. These effects were attenuated following treatment with exogenous IGF1, thus indicating that the miR206/IGF1 signaling pathway may be considered a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of ADassociated microglial inflammation.
27276723	[Brain imaging of Alzheimer' disease: state of the art and perspectives for clinicians].	To improve the clinical detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD) new diagnostic criteria have been proposed, based on biomarkers of synaptic dysfunction, AD-related neurodegeneration, and Abeta cerebral amyloidosis. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and position emission tomography (PET) neuroimaging can be configured as powerful means for the detection of medial-temporal atrophy, reduced uptake of 18F-FDG PET or and increased retention of Abeta amyloid protein by amyloid-PET. In this review, we will discuss these promising techniques that allow assessing in vivo AD pathology and help clinicians to better diagnose and follow-up patients, particularly in clinical trials using disease-modifying treatments.
27276722	[Cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease in current clinical practice].	The cerebrospinal fluid levels of amyloid beta 1-42 (Abeta1-42), total tau and tau phosphorylated at threonine 181 (ptau181) are well established biomarkers of cerebral amyloid pathology and tau related neurodegeneration, two hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease. These biomarkers can help to improve diagnostic accuracy and consequent decisions on counseling, support, and therapy of patients with mild cognitive impairment and dementia. The use of biomarkers is part of the proposed new criteria of AD diagnosis. It may be particularly helpful in cases of atypical clinical presentation and uncertain diagnosis, and if an important benefit for the patient is expected. The ongoing development of new biomarkers based on less or non-invasive procedures will allow for a larger use of biomarkers to improve the diagnosis of cognitive impairment.
27276720	[Dementia with motor and language disorders].	Memory is not the only core diagnostic criteria in Alzheimer's disease and many dementias are characterized by other cognitive deficits. Moreover dementias are often associated with multiple and complex motor signs. The first part of this reviewcovers parkinsonism in diffuse Lewy Body Disease and other neurodegenerative diseases, corticobasal syndrome, or motor deficit in the motoneurone disease-frontotemporal dementia spectrum. In the second part, primary progressive aphasia and its three variants including basic clinical evaluation are described. These complex clinical syndromes involving motor and language systems are important for the clinical practice since they are part of diagnostic criteria of several neurodegenerative diseases and can be considered as phenotypical markers of neurodegeneration.
27274990	Tanshinone IIA Alleviates the AD Phenotypes in APP and PS1 Transgenic Mice.	Therapeutic approach for Alzheimer's disease (AD) is still deficient. To find active compounds from herbal medicine is of interest in the alleviation of AD symptoms. This study aimed to investigate the protective effects of Tanshinone IIA (TIIA) on memory performance and synaptic plasticity in a transgenic AD model at the early phase. 25-100 mg/kg TIIA (intraperitoneal injection, i.p.) was administered to the six-month-old APP and PS1 transgenic mice for 30 consecutive days. After treatment, spatial memory, synaptic plasticity, and related mechanisms were investigated. Our result showed that memory impairment in AD mice was mitigated by 50 and 100 mg/kg TIIA treatments. Hippocampal long-term potentiation was impaired in AD model but rescued by 100 mg/kg TIIA treatment. Mechanically, TIIA treatment reduced the accumulations of beta-amyloid 1-42, C-terminal fragments (CTFs), and p-Tau in the AD model. TIIA did not affect basal BDNF but promoted depolarization-induced BDNF synthesis in the AD mice. Taken together, TIIA repairs hippocampal LTP and memory, likely, through facilitating the clearance of AD-related proteins and activating synaptic BDNF synthesis. TIIA might be a candidate drug for AD treatment.
27274215	Genes associated with Alzheimer's disease: an overview and current status.	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive, neurodegenerative disease and the most common form of dementia in elderly people. It is an emerging public health problem that poses a huge societal burden. Linkage analysis was the first milestone in unraveling the mutations in APP, PSEN1, and PSEN2 that cause early-onset AD, followed by the discovery of apolipoprotein E-epsilon4 allele as the only one genetic risk factor for late-onset AD. Genome-wide association studies have revolutionized genetic research and have identified over 20 genetic loci associated with late-onset AD. Recently, next-generation sequencing technologies have enabled the identification of rare disease variants, including unmasking small mutations with intermediate risk of AD in PLD3, TREM2, UNC5C, AKAP9, and ADAM10. This review provides an overview of the genetic basis of AD and the relationship between these risk genes and the neuropathologic features of AD. An understanding of genetic mechanisms underlying AD pathogenesis and the potentially implicated pathways will lead to the development of novel treatment for this devastating disease.
27272473	Improving Memory and Cognition in Individuals with Down Syndrome.	Down syndrome (DS), often due to trisomy 21, is the most common genetic cause of intellectual disability (ID). In addition, virtually all individuals with DS develop the neuropathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) by the age of 40 years and almost 60 % will manifest symptoms of AD dementia by the age of 65 years. Currently, there are no pharmacological treatments available for ID in individuals with DS and only limited symptomatic treatments for AD dementia. Advances in our understanding in both the molecular basis of ID and the pathogenesis of AD have created opportunities to study potential therapeutic targets. Recent studies in animal models of DS continue to provide a rational basis for translating specific compounds into human clinical trials. However, target and compound selection are only initial steps in the drug development pathway. Other necessary considerations include appropriate study designs to assess efficacy in the DS population, as well as operational aspects specifically tailored to assess cognition in this population. We discuss recent progress in the development of compounds for both ID and AD in individuals with DS, as well as concepts for the design and conduct of clinical trials with such compounds.
27272392	Polymorphisms of CHAT but not TFAM or VR22 are Associated with Alzheimer Disease Risk.	BACKGROUND Alzheimer disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disease that is one of the most prevalent health problems among seniors. The cause of AD has not yet been elucidated, but many risk factors have been identified that might contribute to the pathogenesis and prognosis of AD. We conducted a meta-analysis of studies involving CHAT, TFAM, and VR22 polymorphisms and AD susceptibility to further understand the pathogenesis of AD. MATERIAL AND METHODS PubMed/Medline, Embase, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar were searched for relevant articles. Rs1880676, rs2177369, rs3810950, and rs868750 of CHAT; rs1937 and rs2306604 of TFAM; and rs10997691 and rs7070570 of VR22 are studied in this meta-analysis. RESULTS A total of 51 case-control studies with 16 446 cases and 16 057 controls were enrolled. For CHAT, rs2177369 (G>A) in whites and rs3810950 (G>A) in Asians were found to be associated with AD susceptibility. No association was detected between rs1880676 and rs868750 and AD risk. For TFAM and VR22, no significant association was detected in studied single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). CONCLUSIONS Rs2177369 and rs3810950 of CHAT are associated with AD susceptibility, but rs1880676 and rs868750 are not. Rs1937 and rs2306604 of TFAM, and rs10997691 and rs7070570 of VR22 are not significantly associated with AD risk.
27267007	New cinnamic - N-benzylpiperidine and cinnamic - N,N-dibenzyl(N-methyl)amine hybrids as Alzheimer-directed multitarget drugs with antioxidant, cholinergic, neuroprotective and neurogenic properties.	Here we describe new families of multi-target directed ligands obtained by linking antioxidant cinnamic-related structures with N-benzylpiperidine (NBP) or N,N-dibenzyl(N-methyl)amine (DBMA) fragments. Resulting hybrids, in addition to their antioxidant and neuroprotective properties against mitochondrial oxidative stress, are active at relevant molecular targets in Alzheimer's disease, such as cholinesterases (hAChE and hBuChE) and monoamine oxidases (hMAO-A and hMAO-B). Hybrids derived from umbellic - NBP (8), caffeic - NBP (9), and ferulic - DBMA (12) displayed balanced biological profiles, with IC50s in the low-micromolar and submicromolar range for hChEs and hMAOs, and an antioxidant potency comparable to vitamin E. Moreover, the caffeic - NBP hybrid 9 is able to improve the differentiation of adult SGZ-derived neural stem cells into a neuronal phenotype in vitro.
27266998	Design, synthesis, and pharmacological evaluation of multitarget-directed ligands with both serotonergic subtype 4 receptor (5-HT4R) partial agonist and 5-HT6R antagonist activities, as potential treatment of Alzheimer's disease.	5-HT4 receptor (5-HT4R) activation and blockade of the 5-HT6 receptor (5-HT6R) are known to enhance the release of numerous neurotransmitters whose depletion is implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Furthermore, 5-HT4R agonists seem to favor production of the neurotrophic soluble amyloid protein precursor alpha (sAPPalpha). Consequently, combining 5-HT4R agonist/5-HT6R antagonist activities in a single chemical compound would constitute a novel approach able to display both a symptomatic and disease-modifying effect in AD. Seventeen novel derivatives of RS67333 (1) were synthesized and evaluated as potential dual-target compounds. Among them, four agents showed nanomolar and submicromolar affinities toward 5-HT4R and 5-HT6R, respectively; one of them, 7m, was selected on the basis of its in vitro affinity (Ki5-HT4R = 5.3 nM, Ki5-HT6R = 219 nM) for further in vivo experiments, where 7m showed an antiamnesic effect in the mouse at 1 mg/kg ip.
27264813	[Mutation analysis of presenilin 1 gene in a Chinese family affected with early-onset familial Alzheimer's disease].	OBJECTIVE: To explore the clinical phenotype and genotype in a Chinese family affected with early-onset familial Alzheimer's disease (EOFAD). METHODS: Potential mutation of beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP) gene, presenilin 1 (PSEN1) gene and apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene was detected with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and direct sequencing. RESULTS: Homozygous APOE epsilon 2 allele and no gene mutation of APP gene were detected in the proband (III1). A 488A>G mutation (His163Arg) of the PSEN1 gene was found in the proband and other 4 family members (IV1, IV12, IV21, V2). CONCLUSION: A mutation (c.488A>G, p.His163Arg) of PSEN1 gene was found in a Chinese family affected with EOFAD.
27263933	High tau levels in cerebrospinal fluid predict nursing home placement and rapid progression in Alzheimer's disease.	BACKGROUND: Increased concentrations of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) total tau (t-tau) and phosphorylated tau, as well as decreased amyloid-beta 42 peptide, are biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology, but few studies have shown an association with AD progression rate. We hypothesized that high CSF tau, as a marker of ongoing neurodegeneration, would predict a more aggressive course of AD, using time to nursing home placement (NHP) as the main outcome. METHODS: Our sample inlcuded 234 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to AD (n = 134) or mild to moderate AD (n = 100) who underwent lumbar puncture at a memory clinic and were followed for 2-11 years (median 4.9 years). RESULTS: Individuals with CSF t-tau in the highest quartile (>/=900 ng/L) had a higher ratio of NHP, both in the total cohort and in patients with MCI only (adjusted HR 2.17 [95% CI 1.24-3.80]; HR 2.37 [95% CI 1.10-5.09], respectively), than the lowest quartile. The association between high t-tau levels and future steep deterioration was confirmed in analyses with conversion to moderate dementia (HR 1.66; 95% CI 1.08-2.56), rapid decline in Mini Mental State Examination score (>/=4-point drop/12 months), and dying in severe dementia as outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first study to show that high CSF t-tau levels predict early NHP and conversion to moderate dementia in an AD cohort. Selecting patients with high CSF t-tau, indicating more aggressive neurodegeneration and steeper decline, for AD immunotherapy trials might increase the possibility of showing contrast between active treatment and placebo.
27262702	Amyloid- and FDG-PET imaging in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.	PURPOSE: We aimed to study brain metabolism and presence of beta-amyloid deposits using positron emission tomography (PET) in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). METHODS: This prospective cross-sectional study included 18 patients with definite or probable ALS according to the revised El Escorial diagnostic criteria, and 24 healthy controls. Patients underwent neurological and neuropsychological assessments, PET with (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), and amyloid-PET with (18)F-florbetaben. RESULTS: Patients with ALS showed hypometabolism in the frontal area and hypermetabolism in the cerebellum compared to healthy controls. Four patients (22 %) displayed cognitive impairment and decreased metabolism in the frontal area extending bilaterally to the parietal regions, and increased metabolism in the posterior area of the cerebellum. In patients with no cognitive impairment, metabolism was lower in the left superior frontal gyrus and higher in the anterior and posterior lobes of the cerebellum. In the individual analysis, six patients (35 %) displayed more anterior involvement with hypometabolism affecting the superior frontal, medial, and inferior gyri; six patients (35 %) exhibited a more posterior pattern with hypometabolism in the precentral and postcentral gyri and in the superior and inferior parietal lobules; two patients (11 %) showed a mixed pattern; and three patients (17 %) showed no alterations in brain metabolism. Three (16 %) showed increased (18)F-florbetaben uptake compared to controls. CONCLUSIONS: We have identified two main patterns of brain metabolism with an association to cognitive status. Only a subgroup of patients showed an increased uptake of the amyloid tracer. Our results suggest that ALS is heterogeneous from a clinical, metabolic, and molecular standpoint.
27260328	Dysexecutive syndrome in amnesic mild cognitive impairment: a multicenter study.	BACKGROUND: Executive functions (EF) in Alzheimer's disease (AD), classically related to the prefrontal cortex, have been forgotten in mild stages, given more importance to temporal lobe associated disorders, such as memory. The study of disexecutive syndrome (DS) has been relegated to advanced stages of the disease. Our goal is to demonstrate that EF are already present in amnesic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI). Furthermore, we are interested in knowing whether poor scores in EF tests are related to the progression to AD or another kind of dementia. METHODS: We studied patients with aMCI (n = 81) and healthy controls (n = 142) from neurological departments of several centers of Basque Country with a cross-sectional design. Patients underwent a complete neuropsychological evaluation, neuroimaging testing APOE genotype and 3 year of prospective follow-up. RESULTS: In the first visit, patients with aMCI showed more alterations in tests that evaluate EF such as Stroop, trail-making and categorical verbal fluency. More alterations were also found in NPI scale (P <0.05). Stroop and Trail-Making test were not associated with the future development of AD, but fluency (p = 0.01) and apathy (p = 0.031) did. No patient developed a different kind of dementia different from AD. CONCLUSIONS: DS is a broad concept not confined to frontal lobes, and can be found in early stages of aMCI. DS impacts negatively on patient autonomy and may have prognostic value.
27260250	Autophagy and Alzheimer's Disease.	Autophagy is an essential degradation pathway in clearing abnormal protein aggregates in mammalian cells and is responsible for protein homeostasis and neuronal health. Several studies have shown that autophagy deficits occurred in early stage of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Autophagy plays an important role in generation and metabolism of beta-amyloid (Abeta), assembling of tau and thus its malfunction may lead to the progress of AD. By considering the above evidences, autophagy may be a new target in developing drugs for AD. So far, a number of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)-dependent and independent autophagy modulators have been identified to have positive effects in AD treatment. In this review, we summarized the latest progress supporting the role for autophagy deficits in AD and the potential therapeutic effects of autophagy modulators in AD.
27259128	Improving Management of Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia in Acute Care: Evidence and Lessons Learned From Across the Care Spectrum.	As the prevalence of Alzheimer disease and related dementias increases, dementia-related behavioral symptoms present growing threats to care quality and safety of older adults across care settings. Behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) such as agitation, aggression, and resistance to care occur in nearly all individuals over the course of their illness. In inpatient care settings, if not appropriately treated, BPSD can result in care complications, increased length of stay, dissatisfaction with care, and caregiver stress and injury. Although evidence-based, nonpharmacological approaches to treating BPSD exist, their implementation into acute care has been thwarted by limited nursing staff expertise in behavioral health, and a lack of consistent approaches to integrate behavioral health expertise into medically focused inpatient care settings. This article describes the core components of one evidence-based approach to integrating behavioral health expertise into dementia care. This approach, called STAR-VA, was implemented in Veterans' Health Administration community living centers (nursing homes). It has demonstrated effectiveness in reducing the severity and frequency of BPSD, while improving staff knowledge and skills in caring for people with dementia. The potential for adapting this approach in acute care settings is discussed, along with key lessons learned regarding opportunities for nursing leadership to ensure consistent implementation and sustainability.
27258307	Salvianolic Acid B Inhibits Abeta Generation by Modulating BACE1 Activity in SH-SY5Y-APPsw Cells.	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease in humans. The accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of AD. Previous studies indicated that Salvianolic acid B (SalB) could ameliorate Abeta-induced memory impairment. However, whether SalB could influence the generation of Abeta is unclear. Here, we show that SalB (25, 50, or 100 microM) reduces the generation of Abeta40 and Abeta42 in culture media by decreasing the protein expressions of BACE1 and sAPPbeta in SH-SY5Y-APPsw cells. Meanwhile, SalB increases the levels of ADAM10 and sAPPalpha in the cells. However, SalB has no impact on the protein expressions of APP and PS1. Moreover, SalB attenuates oxidative stress and inhibits the activity of GSK3beta, which might be related to the suppression of BACE1 expression and amyloidogenesis. Our study suggests that SalB is a promising therapeutic agent for AD by targeting Abeta generation.
27255971	Caffeoylquinic Acid Derivatives Protect SH-SY5Y Neuroblastoma Cells from Hydrogen Peroxide-Induced Injury Through Modulating Oxidative Status.	Oxidative stress has been confirmed as a contribution to the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of many neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. Caffeoylquinic acids (CQAs) are considered to have anti-oxidative stress ability in a previous study, but the structure-activity relationships (SARs) of CQAs in neuroprotective effects are still unclear. In the present study, we primarily expound the SARs of CQAs in counteracting H2O2-induced injury in SH-SY5Y cells. We found that CQAs (1-10) represented the protection of SH-SY5Y cells against H2O2-induced injury in varying degrees and malonyl groups could obviously increase the anti-oxidative stress ability of CQAs. Intensive studies of 4,5-O-dicaffeoyl-1-O-(malic acid methyl ester)-quinic acid (MDCQA) indicated that the mechanisms could potentially involve activation of endogenous antioxidant enzymes and the regulation of the phosphorylation of MAPKs and AKT. In conclusion, MDCQA could serve as a neuroprotective agent with a potential to attenuate oxidative stress.
27255602	RNA Interference Silencing of Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3beta Inhibites Tau Phosphorylation in Mice with Alzheimer Disease.	To explore the effect of glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK-3beta) silencing on Tau-5 phosphorylation in mice suffering Alzheimer disease (AD). GSK-3beta was firstly silenced in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells using special lentivirus (LV) and the content of Tau (A-12), p-Tau (Ser396) and p-Tau (PHF-6) proteins. GSK-3beta was also silenced in APP/PS1 mouse model of AD mice, which were divided into three groups (n = 10): AD, vehicle, and LV group. Ten C57 mice were used as control. The memory ability of mice was tested by square water maze, and the morphological changes of hippocampus and neuron death were analyzed by haematoxylin-eosin staining. Moreover, the levels of Tau and phosphorylated Tau (p-Tau) were detected by western blotting and immunohistochemistry, respectively. The lentivirus-mediated GSK-3beta silencing system was successfully developed and silencing GSK-3beta at the cellular level reduced Tau phosphorylation obviously. Moreover, GSK-3beta silence significantly improved the memory ability of AD mice in LV group compared with AD group (P < 0.05) according to the latency periods and error numbers. As for the hippocampus morphology and neuron death, no significant change was observed between LV group and normal control. Immunohistochemical detection and western blotting revealed that the levels of Tau and p-Tau were significantly down-regulated after GSK-3beta silence. Silencing GSK-3beta may have a positive effect on inhibiting the pathologic progression of AD through down-regulating the level of p-Tau.
27252988	Memantine and donepezil: a fixed drug combination for the treatment of moderate to severe Alzheimer's dementia.	Donepezil (and other cholinesterase inhibitors [ChEIs]) and memantine are the mainstays of treatment in Alzheimer's dementia, addressing respectively, the cholinergic and glutamatergic dysregulation which underlies or results from its pathophysiology. To alleviate the pill burden and swallowing difficulties associated with the condition, a fixed drug combination of extended-release memantine and donepezil was developed. This combination was shown to be both bioequivalent to the components administered separately and could be administered sprinkled over soft food. The mode of action, pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy and safety and tolerability of the combination are discussed together with the wider, often conflicting trial literature of combination versus monotherapy with memantine and ChEIs, their meta-analyses and treatment guidelines.
27252059	Physiological Roles of Ubiquitin Ligases Related to the Endoplasmic Reticulum.	Studies on endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated degradation (ERAD), in which unfolded proteins accumulated in the ER are selectively transported to the cytosol for degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome system, have been focused on molecular mechanisms in yeast. In human, disruption of the ER quality control system causes various diseases, such as neurodegenerative disease, lifestyle disease, and cancer. However, there are many ERAD genes with unknown physiological and pathological functions. We identified the novel ubiquitin ligase HRD1 involved in ERAD. HRD1 is expressed in brain neurons and protects against ER stress-induced apoptosis. In familial Parkinson's disease, accumulation of Parkin-associated endothelin receptor-like receptor (Pael-R), a substrate of ubiquitin ligase Parkin involved in ERAD, causes ER stress and apoptosis. We demonstrated that HRD1 promotes ubiquitination and degradation of Pael-R and suppresses ER stress and apoptosis induced by Pael-R. Amyloid precursor protein (APP) is processed into amyloid beta (Abeta) in Alzheimer's disease. We found that HRD1 promotes APP ubiquitination and degradation, resulting in decreased generation of Abeta. Furthermore, suppression of HRD1 expression causes APP accumulation and Abeta generation associated with ER stress and apoptosis. Interestingly, HRD1 protein levels significantly decreased in the cerebral cortex of Alzheimer's disease patients, possibly because of its insolubilization. We demonstrated that HRD1 protein was insolubilized by oxidative stress, resulting in the accumulation of HRD1 into the aggresome. In conclusion, oxidative stress-induced HRD1 insolubilization might be involved in a vicious cycle of increased Abeta production and Abeta-induced oxidative stress in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis.
27251949	Radiosynthesis and in vivo Evaluation of Carbon-11 (2S)-3-(1H-Indol-3-yl)-2-{[(4-methoxyphenyl)carbamoyl]amino}-N-{[1-(5-methoxypyri din-2-yl)cyclohexyl]methyl}propanamide: An Attempt to Visualize Brain Formyl Peptide Receptors in Mouse Models of Neuroinflammation.	Here, we describe the very first attempt to visualize in vivo formyl peptide receptors (FPRs) in mouse brain by positron emission tomography (PET). FPRs are expressed in microglial cells where they mediate chemotactic activity of beta-amyloid peptide in Alzheimer disease and, thus, are involved in neuroinflammatory processes. To this purpose, we have selected (2S)-3-(1H-Indol-3-yl)-2-{[(4-methoxyphenyl)carbamoyl]amino}-N-{[1-(5-methoxypyri din-2-yl)cyclohexyl]methyl}propanamide ((S)-1), that we have previously identified as a potent non-peptidic FPR agonist. (S)-[(11) C]-1 has been prepared in high radiochemical yield. (S)-[(11) C]-1 showed very low penetration of blood-brain barrier and, thus, was unable to accumulate into the brain. In addition, (S)-[(11) C]-1 was not able to label FPRs receptors in brain slices of PS19 and APP23 mice, two animal models of Alzheimer disease. Although (S)-[(11) C]-1 was not suitable to visualize FPRs in the brain, this study provides useful information for the design and characterization of future potential PET radioligands for visualization of brain FPRs by PET.
27251914	Drug treatments in Alzheimer's disease.	Despite the significant public health issue that it poses, only five medical treatments have been approved for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and these act to control symptoms rather than alter the course of the disease. Studies of potential disease-modifying therapy have generally been undertaken in patients with clinically detectable disease, yet evidence suggests that the pathological changes associated with AD begin several years before this. It is possible that pharmacological therapy may be beneficial in this pre-clinical stage before the neurodegenerative process is established. Techniques providing earlier diagnosis, such as cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers and amyloid positron emission tomography neuroimaging, are key to testing this theory in clinical trials. Recent results from trials of agents such as aducanumab are encouraging but must also be interpreted with caution. Such medicines could potentially delay the onset of dementia and would therefore markedly reduce its prevalence. However, we currently remain a good distance away from clinically available disease-modifying therapy.
27251738	[Connections between sleep and Alzheimer's disease : Insomnia, amnesia and amyloid].	Sleep plays an essential role in memory consolidation. Although sleep problems are common in Alzheimer's disease, they are not usually thought to be key features of the disease; however, new experimental research has shown that sleep disturbances not only occur before the onset of typical cognitive deficits but are also associated with the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease and may have a decisive influence on the symptoms and course. Thus, sleep disturbances may be potentially modifiable risk factors for Alzheimer's disease that deserve more attention in research, diagnostics and treatment.
27251360	Polypharmacy and medication regimen complexity as factors associated with staff informant rated quality of life in residents of aged care facilities: a cross-sectional study.	PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to investigate the association between polypharmacy with health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and medication regimen complexity with HRQoL in residential aged care facilities (RACFs). METHODS: A cross-sectional study of 383 residents from six Australian RACFs was conducted. The primary exposures were polypharmacy (>/=9 regular medications) and the validated Medication Regimen Complexity Index (MRCI). The outcome measure was staff informant rated quality of life assessed using the Quality of Life Alzheimer's disease (QoL-AD) scale. Covariates included age, sex, Charlson's comorbidity index, activities of daily living, and dementia severity. Logistic quantile regression was used to characterize the association between polypharmacy and QoL-AD (model 1) and MRCI and QoL-AD (model 2). RESULTS: The median age of the 383 residents was 88 years and 297 (78 %) residents were female. In total, 63 % of residents were exposed to polypharmacy and the median MRCI score (range) was 43.5 (4-113). After adjusting for the covariates, polypharmacy was not associated with either higher or lower QoL-AD scores (estimate -0.02; 95 % confidence interval (CI) -0.165, 0.124; p = 0.78). Similarly, after adjusting for the covariates, MRCI was not associated with either higher or lower QoL-AD scores (estimate -0.0009, 95 % CI -0.005, 0.003; p = 0.63). CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that polypharmacy and medication regimen complexity are not associated with staff informant rated HRQoL. Further research is needed to investigate how specific medication classes may impact change in quality of life over time.
27250365	Current pharmacotherapy and putative disease-modifying therapy for Alzheimer's disease.	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age-related neurodegenerative disease of the central nervous system correlated with the progressive loss of cognition and memory. beta-Amyloid plaques, neurofibrillary tangles and the deficiency in cholinergic neurotransmission constitute the major hallmarks of the AD. Two major hypotheses have been implicated in the pathogenesis of AD namely the cholinergic hypothesis which ascribed the clinical features of dementia to the deficit cholinergic neurotransmission and the amyloid cascade hypothesis which emphasized on the deposition of insoluble peptides formed due to the faulty cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein. Current pharmacotherapy includes mainly the acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor agonist which offer symptomatic therapy and does not address the underlying cause of the disease. The disease-modifying therapy has garnered a lot of research interest for the development of effective pharmacotherapy for AD. beta and gamma-Secretase constitute attractive targets that are focussed in the disease-modifying approach. Potentiation of alpha-secretase also seems to be a promising approach towards the development of an effective anti-Alzheimer therapy. Additionally, the ameliorative agents that prevent aggregation of amyloid peptide and also the ones that modulate inflammation and oxidative damage associated with the disease are focussed upon. Development in the area of the vaccines is in progress to combat the characteristic hallmarks of the disease. Use of cholesterol-lowering agents also is a fruitful strategy for the alleviation of the disease as a close association between the cholesterol and AD has been cited. The present review underlines the major therapeutic strategies for AD with focus on the new developments that are on their way to amend the current therapeutic scenario of the disease.
27248362	Clusterin levels are increased in Alzheimer's disease and influence the regional distribution of Abeta.	Clusterin, also known as apoJ, is a lipoprotein abundantly expressed within the CNS. It regulates Abeta fibril formation and toxicity and facilitates amyloid-beta (Abeta) transport across the blood-brain barrier. Genome-wide association studies have shown variations in the clusterin gene (CLU) to influence the risk of developing sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD). To explore whether clusterin modulates the regional deposition of Abeta, we measured levels of soluble (NP40-extracted) and insoluble (guanidine-HCl-extracted) clusterin, Abeta40 and Abeta42 by sandwich ELISA in brain regions with a predilection for amyloid pathology-mid-frontal cortex (MF), cingulate cortex (CC), parahippocampal cortex (PH), and regions with little or no pathology-thalamus (TH) and white matter (WM). Clusterin level was highest in regions with plaque pathology (MF, CC, PH and PC), approximately mirroring the regional distribution of Abeta. It was significantly higher in AD than controls, and correlated positively with Abeta42 and insoluble Abeta40. Soluble clusterin level rose significantly with severity of cerebral amyloid angiopathy, and in MF and PC regions was highest in APOE varepsilon4 homozygotes. In the TH and WM (areas with little amyloid pathology) clusterin was unaltered in AD and did not correlate with Abeta level. There was a significant positive correlation between the concentration of clusterin and the regional levels of insoluble Abeta42; however, the molar ratio of clusterin : Abeta42 declined with insoluble Abeta42 level in a region-dependent manner, being lowest in regions with predilection for Abeta plaque pathology. Under physiological conditions, clusterin reduces aggregation and promotes clearance of Abeta. Our findings indicate that in AD, clusterin increases, particularly in regions with most abundant Abeta, but because the increase does not match the rising level of Abeta42, the molar ratio of clusterin : Abeta42 in those regions falls, probably contributing to Abeta deposition within the tissue.
27247967	Glaucoma as a Neurodegenerative Disease: Why We Must 'Look for the Protein'.	For years, clinicians and scientists interested in glaucoma have focused on the anterior segment of the eye and lowering of the intraocular pressure with respect to glaucoma causes and therapies. Yet glaucoma progresses in many individuals despite lowering the intraocular pressure. Herein, the concept of glaucoma as a neurodegenerative disease is presented.

27246957	Remote Neuropsychological Assessment in Rural American Indians with and without Cognitive Impairment.	OBJECTIVE: To determine the feasibility and reliability of a brief battery of standard neuropsychological tests administered via video teleconference (VTC) to a sample of rural American Indians compared with traditional face-to-face administration. METHODS: The sample consisted of 84 participants from the Choctaw Nation in Oklahoma, including 53 females and 31 males [M age = 64.89 (SD = 9.73), M education = 12.58 (SD = 2.35)]. Of these, 29 had a diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment or dementia, and 55 were cognitively normal. Tests included the MMSE, Clock Drawing, Digit Span Forward and Backward, Oral Trails, Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised, Letter and Category Fluency, and a short form Boston Naming Test. Alternative forms of tests were administered in counterbalanced fashion in both face-to-face and VTC conditions. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were used to compare test scores between test conditions across the entire sample. RESULTS: All ICCs were significant (p< .0001) and ranged from 0.65 (Clock Drawing) to 0.93 (Boston Naming Test), with a mean ICC of 0.82. CONCLUSION: Results add to the expanding literature supporting the feasibility and reliability of remote videoconference-based neuropsychological test administration and extend findings to American Indians.
27246872	Novel anionic polymer as a carrier for CNS delivery of anti-Alzheimer drug.	Natural and plant-based polymers could be used for control release of drugs and also helps in targeting drug to the site of action. The main objective of present work was to check the feasibility of plant-based, namely, mango gum polymeric nanoparticles (NPs) as a carrier for central nervous system (CNS) delivery using model drug donepezil (DZP). The NPs were prepared by modified ionic gelation method and emulsion cross-linking method. Zeta sizer results showed that the diameter of NPs was about 90-130 nm. The polymeric DZP-loaded NPs were almost spherical in shape, as revealed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). On increasing concentration of NPs suspension from 50 mug/ml to 5000 mug/ml there was no significant increase in % hemolysis. In vivo studies showed that brain targeting was achieved. So on the basis of above results, the extracted water soluble fraction of mango gum is a suitable candidate for brain delivery in the form of nanoformulations.
27245225	Herbal formula GAPT prevents beta amyloid deposition induced Ca(2+)/Calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II and Ca(2+)/Calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase 2B imbalance in APPV717I mice.	BACKGROUND: Synaptic dysfunction is one of the pathological characteristics of Alzheimer's disease (AD), which is directly related to the progressive decline of cognitive function. CaMKII and CaN have been found to play important roles in memory processes and synaptic transmission. So present study aimed to elucidate relationships between CaMKII, CaN and cognitive decline in APPV717I mice, and to reveal whether the cognitive improving effects of GAPT is conducted through rebalance CaMKII and CaN. METHODS: Three-month-old-male APPV717I mice were randomly divided into ten groups (n = 12 per group) and received intragastrically administrated vehicle, donepezil or different doses of herbal formula GAPT for 8 or 4 months. Three-month-old male C57BL/6 J mice was set as vehicle control. RESULTS: Immunohistochemistry analysis showed that there were CaMKII expression decrease in the CA1 region of APPV717I transgenic mice, while the CaMKII expression of donepezil or GAPT treated transgenic mice were all increased. And there were CaN expression increase in the brain cortex of APPV717I transgenic mice, while there were decrease of CaN expression in donepezil or GAPT treated transgenic group. Western blot analysis showed the similar expression pattern without significant difference. CONCLUSION: GAPT extract have showed effectiveness in activating the expression of CaMKII and inhibiting the expression of CaN either before or after the formation of amyloid plaques in the brain of APPV717I transgenic mice, which may in certain way alleviated neuron synaptic dysfunction in AD.
27242933	Synaptic Cell Adhesion Molecules in Alzheimer's Disease.	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative brain disorder associated with the loss of synapses between neurons in the brain. Synaptic cell adhesion molecules are cell surface glycoproteins which are expressed at the synaptic plasma membranes of neurons. These proteins play key roles in formation and maintenance of synapses and regulation of synaptic plasticity. Genetic studies and biochemical analysis of the human brain tissue, cerebrospinal fluid, and sera from AD patients indicate that levels and function of synaptic cell adhesion molecules are affected in AD. Synaptic cell adhesion molecules interact with Abeta, a peptide accumulating in AD brains, which affects their expression and synaptic localization. Synaptic cell adhesion molecules also regulate the production of Abeta via interaction with the key enzymes involved in Abeta formation. Abeta-dependent changes in synaptic adhesion affect the function and integrity of synapses suggesting that alterations in synaptic adhesion play key roles in the disruption of neuronal networks in AD.
27241555	MicroRNA-146a represses LRP2 translation and leads to cell apoptosis in Alzheimer's disease.	MicroRNA regulation of transcript expression has been reported in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here, we investigate the role of microRNA-146a (miRNA-146a), a brain-enriched miRNA, which is upregulated in AD patients. Through analysis of predicted targets of miRNA-146a, low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-2 (Lrp2), a member of the LDLR family that is known to play a protective role in AD, was identified. Overexpression of miRNA-146a in SH-SY5Y cells significantly decreased Lrp2 expression, resulting in a reduction of Akt activation and induction of proapoptotic caspase-3, thereby increasing cell apoptosis. Thus, specific miRNA-146a regulation may contribute to AD by downregulating the Lrp2/Akt pathway.
27240869	Identifying and Managing Pain in People with Alzheimer's Disease and Other Types of Dementia: A Systematic Review.	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Pain in patients with Alzheimer's disease is a complex issue; these patients suffer from the common causes of acute and chronic pain, and some also have neuropathic or nociceptive pain. Whatever the mechanism of pain in these patients, their pain will require careful assessment and management, to insure the correct type and level of analgesia is given. The objective of this systematic review was the identification of studies that have investigated the efficacy of different analgesics on pain intensity or pain-related behavior during nursing home stay and at the end of life. METHODS: A search using pain, pain treatment, and dementia MESH terms and keywords was conducted (October 15, 2015) in MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsychINFO, CINAHL, and Cochrane libraries. RESULTS: Our search yielded 3138 unique hits, published between 1990 and October 2015. We read titles and abstracts, identified 124 papers for full-text evaluation, and included 12 papers to reflect and synthesize the following questions: (1) Which pain assessment tools for people with dementia are responsive to change in pain intensity scores? (2) Which analgesics are efficacy-tested by controlled trials including people with dementia living in nursing homes, including at the end of life? (3) Which outcome measures have been used to identify pain, pain behavior, and/or treatment efficacy in people with dementia? CONCLUSION: Despite increased use of analgesics, pain is still prevalent in people with dementia. Validated pain tools are available but not implemented and not fully tested on responsiveness to treatment. Official guidelines for pain assessment and treatment addressing people with dementia living in a nursing home are lacking. The efficacy of analgesic drug use on pain or neuropsychiatric behavior related to dementia has been hardly investigated.
27240327	The Rationale for Insulin Therapy in Alzheimer's Disease.	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia, with a prevalence that increases with age. By 2050, the worldwide number of patients with AD is projected to reach more than 140 million. The prominent signs of AD are progressive memory loss, accompanied by a gradual decline in cognitive function and premature death. AD is the clinical manifestation of altered proteostasis. The initiating step of altered proteostasis in most AD patients is not known. The progression of AD is accelerated by several chronic disorders, among which the contribution of diabetes to AD is well understood at the cell biology level. The pathological mechanisms of AD and diabetes interact and tend to reinforce each other, thus accelerating cognitive impairment. At present, only symptomatic interventions are available for treating AD. To optimise symptomatic treatment, a personalised therapy approach has been suggested. Intranasal insulin administration seems to open the possibility for a safe, and at least in the short term, effective symptomatic intervention that delays loss of cognition in AD patients. This review summarizes the interactions of AD and diabetes from the cell biology to the patient level and the clinical results of intranasal insulin treatment of cognitive decline in AD.
27240009	Visual and fluorescent assays for selective detection of beta-amyloid oligomers based on the inner filter effect of gold nanoparticles on the fluorescence of CdTe quantum dots.	Beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptides are the major constituents of senile plaques in the brains of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. Abeta monomers (AbetaMs) can coalesce to form small, soluble oligomers (AbetaOs), followed by reorganization and assembly into long, thread-like fibrils (AbetaFs). Recently, soluble AbetaOs have been regarded as reliable molecular biomarkers for the diagnosis of AD because of their high toxicity for neuronal synapse and high concentration levels in the brains of AD patients. In this work, we reported a label-free, sensitive and selective method for visual and fluorescent detection of AbetaOs based on the inner filter effect (IFE) of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) on the fluorescence of CdTe quantum dots (QDs). Specifically, the fluorescence of CdTe QDs was quenched significantly by AuNPs through the IFE. PrP(95-110), an AbetaOs-specific binding peptide from cellular prion protein, triggered the aggregation and color change of AuNPs suspension; thus, the IFE of AuNPs on the fluorescence of CdTe QDs was weakened and the fluorescence intensity was recovered. However, in the presence of AbetaOs, the specific interaction of AbetaOs and PrP(95-110) prevented the absorption of PrP(95-110) onto the surface of AuNPs. As a result, the aggregation of AuNPs was inhibited and the fluorescence intensity of CdTe QDs was quenched again. This label-free method is specific for detection of AbetaOs but not for AbetaMs and AbetaFs. The detection limits were found to be 0.5nM for the visual assay and 0.2nM for the fluorescent detection. We believe that this work would be valuable for many investigations related to AD diagnosis and drug discovery.
27238834	Neurovascular Protective Function of Endothelial Nitric Oxide- Recent Advances.	In the central nervous system endothelial nitric oxide (NO) is an essential molecule responsible for the preservation of the functional integrity of the neurovascular unit. NO causes vasodilatation and is an important inhibitor of platelet aggregation, smooth muscle cell proliferation, and white blood cell adhesion. In addition, endothelium-derived NO exerts anti-inflammatory and pro-angiogenic effects. More recently, it has been recognized that endothelial NO modulates the expression and processing of amyloid precursor protein in cerebrovascular endothelium and neuronal tissue. Studies in endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) knockout mice indicate that endothelial NO functions as a neurovascular protective molecule during aging. Indeed, genetic inactivation of eNOS exacerbates the detrimental effects of aging on cerebrovascular, microglial, and neuronal functions as well as on cognition. These findings suggest that the preservation of healthy endothelium and normal function of eNOS might be important therapeutic targets. Because the beneficial effects of NO are mostly mediated by the activation of guanylate cyclase/cyclic GMP signaling, inhibitors of phosphodiesterase isoforms, or activation of this signaling with exercise, may offer therapeutic opportunities in the prevention and treatment of aging-induced cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease. Most recent advances in understanding the molecular mechanisms linking loss of endothelial NO with cognitive decline will be discussed in this review. (Circ J 2016; 80: 1499-1503).
27236482	Multiple capillary isotachophoresis with repetitive hydrodynamic injections for performance improvement of the electromigration preconcentration.	A novel electrokinetic preconcentration technique based on multiple isotachophoresis (M-ITP) realised in a micro-bored capillary to improve sensitivity for capillary electrophoresis with hydrodynamic injection was developed. The M-ITP operation relies on pressure-assisted pushing of a preconcentrated sample plug after the first ITP process back to the injection end of the capillary, followed by a large volume hydrodynamic injection prior to application of the second ITP step. This operational cycle was repeated as many times as desired with very good repeatability of the peak areas and peak heights at each ITP round (RSD less than 8%). Using imidazole and benzoate as models for cationic and anionic analytes, important insights into the mechanism of this electrokinetic preconcentration process with and without the presence of the electro-osmotic flow (EOF) at acidic and basic conditions were provided. Stacking of the benzoate ion, selected as one model analyte, in the presence of EOF and from a sample plug representing up to 300% of the total capillary length was successfully demonstrated. M-ITP was then demonstrated through the enrichment of the Abeta 1-40 amyloid peptide, considered as one of the biomarkers for biochemical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. Quantification of Abeta 1-40 down to 50nM with UV detection was made possible with 6 M-ITP cycles.
27236050	ALS: A bucket of genes, environment, metabolism and unknown ingredients.	The scientific scenario of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) has dramatically changed since TDP-43 aggregates were discovered in 2006 as the main component of the neuronal inclusions seen in the disease, and more recently, when the implication of C9ORF72 expansion in familial and sporadic cases of ALS and frontotemporal dementia was confirmed. These discoveries have enlarged an extense list of genes implicated in different cellular processes such as RNA processing or autophagia among others and have broaden the putative molecular targets of the disease. Some of ALS-related genes such as TARDBP or SOD1 among others have important roles in the regulation of glucose and fatty acids metabolism, so that an impairment of fatty acids (FA) consumption and ketogenic deficits during exercise in ALS patients would connect the physiopathology with some of the more intriguing epidemiological traits of the disease. The current understanding of ALS as part of a continuum with other neurodegenerative diseases and a crossroads between genetic, neurometabolic and environmental factors represent a fascinating model of interaction that could be translated to other neurodegenerative diseases. In this review we summarize the most relevant data obtained in the ten last years and the key lines for future research in ALS.
27234814	Effect of deoxyribonuclease I treatment for dementia in end-stage Alzheimer's disease: a case report.	BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia and is characterized by a progressive loss of brain tissue leading to amyloid-beta accumulation and severe decline in cognitive function. The cause of Alzheimer's disease is poorly understood, and available treatments are limited in their efficacy, particularly for patients with more severe symptoms. CASE PRESENTATION: We report the case of a 77-year-old Caucasian man with severe dementia and behavioral disturbance secondary to Alzheimer's disease treated with memantine who began adjunct treatment with deoxyribonuclease I. Prior to initiation of deoxyribonuclease I treatment, our patient appeared to be in a stuporous state, with a Mini-Mental State Examination score of 3 and a Functional Assessment Staging Test score of 7. After obtaining informed consent from family members, we started administration of 120 mg of deoxyribonuclease I per day (1500 KU/mg) for treatment of severe cognitive impairment. CONCLUSIONS: Our patient began to demonstrate rapid, considerable improvement in cognitive function 2 days following initiation of deoxyribonuclease I treatment. After 2 months of continued treatment, Mini-Mental State Examination and Functional Assessment Staging Test scores were 18 and 4, respectively.
27233432	Effects of Sesaminol Feeding on Brain Abeta Accumulation in a Senescence-Accelerated Mouse-Prone 8.	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the progressive accumulation of extracellular beta-amyloid (Abeta) aggregates. Recently, the senescence-accelerated mouse-prone 8 (SAMP8) model was highlighted as a useful model of age-related AD. Therefore, we used the SAMP8 mouse to investigate the preventive effects of sesame lignans on the onset of AD-like pathology. In preliminary in vitro studies, sesaminol showed the greatest inhibitory effect on Abeta oligomerization and fibril formation relative to sesamin, sesamolin, and sesaminol triglucoside. Hence, sesaminol was selected for further evaluation in vivo. In SAMP8 mice, feed-through sesaminol (0.05%, w/w, in standard chow) administered over a 16 week period reduced brain Abeta accumulation and decreased serum 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine, an indicator of oxidative stress. Furthermore, sesaminol administration increased the gene and protein expression of ADAM10, which is a protease centrally involved in the non-amyloidogenic processing of amyloid precursor protein. Taken together, these data suggest that long-term consumption of sesaminol may inhibit the accumulation of pathogenic Abeta in the brain.
27232589	Investigational drugs for treating agitation in persons with dementia.	INTRODUCTION: Agitation is common and distressing in persons with dementia, but safe, effective treatments remain elusive. In this review, the authors describe investigational compounds in ongoing or recently completed clinical trials for this indication and provide an opinion on how they may meet current therapeutic needs. AREAS COVERED: Phase II and phase III clinical trials for agitation in persons with dementia were searched in US and EU clinical trial registries and in the medical literature for the period January 2013-February 2016 EXPERT OPINION: The authors searches identified 24 recent clinical trials investigating new treatments for agitation in persons with dementia. Candidate drugs in phase III development included the antipsychotic brexpiprazole, the antidepressant citalopram, the novel compound AVP-786 (deuterated-dextromethorphan/quinidine combination) and the cannabinoid nabilone. Of the compounds in phase II clinical trials, ELND005 (scyllo-inositol) is intended to progress into phase III development, based on evidence from a subgroup analysis and biomarker data. After many years without an FDA/EMA (Food and Drug Administration/European Medicines Agency) approved medication to treat agitation in persons with dementia, we may see the arrival of the first approved drug in the near future.
27230861	Group- and Home-Based Cognitive Intervention for Patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment: A Randomized Controlled Trial.	BACKGROUND: We examined the efficacy of group-based cognitive intervention (GCI) and home-based cognitive intervention (HCI) in amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) and intervention effects on serum brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). METHODS: In this randomized and rater-blinded trial, 293 patients with aMCI from 18 nationwide hospitals were randomized: 96 to the GCI group, 98 to the HCI group and 99 to the control group. For 12 weeks, subjects receiving GCI participated twice per week in group sessions led by trained instructors, and those receiving HCI completed homework materials 5 days per week. They were assessed at baseline, postintervention (PI) and at the 6-month follow-up after the intervention. The primary endpoint was the change from baseline to PI in the modified Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog). RESULTS: In comparison to the controls (a 0.8-point decrease), the subjects receiving GCI (a 2.3-point decrease, p = 0.01) or HCI (a 2.5-point decrease, p = 0.02) showed significant improvements in the modified ADAS-Cog at PI, respectively. By the 6-month follow-up, those receiving GCI or HCI had better scores in the modified ADAS-Cog than the controls. The changes in BDNF levels significantly correlated with the changes in the modified ADAS-Cog in the GCI (r = -0.29, p = 0.02 at PI) and HCI (r = -0.27, p = 0.03 at 6-month follow-up) groups, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The GCI and HCI resulted in cognitive improvements in aMCI. An enhanced brain plasticity may be a component of the mechanism underpinning the cognitive improvements associated with the cognitive interventions.
27228309	Quantitative MRI to understand Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology.	PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The role of white matter damage in the progression of Alzheimer's disease and the associated cognitive symptoms is becoming increasingly clearer. This is partly because of the advent of diffusion tensor imaging, which, in combination with other quantitative MRI techniques, offers unique insights into the patholophysiology of Alzheimer's disease in vivo. The purpose of this review is to integrate the most recent imaging findings, with respect to understanding Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology, and identifying potential biomarkers with diagnostic and prognostic value. RECENT FINDINGS: Consistent with patterns of gray matter atrophy, white matter damage in Alzheimer's disease is localized within white matter tracts connecting the temporal lobe with the rest of the brain, including the cingulum, the uncinate fasciculus and the fornix. These abnormalities are often correlated with adjacent gray matter tissue loss, and with cognitive performance. The relationship between these findings and loss of functional connectivity supports the hypothesis of disconnection as a mechanism for the spread of Alzheimer's disease. SUMMARY: White matter abnormalities occur early in Alzheimer's disease, and might actively contribute to the progression of the disease. Functional and structural gray matter abnormalities parallel the white matter changes, and successful biomarkers are likely to be multiparametric.
27227482	Synthesis and screening of triazolopyrimidine scaffold as multi-functional agents for Alzheimer's disease therapies.	In present study a series of triazolopyrimidine-quinoline and cyanopyridine-quinoline hybrids were designed, synthesized and evaluated as acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs). Molecular docking and scoring was utilized for the design of inhibitors. The molecules were synthesized via an easily accessible, convergent synthetic route. Three triazolopyrimidine based compounds showed nanomolar activity towards acetylcholinesterase. Among them, Ethyl 6-fluoro-4-(4-(5-methyl-[1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidin-7-yl)piperazin-1-yl)quino line-3-carboxylate (10d), strongly inhibited AChE with IC50 value of 42 nM. Furthermore compound 10d was identified as most promising compound with 12 fold selectivity against butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE). This compound displayed a composed multitargeted profile with promising inhibition of self-induced and AChE - induced Abeta aggregation and antioxidant activity.
27226559	Neutralization of RANTES and Eotaxin Prevents the Loss of Dopaminergic Neurons in a Mouse Model of Parkinson Disease.	Parkinson disease (PD) is second only to Alzheimer disease as the most common human neurodegenerative disorder. Despite intense investigation, no interdictive therapy is available for PD. Recent studies indicate that both innate and adaptive immune processes are active in PD. Accordingly, we found a rapid increase in RANTES (regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted) and eotaxin, chemokines that are involved in T cell trafficking, in vivo in the substantia nigra pars compacta and the serum of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-intoxicated mice. RANTES and eotaxin were also up-regulated in the substantia nigra pars compacta of post-mortem PD brains as compared with age-matched controls. Therefore, we investigated whether neutralization of RANTES and eotaxin could protect against nigrostriatal degeneration in MPTP-intoxicated mice. Interestingly, after peripheral administration, functional blocking antibodies against RANTES and eotaxin reduced the infiltration of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells into the nigra, attenuated nigral expression of proinflammatory molecules, and suppressed nigral activation of glial cells. These findings paralleled dopaminergic neuronal protection, normalized striatal neurotransmitters, and improved motor functions in MPTP-intoxicated mice. Therefore, we conclude that attenuation of the chemokine-dependent adaptive immune response may be of therapeutic benefit for PD patients.
27226239	Design, synthesis and biological activity of 1H-indene-2-carboxamides as multi-targeted anti-Alzheimer agents.	The aim of this study was to design new molecules and evaluate their anticholinesterase and amyloid beta (Abeta1-42) inhibition activities as multifunctional drug candidates for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). A series of 5,6-dimethoxy-1H-indene-2-carboxamides (1-22) was synthesized; cholinesterase inhibitory activities of the compounds were measured according to Ellman's colorimetric assay, while the thioflavin T assay was used for measuring the inhibition of Abeta1-42 aggregation. The results revealed that most compounds showed higher inhibitory activity against BuChE than AChE. Compounds 20 and 21 were found to be the most potent BuChE inhibitors with respective IC50 values of 1.08 and 1.09 muM. Compounds 16, 20, 21 and 22 exhibited remarkable inhibition of Abeta1-42 aggregation. Kinetic analysis showed that the most potent BuChE inhibitor (20) acted as a noncompetitive inhibitor. Docking studies suggested that inhibitor 20 displayed many potential hydrogen-bondings with the PAS of BuChE. These results suggest that compound 20 may be an especially promising multifunctional drug for the prevention and treatment of AD.
27226198	Insulin and Lispro Insulin: What is Common and Different in their Behavior?	There are different insulin analogues with various pharmacokinetic characteristics, such as, rapid-acting, long-acting, or intermediate-acting analogues. Since insulin tends to form amyloid aggregates, it is of particular interest to measure characteristic times of formation of amyloid aggregates and compare those to action times for insulin and its analogues. For the study we have chosen one of the insulin analogues - insulin Lispro, which is a fast acting insulin analog. It is usually thought of amyloid aggregation as a nucleation-dependent process. We have estimated the size of the primary nucleus to be one monomer and the size of the secondary nucleus to be around zero in both insulin and Lispro insulin aggregation processes. The main structural element of insulin and Lispro insulin amyloid fibrils is a rounded ring oligomer of about 6-7 nm in diameter, about 2-3 nm in height and about 2 nm in diameter of the hole. Fibrils of several mum in length are produced due to interaction of such oligomers. The packing of ring oligomers in fibrils differs because of the difference in their orderliness. Though the initial stages of fibril formation (monomer, oligomer) are similar, the further process depends on the unique sequence of each peptide. Namely the sequence affects the final morphology of mature amyloids. These observations allow us to conclude that formation of fibrils by short peptides occurs via and by means of oligomer ring structures. Such an important issue as the nature of polymorphism of insulin amyloid fibrils has been settled by us. The role of early oligomeric aggregates in such processes as nucleation and aggregation of amyloid fibrils has been examined.
27225129	Genome-wide association study identifies 74 loci associated with educational attainment.	Educational attainment is strongly influenced by social and other environmental factors, but genetic factors are estimated to account for at least 20% of the variation across individuals. Here we report the results of a genome-wide association study (GWAS) for educational attainment that extends our earlier discovery sample of 101,069 individuals to 293,723 individuals, and a replication study in an independent sample of 111,349 individuals from the UK Biobank. We identify 74 genome-wide significant loci associated with the number of years of schooling completed. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms associated with educational attainment are disproportionately found in genomic regions regulating gene expression in the fetal brain. Candidate genes are preferentially expressed in neural tissue, especially during the prenatal period, and enriched for biological pathways involved in neural development. Our findings demonstrate that, even for a behavioural phenotype that is mostly environmentally determined, a well-powered GWAS identifies replicable associated genetic variants that suggest biologically relevant pathways. Because educational attainment is measured in large numbers of individuals, it will continue to be useful as a proxy phenotype in efforts to characterize the genetic influences of related phenotypes, including cognition and neuropsychiatric diseases.
27224227	Accelerated Brain Atrophy on Serial Computed Tomography: Potential Marker of the Progression of Alzheimer Disease.	OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to validate computed tomography (CT)-based longitudinal markers of the progression of Alzheimer disease (AD). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively studied 33 AD patients and 39 nondemented patients with other neurological illnesses (non-AD) having 4 to 12 CT examinations of the head, with over a mean (SD) of 3.9 (1.7) years. At each time point, we applied an automatic software to measure whole brain, cerebrospinal fluid, and intracranial space volumes. Longitudinal measures were then related to disease status and time since the first scan using hierarchical models. RESULTS: Absolute brain volume loss accelerated for non-AD patients by 0.86 mL/y (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.64-1.08 mL/y) and 1.5x faster, that is, 1.32 mL/y (95% CI, 1.09-1.56 mL/y) for AD patients (P = 0.006). In terms of brain volume normalized to intracranial space, the acceleration in atrophy rate for non-AD patients was 0.0578%/y (95% CI, 0.0389%/y to 0.0767%/y), again 1.5x faster, that is, 0.0919%/y (95% CI, 0.0716%/y to 0.1122%/y) for AD patients (P = 0.017). This translates to an increase in atrophy rate from 0.5% to 1.4% in AD versus to 1.1% in non-AD group after 10 years. CONCLUSIONS: Brain volumetry on CT reliably detected accelerated volume loss in AD and significantly lower acceleration factor in age-matched non-AD patients, leading to the possibility of its use to monitor the progression of cognitive decline and dementia.
27222266	Adamantane - A Lead Structure for Drugs in Clinical Practice.	The adamantane moiety is the structural backbone of numerous compounds and its discovery launched a new field of chemistry studying the approaches to the synthesis as well as the physicochemical and biological properties of organic polyhedral compounds with practical application in the pharmaceutical industry. Adamantane derivatives have proven to be very potent compounds in a wide range of applications from systemic to topical therapy. This review summarizes the currently available adamantane derivatives in clinical practice (amantadine, memantine, rimantadine, tromantadine, adapalene, saxagliptin, vildagliptin), focusing on mechanisms of action, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and clinical trials. The adamantane-based compounds presented in this manuscript have been approved for a wide spectrum of indications (antivirals, antidiabetics and against Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease). Each of the compounds proved to be of vital importance in their therapeutic indication for numerous patients worldwide. This review also considers the mechanisms of side effects to deliver a complete perspective on current treatment options.
27221639	Why didn't I know? Perspectives from adult children of elderly parents with dementia.	PURPOSE: Approximately 27 million adults are living with undiagnosed dementia worldwide. The purpose of this study was to learn about the experiences of adult children of elderly parents who were ultimately diagnosed with dementia. DATA SOURCES: A descriptive qualitative design was used for identifying if there were prodromal signs or symptoms that preceded the more commonly known warning signs of dementia. Twelve, 60-min interviews were conducted over the telephone. CONCLUSIONS: The overarching theme was: "Why didn't I know?" Subthemes were "We ignored it because we didn't want it to be," "We thought it was grief," and "They wouldn't diagnose dementia." Normal aging changes often mask the identification of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia. Healthcare providers should screen patients for dementia when cognitive concerns or changes become apparent. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The General Practitioner Assessment of Cognition and the Mini-Cog can be used for screening cognitive changes. Since depression may be misinterpreted as dementia, screening for depression should also be included if there is a potential for overlap. This is important in those patients who are experiencing grief, as many signs and symptoms of early grief are the same as early dementia.
27221635	Cerebrospinal fluid lactate levels and brain [18F]FDG PET hypometabolism within the default mode network in Alzheimer's disease.	PURPOSE: It has been suggested that neuronal energy metabolism may be involved in Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this view, the finding of increased cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) lactate levels in AD patients has been considered the result of energetic metabolism dysfunction. Here, we investigated the relationship between neuronal energy metabolism, as measured via CSF lactate levels, and cerebral glucose metabolism, as stated at the 2-deoxy-2-(18F)fluoro-D-glucose positron emission tomography ([18F]FDG PET) in AD patients. METHODS: AD patients underwent lumbar puncture to measure CSF lactate levels and [18F]FDG PET to assess brain glucose metabolism. CSF and PET data were compared to controls. Since patients were studied at rest, we specifically investigated brain areas active in rest-condition owing to the Default Mode Network (DMN). We correlated the CSF lactate concentrations with the [18F]FDG PET data in brain areas owing to the DMN, using sex, age, disease duration, Mini Mental State Examination, and CSF levels of tau proteins and beta-amyloid as covariates. RESULTS: AD patients (n = 32) showed a significant increase of CSF lactate levels compared to Control 1 group (n = 28). They also showed brain glucose hypometabolism in the DMN areas compared to Control 2 group (n = 30). Within the AD group we found the significant correlation between increased CSF lactate levels and glucose hypometabolism in Broadman areas (BA) owing to left medial prefrontal cortex (BA10, mPFC), left orbitofrontal cortex (BA11, OFC), and left parahippocampal gyrus (BA 35, PHG). CONCLUSION: We found high CSF levels of lactate and glucose hypometabolism within the DMN in AD patients. Moreover, we found a relationship linking the increased CSF lactate and the reduced glucose consumption in the left mPFC, OFC and PHG, owing to the anterior hub of DMN. These findings could suggest that neural glucose hypometabolism may affect the DMN efficiency in AD, also proposing the possible role of damaged brain energetic machine in impairing DMN.
27215977	miRNA-dependent target regulation: functional characterization of single-nucleotide polymorphisms identified in genome-wide association studies of Alzheimer's disease.	BACKGROUND: A growing body of evidence suggests that microRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and that some disease-associated genetic variants are located within miRNA binding sites. In the present study, we sought to characterize functional polymorphisms in miRNA target sites within the loci defined in earlier genome-wide association studies (GWAS). The main objectives of this study were to (1) facilitate the identification of the gene or genes responsible for the GWAS signal within a locus of interest and (2) determine how functional polymorphisms might be involved in the AD process (e.g., by affecting miRNA-mediated variations in gene expression). METHODS: Stringent in silico analyses were developed to select potential polymorphisms susceptible to impairment of miRNA-mediated repression, and subsequent functional assays were performed in HeLa and HEK293 cells. RESULTS: Two polymorphisms were identified and further analyzed in vitro. The AD-associated rs7143400-T allele (located in 3' untranslated region [3'-UTR] of FERMT2) cotransfected with miR-4504 resulted in lower protein levels relative to the rs7143400-G allele cotransfected with the same miRNA. The AD-associated rs9909-C allele in the 3'-UTR of NUP160 abolished the miR-1185-1-3p-regulated expression observed for the rs9909-G allele. CONCLUSIONS: When considered in conjunction with the findings of previous association studies, our results suggest that decreased expression of FERMT2 might be a risk factor in the etiopathology of AD, whereas increased expression of NUP160 might protect against the disease. Our data therefore provide new insights into AD by highlighting two new proteins putatively involved in the disease process.
27215959	New data on harmful effects of trans-fatty acids.	Various margarines containing trans-fatty acids were marketed as being healthier because of the absence of cholesterol, suggesting to use margarine instead of butter. Fifteen years ago, research documented the grave health risk of trans-fats (T-fat). US FDA in 2015 finalized its decision that T-fat is not safe and set a three-year time limit for complete removal of T-fat from all foods. The greatest danger from T-fat lies in its capacity to distort the cell membranes. The primary health risk identified for T-fat consumption is an elevated risk of coronary heart disease. T-fats have an adverse effect on the brain and nervous system. T-fat from the diet is incorporated into brain cell membranes and alter the ability of neurons to communicate. This can diminish mental performance. Relationship between T-fat intake and depression risk was observed. There is growing evidence for a possible role of T-fat in the development of Alzheimer s disease and cognitive decline with age.
27215623	Influence of four polymorphisms in ABCA1 and PTGS2 genes on risk of Alzheimer's disease: a meta-analysis.	We preformed this meta-analysis to investigate the influence of ABCA1 (ATP-binding cassette sub-family A member 1) rs2422493 (C-477T), rs1800977 (C-14T), rs2066718 (V771M), and PTGS2 (Prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2) rs20417 (G-765C) polymorphisms on the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Seventeen eligible case-control studies were acquired from PubMed, Embase, Alzgene, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure and Wanfang databases. The pooled odds ratios (ORs) with 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CI) were calculated to evaluate the association under five genetic models. Combined data indicated that ABCA1 rs2422493 polymorphism was statistically significant associated with increasing AD risk in three genetic models (allelic T vs C: OR = 1.12, 95 % CI: 1.01-1.24; homozygous TT vs CC: OR = 1.26, 95 % CI: 1.03-1.55; and recessive TT vs TC + CC: OR = 1.33, 95 % CI: 1.12-1.58) while no association was found between two other ABCA1 polymorphisms and AD susceptibility. Nevertheless, a further risk-stratification analysis showed that ApoE-epsilon4 carriers with any ABCA1 polymorphism suffered a much higher probability to be AD patients. Meanwhile, PTGS2 rs20417 polymorphism was linked to decreasing AD risk with a P < 0.0001 in five genetic models (e.g., allelic C vs G: OR = 0.59, 95 % CI: 0.50-0.70; homozygous CC vs GG: OR = 0.31, 95 % CI: 0.18-0.52; and heterozygous CG vs GG: OR = 0.64, 95 % CI: 0.52-0.78). In summary, our meta-analysis results showed that ABCA1 rs2422493 polymorphism was a risk factor for AD while PTGS2 rs20417 variant showed a protective effect on AD risk. In addition, ABCA1 rs2066718 and rs1800977 polymorphisms might not contribute to AD susceptibility in general population, but they should play a role on AD development when interacted with ApoE-epsilon4.
27215525	[Laparoscopic gastrectomy for gastric stump cancer: analysis of 7 cases].	OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety and feasibility of laparoscopic gastrectomy for gastric stump cancer. METHODS: Clinical and follow-up data of 7 patients who underwent laparoscopic gastrectomy for gastric stump cancer in our department from January 2008 to July 2015 were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: There were 5 male and 2 female patients, with a mean age of (62.1+/-10.7) years. Initial gastrectomy was performed for gastric cancer in 3 patients and peptic ulceration in 4. The initial surgery was B-II( gastrojejunostomy in 6 patients and Roux-en-Y gastrojejunostomy in 1. Duration between primary gastrectomy and occurrence of gastric stump cancer was ranged from 6-30 years for peptic ulceration, and from 11-15 years for gastric cancer. During the operation, adhesiolysis and exploration to locate the tumor were performed. Following total remnant gastrectomy and lymphadenectomy, intracorporeal anastomosis was accomplished by Roux-en-Y reconstruction. The methods of intracorporeal esophagojejunostomy were end-to-side approach using a circular stapler in 1 patient, side-to-side approach using an endoscopic linear staple in 2 patients, and hand-sewn technique in 4 patients. The operation time was (247.1+/-17.5) minutes and the intraoperative blood loss was (100.0+/-30.8) ml without transfusion. The number of retrieved lymph node was 19.1+/-4.8. The first flatus time, diet resumption time, postoperative hospital stay were (3.3+/-1.5) days, (3.7+/-0.8) days, (9.4+/-2.6) days, respectively. One patient experienced gastrointestinal bleeding that was managed conservatively and ultimately cured. Seven patients were followed up till January 2016. After follow-up from 6 to 38 months, 1 patient died of peritoneal metastasis 17 months after surgery, and 1 patient died of Alzheimer's disease 19 months after surgery. The other 5 patients were still alive without metastasis or recurrence. CONCLUSION: Laparoscopic gastrectomy for gastric stump cancer is feasible and safe.
27214510	Synthesis and anticholinesterase activity of coumarin-3-carboxamides bearing tryptamine moiety.	A number of N-(2-(1H-indol-3-yl)ethyl)-2-oxo-2H-chromene-3-carboxamides were synthesized and tested against AChE and BuChE. The in vitro assessment of the synthesized compounds 4a-o revealed that most of them had significant activity toward AChE. The SAR study demonstrated that the introduction of benzyloxy moiety on the 7-position of coumarin scaffold can improve the anti-AChE activity. The best result was obtained with 7-(4-fluorobenzyl)oxy moiety in the case of compound 4o, displaying IC50 value of 0.16 muM. Based on the docking study of AChE, the prototype compound 4o was laid across the active site and occupied both peripheral anionic site (PAS) and catalytic anionic site (CAS).
27214308	Growth Hormone and Cerebral Amyloidosis.	Great interest has recently been focused on a paper reporting characteristic deposits of amyloid-beta protein associated with Alzheimer's disease in brains of adults who died of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. As they had contracted such disease after treatment with prion-contaminated human growth hormone extracted from cadaver-derived pituitaries, the authors have suggested that interhuman transmission of Alzheimer's disease had occurred. Our previous research led us to find that amyloid-forming peptides share amino acid sequence homology, summarized by a motif. Here, we probed the amino acid sequence of human growth hormone for such a motif, and found that 2 segments fit the motif and are potentially amyloid-forming. This finding was confirmed by Aggrescan, another well-known software for the prediction of amyloidogenic peptides. Our results, taken together with data from the literature that are missing in the aforementioned paper and associated commentaries, minimize the contagious nature of the iatrogenically-acquired coexistence of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and Alzheimer's disease. In particular, the above mentioned paper misses literature data on intratumoral amyloidosis in growth hormone- and prolactin-secreting adenomas, tumors relatively frequent in adults, which are often silent. It cannot be excluded that some pituitaries used to extract growth hormone contained clinically silent microadenomas, a fraction of which containing amyloid deposits, and patients might had received a fraction of growth hormone (with or without prolactin) that already was an amyloid seed. The intrinsic amyloidogenicity of growth hormone, in the presence of contaminating prion protein (and perhaps prolactin as well) and amyloid-beta contained in some cadavers' pituitaries, may have led to the observed co-occurring of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and Alzheimer's disease.
27213773	Cognitive interventions in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases: emerging mechanisms and role of imaging.	PURPOSE OF REVIEW: There has been recent debate about the lack of compelling scientific evidence on the efficacy of cognitive interventions. The goal of this study is to review the current state of cognitive interventions in Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, present emerging mechanisms, and discuss the role of imaging in designing effective intervention strategies. RECENT FINDINGS: Cognitive interventions appear to be promising in Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. Although feasibility has been shown in mild cognitive impairment, early Alzheimer's disease, and mild to moderate Parkinson's disease, studies to investigate long-term efficacy and mechanisms underlying these interventions are still needed. SUMMARY: There is a need to conduct scientifically rigorous studies to validate the efficacy of cognitive intervention trials. Future studies will greatly benefit from including longitudinal imaging in their study design. Imaging can be used to demonstrate the efficacy and mechanisms by measuring brain changes over the intervention period. Imaging can also be used to determine biological and disease-related factors that may influence the treatment response, that is, the effect modifiers. Consideration of effect modifiers will allow us to measure the treatment response in biomarkers and cognition with greater sensitivity and also aid in designing trials that will lead to better patient outcomes.
27213408	Axonal Transport and Neurodegeneration: How Marine Drugs Can Be Used for the Development of Therapeutics.	Unlike virtually any other cells in the human body, neurons are tasked with the unique problem of transporting important factors from sites of synthesis at the cell bodies, across enormous distances, along narrow-caliber projections, to distally located nerve terminals in order to maintain cell viability. As a result, axonal transport is a highly regulated process whereby necessary cargoes of all types are packaged and shipped from one end of the neuron to the other. Interruptions in this finely tuned transport have been linked to many neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer's (AD), Huntington's disease (HD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) suggesting that this pathway is likely perturbed early in disease progression. Therefore, developing therapeutics targeted at modifying transport defects could potentially avert disease progression. In this review, we examine a variety of potential compounds identified from marine aquatic species that affect the axonal transport pathway. These compounds have been shown to function in microtubule (MT) assembly and maintenance, motor protein control, and in the regulation of protein degradation pathways, such as the autophagy-lysosome processes, which are defective in many degenerative diseases. Therefore, marine compounds have great potential in developing effective treatment strategies aimed at early defects which, over time, will restore transport and prevent cell death.
27213057	Differential DNA Methylation of MicroRNA Genes in Temporal Cortex from Alzheimer's Disease Individuals.	This study investigated for the first time the genomewide DNA methylation changes of noncoding RNA genes in the temporal cortex samples from individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD). The methylome of 10 AD individuals and 10 age-matched controls were obtained using Illumina 450 K methylation array. A total of 2,095 among the 15,258 interrogated noncoding RNA CpG sites presented differential methylation, 161 of which were associated with miRNA genes. In particular, 10 miRNA CpG sites that were found to be hypermethylated in AD compared to control brains represent transcripts that have been previously associated with the disease. This miRNA set is predicted to target 33 coding genes from the neuregulin receptor complex (ErbB) signaling pathway, which is required for the neurons myelination process. For 6 of these miRNA genes (MIR9-1, MIR9-3, MIR181C, MIR124-1, MIR146B, and MIR451), the hypermethylation pattern is in agreement with previous results from literature that shows downregulation of miR-9, miR-181c, miR-124, miR-146b, and miR-451 in the AD brain. Our data implicate dysregulation of miRNA methylation as contributor to the pathogenesis of AD.
27211547	The Role of Amyloid-beta Oligomers in Toxicity, Propagation, and Immunotherapy.	The incidence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is growing every day and finding an effective treatment is becoming more vital. Amyloid-beta (Abeta) has been the focus of research for several decades. The recent shift in the Abeta cascade hypothesis from all Abeta to small soluble oligomeric intermediates is directing the search for therapeutics towards the toxic mediators of the disease. Targeting the most toxic oligomers may prove to be an effective treatment by preventing their spread. Specific targeting of oligomers has been shown to protect cognition in rodent models. Additionally, the heterogeneity of research on Abeta oligomers may seem contradictory until size and conformation are taken into account. In this review, we will discuss Abeta oligomers and their toxicity in relation to size and conformation as well as their influence on inflammation and the potential of Abeta oligomer immunotherapy.
27209302	Deacetylation of TFEB promotes fibrillar Abeta degradation by upregulating lysosomal biogenesis in microglia.	Microglia play a pivotal role in clearance of Abeta by degrading them in lysosomes, countering amyloid plaque pathogenesis in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recent evidence suggests that lysosomal dysfunction leads to insufficient elimination of toxic protein aggregates. We tested whether enhancing lysosomal function with transcription factor EB (TFEB), an essential regulator modulating lysosomal pathways, would promote Abeta clearance in microglia. Here we show that microglial expression of TFEB facilitates fibrillar Abeta (fAbeta) degradation and reduces deposited amyloid plaques, which are further enhanced by deacetylation of TFEB. Using mass spectrometry analysis, we firstly confirmed acetylation as a previously unreported modification of TFEB and found that SIRT1 directly interacted with and deacetylated TFEB at lysine residue 116. Subsequently, SIRT1 overexpression enhanced lysosomal function and fAbeta degradation by upregulating transcriptional levels of TFEB downstream targets, which could be inhibited when TFEB was knocked down. Furthermore, overexpression of deacetylated TFEB at K116R mutant in microglia accelerated intracellular fAbeta degradation by stimulating lysosomal biogenesis and greatly reduced the deposited amyloid plaques in the brain slices of APP/PS1 transgenic mice. Our findings reveal that deacetylation of TFEB could regulate lysosomal biogenesis and fAbeta degradation, making microglial activation of TFEB a possible strategy for attenuating amyloid plaque deposition in AD.
27209028	Influence of education on cognitive performance and dopamine transporter binding in dementia with Lewy bodies.	OBJECTIVES: Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) are the two most common forms of dementia. These two diseases share some clinical and pathological similarities, yet the loss of dopaminergic neurons confirmed by 123-I-Ioflupane Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) is a suggestive feature of DLB. Current evidence suggests that higher education has a protective effect on the risk of developing clinical AD. However, how education influences cognitive performance and the presynaptic dopamine transporter marker in DLB is unknown. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed 56 consecutive patients with DLB who underwent a 123-I-Ioflupane SPECT from January 2009 to August 2013 at the University Hospital of Caen. We collected clinical and neuropsychological data from medical files and 123-I-Ioflupane SPECT data for all patients. RESULTS: There was no correlation between education and global cognitive performance in patients with DLB. However, there was a positive correlation between education and tests exploring visuoconstructive functions (Rey complex figure copy and recall) and verbal retrieval strategies (Grober and Buschke free recall test). There was also a positive correlation between education and dopamine transporter binding. Higher educated patients had higher binding in the striatum, putamen and caudate nucleus (p=0.001 for each regions of interest). Dopamine transporter binding in the striatum, putamen and caudate nucleus was lower in the subgroup of patients with REM sleep behavior disorder, but was not associated with other DLB symptoms. CONCLUSION: Higher education may have a protective effect on visuoconstructive performance and verbal retrieval strategies and may influence dopaminergic nigrostriatal neurodegeneration in patients with DLB.
27207427	A possible new role for Abeta in vascular and inflammatory dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease.	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is often characterized by vascular pathology, a procoagulant state, and chronic inflammation. The mechanisms behind these abnormalities in AD are not clear. Here, we review evidence for the role of the AD-associated peptide Abeta in promoting inflammation and thrombosis in AD via its interaction with the circulating proteins factor XII and fibrinogen.
27207326	Abeta-Induced Insulin Resistance and the Effects of Insulin on the Cholesterol Synthesis Pathway and Abeta Secretion in Neural Cells.	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by amyloid-beta (Abeta) toxicity, tau pathology, insulin resistance, neuroinflammation, and dysregulation of cholesterol homeostasis, all of which play roles in neurodegeneration. Insulin has polytrophic effects on neurons and may be at the center of these pathophysiological changes. In this study, we investigated possible relationships among insulin signaling and cholesterol biosynthesis, along with the effects of Abeta42 on these pathways in vitro. We found that neuroblastoma 2a (N2a) cells transfected with the human gene encoding amyloid-beta protein precursor (AbetaPP) (N2a-AbetaPP) produced Abeta and exhibited insulin resistance by reduced p-Akt and a suppressed cholesterol-synthesis pathway following insulin treatment, and by increased phosphorylation of insulin receptor subunit-1 at serine 612 (p-IRS-S612) as compared to parental N2a cells. Treatment of human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells with Abeta42 also increased p-IRS-S612, suggesting that Abeta42 is responsible for insulin resistance. The insulin resistance was alleviated when N2a-AbetaPP cells were treated with higher insulin concentrations. Insulin increased Abeta release from N2a-AbetaPP cells, by which it may promote Abeta clearance. Insulin increased cholesterol-synthesis gene expression in SH-SY5Y and N2a cells, including 24-dehydrocholesterol reductase (DHCR24) and 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGCR) through sterol-regulatory element-binding protein-2 (SREBP2). While Abeta42-treated SH-SY5Y cells exhibited increased HMGCR expression and c-Jun phosphorylation as pro-inflammatory responses, they also showed down-regulation of neuro-protective/anti-inflammatory DHCR24. These results suggest that Abeta42 may cause insulin resistance, activate JNK for c-Jun phosphorylation, and lead to dysregulation of cholesterol homeostasis, and that enhancing insulin signaling may relieve the insulin-resistant phenotype and the dysregulated cholesterol-synthesis pathway to promote Abeta release for clearance from neural cells.
27206884	Immunolocalization of Tom1 in relation to protein degradation systems in Alzheimer's disease.	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age-related neurodegenerative disorder. Its pathological hallmarks are senile plaques (SPs), which contain extracellular deposits of amyloid beta (Abeta) protein fibrils and dystrophic neurites (DNs), and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) containing hyperphosphorylated tau. Impairment of protein-degradation systems, including the ubiquitin-proteasome and the autophagy-lysosome systems, has been proposed as one of the causes of the accumulation of these aberrant proteins in AD brains. Tom1 (target of Myb1) was originally identified by the induction of its expression by the v-Myb oncogene and is a part of two major protein-degradation systems. The present study was conducted by immunohistochemical and immunofluorescent stainings to show that Tom1 was localized in DNs, perisomatic granules (PSGs), and NFTs in AD brains. Moreover, in DNs, Tom1 colocalized with ubiquitin, lysosomal proteins, and Tom1-related proteins (Tollip and myosin VI), which act in both protein-degradation systems via Tom1. These results indicate that Tom1 plays important roles in protein-degradation systems in AD pathogenesis.
27206882	Blood glucose levels and cortical thinning in cognitively normal, middle-aged adults.	Type II diabetes mellitus (DM) increases risk for cognitive decline and is associated with brain atrophy in older demented and non-demented individuals. We investigated (1) the cross-sectional association between fasting blood glucose level and cortical thickness in a sample of largely middle-aged, cognitively normal adults, and (2) whether these associations were modified by genes associated with both lipid processing and dementia. To explore possible modifications by genetic status, we investigated the interaction between blood glucose levels and the apolipoprotein E (APOE) epsilon4 allele and the translocase of the outer mitochondrial membrane (TOMM) 40 '523 genotype on cortical thickness. Cortical thickness measures were based on mean thickness in a subset of a priori-selected brain regions hypothesized to be vulnerable to atrophy in Alzheimer's disease (AD) (i.e., 'AD vulnerable regions'). Participants included 233 cognitively normal subjects in the BIOCARD study who had a measure of fasting blood glucose and cortical thickness measures, quantified by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. After adjustment for age, sex, race, education, depression, and medical conditions, higher blood glucose was associated with thinner parahippocampal gyri (B=-0.002; 95% CI -0.004, -0.0004) and temporal pole (B=-0.002; 95% CI -0.004, -0.0001), as well as reduced average thickness over AD vulnerable regions (B=-0.001; 95% CI -0.002, -0.0001). There was no evidence for greater cortical thinning in epsilon4 carriers of the APOE gene or in APOE epsilon3/3 individuals carrying the TOMM40 VL/VL genotypes. When individuals with glucose levels in the diabetic range (>/=126mg/dL), were excluded from the analysis, the associations between glucose levels and cortical thickness were no longer significant. These findings suggest that glucose levels in the diabetic range are associated with reduced cortical thickness in AD vulnerable regions as early as middle age.
27206864	Age-dependent cognitive and affective differences in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases in relation to MRI findings.	OBJECTIVE: To compare age-dependent changes in cognitive and affective functions related to white matter changes between patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). METHODS: We retrospectively compared age-dependent cognitive and affective functions in 216 AD patients, 153 PD patients, and 103 healthy controls with cerebral white matter lesions (WMLs), periventricular hyperintensity (PVH), deep white matter hyperintensity (DWMH), micro-bleeds (MBs), and lacunar infarcts (LIs). RESULTS: The average mini-mental state examination (MMSE) scores were 19.6+/-6.1 and 26.8+/-3.6 in AD and PD patients, respectively. Significant decreases were found in the MMSE score, Hasegawa's dementia scale-revised (HDS-R) score, frontal assessment battery score, and Abe's BPSD score (ABS) among the age-dependent AD subgroups and in the MMSE, HDS-R, Montreal cognitive assessment, geriatric depression scale, and ABS scores among the age-dependent PD subgroups; they were worse in AD patients. White matter changes were observed in >88% and >72% of patients with AD and PD, respectively. An age-dependent direct comparison of AD and PD showed significant differences in the PVH and DWMH grades, and numbers of MBs and LIs. CONCLUSION: WML-related cognitive and affective functions worsen with age in AD and PD patients; however, the abnormalities were more frequent and stronger in AD patients.
27206648	Impact of frequent cerebrospinal fluid sampling on Abeta levels: systematic approach to elucidate influencing factors.	BACKGROUND: Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides are predictive biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease and are proposed as pharmacodynamic markers for amyloid-lowering therapies. However, frequent sampling results in fluctuating CSF Abeta levels that have a tendency to increase compared with baseline. The impact of sampling frequency, volume, catheterization procedure, and ibuprofen pretreatment on CSF Abeta levels using continuous sampling over 36 h was assessed. METHODS: In this open-label biomarker study, healthy participants (n = 18; either sex, age 55-85 years) were randomized into one of three cohorts (n = 6/cohort; high-frequency sampling). In all cohorts except cohort 2 (sampling started 6 h post catheterization), sampling through lumbar catheterization started immediately post catheterization. Cohort 3 received ibuprofen (800 mg) before catheterization. Following interim data review, an additional cohort 4 (n = 6) with an optimized sampling scheme (low-frequency and lower volume) was included. CSF Abeta(1-37), Abeta(1-38), Abeta(1-40), and Abeta(1-42) levels were analyzed. RESULTS: Increases and fluctuations in mean CSF Abeta levels occurred in cohorts 1-3 at times of high-frequency sampling. Some outliers were observed (cohorts 2 and 3) with an extreme pronunciation of this effect. Cohort 4 demonstrated minimal fluctuation of CSF Abeta both on a group and an individual level. Intersubject variability in CSF Abeta profiles over time was observed in all cohorts. CONCLUSIONS: CSF Abeta level fluctuation upon catheterization primarily depends on the sampling frequency and volume, but not on the catheterization procedure or inflammatory reaction. An optimized low-frequency sampling protocol minimizes or eliminates fluctuation of CSF Abeta levels, which will improve the capability of accurately measuring the pharmacodynamic read-out for amyloid-lowering therapies. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01436188 . Registered 15 September 2011.
27206484	Novel PSEN1 G209A mutation in early-onset Alzheimer dementia supported by structural prediction.	BACKGROUND: Three main genes are described as causative genes for early-onset Alzheimer dementia (EOAD): APP, PSEN1 and PSEN2. We describe a woman with EOAD had a novel PSEN1 mutation. CASE REPORT: A 54-year-old right-handed woman presented 12-year history of progressive memory decline. She was clinically diagnosed as familial Alzheimer's disease due to a PSEN1 mutation. One of two daughters also has the same mutation, G209A in the TM-IV of PS1 protein. Her mother had unspecified dementia that began at the age of 40s. PolyPhen2 and SIFT prediction suggested that G209A might be a damaging variant with high scores. 3D modeling revealed that G209A exchange could result significant changes in the PS1 protein. CONCLUSION: We report a case of EOAD having probable novel PSEN1 (G209A) mutation verified with structural prediction.
27203115	SnapShot: Microglia in Disease.	The development and maintenance of the central nervous system is dependent upon regulated, homeostatic actions of microglia, which sculpt and refine neuronal circuitry. By contrast, dysregulation of microglia contributes to the pathology of neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism spectrum disorders; neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease; and schizophrenia and chronic neuropathic pain.
27196881	In Vitro Antioxidant, Anti-Diabetes, Anti-Dementia, and Inflammation Inhibitory Effect of Trametes pubescens Fruiting Body Extracts.	Trametes pubescens, white rot fungus, has been used for folk medicine in Asian countries to treat ailments such as cancer and gastrointestinal diseases. This study was initiated to evaluate the in vitro antioxidant, anti-diabetes, anti-dementia, and anti-inflammatory activities of T. pubescens fruiting bodies. The 1,1-diphenyl-2-picryl-hydrazyl (DPPH) free radical scavenging activities of T. pubescens methanol (ME) and hot water (HWE) extracts (2.0 mg/mL) were comparable to butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), the positive control. However, the chelating effects of ME and HWE were significantly higher than that of BHT. The HWE (6 mg/mL) also showed comparable reducing power to BHT. Eleven phenol compounds were detected by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis. The alpha-amylase and alpha-glucosidase inhibitory activities of the ME and HWE of the mushroom were lower than Acarbose, the standard reference; however, the inhibitory effects of the mushroom extracts at 2.0 mg/mL were moderate. The acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) inhibitory effects of ME and HWE were moderate and comparable with galanthamine, the standard drug to treat early stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The ME had a neuroprotective effect against glutamate-induced PC-12 cell cytotoxicity at the concentration range of 2-40 mug/mL. The mushroom extracts also showed inflammation inhibitory activities such as production of nitric oxide (NO) and expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced murine macrophage-like cell lines (RAW 264.7) and significantly suppressed the carrageenan-induced rat paw-edema. Therefore, fruiting body extracts of T. pubescens demonstrated antioxidant related anti-diabetes, anti-dementia and anti-inflammatory activities.
27196880	Naturally Inspired Molecules as Multifunctional Agents for Alzheimer's Disease Treatment.	Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been defined as a multi-factorial disorder resulting from a complex array of networked cellular and molecular mechanisms. In particular, elevated levels of Abeta protein and its aggregation products in the presence of metal ions proved to be highly neurotoxic and therapeutic strategies aimed at preventing Abeta generation and oxidative stress may represent an effective approach for AD treatment. A recent paradigm for the treatment of complex diseases such as AD suggests the employment of multifunctional compounds, single chemical entities capable of simultaneously modulating different targets involved in the pathology. In this paper, the "pharmacophores combination" strategy was applied, connecting the main scaffold of the BACE-1 ligand 1 to that of the chalcone 2, as metal chelating pharmacophore, to obtain a small library of compounds. Conjugate 5 emerged as the most interesting derivative, proving to inhibit BACE-1 with low-micromolar potency, and showing neuroprotective effects. In particular, 5 proved to be able to protect from metal-associated oxidative stress by hampering intracellular Cu(2+)-induced ROS formation without any direct neurotoxic effect.
27193889	The algorithm for Alzheimer risk assessment based on APOE promoter polymorphisms.	BACKGROUND: Over the past two decades, the APOE gene and its polymorphisms have been among the most studied risk factors of Alzheimer disease (AD) development; yet, there are discrepancies between various studies regarding their impact. For this reason, the evaluation of the APOE genotype has not been included in the current European Federation of Neurological Societies guidelines for AD diagnosis and management. This aim of this study was to add to this discussion by assessing the possible influence of multiple polymorphisms in the promoter region of the APOE gene and genotypes of its allele E on the risk for dementia. METHODS: We performed a comprehensive analysis of APOE gene polymorphisms, assessed the detected genotypes and correlated molecular findings with serum apolipoprotein E concentrations. The study comprised 110 patients with AD and 110 age-matched healthy individuals from the Polish population. RESULTS: Four polymorphisms of the APOE gene had minor allele frequency exceeding 5% and were included in the analysis: -491A/T (rs449647), -427T/C (rs769446), -219T/G (rs405509) in the promoter region and +113G/C (rs440446) in intron 1. A protective effect of the -219G allele on AD development was observed. Also, the -491T and -219G alleles were found to be underrepresented in the carriers of the APOE E4 variant. On the basis of the genotype and linkage disequilibrium studies, a relative score was attributed to given genotypes with respect to the estimated probability of their protective effects against AD, giving rise to the 'preventive score'. This 'preventive score', based on the total sums of the relative scores, expresses the protective effect deriving from the synergistic action of individual single-nucleotide polymorphisms. The 'preventive score' was identified as an independent predictive factor. CONCLUSIONS: We propose a novel, more complex approach to AD risk assessment based on the additive effect of multiple polymorphic loci within the APOE promoter region, which on their own may have too weak an impact to reach the level of significance. This has potentially practical implications, as it may help to improve the informative potential of APOE testing in a clinical setting. Subsequent studies of the proposed system in large, multi-ethnic cohorts are necessary for its validation and to assess its potential practical value for clinical applications.
27191912	A methodological study of locus coeruleus degeneration in dementing disorders.	BACKGROUND: Degeneration of the locus coeruleus (LC) of the brain stem is a recognized phenomenon in Alzheimer's disease (AD), in dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and in Parkinson's disease with dementia (PDD). Prior studies have suggested that LC degeneration can be used to differentiate various dementing disorders histologically, but the paucity of methodological data may hamper systematic research on this nucleus. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate various approaches to quantifying LC degeneration in dementing disorders, and to inform future decisions regarding the most appropriate method for diagnostics and research. METHODS: 105 LCs from brains of demented individuals with AD, DLB/PDD, vascular dementia (VaD), mixed dementia (AD+VaD), or frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) were examined, and the extent of LC degeneration was assessed using macroscopic evaluation, cell counting, and two degeneration scales. Scores were compared across diagnostic categories; diagnostic utility and intra- and interobserver reliability were assessed. RESULTS: AD and DLB/PDD were associated with greater LC damage using either assessment method, significantly different from VaD and FTLD. Macroscopic appearance was informative, but cell counting was more sensitive and specific. The degeneration scales did not add significant diagnostic value over cell counting and were associated with greater observer variability. CONCLUSIONS: The LC degenerates in certain dementia subtypes, especially in AD and DLB/PDD. Macroscopic assessment of the LC postmortem can be used to differentiate between disorders associated with degeneration (AD, DLB/PDD) or sparing (VaD) of the LC, but counting LC cells in a representative pontine section is the most appropriate method by which to assess LC degeneration.
27190655	Role of Striatal-Enriched Tyrosine Phosphatase in Neuronal Function.	Striatal-enriched protein tyrosine phosphatase (STEP) is a CNS-enriched protein implicated in multiple neurologic and neuropsychiatric disorders. STEP regulates key signaling proteins required for synaptic strengthening as well as NMDA and AMPA receptor trafficking. Both high and low levels of STEP disrupt synaptic function and contribute to learning and behavioral deficits. High levels of STEP are present in human postmortem samples and animal models of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and schizophrenia and in animal models of fragile X syndrome. Low levels of STEP activity are present in additional disorders that include ischemia, Huntington's chorea, alcohol abuse, and stress disorders. Thus the current model of STEP is that optimal levels are required for optimal synaptic function. Here we focus on the role of STEP in Alzheimer's disease and the mechanisms by which STEP activity is increased in this illness. Both genetic lowering of STEP levels and pharmacological inhibition of STEP activity in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease reverse the biochemical and cognitive abnormalities that are present. These findings suggest that STEP is an important point for modulation of proteins required for synaptic plasticity.
27190492	Histamine and Immune Biomarkers in CNS Disorders.	Neuroimmune dysregulation is a common phenomenon in different forms of central nervous system (CNS) disorders. Cross-links between central and peripheral immune mechanisms appear to be disrupted as reflected by a series of immune markers (CD3, CD4, CD7, HLA-DR, CD25, CD28, and CD56) which show variability in brain disorders such as anxiety, depression, psychosis, stroke, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, migraine, epilepsy, vascular dementia, mental retardation, cerebrovascular encephalopathy, multiple sclerosis, brain tumors, cranial nerve neuropathies, mental retardation, and posttraumatic brain injury. Histamine (HA) is a pleiotropic monoamine involved in several neurophysiological functions, neuroimmune regulation, and CNS pathogenesis. Changes in brain HA show an age- and sex-related pattern, and alterations in brain HA levels are present in different CNS regions of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Brain HA in neuronal and nonneuronal compartments plays a dual role (neurotrophic versus neurotoxic) in a tissue-specific manner. Pathogenic mechanisms associated with neuroimmune dysregulation in AD involve HA, interleukin-1beta, and TNF-alpha, whose aberrant expression contributes to neuroinflammation as an aggravating factor for neurodegeneration and premature neuronal death.
27188740	Amyloid beta directed antibody for Alzheimer's disease, an evidence based meta-analysis.	In several preclinical researches, antibody of Aacting directly in the central nervous system showed a great efficacy on the clearance of plaques. However, the other researches were opposite. We performed a meta-analysis to evaluate the amyloid-beta-directed antibody treatment of Alzheimer's disease. We searched Pubmed, Web of science, Embase and Cochrane library. Pooled data was calculated by standard mean difference. The heterogeneity and publication bias were evaluated by I2 and funnel plot. Totally, 5 RCTs (randomized clinical trials) with high qualities were included. There weas no difference of mean change form baseline between therapy and placebo group based on Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE, SMD = 0.00, p = 0.97, 95% CI = -0.23 0.22) and Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB, SMD = 0.22, p = 0.39, 95% CI = -0.28 0.71), but a significant decrease according to Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-cog, SMD = 0.07, p = 0.01, 95% CI = -0.02 0.13). In conclusion, Antibody was not benefit for AD based on MMSE and CDR-SB but had a little effect according to ADAS-cog.
27188425	The synergistic risk effect of apolipoprotein epsilon4 and DNA (cytosine-5-)-methyltransferase 3 beta (DNMT3B) haplotype for Alzheimer's disease.	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex and multifactorial disease with the contribution of several genes and polymorphisms to its development. Among these genes, the APOEepsilon4 is the best known risk factor for AD. Methylation is associated with APOE expression and AD development. Recently, we found an association of the TGG haplotype in the DNMT3B gene, one of the catalyst enzyme for methylation, with AD. Therefore, the objective of the study was to investigate whether APOEepsilon4 and TGG haplotype have an synergistic effect on AD. The sample was composed of 212 Caucasian individuals (108 healthy controls and 104 with AD by NINCDS-ADRDA and DSM-IV-TR criteria) from southern Brazil. The genetic analyses were performed by real time PCR for TaqMan((R)) assay. Multivariate logistic regression was performed categorizing groups according to presence of APOEepsilon4 and/or TGG haplotype as an independent variable for outcome AD. The presence of TGG haplotype plus the allele APOEepsilon4 were strongly associated with AD [OR 11.13; 95 % CI (4.25-29.16); P < 0.001]. This association had a higher risk than each risk factor alone. We found a strong association of the interaction of DNMT3B gene with the APOEepsilon4 in this sample of AD patients. The presence of TGG haplotype and APOEepsilon4 significantly increased the risk of developing the disease, showing an synergistic effect.
27185631	Endoplasmic reticulum stress mediates JNK-dependent IRS-1 serine phosphorylation and results in Tau hyperphosphorylation in amyloid beta oligomer-treated PC12 cells and primary neurons.	AIMS: Endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) and insulin signaling impairment are commonly observed in Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the association between these two factors in AD has not been carefully studied. In peripheral insulin signaling impairment, ERS interferes with insulin signaling through c-Jun. N-terminal kinase (JNK)-dependent insulin receptor substance-1 (IRS-1) serine phosphorylation. We conducted this study to determine whether a similar mechanism contributes to insulin signaling impairment in AD pathogenesis. METHODS: Changes in the levels of ERS markers, JNK activation, the insulin signaling status and Tau hyperphosphorylation were examined in amyloid beta1-42 (Abeta1-42) oligomer-treated PC12 cells and primary neurons by western blotting and real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR. Inhibitors of ERS and JNK were utilized to confirm their association. RESULTS: Our results demonstrated that Abeta1-42 oligomers significantly induced ERS and JNK activation. In addition, in response to Abeta1-42 oligomers, IRS-1 phosphorylation at serines 307, 318 and 612 was increased. Further, an increase in Tau hyperphosphorylation at threonine 181 was observed following Abeta1-42 oligomer treatment. Moreover, inhibition of ERS or JNK could partially reverse the changes induced by the Abeta1-42 oligomers. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that ERS may contribute to insulin signaling impairment in AD through JNK-dependent IRS-1 serine phosphorylation. The ERS/JNK/IRS-1 pathway may be involved in Abeta1-42 oligomer-induced Tau hyperphosphorylation in AD.
27185022	Brain in Congenital Heart Disease Across the Lifespan: The Cumulative Burden of Injury.	The number of patients surviving with congenital heart disease (CHD) has soared over the last 3 decades. Adults constitute the fastest-growing segment of the CHD population, now outnumbering children. Research to date on the heart-brain intersection in this population has been focused largely on neurodevelopmental outcomes in childhood and adolescence. Mutations in genes that are highly expressed in heart and brain may cause cerebral dysgenesis. Together with altered cerebral perfusion in utero, these factors are associated with abnormalities of brain structure and brain immaturity in a significant portion of neonates with critical CHD even before they undergo cardiac surgery. In infancy and childhood, the brain may be affected by risk factors related to heart disease itself or to its interventional treatments. As children with CHD become adults, they increasingly develop heart failure, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and coronary disease. These acquired cardiovascular comorbidities can be expected to have effects similar to those in the general population on cerebral blood flow, brain volumes, and dementia. In both children and adults, cardiovascular disease may have adverse effects on achievement, executive function, memory, language, social interactions, and quality of life. Against the backdrop of shifting demographics, risk factors for brain injury in the CHD population are cumulative and synergistic. As neurodevelopmental sequelae in children with CHD evolve to cognitive decline or dementia during adulthood, a growing population of CHD can be expected to require support services. We highlight evidence gaps and future research directions.
27183980	The Use of Stilbene Scaffold in Medicinal Chemistry and Multi- Target Drug Design.	The stilbene scaffold is a basic element for a number of biologically active natural and synthetic compounds, and it is considered as a privileged structure. Stilbenes exemplified by resveratrol, combretastatin A-4 and pterostilbene are of significant interest for drug research and development because of their potential in therapeutic and preventive application. Resveratrol, present in grapes and other food products, plays a role in the prevention of several human pathological processes and has been suggested as an anticancer agent. Moreover, recent evidence has revealed its potential effect on the aging process, diabetes and neurological dysfunction. Combretastatin A-4, from the bark of South African bush willow Combretum caffrum, also shows significant antitumor activity. Pterostilbene is closely related to resveratrol, sharing the same unique therapeutic potential as anti-inflammatory, antineoplastic and antioxidant agent. Therefore, research and development of stilbene-based medicinal chemistry have become rapidly evolving and increasingly active topics covering almost the whole range of therapeutic fields. In the present review, we provide an overview of the role of stilbenes in medicinal chemistry. In this context, we highlight the chemical methodologies adopted for the synthesis of stilbene derivatives, and outline the successful design of novel stilbene based hybrids in the field of cancer, Alzheimer's and other relevant diseases. This information may be useful in further design of stilbene-based molecules as new leads for the development of novel agents with clinical potential or as effective chemical probes to dissect biological processes.
27180966	[The biological role of sulfatides].	Sulfatides (3-O-sulfogalactosylceramides, sulfated galactocerebrosides, SM4) are esters of sulfuric acid with galactosylceramides. These acidic glycosphingolipids, present at the external leaflet of the plasma membrane, are synthesized by a variety of mammalian cells. They are especially abundant in the myelin sheath of oligodendrocytes in the central nervous system and Schwann cells in the peripheral nervous system. Studies using cerebroside galactosyltransferase-deficient mice revealed that sulfatides are responsible for proper structure and functioning of myelin. Large amounts of sulfatides are also found in the kidney, gastrointestinal tract, islets of Langerhans, and membranes of erythrocytes, thrombocytes and granulocytes. They are ligands for numerous proteins, but in most cases the biological role of such interactions is poorly understood. A notable exception is their binding by P- and L-selectins. Platelet sulfatides are major ligands for P-selectin, and this interaction is critical for the formation of stable platelet aggregates. Sulfatides also bind to chemokines, and seem to play a role in regulation of cytokine expression in human lymphocytes and monocytes. Aberrant metabolism of sulfatides, could cause several important human diseases. In this article, we describe the changes in sulfatide expression associated with such nervous disorders as metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD), Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease, and several types of cancer, e.g. colon cancer, kidney cancer, and ovarian cancer. We also discuss the involvement of sulfatides in cancer progression, diabetes and autoimmune and immune disorders such as multiple sclerosis. This acidic glycosphingolipids seem to play an important role in pathogenesis of infectious diseases, serving as receptors for binding various bacteria and viruses.
27180794	Homonymous Hemianopsia Associated with Probable Alzheimer's Disease.	Posterior cortical atrophy (PCA) is a rare neurodegenerative disorder that has cerebral atrophy in the parietal, occipital, or occipitotemporal cortices and is characterized by visuospatial and visuoperceptual impairments. The most cases are pathologically compatible with Alzheimer's disease (AD). We describe a case of PCA in which a combination of imaging methods, in conjunction with symptoms and neurological and neuropsychological examinations, led to its being diagnosed and to AD being identified as its probable cause. Treatment with donepezil for 6 months mildly improved alexia symptoms, but other symptoms remained unchanged. A 59-year-old Japanese woman with progressive alexia, visual deficit, and mild memory loss was referred to our neurologic clinic for the evaluation of right homonymous hemianopsia. Our neurological examination showed alexia, constructional apraxia, mild disorientation, short-term memory loss, and right homonymous hemianopsia. These findings resulted in a score of 23 (of 30) points on the Mini-Mental State Examination. Occipital atrophy was identified, with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showing left-side dominance. The MRI data were quantified with voxel-based morphometry, and PCA was diagnosed on the basis of these findings. Single photon emission computed tomography with (123)I-N-isopropyl-p-iodoamphetamine showed hypoperfusion in the corresponding voxel-based morphometry occipital lobes. Additionally, the finding of hypoperfusion in the posterior associate cortex, posterior cingulate gyrus, and precuneus was consistent with AD. Therefore, the PCA was considered to be a result of AD. We considered Lewy body dementia as a differential diagnosis because of the presence of hypoperfusion in the occipital lobes. However, the patient did not meet the criteria for Lewy body dementia during the course of the disease. We therefore consider including PCA in the differential diagnoses to be important for patients with visual deficit, cognitive impairment, and cerebral atrophy in the parietal, occipital, or occipitotemporal cortices. A combination of imaging methods, including MRI and single photon emission computed tomography, may help identify probable causes of PCA.
27176600	Target identification in Fusobacterium nucleatum by subtractive genomics approach and enrichment analysis of host-pathogen protein-protein interactions.	BACKGROUND: Fusobacterium nucleatum, a well studied bacterium in periodontal diseases, appendicitis, gingivitis, osteomyelitis and pregnancy complications has recently gained attention due to its association with colorectal cancer (CRC) progression. Treatment with berberine was shown to reverse F. nucleatum-induced CRC progression in mice by balancing the growth of opportunistic pathogens in tumor microenvironment. Intestinal microbiota imbalance and the infections caused by F. nucleatum might be regulated by therapeutic intervention. Hence, we aimed to predict drug target proteins in F. nucleatum, through subtractive genomics approach and host-pathogen protein-protein interactions (HP-PPIs). We also carried out enrichment analysis of host interacting partners to hypothesize the possible mechanisms involved in CRC progression due to F. nucleatum. RESULTS: In subtractive genomics approach, the essential, virulence and resistance related proteins were retrieved from RefSeq proteome of F. nucleatum by searching against Database of Essential Genes (DEG), Virulence Factor Database (VFDB) and Antibiotic Resistance Gene-ANNOTation (ARG-ANNOT) tool respectively. A subsequent hierarchical screening to identify non-human homologous, metabolic pathway-independent/pathway-specific and druggable proteins resulted in eight pathway-independent and 27 pathway-specific druggable targets. Co-aggregation of F. nucleatum with host induces proinflammatory gene expression thereby potentiates tumorigenesis. Hence, proteins from IBDsite, a database for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) research and those involved in colorectal adenocarcinoma as interpreted from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) were retrieved to predict drug targets based on HP-PPIs with F. nucleatum proteome. Prediction of HP-PPIs exhibited 186 interactions contributed by 103 host and 76 bacterial proteins. Bacterial interacting partners were accounted as putative targets. And enrichment analysis of host interacting partners showed statistically enriched terms that were in positive correlation with CRC, atherosclerosis, cardiovascular, osteoporosis, Alzheimer's and other diseases. CONCLUSION: Subtractive genomics analysis provided a set of target proteins suggested to be indispensable for survival and pathogenicity of F. nucleatum. These target proteins might be considered for designing potent inhibitors to abrogate F. nucleatum infections. From enrichment analysis, it was hypothesized that F. nucleatum infection might enhance CRC progression by simultaneously regulating multiple signaling cascades which could lead to up-regulation of proinflammatory responses, oncogenes, modulation of host immune defense mechanism and suppression of DNA repair system.
27176479	Neuroimaging basis in the conversion of aMCI patients with APOE-epsilon4 to AD: study protocol of a prospective diagnostic trial.	BACKGROUND: The epsilon4 allele of the Apolipoprotein E gene (APOE-epsilon4) is a potent genetic risk factor for sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD). Amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) is an intermediate state between normal cognitive aging and dementia, which is easy to convert to AD dementia. It is an urgent problem in the field of cognitive neuroscience to reveal the conversion of aMCI-epsilon4 to AD. Based on our preliminary work, we will study the neuroimaging features in the special group of aMCI-epsilon4 with multi-modality magnetic resonance imaging (structural MRI, resting state-fMRI and diffusion tensor imaging) longitudinally. METHODS/DESIGN: In this study, 200 right-handed subjects who are diagnosed as aMCI with APOE-epsilon4 will be recruited at the memory clinic of the Neurology Department, XuanWu Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China. All subjects will undergo the neuroimaging and neuropsychological evaluation at a 1 year-interval for 3 years. The primary outcome measures are 1) Microstructural alterations revealed with multimodal MRI scans including structure MRI (sMRI), resting state functional MRI (rs-fMRI), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI); 2) neuropsychological evaluation, including the World Health Organization-University of California-LosAngeles Auditory Verbal Learning Test (WHO-UCLA AVLT), Addenbrook's cognitive examination-revised (ACE-R), mini-mental state examination (MMSE), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Clinical Dementia Rating scale (CDR). DISCUSSION: This study is to find out the neuroimaging biomarker and the changing laws of the marker during the progress of aMCI-epsilon4 to AD, and the final purpose is to provide scientific evidence for new prevention, diagnosis and treatment of AD. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This study has been registered to ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02225964, https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ ) in August 24, 2014.
27176468	Molecular evaluation of herbal compounds as potent inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive disease and the predominant cause of dementia. Common symptoms include short-term memory loss, and confusion with time and place. Individuals with AD depend on their caregivers for assistance, and may pose a burden to them. The acetylcholinesterase (AChE) enzyme is a key target in AD and inhibition of this enzyme may be a promising strategy in the drug discovery process. In the present study, an inhibitory assay was carried out against AChE using total alkaloidal plants and herbal extracts commonly available in vegetable markets. Subsequently, molecular docking simulation analyses of the bioactive compounds present in the plants were conducted, as well as a proteinligand interaction analysis. The stability of the docked proteinligand complex was assessed by 20 ns molecular dynamics simulation. The inhibitory assay demonstrated that Uncaria rhynchophylla and Portulaca oleracea were able to inhibit AChE. In addition, molecular docking simulation analyses indicated that catechin present in Uncaria rhynchophylla, and dopamine and norepinephrine present in Portulaca oleracea, had the best docking scores and interaction energy. In conclusion, catechin in Uncaria rhynchophylla, and dopamine and norepinephrine in Portulaca oleracea may be used to treat AD.
27176461	Bapineuzumab for mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease in two global, randomized, phase 3 trials.	BACKGROUND: Our objective was to evaluate the efficacy (clinical and biomarker) and safety of intravenous bapineuzumab in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHODS: Two of four phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 18-month trials were conducted globally: one in apolipoprotein E epsilon4 carriers and another in noncarriers. Patients received bapineuzumab 0.5 mg/kg (both trials) or 1.0 mg/kg (noncarrier trial) or placebo every 13 weeks. Coprimary endpoints were change from baseline to week 78 on the 11-item Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive subscale and the Disability Assessment for Dementia. RESULTS: A total of 683 and 329 patients completed the current carrier and noncarrier trials, respectively, which were terminated prematurely owing to lack of efficacy in the two other phase 3 trials of bapineuzumab in AD. The current trials showed no significant difference between bapineuzumab and placebo for the coprimary endpoints and no effect of bapineuzumab on amyloid load or cerebrospinal fluid phosphorylated tau. (Both measures were stable over time in the placebo group.) Amyloid-related imaging abnormalities with edema or effusion were confirmed as the most notable adverse event. CONCLUSIONS: These phase 3 global trials confirmed lack of efficacy of bapineuzumab at tested doses on clinical endpoints in patients with mild to moderate AD. Some differences in the biomarker results were seen compared with the other phase 3 bapineuzumab trials. No unexpected adverse events were observed. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Noncarriers (3000) ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT00667810 ; registered 24 Apr 2008. Carriers (3001) ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT00676143 ; registered 2 May 2008.
27175669	The Association Between Genetic Polymorphism rs703842 in CYP27B1 and Multiple Sclerosis: A Meta-Analysis.	Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most frequent nontraumatic disabling neurological disease among young adults. Previous studies have examined the association of rs703842 in CYP27B1 with MS susceptibility, with inconsistent results reported.The objective of this study is to conduct a systematic literature search and perform meta-analyses to examine whether rs703842 is associated with MS risk.We searched potential literature in PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, Google Scholar, Web of Science, and HuGE by using the following inclusion criteria: studies were on human subjects; the studies were case-control studies; studies included subjects who had MS and those who did not have MS; and the studies provided genotype data for rs703842 for subjects who had and did not have MS, or provided odds ratios (ORs) and the 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for assessing the association of rs703842 with MS, or provided sufficient data for the calculation of OR and the 95% CI. We used random-effects models to calculate the OR as a measure of association. We used I to assess between-study heterogeneity, and a funnel plot and Egger test to assess publication bias.Seven studies published since 2008 met the eligibility criteria and were included in the meta-analyses. We found that the C allele was significantly associated with reduced MS susceptibility (OR = 0.88, 95% CI: 0.80-0.89; P < 0.0001). We also found significant association of rs703842 with MS risk using a dominant and a recessive model (both P < 0.0002). Our results remain unchanged if our meta-analysis was limited to studies that included only Caucasian participants (OR = 0.85, 95% CI: 0.80-0.90; P < 0.0001).Our study has several limitations: The sample size is limited; We were unable to control for some important confounding factors as data for individual participant were not available; and Most of the included studies focus on MS risk in Caucasian. As a result, we could not perform meta-analysis for assessing the relationship in other ethnic groups.In summary, we found that the genetic variant rs703842 in CYP27B1 is associated with MS risk in Caucasians. More studies with larger sample size that control for important confounding factors are needed to validate the findings from this study.
27174134	Coumarins as cholinesterase inhibitors: A review.	The first report in literature of the isolation of coumarin was in the year 1820. After this report, other papers were published demonstrating the isolation and synthesis of coumarin and analogues. These compounds have been studying along the years for several different pathologies. One of these pathologies was Alzheimer's disease (AD), being the main cause of dementia in the contemporary world. There are two hypotheses to explain the pathogenesis mechanism and disease symptoms, then having the "amyloid hypothesis" and the "cholinergic hypothesis". Some drugs for AD are based on the theory of "cholinergic hypothesis", which objective is to increase the concentration of ACh in the synaptic cleft by the inhibition of cholinesterases. Over the last twenty years, many studies with coumarins compounds were reported as cholinesterases inhibitors. The aim of the present review is to discuss the studies and development of new compounds for AD treatment.
27173630	[Benefits of aromatherapy in dementia special care units].	Aromatherapy is classed as a non-pharmacological treatment, recognised as a therapy for certain disorders. This practice was the subject of a study in a special care unit for patients with dementia. The objective was to demonstrate the benefit of aromatherapy diffusion on major behavioural disorders.
27173629	[The non-meaningfulness of psycho-behavioural disorders with dementia].	Dementia questions and undermines the content exchanged and relational codes. What is the true nature of these disorders? While they are not psychotic disorders, they evoke a psychiatric revelation of Alzheimer's disease. It is therefore necessary to design a mental health policy which is equal for everyone and encourage ethical reflection around the issue of care.
27168327	Carnosic Acid Prevents Beta-Amyloid-Induced Injury in Human Neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y Cells via the Induction of Autophagy.	Beta-amyloid (Abeta), the hallmark protein in Alzheimer's disease (AD), induces neurotoxicity that involves oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction, leading to cell death. Carnosic acid (CA), a polyphenolic diterpene isolated from the herb rosemary (Rosemarinus officinalis), was investigated in our study to assess its neuroprotective effect and underlying mechanism against Abeta-induced injury in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. We found that CA pretreatment alleviated the Abeta25-35-induced loss of cell viability, inhibited both Abeta1-42 accumulation and tau hyperphosphorylation, reduced reactive oxygen species generation, and maintained the mitochondrial membrane potential. Moreover, CA increased the microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3)-II/I ratio and decreased SQSTM1(p62), indicating that CA could induce autophagy. Autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine (3-MA) attenuated the neuroprotective effect of CA, suggesting that autophagy was involved in the neuroprotection of CA. It was also observed that CA activated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) but inhibited mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). Furthermore, blocking AMPK with si-AMPKalpha successfully inhibited the upregulation of LC3-II/I, prevented the downregulation of phosphorylation of mTOR and SQSTM1(p62), indicating that CA induced autophagy in SH-SY5Y cells via the activation of AMPK. These results suggested that CA might be a potential agent for preventing AD.
27167887	[Non-invasive brain stimulation in neurology : Transcranial direct current stimulation to enhance cognitive functioning].	Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has been successfully used in neuroscientific research to modulate cognitive functions. Recent studies suggested that improvement of behavioral performance is associated with tDCS-induced modulation of neuronal activity and connectivity. Thus, tDCS may also represent a promising tool for reconstitution of cognitive functions in the context of memory decline related to Alzheimer's disease or aphasia following stroke; however, evidence from randomized sham-controlled clinical trials is still scarce. Initial results of tDCS-induced behavioral improvement in patients with Alzheimer's dementia and its precursors indicated that an intense memory training combined with tDCS may be effective. Early interventions in the stage of mild cognitive impairment could be crucial but further evidence is needed to substantiate this. In patients with aphasia following stroke tDCS was applied to the left and right hemispheres, with varying results depending on the severity of the symptoms and polarity of the stimulation. Patients with mild aphasia can benefit from tDCS of the language dominant hemisphere while in patients with severe aphasia tDCS of right hemispheric homologous brain language areas may be particularly relevant. Moreover, recent studies suggested that an intervention in the subacute phase of aphasia could be most promising. In summary, tDCS could provide the exciting possibility to reconstitute cognitive functions in patients with neurological disorders. Future studies have to elucidate whether tDCS can be used in the clinical routine to prevent further cognitive decline in neurodegenerative diseases and whether beneficial effects from experimental studies translate into long-term improvement in activities of daily life.
27167886	[Geriatrics - an interdisciplinary challenge].	The care of elderly patients will continue to challenge the healthcare system over the next decades. As a rule geriatric patients suffer from multimorbidities with complex disease patterns, and the ability to cope with everyday life is severely reduced. Treatment is provided by a multiprofessional geriatric team, and the primary goal is improvement of functional status, quality of life in the social environment and autonomy by employing a holistic approach. In Germany geriatric care is provided by physicians from various medical specialties (e.g. general practitioners, internists, neurologists and psychiatrists). In the training for the subspecialty clinical geriatrics, these specialties enjoy equal rights. Recent efforts to establish a qualification as physician for internal medicine and geriatrics have initiated a discussion to make the suitability for qualification as a geriatrician dependent on the medical specialty. Geriatric patients benefit from multidisciplinary cooperation. Neurologists possess great expertise in the treatment of patients with dementia, depression, delirium, consequences of degenerative spinal cord diseases and vertebral bone fractures, stroke, Parkinson's syndrome, epileptic seizures, vertigo and dizziness, neuropathies, lesions of peripheral nerves and in the multimodal therapy of pain. To function in a position of responsibility in a geriatric department, neurologists need skills in general internal medicine. These are acquired either on a geriatric ward or during specialization as a neurologist by full time secondment to large neurological or interdisciplinary intensive care units.
27165411	A retrospective population based cohort study of access to specialist palliative care in the last year of life: who is still missing out a decade on?	BACKGROUND: Historically, specialist palliative care has been accessed by a greater proportion of people dying with cancer compared to people with other life-limiting conditions. More recently, a variety of measures to improve access to palliative care for people dying from non-cancer conditions have been implemented. There are few rigorous population-based studies that document changes in palliative care service delivery relative to the number of patients who could benefit from such services. METHOD: A retrospective cohort study of the last year of life of persons with an underlying cause of death in 2009-10 from cancer, heart failure, renal failure, liver failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, Alzheimer's disease, motor neurone disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease and/or HIV/AIDS. The proportion of decedents receiving specialist palliative care was compared to a 2000-02 cohort. Logistic regression models were used identify social and demographic factors associated with accessing specialist palliative care. RESULTS: There were 12,817 deaths included into the cohort; 7166 (56 %) from cancer, 527 (4 %) from both cancer and non-cancer conditions and 5124 (40 %) from non-cancer conditions. Overall, 46.3 % of decedents received community and/or hospital based specialist palliative care; a 3.5 % (95 % CI 2.3-4.7) increase on specialist palliative care access reported ten years earlier. The majority (69 %; n = 4928) of decedents with cancer accessed palliative care during the last year of life. Only 14 % (n = 729) of decedents with non-cancer conditions accessed specialist palliative care, however, this represented a 6.1 % (95 % CI 4.9-7.3) increase on the specialist palliative care access reported for the same decedent group ten years earlier. Compared to decedents with heart failure, increased odds of palliative care access was observed for decedents with cancer (OR 10.5; 95 % CI 9.1-12.2), renal failure (OR 1.5; 95 % CI 1.3-1.9), liver failure (OR 2.3; 95 % CI 1.7-3.3) or motor neurone disease (OR 4.5; 95 % CI 3.1-6.6). Living in major cities, being female, having a partner and living in a private residence was associated with increased odds of access to specialist palliative care. CONCLUSION: There is small but significant increase in access to specialist palliative care services in Western Australia, specifically in patients dying with non-cancer conditions.
27164846	Contact heat sensitivity and reports of unpleasantness in communicative people with mild to moderate cognitive impairment in Alzheimer's disease: a cross-sectional study.	BACKGROUND: Compared to healthy controls, people with Alzheimer's disease (AD) have been shown to receive less pain medication and report pain less frequently. It is unknown if these findings reflect less perceived pain in AD, an inability to recognize pain, or an inability to communicate pain. METHODS: To further examine aspects of pain processing in AD, we conducted a cross-sectional study of sex-matched adults >/=65 years old with and without AD (AD: n = 40, female = 20, median age = 75; control: n = 40, female = 20, median age = 70) to compare the psychophysical response to contact-evoked perceptual heat thresholds of warmth, mild pain, and moderate pain, and self-reported unpleasantness for each percept. RESULTS: When compared to controls, participants with AD required higher temperatures to report sensing warmth (Cohen's d = 0.64, p = 0.002), mild pain (Cohen's d = 0.51, p = 0.016), and moderate pain (Cohen's d = 0.45, p = 0.043). Conversely, there were no significant between-group differences in unpleasantness ratings (p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The between-group findings demonstrate that when compared to controls, people with AD are less sensitive to the detection of thermal pain but do not differ in affective response to the unpleasant aspects of thermal pain. These findings suggest that people with AD may experience greater levels of pain and potentially greater levels of tissue or organ damage prior to identifying and reporting injury. This finding may help to explain the decreased frequency of pain reports and consequently a lower administration of analgesics in AD.
27164711	Myo-inositol changes precede amyloid pathology and relate to APOE genotype in Alzheimer disease.	OBJECTIVE: We aimed to test whether in vivo levels of magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) metabolites myo-inositol (mI), N-acetylaspartate (NAA), and choline are abnormal already during preclinical Alzheimer disease (AD), relating these changes to amyloid or tau pathology, and functional connectivity. METHODS: In this cross-sectional multicenter study (a subset of the prospective Swedish BioFINDER study), we included 4 groups, representing the different stages of predementia AD: (1) cognitively healthy elderly with normal CSF beta-amyloid 42 (Abeta42), (2) cognitively healthy elderly with abnormal CSF Abeta42, (3) patients with subjective cognitive decline and abnormal CSF Abeta42, (4) patients with mild cognitive decline and abnormal CSF Abeta42 (Ntotal = 352). Spectroscopic markers measured in the posterior cingulate/precuneus were considered alongside known disease biomarkers: CSF Abeta42, phosphorylated tau, total tau, [(18)F]-flutemetamol PET, f-MRI, and the genetic risk factor APOE. RESULTS: Amyloid-positive cognitively healthy participants showed a significant increase in mI/creatine and mI/NAA levels compared to amyloid-negative healthy elderly (p < 0.05). In amyloid-positive healthy elderly, mI/creatine and mI/NAA correlated with cortical retention of [(18)F] flutemetamol tracer ([Formula: see text] = 0.44, p = 0.02 and [Formula: see text] = 0.51, p = 0.01, respectively). Healthy elderly APOE epsilon4 carriers with normal CSF Abeta42 levels had significantly higher mI/creatine levels (p < 0.001) than epsilon4 noncarriers. Finally, elevated mI/creatine was associated with decreased functional connectivity within the default mode network (rpearson = -0.16, p = 0.02), independently of amyloid pathology. CONCLUSIONS: mI levels are elevated already at asymptomatic stages of AD. Moreover, mI/creatine concentrations were increased in healthy APOE epsilon4 carriers with normal CSF Abeta42 levels, suggesting that mI levels may reveal regional brain consequences of APOE epsilon4 before detectable amyloid pathology.
27164694	APOE epsilon4 and the associations of seafood and long-chain omega-3 fatty acids with cognitive decline.	OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between consumption of seafood and long-chain n-3 fatty acids with change in 5 cognitive domains over an average of 4.9 years. METHODS: From an ongoing longitudinal, community-based epidemiologic study of aging and dementia (the Rush Memory and Aging Project), we included 915 participants (age 81.4 +/- 7.2 years, 25% men) who had completed at least one follow-up cognitive assessment and dietary data. Diet was assessed by semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire. Scores for global cognitive function and 5 cognitive domains (episodic, semantic, and working memory, perceptual speed, and visuospatial ability) were assessed using 19 cognitive tests. Mixed models adjusted for multiple risk factors of cognitive change were used to assess the associations. RESULTS: Consumption of seafood was associated with slower decline in semantic memory (beta = 0.024; p = 0.03) and perceptual speed (beta = 0.020; p = 0.05) in separate models adjusted for age, sex, education, participation in cognitive activities, physical activity, alcohol consumption, smoking, and total energy intake. In secondary analyses, APOE epsilon4 carriers demonstrated slower rates of decline in global cognition and in multiple cognitive domains with weekly seafood consumption and with moderate to high long-chain n-3 fatty acid intake from food. These associations were not present in APOE epsilon4 noncarriers. Higher intake levels of alpha-linolenic acid were associated with slower global cognitive decline, but also only in APOE epsilon4 carriers. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest protective relations of one meal per week of seafood and long-chain n-3 fatty acids against decline in multiple cognitive domains. The role of APOE epsilon4 in this association needs further study.
27164691	Vitamin E in aging persons with Down syndrome: A randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial.	OBJECTIVE: To determine whether vitamin E would slow the progression of cognitive deterioration and dementia in aging persons with Down syndrome (DS). METHODS: A randomized, double-blind controlled clinical trial was conducted at 21 clinical sites, and researchers trained in research procedures recruited adults with DS older than 50 years to participate. Participants were randomly assigned to receive 1,000 IU of vitamin E orally twice daily for 3 years or identical placebo. The primary outcome was change on the Brief Praxis Test (BPT). Secondary outcomes included incident dementia and measures of clinical global change, cognition, function, and behavior. RESULTS: A total of 337 individuals were randomized, 168 to vitamin E and 169 to placebo. Both groups demonstrated deterioration on the BPT with no difference between drug and placebo. At baseline, 26% were diagnosed with dementia and there was an overall rate of incident dementia of 11%/year with no difference between groups. There was no effect on the secondary outcome measures. Though numerically higher in the treatment group, there was no difference in the number of adverse events (p = 0.079) and deaths (p = 0.086) between groups. CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin E did not slow the progression of cognitive deterioration in older individuals with DS. CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class II evidence that vitamin E does not significantly slow the progression of cognitive deterioration in aging persons with DS.
27164667	Accelerating rates of cognitive decline and imaging markers associated with beta-amyloid pathology.	OBJECTIVE: To estimate points along the spectrum of beta-amyloid pathology at which rates of change of several measures of neuronal injury and cognitive decline begin to accelerate. METHODS: In 460 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), we estimated the points at which rates of florbetapir PET, fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET, MRI, and cognitive and functional decline begin to accelerate with respect to baseline CSF Abeta42. Points of initial acceleration in rates of decline were estimated using mixed-effects regression. RESULTS: Rates of neuronal injury and cognitive and even functional decline accelerate substantially before the conventional threshold for amyloid positivity, with rates of florbetapir PET and FDG PET accelerating early. Temporal lobe atrophy rates also accelerate prior to the threshold, but not before the acceleration of cognitive and functional decline. CONCLUSIONS: A considerable proportion of patients with MCI would not meet inclusion criteria for a trial using the current threshold for amyloid positivity, even though on average, they are experiencing cognitive/functional decline associated with prethreshold levels of CSF Abeta42. Future trials in early Alzheimer disease might consider revising the criteria regarding beta-amyloid thresholds to include the range of amyloid associated with the first signs of accelerating rates of decline.
27164657	Multimorbidity and neuroimaging biomarkers among cognitively normal persons.	OBJECTIVE: To assess the cross-sectional association between multimorbidity and imaging biomarkers of brain pathology in the population-based Mayo Clinic Study of Aging (MCSA). METHODS: The study consisted of 1,449 MCSA participants who were cognitively normal at the time of MRI. A subset of the participants also had (11)C-Pittsburgh compound B (n = 689) and (18)fluorodeoxyglucose (n = 688) PET scans available. Information on multimorbidity (defined as >/=2 chronic conditions) in the 5 years prior to the first imaging study was captured from the medical record using ICD-9 codes for chronic conditions and the Rochester Epidemiology Project medical records linkage system. The cross-sectional association of multimorbidity and imaging biomarkers was examined using logistic and linear regression models. RESULTS: Among 1,449 cognitively normal participants (mean age 79 years; 50.9% men), 85.4% had multimorbidity (>/=2 chronic conditions). Multimorbidity and severe multimorbidity (>/=4 chronic conditions) were associated with abnormal Alzheimer disease (AD) signature meta-region of interest (meta-ROI) (18)F-FDG hypometabolism (odds ratio [OR] 2.03; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.10-3.77 and OR 2.22; 95% CI 1.18-4.16, respectively), and with abnormal AD signature MRI cortical thickness (OR 1.53; 95% CI 1.09-2.16 and OR 1.76; 95% CI 1.24-2.51, respectively), but was not associated with amyloid accumulation. CONCLUSIONS: Multimorbidity was associated with brain pathology through mechanisms independent of amyloid deposition and such neuronal injury and pathology was present before any symptomatic evidence of cognitive impairment. Longitudinal follow-up will provide insights into potential causal associations of multimorbidity with changes in brain pathology.
27162352	High-speed atomic force microscopy reveals structural dynamics of amyloid beta1-42 aggregates.	Aggregation of amyloidogenic proteins into insoluble amyloid fibrils is implicated in various neurodegenerative diseases. This process involves protein assembly into oligomeric intermediates and fibrils with highly polymorphic molecular structures. These structural differences may be responsible for different disease presentations. For this reason, elucidation of the structural features and assembly kinetics of amyloidogenic proteins has been an area of intense study. We report here the results of high-speed atomic force microscopy (HS-AFM) studies of fibril formation and elongation by the 42-residue form of the amyloid beta-protein (Abeta1-42), a key pathogenetic agent of Alzheimer's disease. Our data demonstrate two different growth modes of Abeta1-42, one producing straight fibrils and the other producing spiral fibrils. Each mode depends on initial fibril nucleus structure, but switching from one growth mode to another was occasionally observed, suggesting that fibril end structure fluctuated between the two growth modes. This switching phenomenon was affected by buffer salt composition. Our findings indicate that polymorphism in fibril structure can occur after fibril nucleation and is affected by relatively modest changes in environmental conditions.
27159438	Financial exploitation, financial capacity, and Alzheimer's disease.	Research in the past decade has documented that financial exploitation of older adults has become a major problem, and psychology is only recently increasing its presence in efforts to reduce exploitation. During the same time period, psychology has been a leader in setting best practices for the assessment of diminished capacity in older adults culminating in the 2008 American Bar Association Commission on Law and Aging and American Psychological Association (ABA/APA) joint publication on a handbook for psychologists. Assessment of financial decision-making capacity is often the cornerstone assessment needed in cases of financial exploitation. This article will examine the intersection of financial exploitation and decision-making capacity and introduce a new conceptual model and new tools for both the investigation and prevention of financial exploitation.

27159433	Healthy cognitive aging and dementia prevention.	Behavioral prevention strategies can help maintain high levels of cognition and functional integrity, and can reduce the social, medical, and economic burden associated with cognitive aging and age-associated neurodegenerative diseases. Interventions involving physical exercise and cognitive training have consistently shown positive effects on cognition in older adults. "Brain fitness" interventions have now been shown to have sustained effects lasting 10 years or more. A meta-analysis suggests these physical exercise and brain fitness exercises produce nearly identical impact on formal measures of cognitive function. Behavioral interventions developed and deployed by psychologists are key in supporting healthy cognitive aging. The National Institutes of Health should expand research on cognitive health and behavioral and social science to promote healthy aging and to develop and refine ways to prevent and treat dementia. Funding for adequately powered, large-scale trials is needed. Congress must maintain support for crucial dementia-related initiatives like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Healthy Brain Initiative and fund training programs to insure there is a work force with skills to provide high quality care for older adults. Insurers must provide better coverage for behavioral interventions. Better coverage is needed so there can be increased access to evidence-based disease prevention and health promotion services with the potential for reducing dementia risk. (PsycINFO Database Record
27156508	[Language Symptoms of Alzheimer's Disease].	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder mainly characterized by progressive memory disturbance. Language symptoms are considered to be less disease specific and therefore did not attract many researchers, interest until recently. Typical patients with AD present amnesic aphasia in the early disease stage followed by transcortical sensory aphasia; however, their language symptoms are varied. Recently, the concept of logopenic variant of primary progressive aphasia (PPA) has been developed, which is reported to have Alzheimer's neuropathology. Clinicians should verify patients' language abilities, as language can be the key to reveal their true cognitive functions.
27155653	Insights into the variability of nucleated amyloid polymerization by a minimalistic model of stochastic protein assembly.	Self-assembly of proteins into amyloid aggregates is an important biological phenomenon associated with human diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. Amyloid fibrils also have potential applications in nano-engineering of biomaterials. The kinetics of amyloid assembly show an exponential growth phase preceded by a lag phase, variable in duration as seen in bulk experiments and experiments that mimic the small volumes of cells. Here, to investigate the origins and the properties of the observed variability in the lag phase of amyloid assembly currently not accounted for by deterministic nucleation dependent mechanisms, we formulate a new stochastic minimal model that is capable of describing the characteristics of amyloid growth curves despite its simplicity. We then solve the stochastic differential equations of our model and give mathematical proof of a central limit theorem for the sample growth trajectories of the nucleated aggregation process. These results give an asymptotic description for our simple model, from which closed form analytical results capable of describing and predicting the variability of nucleated amyloid assembly were derived. We also demonstrate the application of our results to inform experiments in a conceptually friendly and clear fashion. Our model offers a new perspective and paves the way for a new and efficient approach on extracting vital information regarding the key initial events of amyloid formation.
27153489	Thoughts on Obesity and Brain Glucose.	Homeostatic control of brain metabolism is essential for neuronal activity. Jais et al., (2016) report that reduced brain glucose uptake elicited by a high-fat diet self-corrects by the recruitment of peripheral, VEGF-producing macrophages to the blood-brain barrier. Their findings further suggest that restoring brain glucose availability might help protect from cognitive impairment in Alzheimer's disease.
27152332	The crystal structure of human dopamine beta-hydroxylase at 2.9 A resolution.	The norepinephrine pathway is believed to modulate behavioral and physiological processes, such as mood, overall arousal, and attention. Furthermore, abnormalities in the pathway have been linked to numerous diseases, for example hypertension, depression, anxiety, Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and cocaine dependence. We report the crystal structure of human dopamine beta-hydroxylase, which is the enzyme converting dopamine to norepinephrine. The structure of the DOMON (dopamine beta-monooxygenase N-terminal) domain, also found in >1600 other proteins, reveals a possible metal-binding site and a ligand-binding pocket. The catalytic core structure shows two different conformations: an open active site, as also seen in another member of this enzyme family [the peptidylglycine alpha-hydroxylating (and alpha-amidating) monooxygenase], and a closed active site structure, in which the two copper-binding sites are only 4 to 5 A apart, in what might be a coupled binuclear copper site. The dimerization domain adopts a conformation that bears no resemblance to any other known protein structure. The structure provides new molecular insights into the numerous devastating disorders of both physiological and neurological origins associated with the dopamine system.
27151228	Pre-critical MRI findings of an Alzheimer's disease patient with pathologically proven cerebral amyloid angiopathy related lobar hemorrhage.	An 85-year-old woman with untreated hypertension was admitted with a disturbance of consciousness. On admission, brain CT revealed a lobar intracerebral hemorrhage with a midline shift. An intracranial hematoma was evacuated via a life-saving craniotomy. Definite pathological findings of amyloid-beta deposition in the excised hematoma (strong in anti-amyloid beta40 immunostain, but weak in anti- amyloid beta42) indicated cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). She had been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease at a regional memory clinic one month before symptom onset based on MRI findings of medial temporal lobe atrophy as well as CAA-related features of multiple strictly lobar cerebral microbleeds in the occipital lobe, cortical superficial siderosis and >20 enlarged perivascular spaces in the centrum semiovale. This experience suggests that comprehensive interpretation of such CAA-related findings on MRI might help to improve the management of cardiovascular risk factors for Alzheimer's disease.
27151193	PDZ Binding Domains, Structural Disorder and Phosphorylation: A Menage-a-trois Tailing Dcp2 mRNA Decapping Enzymes.	Diverse cellular activities are mediated through the interaction of protein domains and their binding partners. One such protein domain widely distributed in the higher metazoan world is the PDZ domain, which facilitates abundant protein-protein interactions. The PDZ domain-PDZ binding domain interaction has been implicated in several pathologies including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and Down syndrome. PDZ domains bind to C-terminal peptides/proteins which have either of the following combinations: S/T-X-hydrophobic-COOH for type I, hydrophobic-Xhydrophobic- COOH for type II, and D/E-X-hydrophobic-COOH for type III, although hydrophobicity in the termini form the key characteristic of the PDZ-binding domains. We identified and characterized a Dcp2 type mRNA decapping enzyme from Arabidopsis thaliana, a protein containing a putative PDZ-binding domain using mutagenesis and protein biochemistry. Now we are using bioinformatics to study the Cterminal end of mRNA decapping enzymes from complex metazoans with the aim of (1) identifying putative PDZ-binding domains (2) Correlating structural disorder with PDZ binding domains and (3) Demonstrating the presence of phosphorylation sites in C-terminal extremities of Dcp2 type mRNA decapping enzymes. It is proposed here that the trinity of PDZbinding domains, structural disorder and phosphorylation-susceptible sites are a feature of the Dcp2 family of decapping enzymes and perhaps is a wider trick in protein evolution where scaffolding/tethering is a requirement for localization and function. It is critical though laboratory-based supporting evidence is sought to back-up this bioinformatics exploration into tail regions of mRNA decapping enzymes.
27148797	A comparative study of caregiver burden in late-onset depression and Alzheimer's disease.	BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) and major depressive disorder are the two most common psychogeriatric disorders. Late-onset depression (LOD) is the most common cause of emotional suffering in the elderly and is associated with a poor quality of life in caregivers. Although the burden on caregivers of individuals suffering from AD has been well studied, there is a paucity of comparative studies on caregiver burden between AD and LOD. The objectives of this study were to compare the caregiver burden in LOD and AD and to identify factors associated with caregiver burden in LOD. METHODS: The study included two groups of 25 patients and their caregivers. Group 1 consisted of LOD patients diagnosed with major depressive disorder according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition, text revision, with onset after age 60, and their caregivers. Group 2 consisted of AD patients and their caregivers. Caregiver burden was assessed by the Zarit Caregiver Burden Interview. Sociodemographic and clinical correlates of caregiver burden in LOD and AD were analyzed. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in caregiver burden between LOD and AD (P = 0.27). In LOD, the factors positively associated with caregiver burden included the patient's education and the caregiver being a woman, married, unmarried, and a student. Factors negatively associated with caregiver burden included being the son of the patient and high income status. Multivariate stepwise regression analysis showed that caregiver burden in AD is predicted by the Behavioural Pathology in Alzheimer's Disease Scale score, income, presence of diabetes, and in-laws as caregivers (adjusted R(2) = 0.847, P < 0.001). In LOD, caregiver burden is predicted by income, the patient's education, and whether the caregiver is a student or spouse (adjusted R(2) = 0.388, P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: This study highlights the finding that caregiver burden in LOD is comparable to that in AD and requires interventions to reduce the caregiver strain.
27148392	Centered Kernel Alignment Enhancing Neural Network Pretraining for MRI-Based Dementia Diagnosis.	Dementia is a growing problem that affects elderly people worldwide. More accurate evaluation of dementia diagnosis can help during the medical examination. Several methods for computer-aided dementia diagnosis have been proposed using resonance imaging scans to discriminate between patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) or mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and healthy controls (NC). Nonetheless, the computer-aided diagnosis is especially challenging because of the heterogeneous and intermediate nature of MCI. We address the automated dementia diagnosis by introducing a novel supervised pretraining approach that takes advantage of the artificial neural network (ANN) for complex classification tasks. The proposal initializes an ANN based on linear projections to achieve more discriminating spaces. Such projections are estimated by maximizing the centered kernel alignment criterion that assesses the affinity between the resonance imaging data kernel matrix and the label target matrix. As a result, the performed linear embedding allows accounting for features that contribute the most to the MCI class discrimination. We compare the supervised pretraining approach to two unsupervised initialization methods (autoencoders and Principal Component Analysis) and against the best four performing classification methods of the 2014 CADDementia challenge. As a result, our proposal outperforms all the baselines (7% of classification accuracy and area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve) at the time it reduces the class biasing.
27144552	Synthesis of Thiazolo[5,4-f]quinazolin-9(8H)-ones as Multi-Target Directed Ligands of Ser/Thr Kinases.	A library of thirty novel thiazolo[5,4-f]quinazolin-9(8H)-one derivatives belonging to four series designated as 12, 13, 14 and 15 was efficiently prepared, helped by microwave-assisted technology when required. The efficient multistep synthesis of methyl 6-amino-2-cyano- benzo[d]thiazole-7-carboxylate (1) has been reinvestigated and performed on a multigram scale. The inhibitory potency of the final products against five kinases involved in Alzheimer's disease was evaluated. This study demonstrates that some molecules of the 12 and 13 series described in this paper are particularly promising for the development of new multi-target inhibitors of kinases.
27142664	Self-management by family caregivers to manage changes in the behavior and mood of their relative with dementia: an online focus group study.	BACKGROUND: Self-management is important for family caregivers of people with dementia, especially when they face changes in their relative's behavior and mood, such as depression, apathy, anxiety, agitation and aggression. The aim of this study is to give insight into why these changes in behavior and mood are stressful for family caregivers, what self-management strategies family caregivers use when managing these changes and the stress they experience. METHODS: A qualitative study was conducted using four online focus groups with 32 family caregivers of people with dementia living in the Netherlands. Transcripts of the focus group discussions were analyzed using principles of thematic analysis. RESULTS: Managing changes in the behavior and mood of their relative with dementia is stressful for family caregivers because of constantly having to switch, continuously having to keep the person with dementia occupied and distracted, the fact that others see a different side to the relative, and the fact that caregivers know what to do, but are often not able to put this into practice. Caregivers use calming down and stimulation as self-management strategies for influencing the changes in the behavior and mood of their relative. Furthermore, caregivers describe three self-management strategies that let them manage their own stress and keep up the care for their loved ones: looking for distractions, getting rest, and discussing their feelings and experiences. CONCLUSIONS: Behavior and mood changes of a person with dementia are stressful for family caregivers. They use several self-management strategies to positively affect the mood and behavior changes, and also to manage their own stress.
27142529	Effect of diabetes on caregiver burden in an observational study of individuals with Alzheimer's disease.	BACKGROUND: The burden on caregivers of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with the patient's functional status and may also be influenced by chronic comorbid medical conditions, such as diabetes. This post-hoc exploratory analysis assessed whether comorbid diabetes in patients with AD affects caregiver burden, and whether caregivers with diabetes experience greater burden than caregivers without diabetes. Caregiver and patient healthcare resource use (HCRU) were also assessed. METHODS: Baseline data from the GERAS observational study of patients with AD and their caregivers (both n = 1495) in France, Germany and the UK were analyzed. Caregiver burden was assessed using the Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI). Caregiver time on activities of daily living (ADL: basic ADL; instrumental ADL, iADL) and supervision (hours/month), and caregiver and patient HCRU (outpatient visits, emergency room visits, nights hospitalized) were assessed using the Resource Utilization in Dementia instrument for the month before the baseline visit. Regression analyses were adjusted for relevant covariates. Time on supervision and basic ADL was analyzed using zero-inflated negative binomial regression. RESULTS: Caregivers of patients with diabetes (n = 188) were younger and more likely to be female (both p < 0.05), compared with caregivers of patients without diabetes (n = 1307). Analyses showed caregivers of patients with diabetes spent significantly more time on iADL (+16 %; p = 0.03; increases were also observed for basic ADL and total caregiver time but did not reach statistical significance) and had a trend towards increased ZBI score. Patients with diabetes had a 63 % increase in the odds of requiring supervision versus those without diabetes (p = 0.01). Caregiver and patient HCRU did not differ according to patient diabetes. Caregivers with diabetes (n = 127) did not differ from those without diabetes (n = 1367) regarding burden/time, but caregivers with diabetes had a 91 % increase in the odds of having outpatient visits (p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: This cross-sectional analysis found caregiver time on iADL and supervision was higher for caregivers of patients with AD and diabetes versus without diabetes, while HCRU was unaffected by patient diabetes. Longitudinal analyses assessing change in caregiver burden over time by patient diabetes status may help clarify the cumulative impact of diabetes and AD dementia on caregiver burden.
27141616	[Electroacupuncture Intervention Inhibits the Decline of Learning-memory Ability and Overex- pression of Cleaved Caspase-3 and Bax in Hippocampus Induced by Isoflurane in APPswe/PS 1].	OBJECTIVE: To investigate the protection mechanism of electroacupuncture (EA) therapy against Alzheimer's disease (AD)-like neurotoxicity induced by Isoflurane. METHODS: Twenty-four APPswe/PS 1 dE9 double transgenic mice (one of the most extensively used transgenic mouse model of AD) and 24 littermate wild-type mice were randomly assigned into control (Con) group, isoflurane (Iso) group and EA group, respectively (n = 8 in each group). EA (2 Hz/100 Hz, 1 mA) was applied to "Baihui" (GV 20) and "Yongquan" (KI 1) for 15 min, once a day for 3 days. The transgenic mice were exposed to a closed box filled with 1.2% isoflurane + 30% O2 +70% N2 for 4 h. The animals' learning-memory ability was detected by Morris water maze test. The expression of cleaved Caspase-3 in the CA 1 area of hippocampus was detected by immunohistochemistry, and that of hippocampal Bcl-2 and Bax proteins detected by Western blot. RESULTS: Compared with the wilde-type mice, the average escape latency of place navigation test was significantly longer, while the percentage of target-quadrant stay time and the target- platform crossing times of spacial probe test were marked decreased in AD + lso mice (P < 0.05). After acupuncture intervention, the abovementioned changes were reversed (P < 0.05). Correspondingly, compared with the AD-Con group, the number of hippocampal activated Caspase-3-positive cells and the expression of Bax protein were significantly increased in the AD-Iso group (P < 0.05). After EA intervention, the increased Caspase-3-positive cell number and Bax protein expression were remarkably down-regulated in the AD-EA group, and the decreased ratio of Bcl-2/Bax in AD-Iso mice was obviously up-regulated in AD-EA mice (P < 0.05). No significant changes were found in the average escape latency, the percentage of target-quadrant stay time and the target-platofrm corssing times, and inthe number of hippocampal activated Caspase-3-positive cells, the expression levels of hippocampal Bcl-2 and Sax and the ratio of Bcl-2/Bax in the three groups of wilde-type mice (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: EA intervention can improve the learning-memory ability in AD + Isoflurane mice, suggesting a reduction of AD-like neurotoxicity, which may be associated with its actions in inhibiting the overexpression of activated Caspase-3 and Bax proteins in the hippocampus.
27138860	Effect of Ca(2+) on Ass40 fibrillation is characteristically different.	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the only one among top ten diseases in USA that cannot be cured, prevented or slowed down. At molecular level the mechanism of onset has been closely associated with mis-folding of Abeta40 and Abeta42 and is well supported by the genetic data for AD. Extensive research efforts have led to identification of factors and metal ions that could manipulate Abeta equilibrium, especially Ca(2+). Previously, we reported selectively acceleration of Abeta42 fibril formation by Ca(2+)in vitro within physiological concentrations (BBA (2009) 1794:1536). Abeta40 on the other hand did not appear to be significantly affected by Ca(2+) addition. In an effort to understand the distinctive behavior of Abeta40, we monitored changes of Abeta40 aggregation by intrinsic tyrosine fluorescence and CD and took different approaches for data processing. Our analysis of CD data indicates a complex effect induced by the addition of 2mM Ca(2+) resulting in an increase in the rate of transformation from monomer to beta-sheet rich fibrilar or intermediate species formation in Abeta40. Surprisingly, the kinetics observed by intrinsic fluorescence studies in this article and ThT, SEC or EM studies in our previous report were not able to unravel the existence of this effect in Abeta40.
27136595	Molecular Mechanisms in the Pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease and Tauopathies-Prion-Like Seeded Aggregation and Phosphorylation.	Neurofibrillary tau pathology (tangles and threads) and extracellular amyloid-beta (Abeta) pathology are defining features of Alzheimer's disease. For 25 years, most research has focused on the amyloid hypothesis of AD pathogenesis and progression. But, because of failures in clinical trials of Abeta-targeted therapies and the new concept of prion-like propagation of intracellular abnormal proteins, tau has come back into the spotlight as a candidate therapeutic target in AD. Tau pathologies are found in a range of neurodegenerative disorders, but extensive analyses of pathological tau in diseased brains has demonstrated that the abnormal tau protein in each disease is structurally distinct, supporting the idea that progression of the diverse but characteristic tau pathologies occurs through prion-like seed-dependent aggregation. Therefore, intervention in the conversion of normal tau to abnormal forms and in cell-to-cell transmission of tau may be the key to development of disease-modifying therapies for AD and other dementing disorders.
27136297	Phthalocyanines as Molecular Scaffolds to Block Disease-Associated Protein Aggregation.	The aggregation of proteins into toxic conformations plays a critical role in the development of different neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and Creutzfled-Jakob's disease (CJD). These disorders share a common pathological mechanism that involves the formation of aggregated protein species including toxic oligomers and amyloid fibrils. The aggregation of alpha-synuclein (alphaS) in PD and the amyloid beta peptide (Abeta) and tau protein in AD results in neuronal death and disease onset. In the case of CJD, the misfolding of the physiological prion protein (PrP) induces a chain reaction that results in accumulation of particles that elicit brain damage. Currently, there is no preventive therapy for these diseases and the available therapeutic approaches are based on the treatment of the symptoms rather than the underlying causes of the disease. Accordingly, the aggregation pathway of these proteins represents a useful target for therapeutic intervention. Therefore, understanding the mechanism of amyloid formation and its inhibition is of high clinical importance. The design of small molecules that efficiently inhibit the aggregation process and/or neutralize its associated toxicity constitutes a promising tool for the development of therapeutic strategies against these disorders. In this accounts, we discuss current knowledge on the anti-amyloid activity of phthalocyanines and their potential use as drug candidates in neurodegeneration. These tetrapyrrolic compounds modulate the amyloid assembly of alphaS, tau, Abeta, and the PrP in vitro, and protect cells from the toxic effects of amyloid aggregates. In addition, in scrapie-infected mice, these compounds showed important prophylactic antiscrapie properties. The structural basis for the inhibitory effect of phthalocyanines on amyloid filament assembly relies on specific pi-pi interactions between the aromatic ring system of these molecules and aromatic residues in the amyloidogenic proteins. Analysis of the structure-activity relationship in phthalocyanines revealed that their anti-amyloid activity is highly dependent on the type of metal ion coordinated to the tetrapyrrolic system but is not sensitive to the number of peripheral charged substituents. The tendency of phthalocyanines to oligomerize (self-association) via aromatic-aromatic stacking interactions correlates precisely with their binding capabilities to target proteins and, more importantly, determines their efficiency as anti-amyloid agents. The ability to block different types of disease-associated protein aggregation raises the possibility that these cyclic tetrapyrrole compounds have a common mechanism of action to impair the formation of a variety of pathological aggregates. Because the structural and molecular basis for the anti-amyloid effects of these molecules is starting to emerge, combined efforts from the fields of structural, cellular, and animal biology will result critical for the rational design and discovery of new drugs for the treatment of amyloid related neurological disorders.
27135936	Magnetic immunoassay platform based on the planar frequency mixing magnetic technique.	We represent the experimental results of our planar-frequency mixing magnetic detection (p-FMMD) technique to obtain 2D superparamagnetic images for magnetic immunoassay purpose. The imaging of magnetic beads is based on the nonlinear magnetic characteristics inherent in superparamagnetic materials. The p-FMMD records the sum-frequency components originating from both a high and a low frequency magnetic field incident on the magnetically nonlinear nanoparticles. In this study, we apply the p-FMMD technique to 2D scanning imaging of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) in a microfluidic platform. Our p-FMMD system enables to acquire planar images of SPIONs filled in a microchannel as narrow as 30microm in width. The minimum detectable amount is ~1.0x10(8) beads of 100nm size. The system shows a spatial resolution enabling to distinguish between two distinct channels even 2mm apart from each other. Our p-FMMD system as a magnetic immunoassaying system has permitted the detection of amyloid beta 42 (Abeta42), a promising biomarker of Alzheimer's disease, at the minimum concentration of 23.8pg/ml. This may enable the identification of the Abeta42 levels for the early-stage of Alzheimer's disease with the assistance of the MPI using p-FMMD technique. The results show that the deployment of the p-FMMD can be an alternative to conventional biosensing analytical methods, and can be used as a fast and portable screening method.
27133915	The combination of 1alpha,25dihydroxyvitaminD3 with resveratrol improves neuronal degeneration by regulating endoplasmic reticulum stress, insulin signaling and inhibiting tau hyperphosphorylation in SH-SY5Y cells.	Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is a critical factor involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Vitamin D and resveratrol are two nutritional factors that have reported neuroprotective effects, and findings from cellular models suggest that resveratrol could potentiate vitamin D's effects. We aimed to determine the effects of vitamin D & resveratrol on ER stress mediated neurodegeneration and whether synergistic effects existed. Tunicamycin and Abeta25-35 was utilized to induce ER stress in SH-SY5Y cells, cells were then incubated with vitamin D and resveratrol. The combination of vitamin D & resveratrol completely reversed tunicamycin and Abeta25-35 induced cytotoxicity in SH-SY5Y cells, as well as elevation in ER stress markers (i.e.GRP78, p-eIF2alpha and CHOP), insulin signaling disruption (i.e. elevation in p-IRS-1serine307 and reduction in p-Akt serine473) and tau phosphorylation (i.e. reduction in p-GSK3beta serine9, and elevation in p-Tau serine396 &404). Further studies are required to clarify whether the observed synergistic effects in the present study would also existed in vivo, this will lay scientific foundation whether the combination of vitamin D with resveratrol might be an effective maneuver in the treatment of AD in human subjects.
27132526	Neuromodulation for restoring memory.	Disorders of learning and memory have a large social and economic impact in today's society. Unfortunately, existing medical treatments have shown limited clinical efficacy or potential for modification of the disease course. Deep brain stimulation is a successful treatment for movement disorders and has shown promise in a variety of other diseases including psychiatric disorders. The authors review the potential of neuromodulation for the treatment of disorders of learning and memory. They briefly discuss learning circuitry and its involvement in Alzheimer disease and traumatic brain injury. They then review the literature supporting various targets for neuromodulation to improve memory in animals and humans. Multiple targets including entorhinal cortex, fornix, nucleus basalis of Meynert, basal ganglia, and pedunculopontine nucleus have shown a promising potential for improving dysfunctional memory by mechanisms such as altering firing patterns in neuronal networks underlying memory and increasing synaptic plasticity and neurogenesis. Significant work remains to be done to translate these findings into durable clinical therapies.
27129267	The Dynamics and Turnover of Tau Aggregates in Cultured Cells: INSIGHTS INTO THERAPIES FOR TAUOPATHIES.	Filamentous tau aggregates, the hallmark lesions of Alzheimer disease (AD), play key roles in neurodegeneration. Activation of protein degradation systems has been proposed to be a potential strategy for removing pathological tau, but it remains unclear how effectively tau aggregates can be degraded by these systems. By applying our previously established cellular model system of AD-like tau aggregate induction using preformed tau fibrils, we demonstrate that tau aggregates induced in cells with regulated expression of full-length mutant tau can be gradually cleared when soluble tau expression is suppressed. This clearance is at least partially mediated by the autophagy-lysosome pathway, although both the ubiquitin-proteasome system and the autophagy-lysosome pathway are deficient in handling large tau aggregates. Importantly, residual tau aggregates left after the clearance phase leads to a rapid reinstatement of robust tau pathology once soluble tau expression is turned on again. Moreover, we succeeded in generating monoclonal cells persistently carrying tau aggregates without obvious cytotoxicity. Live imaging of GFP-tagged tau aggregates showed that tau inclusions are dynamic structures constantly undergoing "fission" and "fusion," which facilitate stable propagation of tau pathology in dividing cells. These findings provide a greater understanding of cell-to-cell transmission of tau aggregates in dividing cells and possibly neurons.
27128441	Manipulating the Prion Protein Gene Sequence and Expression Levels with CRISPR/Cas9.	The mammalian prion protein (PrP, encoded by Prnp) is most infamous for its central role in prion diseases, invariably fatal neurodegenerative diseases affecting humans, food animals, and animals in the wild. However, PrP is also hypothesized to be an important receptor for toxic protein conformers in Alzheimer's disease, and is associated with other clinically relevant processes such as cancer and stroke. Thus, key insights into important clinical areas, as well as into understanding PrP functions in normal physiology, can be obtained from studying transgenic mouse models and cell culture systems. However, the Prnp locus is difficult to manipulate by homologous recombination, making modifications of the endogenous locus rarely attempted. Fortunately in recent years genome engineering technologies, like TALENs or CRISPR/Cas9 (CC9), have brought exceptional new possibilities for manipulating Prnp. Herein, we present our observations made during systematic experiments with the CC9 system targeting the endogenous mouse Prnp locus, to either modify sequences or to boost PrP expression using CC9-based synergistic activation mediators (SAMs). It is our hope that this information will aid and encourage researchers to implement gene-targeting techniques into their research program.
27128373	Alzheimer's Disease Risk Genes and Lipid Regulators.	Brain lipid homeostasis plays an important role in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other neurodegenerative disorders. Aggregation of amyloid-beta peptide is one of the major events in AD. The complex interplay between lipids and amyloid-beta accumulation has been intensively investigated. The proportions of lipid components including phospholipids, sphingolipids, and cholesterol are roughly similar across different brain regions under physiological conditions. However, disruption of brain lipid homeostasis has been described in AD and implicated in disease pathogenesis. Moreover, studies suggest that analysis of lipid composition in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid could improve our understanding of the disease development and progression, which could potentially serve as disease biomarkers and prognostic indicators for AD therapies. Here, we summarize the functional roles of AD risk genes and lipid regulators that modulate brain lipid homeostasis including different lipid species, lipid complexes, and lipid transporters, particularly their effects on amyloid processing, clearance, and aggregation, as well as neuro-toxicities that contribute to AD pathogenesis.
27128182	Potent anticholinesterasic and neuroprotective pyranotacrines as inhibitors of beta-amyloid aggregation, oxidative stress and tau-phosphorylation for Alzheimer's disease.	Herein we describe the synthesis and in vitro biological evaluation of thirteen new, racemic, diversely functionalized 2-chloroquinolin-3-yl substituted PyranoTacrines (PTs) as multipotent tacrine analogues for Alzheimer's disease (AD) therapy. Among these compounds, 1-(5-amino-4-(2-chloro-7-methoxyquinolin-3-yl)-2-methyl-6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-4H-pyr ano [2,3-b]quinolin-3-yl)ethanone (9) and ethyl 5-amino-4-(2-chloroquinolin-3-yl)-2-methyl-6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-4H-pyrano[2,3-b]qui noline-3-carboxylate (4) were found to be non-neurotoxic agents in human neuroblastoma SHSY5Y cells. Compounds 9 (IC50 = 0.47 +/- 0.13 muM) and 4 (IC50 = 0.48 +/- 0.05 muM) are potent, mixed-type (9: Ki = 0.0142 +/- 0.003 muM), and selective EeAChE inhibitors, binding at the both catalytic and peripheral anionic site of the enzyme. Compounds 9 and 4 are neuroprotective agents at low muM concentrations upon decreased viability of SHSY5Y cells induced by oxidative stress, and stimulators of GSK3beta-dependent tau phosphorylation. In addition, molecules 9 and 4 effectively counteract Abeta-aggregation on exposure to Abeta1-40, as well as Abeta1-40 aggregation-dependent tau-oligomerization and phosphorylation in (396)Ser, which could be ascribed to the anti-aggregating properties shown in vitro. Thus, a new family of tacrine analogues, whose potent AChEI activity is linked to both their Abeta-aggregating and tau-phosphorylation inhibitory capacities, has been discovered for the potential treatment of AD.
27127658	Regulation of the Postsynaptic Compartment of Excitatory Synapses by the Actin Cytoskeleton in Health and Its Disruption in Disease.	Disruption of synaptic function at excitatory synapses is one of the earliest pathological changes seen in wide range of neurological diseases. The proper control of the segregation of neurotransmitter receptors at these synapses is directly correlated with the intact regulation of the postsynaptic cytoskeleton. In this review, we are discussing key factors that regulate the structure and dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton, the major cytoskeletal building block that supports the postsynaptic compartment. Special attention is given to the complex interplay of actin-associated proteins that are found in the synaptic specialization. We then discuss our current understanding of how disruption of these cytoskeletal elements may contribute to the pathological events observed in the nervous system under disease conditions with a particular focus on Alzheimer's disease pathology.
27125067	ETHICAL AND GENETIC ASPECTS REGARDING PRESYMPTOMATIC TESTING FOR NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASES.	Neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's dementia, Huntington's chorea, Parkinson's disease or spinocerebellar ataxia, manifests into adulthood with an insidious onset, slowly of progressive symptoms. All of these diseases are characterized by presimptomatic stages that preceded with many years of clinical debut. In Parkinson's disease, more than half of the dopaminergic neurons of the black substance are lost before the advent of motor characteristic manifestations. In Huntington's chorea, the progressive neurodegenerative disease could be diagnose prenatal and presymptomatic by analyse of the number of CAG repeats in exon 1 of the huntingtin gene. A similar mechanism represented by expansion of trinucleotide repeats during hereditary transmission from parents to children was identified in fragile X syndrome, spinocerebellar ataxia, spinal muscular and bulbar atrophy, or myotonic dystrophy. Presymptomatic diagnosis in all these progressive diseases raise many ethical issues, due to the psychological impact that can cause the prediction of a disease for which there is currently no curative treatment. Therefore, a positive result can produce serious psychological trauma and major changes in the lifestyle of the individual, instead, a negative result can bring joy and tranquillity. But the problem arises if presymptomatic testing in these neurodegenerative diseases brings greater benefits compared to the possible psychological damage, which can add the risk of stigmatization or discrimination.
27125025	[Fragment of Receptor for Advanced Glycation End Products Improves Memory State in a Model of Alzheimer's Disease].	A number of synthetic peptides corresponding to potentially important regions in the sequence of the four membrane proteins known as beta-amyloid cell receptors have been investigated on their ability to improve memory state in experimental model of Alzheimer's disease. Nine fragments repeating all the exposed nonstructural regions of the RAGE protein according to X-ray data, have been synthesized. The activity of these peptides and synthesized earlier immunoprotective fragments of other three proteins (acetylcholine receptor alpha7-type, prion protein and neurotrophin receptor p75) has been investigated under intranasal administration, without immune response to the peptide. Only one fragment RAGE (60-76) was shown to have a therapeutic activity improving the memory state of bulbectomized mice and leads to decreasing in the level of brain beta-amyloid.
27124833	Preliminary Results of National Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) Registry Risk Factor Survey Data.	BACKGROUND: The National ALS Registry is made up of two components to capture amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) cases: national administrative databases (Medicare, Medicaid, Veterans Health Administration and Veterans Benefits Administration) and self-identified cases captured by the Registry's web portal. This study describes self-reported characteristics of U.S. adults with ALS using the data collected by the National ALS Registry web portal risk factor surveys only from October 19, 2010 through December 31, 2013. OBJECTIVE: To describe findings from the National ALS Registry's web portal risk factor surveys. MEASUREMENTS: The prevalence of select risk factors among adults with ALS was determined by calculating the frequencies of select risk factors-smoking and alcohol (non, current and former) histories, military service and occupational history, and family history of neurodegenerative diseases such as ALS, Alzheimer's and/or Parkinson's. RESULTS: Nearly half of survey respondents were ever smokers compared with nearly 41% of adults nationally. Most respondents were ever drinkers which is comparable to national estimates. The majority were light drinkers. Nearly one-quarter of survey respondents were veterans compared with roughly 9% of US adults nationally. Most respondents were retired or disabled. The industries in which respondents were employed for the longest time were Professional and Scientific and Technical Services. When family history of neurodegenerative diseases in first degree relatives was evaluated against our comparison group, the rates of ALS were similar, but were higher for Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease and any neurodegenerative diseases. CONCLUSIONS: The National ALS Registry web portal, to our knowledge, is the largest, most geographically diverse collection of risk factor data about adults living with ALS. Various characteristics were consistent with other published studies on ALS risk factors and will allow researchers to generate hypotheses for future research.
27122015	Epigenetic assimilation in the aging human brain.	BACKGROUND: Epigenetic drift progressively increases variation in DNA modification profiles of aging cells, but the finale of such divergence remains elusive. In this study, we explored the dynamics of DNA modification and transcription in the later stages of human life. RESULTS: We find that brain tissues of older individuals (>75 years) become more similar to each other, both epigenetically and transcriptionally, compared with younger individuals. Inter-individual epigenetic assimilation is concurrent with increasing similarity between the cerebral cortex and the cerebellum, which points to potential brain cell dedifferentiation. DNA modification analysis of twins affected with Alzheimer's disease reveals a potential for accelerated epigenetic assimilation in neurodegenerative disease. We also observe loss of boundaries and merging of neighboring DNA modification and transcriptomic domains over time. CONCLUSIONS: Age-dependent epigenetic divergence, paradoxically, changes to convergence in the later stages of life. The newly described phenomena of epigenetic assimilation and tissue dedifferentiation may help us better understand the molecular mechanisms of aging and the origins of diseases for which age is a risk factor.
27121704	Interventions to delay functional decline in people with dementia: a systematic review of systematic reviews.	OBJECTIVE: To summarise existing systematic reviews that assess the effects of non-pharmacological, pharmacological and alternative therapies on activities of daily living (ADL) function in people with dementia. DESIGN: Overview of systematic reviews. METHODS: A systematic search in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, DARE, Medline, EMBASE and PsycInfo in April 2015. Systematic reviews of randomised controlled trials conducted in people with Alzheimer's disease or dementia measuring the impact on ADL function were included. Methodological quality of the systematic reviews was independently assessed by two authors using the AMSTAR tool. The quality of evidence of the primary studies for each intervention was assessed using GRADE. RESULTS: A total of 23 systematic reviews were included in the overview. The quality of the reviews varied; however most (65%) scored 8/11 or more on the AMSTAR tool, indicating high quality. Interventions that were reported to be effective in minimising decline in ADL function were: exercise (6 studies, 289 participants, standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.68, 95% CI 0.08 to 1.27; GRADE: low), dyadic interventions (8 studies, 988 participants, SMD 0.37, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.69; GRADE: low) acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and memantine (12 studies, 4661 participants, donepezil 10 mg SMD 0.18, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.32; GRADE: moderate), selegiline (7 studies, 810 participants, SMD 0.27, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.41; GRADE: low), huperzine A (2 studies, 70 participants, SMD 1.48, 95% CI 0.95 to 2.02; GRADE: very low) and Ginkgo biloba (7 studies, 2530 participants, SMD 0.36, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.44; GRADE: very low). CONCLUSIONS: Healthcare professionals should ensure that people with dementia are encouraged to exercise and that primary carers are trained and supported to provide safe and effective care for the person with dementia. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors or memantine should be trialled unless contraindicated. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: CRD42015020179.
27121148	Cerebrospinal fluid soluble TREM2 in aging and Alzheimer's disease.	BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) neuropathology is associated with neuroinflammation, but there are few useful biomarkers. Mutant variants of triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) have recently been linked to late-onset AD and other neurodegenerative disorders. TREM2, a microglial receptor, is involved in innate immunity. A cleaved fragment, soluble TREM2 (sTREM2), is present in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). METHODS: We developed and used a novel enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to investigate the potential value of CSF sTREM2 as an AD biomarker in two independent cohorts: an AD/mild cognitive impairment (MCI)/control cohort (n = 100) and an AD/control cohort (n = 50). RESULTS: We found no significant difference in sTREM2 levels between groups of controls and patients with AD or MCI. However, among all controls there was a positive correlation between sTREM2 and age (Spearman rho = 0.50; p < 0.001; n = 75). In the AD/MCI/control cohort, CSF sTREM2 correlated positively with total Tau (T-tau) (Spearman rho 0.57; p < 0.001; n = 50), phosphorylated Tau (P-tau) (Spearman rho 0.63; p < 0.001; n = 50) and amyloid-beta1-42 (Abeta42) (Spearman rho 0.35; p = 0.01; n = 50) in control subjects. Among controls with a CSF Abeta42 above a cut-off value (700 pg/ml) in this cohort, the positive correlation between sTREM2 and Abeta42 was stronger (Spearman rho = 0.44; p = 0.002; n = 46). CONCLUSIONS: sTREM2 in CSF correlates with aging in controls, and with the neurodegenerative markers CSF T-tau/P-tau among controls who are negative for AD CSF core biomarkers Abeta42, T-tau or P-tau.
27120160	Efficient introduction of specific homozygous and heterozygous mutations using CRISPR/Cas9.	The bacterial CRISPR/Cas9 system allows sequence-specific gene editing in many organisms and holds promise as a tool to generate models of human diseases, for example, in human pluripotent stem cells. CRISPR/Cas9 introduces targeted double-stranded breaks (DSBs) with high efficiency, which are typically repaired by non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) resulting in nonspecific insertions, deletions or other mutations (indels). DSBs may also be repaired by homology-directed repair (HDR) using a DNA repair template, such as an introduced single-stranded oligo DNA nucleotide (ssODN), allowing knock-in of specific mutations. Although CRISPR/Cas9 is used extensively to engineer gene knockouts through NHEJ, editing by HDR remains inefficient and can be corrupted by additional indels, preventing its widespread use for modelling genetic disorders through introducing disease-associated mutations. Furthermore, targeted mutational knock-in at single alleles to model diseases caused by heterozygous mutations has not been reported. Here we describe a CRISPR/Cas9-based genome-editing framework that allows selective introduction of mono- and bi-allelic sequence changes with high efficiency and accuracy. We show that HDR accuracy is increased dramatically by incorporating silent CRISPR/Cas-blocking mutations along with pathogenic mutations, and establish a method termed 'CORRECT' for scarless genome editing. By characterizing and exploiting a stereotyped inverse relationship between a mutation's incorporation rate and its distance to the DSB, we achieve predictable control of zygosity. Homozygous introduction requires a guide RNA targeting close to the intended mutation, whereas heterozygous introduction can be accomplished by distance-dependent suboptimal mutation incorporation or by use of mixed repair templates. Using this approach, we generated human induced pluripotent stem cells with heterozygous and homozygous dominant early onset Alzheimer's disease-causing mutations in amyloid precursor protein (APP(Swe)) and presenilin 1 (PSEN1(M146V)) and derived cortical neurons, which displayed genotype-dependent disease-associated phenotypes. Our findings enable efficient introduction of specific sequence changes with CRISPR/Cas9, facilitating study of human disease.
27118573	Amyloid beta plaque: a culprit for neurodegeneration.	Increasing life expectancy has resulted in an increase in neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer's disease. None of the hypothesis proposed till date explains the exact pathobiology of the disease. It is therefore imperative to understand the underlying mechanisms. Amyloid beta (Abeta) is regarded as the main culprit and maximum therapeutic efforts are centered towards Abeta. This review will discuss about the biosynthesis, the physiological role of Abeta including the pathogenic aggregation of Abeta resulting neurodegenerative cognitive disabilities. Most studies of Alzheimer's disease have focused on the biochemical mechanisms involved in the neurodegenerative processes triggered by Abeta aggregates. Abeta is generated from mature amyloid precursor protein being metabolized by two competing pathways, alpha-secretase pathway (non-amyloidogenic pathway) and beta-secretase (amyloidogenic pathway). The physiological roles of Abeta reported in neurotrophic properties, neurogenesis, synaptic plasticity, metal ion sequestration and specificity of blood brain barrier. The neuronal injury is the result of Abeta oligomerization and it is reported that oligomerization of Abeta contributes to neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease. The physiological role of Abeta must be considered in the development of medications that intended to decrease its oligomerization forming plaques in a disease like Alzheimer's disease. The biosynthetic pathways for transport and accumulation of Abeta need to be ascertained as an attempt to develop future strategies for prevention of neurodegenerative disorders.
27118310	Tau mutant A152T, a risk factor for FTD/PSP, induces neuronal dysfunction and reduced lifespan independently of aggregation in a C. elegans Tauopathy model.	BACKGROUND: A certain number of mutations in the Microtubule-Associated Protein Tau (MAPT) gene have been identified in individuals with high risk to develop neurodegenerative diseases, collectively called tauopathies. The mutation A152TMAPT was recently identified in patients diagnosed with frontotemporal spectrum disorders, including Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP), Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD), Corticobasal Degeneration (CBD), and Alzheimer disease (AD). The A152TMAPT mutation is unusual since it lies within the N-terminal region of Tau protein, far outside the repeat domain that is responsible for physiological Tau-microtubule interactions and pathological Tau aggregation. How A152TMAPT causes neurodegeneration remains elusive. RESULTS: To understand the pathological consequences of this mutation, here we present a new Caenorhabditis elegans model expressing the mutant A152TMAPT in neurons. While expression of full-length wild-type human tau (Tau(wt), 2N4R) in C. elegans neurons induces a progressive mild uncoordinated locomotion in a dose-dependent manner, mutant tau (Tau(A152T), 2N4R) induces a severe paralysis accompanied by acute neuronal dysfunction. Mutant Tau(A152T) worms display morphological changes in neurons reminiscent of neuronal aging and a shortened life-span. Moreover, mutant A152T overexpressing neurons show mislocalization of pre-synaptic proteins as well as distorted mitochondrial distribution and trafficking. Strikingly, mutant tau-transgenic worms do not accumulate insoluble tau aggregates, although soluble oligomeric tau was detected. In addition, the full-length A152T-tau remains in a pathological conformation that accounts for its toxicity. Moreover, the N-terminal region of tau is not toxic per se, despite the fact that it harbours the A152T mutation, but requires the C-terminal region including the repeat domain to move into the neuronal processes in order to execute the pathology. CONCLUSION: In summary, we show that the mutant Tau(A152T) induces neuronal dysfunction, morphological alterations in neurons akin to aging phenotype and reduced life-span independently of aggregation. This comprehensive description of the pathology due to Tau(A152T) opens up multiple possibilities to identify cellular targets involved in the Tau-dependent pathology for a potential therapeutic intervention.
27117804	Cardiometabolic risk factors predict cerebrovascular health in older adults: results from the Brain in Motion study.	Aging and physical inactivity are associated with an increased risk of developing metabolic syndrome (MetS). With the rising prevalence of MetS, it is important to determine the extent to which it affects cerebrovascular health. The primary purpose of this report is to examine the impact of MetS on cerebrovascular health (resting cerebral blood flow (CBF) peak velocity (V P), cerebrovascular conductance (CVC), and CBF responses to hypercapnia) in healthy older adults with normal cognition. A secondary goal was to examine the influence of apolipoprotein E (APOE) epsilon4 expression on these indices. In a sample of 258 healthy men and women older than 53 years, 29.1% met criteria for MetS. MetS, sex, and age were found to be significant predictors of CVC, and V P, MetS, and APOE status were significant predictors of V P-reactivity, and CVC-reactivity was best predicted by MetS status. After controlling for these factors, participants with MetS demonstrated lower cerebrovascular measures (CVC, V P, CVC-reactivity, and V P-reactivity) compared to participants without MetS. APOE epsilon4 carriers had higher V P-reactivity than noncarriers. These results provide evidence that cardiometabolic and vascular risk factors clustered together as the MetS predict measures of cerebrovascular health indices in older adults. Higher V P-reactivity in APOE epsilon4 carriers suggests vascular compensation for deleterious effects of this known risk allele for Alzheimer's disease and stroke.
27117371	[Influence factors of dislocation after bipolar prosthetic replacement].	OBJECTIVE: To discuss the influence factors of dislocation after bipolar prosthetic replacement. METHODS: A total of 374 patients who received bipolar prosthetic replacement in our hospital from October 2001 to October 2015 were retrospectively studied. The clinic data of patients with dislocation after operation was summarized to analyze the causes. RESULTS: Dislocation happened in 12 patients among all the 374 patients.10 cases received manual relocation, 2 cases open relocation. Most of the 12 patients were accompanied with neurological and psychiatric disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, sequelae of cerebral infarction, etc. Some factors like improper body position caused by these complications were the main influence factors of dislocation. CONCLUSION: Accompanied with neurological and psychiatric disorders is the important influence factor of dislocation after bipolar prosthetic replacement.
27116005	A First Tetraplex Assay for the Simultaneous Quantification of Total alpha-Synuclein, Tau, beta-Amyloid42 and DJ-1 in Human Cerebrospinal Fluid.	The quantification of four distinct proteins (alpha-synuclein, beta-amyloid1-42, DJ-1, and total tau) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) has been proposed as a laboratory-based platform for the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). While there is some clinical utility in measuring these markers individually, their usage in routine clinical testing remains challenging, in part due to substantial overlap of concentrations between healthy controls and diseased subjects. In contrast, measurement of different analytes in a single sample from individual patients in parallel appears to considerably improve the accuracy of AD or PD diagnosis. Here, we report the development and initial characterization of a first, electrochemiluminescence-based multiplex immunoassay for the simultaneous quantification of all four proteins ('tetraplex') in as little as 50 mul of CSF. In analytical performance experiments, we assessed its sensitivity, spike-recovery rate, parallelism and dilution linearity as well as the intra- and inter-assay variability. Using our in-house calibrators, we recorded a lower limit of detection for alpha-synuclein, beta-amyloid42, DJ-1, and t-tau of 1.95, 1.24, 5.63, and 4.05 pg/ml, respectively. The corresponding, linear concentration range covered >3 orders of magnitude. In diluted CSF samples (up to 1:4), spike-recovery rates ranged from a low of 55% for beta-amyloid42 to a high of 98% for DJ-1. Hillslopes ranged from 1.03 to 1.30, and inter-assay variability demonstrated very high reproducibility. Our newly established tetraplex assay represents a significant technical advance for fluid-based biomarker studies in neurodegenerative disorders allowing the simultaneous measurement of four pivotal makers in single CSF specimens. It provides exceptional sensitivity, accuracy and speed.
27115121	Resting-state abnormalities in amnestic mild cognitive impairment: a meta-analysis.	Amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) is a prodromal stage of Alzheimer's disease (AD). As no effective drug can cure AD, early diagnosis and intervention for aMCI are urgently needed. The standard diagnostic procedure for aMCI primarily relies on subjective neuropsychological examinations that require the judgment of experienced clinicians. The development of other objective and reliable aMCI markers, such as neural markers, is therefore required. Previous neuroimaging findings revealed various abnormalities in resting-state activity in MCI patients, but the findings have been inconsistent. The current study provides an updated activation likelihood estimation meta-analysis of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data on aMCI. The authors searched on the MEDLINE/PubMed databases for whole-brain resting-state fMRI studies on aMCI published until March 2015. We included 21 whole-brain resting-state fMRI studies that reported a total of 156 distinct foci. Significant regional resting-state differences were consistently found in aMCI patients relative to controls, including the posterior cingulate cortex, right angular gyrus, right parahippocampal gyrus, left fusiform gyrus, left supramarginal gyrus and bilateral middle temporal gyri. Our findings support that abnormalities in resting-state activities of these regions may serve as neuroimaging markers for aMCI.
27114525	delta-COP modulates Abeta peptide formation via retrograde trafficking of APP.	The components involved in cellular trafficking and protein recycling machinery that have been associated with increased Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk belong to the late secretory compartments for the most part. Here, we hypothesize that these late unavoidable events might be the consequence of earlier complications occurring while amyloid precursor protein (APP) is trafficking through the early secretory pathway. We investigated the relevance to AD of coat protein complex I (COPI)-dependent trafficking, an early step in Golgi-to-endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retrograde transport and one of the very first trafficking steps. Using a complex set of imaging technologies, including inverse fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (iFRAP) and photoactivatable probes, coupled to biochemical experiments, we show that COPI subunit delta (delta-COP) affects the biology of APP, including its subcellular localization and cell surface expression, its trafficking, and its metabolism. These findings demonstrate the crucial role of delta-COP in APP metabolism and, consequently, the generation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide, providing previously nondescribed mechanistic explanations of the underlying events.
27114037	Whole-Genome Sequencing of a Healthy Aging Cohort.	Studies of long-lived individuals have revealed few genetic mechanisms for protection against age-associated disease. Therefore, we pursued genome sequencing of a related phenotype-healthy aging-to understand the genetics of disease-free aging without medical intervention. In contrast with studies of exceptional longevity, usually focused on centenarians, healthy aging is not associated with known longevity variants, but is associated with reduced genetic susceptibility to Alzheimer and coronary artery disease. Additionally, healthy aging is not associated with a decreased rate of rare pathogenic variants, potentially indicating the presence of disease-resistance factors. In keeping with this possibility, we identify suggestive common and rare variant genetic associations implying that protection against cognitive decline is a genetic component of healthy aging. These findings, based on a relatively small cohort, require independent replication. Overall, our results suggest healthy aging is an overlapping but distinct phenotype from exceptional longevity that may be enriched with disease-protective genetic factors. VIDEO ABSTRACT.
27114033	Progranulin Deficiency Promotes Circuit-Specific Synaptic Pruning by Microglia via Complement Activation.	Microglia maintain homeostasis in the brain, but whether aberrant microglial activation can cause neurodegeneration remains controversial. Here, we use transcriptome profiling to demonstrate that deficiency in frontotemporal dementia (FTD) gene progranulin (Grn) leads to an age-dependent, progressive upregulation of lysosomal and innate immunity genes, increased complement production, and enhanced synaptic pruning in microglia. During aging, Grn(-/-) mice show profound microglia infiltration and preferential elimination of inhibitory synapses in the ventral thalamus, which lead to hyperexcitability in the thalamocortical circuits and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)-like grooming behaviors. Remarkably, deleting C1qa gene significantly reduces synaptic pruning by Grn(-/-) microglia and mitigates neurodegeneration, behavioral phenotypes, and premature mortality in Grn(-/-) mice. Together, our results uncover a previously unrecognized role of progranulin in suppressing aberrant microglia activation during aging. These results represent an important conceptual advance that complement activation and microglia-mediated synaptic pruning are major drivers, rather than consequences, of neurodegeneration caused by progranulin deficiency.
27113638	Serum high-density lipoprotein is associated with better cognitive function in a cross-sectional study of aging women.	Purpose/Aim of the study: Poor cardiovascular health, including obesity and altered lipid profiles at mid-life, are linked to increased risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The biological mechanisms linking cardiovascular health and cognitive function are unclear though are likely to be multifactorial. This study examined the association between various lipoproteins and cognitive functioning in ageing women. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We investigated the relationship between readily available biomarkers (i.e. serum lipoprotein) and cognitive decline in domains associated with increased risk of AD (e.g. episodic verbal memory performance and subjective memory complaint). We report cross-sectional data investigating the relationship between serum total cholesterol, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein (HDL-C) and low-density lipoprotein with verbal memory and learning ability in 130 women with and without memory complaints (n = 71 and 59, respectively) drawn from a study investigating cognitively healthy Western Australians (average age 62.5 years old). RESULTS: After statistical modelling that controlled for the effects of age, depression and apolipoprotein E genotype, HDL-C was significantly associated with better verbal learning and memory performance, specifically short and long delay-free recalls (F = 3.062; p < .05 and F = 3.2670; p < .05, respectively). CONCLUSION: Our cross-sectional findings suggest that the positive effect of HDL-C on verbal memory may be present much earlier than previously reported and provide further support for the role of HDL-C in healthy brain ageing. Further exploration of the protective effect of HDL-C on cognitive function in ageing is warranted through follow-up, longitudinal studies.
27112440	Gastrodin Protects Neural Progenitor Cells Against Amyloid beta (1-42)-Induced Neurotoxicity and Improves Hippocampal Neurogenesis in Amyloid beta (1-42)-Injected Mice.	The aim of this study was to investigate the neuroprotective effects of gastrodin (GAS), one of the major bioactive components of Gastrodia elata Blume (Tian Ma), against amyloid beta (Abeta) (1-42)-induced neurotoxicity in primary neural progenitor cells (NPCs). We found that pretreatment with GAS not only prevents a loss in cell viability following treatment with Abeta (1-42) but also counteracts Abeta (1-42)-triggered release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and nitric oxide (NO) in a dose-dependent manner. Additionally, GAS was able to attenuate Abeta (1-42)-induced apoptosis in NPCs, evidenced by the decreased percentage of apoptotic cells and altered expression of apoptosis-related proteins in response to GAS pretreatment prior to Abeta (1-42) exposure. Furthermore, in Abeta (1-42)-injected C57BL/6 mice, we found that systemic administration of GAS could improve hippocampal neurogenesis, manifested by the increased number of SOX-2 and doublecortin (DCX)-positive cells in the DG area. Mechanistic studies revealed that in NPCs, GAS could reverse the Abeta (1-42)-induced increase in phosphorylation of MEK-1/2, extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK), and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). When combining GAS with the MEK inhibitor U0126 or the JNK inhibitor SP600125, we observed a synergistic effect against Abeta (1-42)-induced reduction in cell viability of NPCs. Taken together, these results show the efficacy and underlying mechanism of GAS against amyloid beta (1-42)-induced neurotoxicity and provide substantial insight into the potential merits of GAS for its clinical application in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
27112350	Network-driven plasma proteomics expose molecular changes in the Alzheimer's brain.	BACKGROUND: Biological pathways that significantly contribute to sporadic Alzheimer's disease are largely unknown and cannot be observed directly. Cognitive symptoms appear only decades after the molecular disease onset, further complicating analyses. As a consequence, molecular research is often restricted to late-stage post-mortem studies of brain tissue. However, the disease process is expected to trigger numerous cellular signaling pathways and modulate the local and systemic environment, and resulting changes in secreted signaling molecules carry information about otherwise inaccessible pathological processes. RESULTS: To access this information we probed relative levels of close to 600 secreted signaling proteins from patients' blood samples using antibody microarrays and mapped disease-specific molecular networks. Using these networks as seeds we then employed independent genome and transcriptome data sets to corroborate potential pathogenic pathways. CONCLUSIONS: We identified Growth-Differentiation Factor (GDF) signaling as a novel Alzheimer's disease-relevant pathway supported by in vivo and in vitro follow-up experiments, demonstrating the existence of a highly informative link between cellular pathology and changes in circulatory signaling proteins.
27111701	What are the boundaries of legal guardianship in Alzheimer's disease? An evidence-based update in the context of the Brazilian Civil Code.	The Brazilian Civil Code, which came into force in 2002, established a functional criterion for guardianship proceedings and introduced the concept of "limited guardianship," applied to cases in which incapacity to exercise civil rights is partial. With population aging and the growth in the number of older people with cognitive impairments, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), the need to invoke legal remedies against elder abuse increased; however, difficulties in assessing capacity still lead to a majority of decisions in favor of plenary guardianship. The present article compiled data on capacity in AD subjects. The varying degrees of decision-making impairment at different stages of AD might be compatible with limited guardianship in milder cases of the disease.
27111131	Reversible Hypothermia in a Drug-naive Inpatient with Alzheimer's Disease Receiving Pipamperone.	Hypothermia is a potentially life-threatening side effect of antipsychotic drugs, especially those with strong 5-HT2 antagonist properties. However, the exact underlying mechanism is still under debate. We discuss a case of hypothermia following pipamperone treatment in an elderly female inpatient with Alzheimer's disease, which occurred at day 4 after medication onset and vanished after dose reduction. Thus, this case demonstrates 1) the importance of monitoring body temperature even in low-potency antipsychotics, at least in the elderly, and 2) that in some cases, dose reduction may be a sufficient countermeasure.
27110749	Natural Phytochemicals in the Treatment and Prevention of Dementia: An Overview.	The word dementia describes a class of heterogeneous diseases which etiopathogenetic mechanisms are not well understood. There are different types of dementia, among which, Alzheimer's disease (AD), vascular dementia (VaD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) are the more common. Currently approved pharmacological treatments for most forms of dementia seem to act only on symptoms without having profound disease-modifying effects. Thus, alternative strategies capable of preventing the progressive loss of specific neuronal populations are urgently required. In particular, the attention of researchers has been focused on phytochemical compounds that have shown antioxidative, anti-amyloidogenic, anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic properties and that could represent important resources in the discovery of drug candidates against dementia. In this review, we summarize the neuroprotective effects of the main phytochemicals belonging to the polyphenol, isothiocyanate, alkaloid and cannabinoid families in the prevention and treatment of the most common kinds of dementia. We believe that natural phytochemicals may represent a promising sources of alternative medicine, at least in association with therapies approved to date for dementia.
27110325	Redox Imbalance and Viral Infections in Neurodegenerative Diseases.	Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are essential molecules for many physiological functions and act as second messengers in a large variety of tissues. An imbalance in the production and elimination of ROS is associated with human diseases including neurodegenerative disorders. In the last years the notion that neurodegenerative diseases are accompanied by chronic viral infections, which may result in an increase of neurodegenerative diseases progression, emerged. It is known in literature that enhanced viral infection risk, observed during neurodegeneration, is partly due to the increase of ROS accumulation in brain cells. However, the molecular mechanisms of viral infection, occurring during the progression of neurodegeneration, remain unclear. In this review, we discuss the recent knowledge regarding the role of influenza, herpes simplex virus type-1, and retroviruses infection in ROS/RNS-mediated Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).
27109753	Relationships of human alpha/beta hydrolase fold proteins and other organophosphate-interacting proteins.	Organophosphates (OPs) are either found in nature or synthetized for use as pesticides, flame retardants, neurotoxic warfare agents or drugs (cholinergic enhancers in Alzheimer's disease and myasthenia gravis, or inhibitors of lipases in metabolic diseases). Because of the central role of acetylcholinesterase cholinergic neurotransmission in humans, one of the main purposes for using OPs is inactivation of the enzyme by phosphorylation of the nucleophilic serine residue in the active center. However, hundreds of serine hydrolases are expressed in the human proteome, and many of them are potential targets for OP adduction. In this review, we first situate the alpha/beta hydrolase fold proteins among the distinctively folded proteins known to interact with OPs, in particular the different lipases, peptidases, and enzymes hydrolyzing OPs. Second, we compile the human alpha/beta hydrolases and review those that have been experimentally shown to interact with OPs. Among the 120 human alpha/beta hydrolase fold proteins, 102 have a serine in the consensus GXSXG pentapeptide compatible with an active site, 6 have an aspartate or a cysteine as the active site nucleophile residue, and 12 evidently lack an active site. 76 of the 120 have been experimentally shown to bind an OP.
27109181	Amyloid-beta plaques disrupt axon initial segments.	UNLABELLED: Amyloid-beta (Abeta) plaques are one of the central pathologies of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Plaque formation in animal models of AD coincides with the appearance of synaptic abnormalities, aberrant neuronal excitability, and cognitive decline. Abeta plaques may disrupt neuronal excitability since they have been proposed to be synaptotoxic, to induce axonal varicosities and neurite breakage, and to significantly decrease spine density. Axon initial segments (AIS) also regulate neuronal excitability and help maintain neuronal polarity. Despite these essential functions, the effects of plaques on AIS structure have not been fully determined. Using a mouse AD model, we measured a significant decrease in the density of AIS up to 75mum away from the center of fibrillar, thioflavin-labeled plaques. The reduction was observed in animals with both moderate and severe plaque loads, and was associated with increased densities of microglia near the plaques. Furthermore, animals with severe plaque loads had significantly reduced AIS lengths adjacent to Abeta plaques. These results suggest the local environment surrounding Abeta plaques may be harmful to the AIS. We propose that AIS loss is a previously unappreciated consequence of AD that could significantly impact brain function. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: This paper demonstrates that neurons near Abeta plaques have disrupted axon initial segments. Loss or disruption of AIS is predicted to have detrimental consequences for brain function.
27108910	Liraglutide prevents beta-amyloid-induced neurotoxicity in SH-SY5Y cells via a PI3K-dependent signaling pathway.	OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to investigate the effects of the GLP-1 analog liraglutide on beta-amyloid (Abeta)-induced neurotoxicity in the human neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y and study the underlying mechanisms. METHODS: Cultured SH-SY5Y cells in vitro were randomly divided into normal control group, beta-amyloid (Abeta) group (20, 40, and 80 uM), and liraglutide pre-treatment group (10, 100, and 200 nM). Cell viability was determined by CCK-8 and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Based on its higher protection potentials, the effect of the liraglutide (100 nM) and wortmannin (200 nM) on beta-amyloid (Abeta) group (40 uM) damage in human SH-SY5Ycells was examined by DAPI fluorescence staining and flow cytometry. Caspase-3, Bcl-2, Bax, Cyt-C, Akt, and P-Akt expression were detected by western blotting. RESULTS: We found that exposure of SH-SY5Y to Abeta (25-35)-induced cytotoxicity, increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) leakage, and cellular apoptosis. Interestingly, pre-treatment with liraglutide reversed these reactions. Liraglutide afforded protection against Abeta (25-35)-induced toxicity by inhibiting apoptosis, which was also confirmed by the activated caspase-3 assay. P-Akt and Bcl-2/Bax expression increased after pre-treatment with liraglutide in SH-SY5Y cells exposed to Abeta (25-35), whereas cytochrome-c release decreased. This effect could be reversed by wortmannin, an inhibitor of PI3K (phosphoinositide 3-kinase). DISCUSSION: These findings suggest that liraglutide prevented Abeta (25-35)-induced neurotoxicity by inhibiting neuronal apoptosis and liraglutide may have a neuroprotective effect through activation of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Thus, liraglutide may be a preventive or therapeutic agent for Alzheimer's disease.
27107571	Prevalence and risk factors for prolonged QT interval and QT dispersion in patients with type 2 diabetes.	AIMS: Prolonged QT interval is associated with cardiac arrhythmias and sudden death. The present study determined the prevalence of prolonged QT interval and QT dispersion and defined their clinical and metabolic predictors in patients with type 2 diabetes. METHODS: Cross-sectional study included 501 patients with type 2 diabetes. A standard 12-lead electrocardiogram was recorded. QT corrected for heart rate (QTc) >440 ms and QT dispersion (QTd) >80 ms were considered abnormally prolonged. QTc >/= 500 ms was considered a high-risk QTc prolongation. Demographic, clinical and laboratory data were collected. Independent risk factors for prolonged QTc and QTd were assessed using logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: Prevalence of QTc > 440 ms and QTd > 80 ms were 44.1 and 3.6 %, respectively. Prevalence of high-risk QTc (>/=500 ms) was 2 % only. Independent risk factors for QTc prolongation >440 ms were mean blood glucose (beta = 2.192, p < 0.001), treatment with sulphonylurea (beta = 5.198, p = 0.027), female gender (beta = 8.844, p < 0.001), and coronary heart disease (beta = 8.636, p = 0.001). Independent risk factors for QTc >/= 500 ms were coronary heart disease (beta = 4.134, p < 0.001) and mean blood glucose level (beta = 1.735, p < 0.001). The independent risk factor for prolonged QTd was only coronary heart disease (beta = 5.354, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Although the prevalence of prolonged QTc > 440 ms is significant, the prevalence of high-risk QTc (>/=500 ms) and QTd > 80 ms is very low in patients with type 2 diabetes. Hyperglycaemia and coronary heart disease are strong predictors of high-risk QTc.
27107028	Comparability of [18F]THK5317 and [11C]PIB blood flow proxy images with [18F]FDG positron emission tomography in Alzheimer's disease.	For amyloid positron emission tomography tracers, the simplified reference tissue model derived ratio of influx rate in target relative to reference region (R1) has been shown to serve as a marker of brain perfusion, and, due to the strong coupling between perfusion and metabolism, as a proxy for glucose metabolism. In the present study, 11 prodromal Alzheimer's disease and nine Alzheimer's disease dementia patients underwent [18F]THK5317, carbon-11 Pittsburgh Compound-B ([11C]PIB), and 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-D-glucose ([18F]FDG) positron emission tomography to assess the possible use of early-phase [18F]THK5317 and R1 as proxies for brain perfusion, and thus, for glucose metabolism. Discriminative performance (prodromal vs Alzheimer's disease dementia) of [18F]THK5317 (early-phase SUVr and R1) was compared with that of [11C]PIB (early-phase SUVr and R1) and [18F]FDG. Strong positive correlations were found between [18F]THK5317 (early-phase, R1) and [18F]FDG, particularly in frontal and temporoparietal regions. Differences in correlations between early-phase and R1 ([18F]THK5317 and [11C]PIB) and [18F]FDG, were not statistically significant, nor were differences in area under the curve values in the discriminative analysis. Our findings suggest that early-phase [18F]THK5317 and R1 provide information on brain perfusion, closely related to glucose metabolism. As such, a single positron emission tomography study with [18F]THK5317 may provide information about both tau pathology and brain perfusion in Alzheimer's disease, with potential clinical applications.
27106634	Metaflammasome components in the human brain: a role in dementia with Alzheimer's pathology?	Epidemiological and genetic studies have identified metabolic disorders and inflammation as risk factors for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Evidence in obesity and type-2 diabetes suggests a role for a metabolic inflammasome ("metaflammasome") in mediating chronic inflammation in peripheral organs implicating IKKbeta (inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa-B kinase subunit beta), IRS1 (insulin receptor substrate 1), JNK (c-jun N-terminal kinase), and PKR (double-stranded RNA protein kinase). We hypothesized that these proteins are expressed in the brain in response to metabolic risk factors in AD. Neocortex from 299 participants from the MRC Cognitive Function and Ageing Studies was analysed by immunohistochemistry for the expression of the phosphorylated (active) form of IKKbeta [pSer176/180 ], IRS1 [pS312 ], JNK [pThr183 /Tyr185 ] and PKR [pT451 ]. The data were analyzed to investigate whether the proteins were expressed together and in relation with metabolic disorders, dementia, Alzheimer's pathology and APOE genotype. We observed a change from a positive to a negative association between the proteins and hypertension according to the dementia status. Type-2 diabetes was negatively related with the proteins among participants without dementia; whereas participants with dementia and AD pathology showed a positive association with JNK. A significant association between IKKbeta and JNK in participants with dementia and AD pathology was observed, but not in those without dementia. Otherwise, weak to moderate associations were observed among the protein loads. The presence of dementia was significantly associated with JNK and negatively associated with IKKbeta and IRS1. Cognitive scores showed a significant positive relationship with IKKbeta and a negative with IRS1, JNK and PKR. The proteins were significantly associated with pathology in Alzheimer's participants with the relationship being inverse or not significant in participants without dementia. Expression of the proteins was not related to APOE genotype. These findings highlight a role for these proteins in AD pathophysiology but not necessarily as a complex.
27106271	Relation between aerobic fitness and brain structures in amnestic mild cognitive impairment elderly.	Mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) is a clinical condition, with high risk to develop Alzheimer's disease. Physical exercise may have positive effect on cognition and brain structure in older adults. However, it is still under research whether these influences are true on aMCI subjects with low Ab_42 and high total tau in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which is considered a biomarker for AD. Therefore, we aimed to investigate a possible relation between aerobic fitness (AF) and gray matter (GM) volume and AF and white matter (WM) integrity in aMCI with a CSF biomarker. Twenty-two participants with aMCI acquired the images on a 3.0-T MRI. AF was assessed by a graded exercise test on a treadmill. Voxel-based morphometry and tract-based spatial statistic methods were used to analyze the GM volume and WM microstructural integrity, respectively. We correlated AF and GM volume and WM integrity in aMCI (p < 0.05, FWE corrected, cluster with at least five voxels). There was a positive relation between AF and GM volume mostly in frontal superior cortex. In WM integrity, AF was positively correlated with fractional anisotropy and negatively correlated with mean diffusivity and radial diffusivity, all in the same tracts that interconnect frontal, temporal, parietal, and occipital areas (longitudinal fasciculus, fronto-occipital fasciculus, and corpus callosum). These results suggest that aerobic fitness may have a positive influence on protection of brain even in aMCI CSF biomarker, a high-risk population to convert to AD.
27105448	Carnosine and Homocarnosine Degradation Mechanisms by the Human Carnosinase Enzyme CN1: Insights from Multiscale Simulations.	The endogenous dipeptide l-carnosine, and its derivative homocarnosine, prevent and reduce several pathologies like amytrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease. Their beneficial action is severely hampered because of the hydrolysis by carnosinase enzymes, in particular the human carnosinase, hCN1. This belongs to the metallopeptidase M20 family, where a cocatalytic active site is formed by two Zn(2+) ions, bridged by a hydroxide anion. The protein may exist as a monomer and as a dimer in vivo. Here we used hybrid quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics simulations based on the dimeric apoenzyme's structural information to predict the Michaelis complexes with l-carnosine and its derivative homocarnosine. On the basis of our calculations, we suggest that (i) l-carnosine degradation occurs through a nucleophilic attack of a Zn(2+)-coordinated bridging moiety for both monomer and dimer. This mechanistic hypothesis for hCN1 catalysis differs from previous proposals, while it is in agreement with available experimental data. (ii) The experimentally measured higher affinity of homocarnosine for the enzyme relative to l-carnosine might be explained, at least in part, by more extensive interactions inside the monomeric and dimeric hCN1's active site. (iii) Hydrogen bonds at the binding site, present in the dimer but absent in the monomer, might play a role in the experimentally observed higher activity of the dimeric form. Investigations of the enzymatic reaction are required to establish or disprove this hypothesis. Our results may serve as a basis for the design of potent hCN1 inhibitors.
27104962	Macular Thickness Measurements with Frequency Domain-OCT for Quantification of Retinal Neural Loss and its Correlation with Cognitive Impairment in Alzheimer's Disease.	PURPOSE: To evaluate the ability of frequency domain optical coherence tomography (fd-OCT) to estimate retinal neural loss in eyes with Alzheimer's disease (AD). We also verified the existence of a correlation between AD-related cognitive impairment and macular and peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness measurements. METHODS: fd-OCT scans were obtained from 45 eyes of 24 patients with AD and 48 control eyes. Peripapillary RNFL, macular full-thickness and segmented inner macular thickness parameters were calculated. The inner macular parameters included macular retinal nerve fiber layer (mRNFL) thickness, ganglion cell layer (GCL) plus inner plexiform layer thickness (GCL+), and RNFL plus GCL+ thickness (GCL++). The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) was used to assess cognition in all subjects. The two groups were compared and the relationship between MMSE scores and fd-OCT measurements was verified. RESULTS: Average, superior and inferior quadrant RNFL thickness parameters and all but one of the nine full-thickness macular measurements were significantly reduced in AD patients compared to controls. The segmented layers, GCL+ and GCL++ were significantly reduced in AD eyes. A significant correlation was found between most fd-OCT parameters (especially macular thickness measurements) and MMSE scores. CONCLUSIONS: Most fd-OCT peripapillary RNFL and macular full-thickness and segmented inner retinal layers parameters were reduced in AD eyes compared to controls. Moreover, neuronal loss, especially as reflected in macular parameters, correlated well with cognitive impairment in AD. Our results suggest that fd-OCT could be a potentially useful diagnostic tool in the evaluation and follow-up of AD patients.
27104898	Drawing Disorders in Alzheimer's Disease and Other Forms of Dementia.	Drawing is a multicomponential process that can be impaired by many kinds of brain lesions. Drawing disorders are very common in Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia, and can provide clinical information for the distinction of the different dementing diseases. In our review we started from an overview of the neural and cognitive bases of drawing, and from a recollection of the drawing tasks more frequently used for assessing individuals with dementia. Then, we analyzed drawing disorders in dementia, paying special attention to those observed in Alzheimer's disease, from the prodromal stages of the amnesic mild cognitive impairment to the stages of full-blown dementia, both in the sporadic forms with late onset in the entorhino-hippocampal structures and in those with early onset in the posterior neocortical structures. We reviewed the drawing features that could differentiate Alzheimer's disease from vascular dementia and from the most frequent forms of degenerative dementia, namely frontotemporal dementia and Lewy body disease. Finally, we examined some peculiar aspects of drawing disorders in dementia, such as perseverations, rotations, and closing-in. We argue that a careful analysis of drawing errors helps to differentiate the different forms of dementia more than overall accuracy in drawing.
27104894	Dementia and Rapid Mortality: Who is at Risk?	BACKGROUND: Dementia is typically known for its insidious onset and slowly progressive course, but a subgroup deteriorates fast and dies within years or even months. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to characterize dementia patients with a rapidly progressive course to death and evaluate their cause of death. METHODS: We retrospectively included all patients from the Amsterdam Dementia Cohort who died within two years after diagnosis. We evaluated the characteristics of these rapid progressors and compared them to patients known to be alive two years after diagnosis ('non-rapid mortality'). RESULTS: We included 129 dementia patients (13% of our total cohort with known follow-up) with rapid mortality (age 72+/-10 y [29% <65 y], 70[55%]M, MMSE 20+/-5). Mean(SD) survival was 12+/-7 months. Compared to non-rapid mortality patients (n = 892; age 68+/-9, 503(56%)M, MMSE 22+/-5), patients with rapid mortality were slightly older at time of diagnosis, had lower MMSE scores, more depressive symptoms and higher prevalence of a cardiovascular history (all p < 0.05). Alzheimer's disease (AD, 43%) was most frequent in patients with rapid mortality, but the occurrence was much lower compared to non-rapid mortality patients (71%), while all other dementia diagnoses, especially Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), vascular dementia (VaD), and frontotemporal dementia (FTD), were more frequent (p < 0.001). There were no specific characteristics for AD patients with rapid versus non-rapid mortality, especially APOE genotypes and CSF-profiles were comparable (p > 0.70). Cause of death was highly variable without a clear relation to dementia diagnosis, with exception of dementia itself in CJD, intracerebral hematoma in VaD, and motor neuron disease in FTD. CONCLUSIONS: Short survival is relatively common ( approximately 13% in our cohort) and occurs in all different types of dementia, with overrepresentation of non-AD dementias like CJD, VaD, and FTD.
27104649	L17A/F19A Substitutions Augment the alpha-Helicity of beta-Amyloid Peptide Discordant Segment.	beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) aggregation has been thought to be associated with the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Recently, we showed that L17A/F19A substitutions may increase the structural stability of wild-type and Arctic-type Abeta40 and decrease the rates of structural conversion and fibril formation. However, the underlying mechanism for the increase of structural stability as a result of the alanine substitutions remained elusive. In this study, we apply nuclear magnetic resonance and circular dichroism spectroscopies to characterize the Abeta40 structure, demonstrating that L17A/F19A substitutions can augment the alpha-helicity of the residues located in the alpha/beta-discordant segment (resides 15 to 23) of both wild-type and Arctic-type Abeta40. These results provide a structural basis to link the alpha-helicity of the alpha/beta-discordant segment with the conformational conversion propensity of Abeta.
27104579	New Features about Tau Function and Dysfunction.	Tau is a brain microtubule-associated protein that directly binds to a microtubule and dynamically regulates its structure and function. Under pathological conditions, tau self-assembles into filamentous structures that end up forming neurofibrillary tangles. Prominent tau neurofibrillary pathology is a common feature in a number of neurodegenerative disorders, collectively referred to as tauopathies, the most common of which is Alzheimer's disease (AD). Beyond its classical role as a microtubule-associated protein, recent advances in our understanding of tau cellular functions have revealed novel insights into their important role during pathogenesis and provided potential novel therapeutic targets. Regulation of tau behavior and function under physiological and pathological conditions is mainly achieved through post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, glycosylation, acetylation, and truncation, among others, indicating the complexity and variability of factors influencing regulation of tau toxicity, all of which have significant implications for the development of novel therapeutic approaches in various neurodegenerative disorders. A more comprehensive understanding of the molecular mechanisms regulating tau function and dysfunction will provide us with a better outline of tau cellular networking and, hopefully, offer new clues for designing more efficient approaches to tackle tauopathies in the near future.
27104138	Differential diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases using structural MRI data.	Different neurodegenerative diseases can cause memory disorders and other cognitive impairments. The early detection and the stratification of patients according to the underlying disease are essential for an efficient approach to this healthcare challenge. This emphasizes the importance of differential diagnostics. Most studies compare patients and controls, or Alzheimer's disease with one other type of dementia. Such a bilateral comparison does not resemble clinical practice, where a clinician is faced with a number of different possible types of dementia. Here we studied which features in structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans could best distinguish four types of dementia, Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal dementia, vascular dementia, and dementia with Lewy bodies, and control subjects. We extracted an extensive set of features quantifying volumetric and morphometric characteristics from T1 images, and vascular characteristics from FLAIR images. Classification was performed using a multi-class classifier based on Disease State Index methodology. The classifier provided continuous probability indices for each disease to support clinical decision making. A dataset of 504 individuals was used for evaluation. The cross-validated classification accuracy was 70.6% and balanced accuracy was 69.1% for the five disease groups using only automatically determined MRI features. Vascular dementia patients could be detected with high sensitivity (96%) using features from FLAIR images. Controls (sensitivity 82%) and Alzheimer's disease patients (sensitivity 74%) could be accurately classified using T1-based features, whereas the most difficult group was the dementia with Lewy bodies (sensitivity 32%). These results were notable better than the classification accuracies obtained with visual MRI ratings (accuracy 44.6%, balanced accuracy 51.6%). Different quantification methods provided complementary information, and consequently, the best results were obtained by utilizing several quantification methods. The results prove that automatic quantification methods and computerized decision support methods are feasible for clinical practice and provide comprehensive information that may help clinicians in the diagnosis making.
27103528	Association of genetic risk factors with cognitive decline: the PATH through life project.	We examined the association of 28 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), previously associated with dementia or cognitive performance, with tests assessing episodic memory, working memory, vocabulary, and perceptual speed in 1689 nondemented older Australians of European ancestry. In addition to testing each variant individually, we assessed the collective association of the 12-risk SNPs for late-onset Alzheimer's disease using weighted and unweighted genetic risk scores. Significant associations with cognitive performance were observed for APOE epsilon4 allele, ABCA7-rs3764650, CR1-rs3818361, MS4A4E-rs6109332, BDNF-rs6265, COMT-rs4680, CTNNBL-rs6125962, FRMD4A-rs17314229, FRMD4A-rs17314229, intergenic SNP chrX-rs12007229, PDE7A-rs10808746, SORL1-rs668387, and ZNF224-rs3746319. In addition, the weighted genetic risk score was associated with worse performance on episodic memory. The identification of genetic risk factors, that act individually or collectively, may help in screening for people with elevated risk of cognitive decline and for understanding the biological pathways that underlie cognitive decline.
27103525	EEG-directed connectivity from posterior brain regions is decreased in dementia with Lewy bodies: a comparison with Alzheimer's disease and controls.	Directed information flow between brain regions might be disrupted in dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and relate to the clinical syndrome of DLB. To investigate this hypothesis, resting-state electroencephalography recordings were obtained in patients with probable DLB and Alzheimer's disease (AD), and controls (N = 66 per group, matched for age and gender). Phase transfer entropy was used to measure directed connectivity in the groups for the theta, alpha, and beta frequency band. A posterior-to-anterior phase transfer entropy gradient, with occipital channels driving the frontal channels, was found in controls in all frequency bands. This posterior-to-anterior gradient was largely lost in DLB in the alpha band (p < 0.05). In the beta band, posterior brain regions were less driving in information flow in AD than in DLB and controls. In conclusion, the common posterior-to-anterior pattern of directed connectivity in controls is disturbed in DLB patients in the alpha band, and in AD patients in the beta band. Disrupted alpha band-directed connectivity may underlie the clinical syndrome of DLB and differentiate between DLB and AD.
27103524	The executive prominent/memory prominent spectrum in Alzheimer's disease is highly heritable.	Late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) can present heterogeneously, with several subtypes recognized, including dysexecutive AD. One way to identify people with dysexecutive AD is to consider the difference between memory and executive functioning, which we refer to as the executive prominent/memory prominent spectrum. We aimed to determine if this spectrum was heritable. We used neuropsychological and genetic data from people with mild LOAD (Clinical Dementia Rating 0.5 or 1.0) from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. We cocalibrated the neuropsychological data to obtain executive functioning and memory scores and used their difference as a continuous phenotype to calculate its heritability overall and by chromosome. Narrow-sense heritability of the difference between memory and executive functioning scores was 0.68 (standard error 0.12). Single nucleotide polymorphisms on chromosomes 1, 2, 4, 11, 12, and 18 explained the largest fraction of phenotypic variance, with signals from each chromosome accounting for 5%-7%. The chromosomal pattern of heritability differed substantially from that of LOAD itself.
27103523	Relationships between sleep quality and brain volume, metabolism, and amyloid deposition in late adulthood.	Recent studies in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and in humans suggest that sleep disruption and amyloid-beta (Abeta) accumulation are interrelated, and may, thus, exacerbate each other. We investigated the association between self-reported sleep variables and neuroimaging data in 51 healthy older adults. Participants completed a questionnaire assessing sleep quality and quantity and underwent positron emission tomography scans using [18F]florbetapir and [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose and an magnetic resonance imaging scan to measure Abeta burden, hypometabolism, and atrophy, respectively. Longer sleep latency was associated with greater Abeta burden in prefrontal areas. Moreover, the number of nocturnal awakenings was negatively correlated with gray matter volume in the insular region. In asymptomatic middle-aged and older adults, lower self-reported sleep quality was associated with greater Abeta burden and lower volume in brain areas relevant in aging and AD, but not with glucose metabolism. These results highlight the potential relevance of preserving sleep quality in older adults and suggest that sleep may be a factor to screen for in individuals at risk for AD.
27103054	Testing and disclosures related to amyloid imaging and Alzheimer's disease: Common questions and fact sheet summary.	Alzheimer's disease research has often focused on the molecular brain changes that promote memory loss and other dementia-related cognitive impairments. Many studies, for example, have used positron emission tomography (PET) imaging to measure brain levels of the beta-amyloid protein, a key molecular suspect in Alzheimer's. In recent years, PET scans have become more prominent in clinical settings. Clinicians may use a positive PET scan-that is, a significant presence of beta-amyloid plaques in the brain-to help determine a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. Yet, because beta-amyloid PET remains a fairly new diagnostic tool, physicians and patients still have many basic questions about how and why it is used. This article addresses some of those questions. It explains what PET scans actually show, how they are employed in research and clinical trials, and when they should and should not be used to help diagnose Alzheimer's in everyday patients. The article also discusses whether cognitively healthy people should request PET scans to assess their risk for developing dementia. Information in the text will be updated in future years, as diagnostic imaging techniques for Alzheimer's disease continue to evolve.
27103040	The Role of Insulin Resistance and Glucose Metabolism Dysregulation in the Development of Alzheimer s Disease.	Alzheimer s disease is a chronic neurodegenerative disorder affecting millions of people worldwide, characterized by a progressive decline in cognitive functions. Factors involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer s disease include metabolic alterations such as insulin resistance and hyperglycemia, both of which are also hallmarks of type-2 diabetes mellitus. The accumulation of beta-amyloid peptides in the brain of Alzheimer s patients is responsible in part for the neurotoxicity underlying the loss of synaptic plasticity that triggers a cascade of events leading to cell death. A large number of studies revealed the key role of the hippocampus and cerebral cortex in the memory and learning deficits of Alzheimer s disease. Although ample evidence suggests a link between altered insulin action, the dysregulation of glucose metabolism, and beta-amyloid accumulation in animal models and humans with Alzheimer s, no supporting evidence was available. In this article, we review the potential toxic effects of beta-amyloid in the hypothalamus, a brain center involved in the control of insulin action and glucose metabolism. Furthermore, we discuss our recent studies unraveling a novel neurotoxic action of beta-amyloid that perturbs hypothalamic glucoregulation, leading to increased hepatic glucose production and hyperglycemia. These findings provide evidence for a link between beta-amyloid toxicity and altered glucose metabolism.
27101792	Focused ultrasound as a non-invasive intervention for neurological disease: a review.	Focused ultrasound (FUS) is an incision-less intervention that is a Food and Drug Association (FDA) approved surgical treatment for various pathologies including uterine fibroids and bone metastases. Recent advances in magnetic resonance imaging thermometry and ability to use FUS across the intact calvarium have re-opened interest in the use of FUS in the treatment of neurological diseases. FUS currently has a European CE mark for use in movement disorders. However, it shows potential in the treatment of other neuropathologies including tumours and as a lesional tool in epilepsy. FUS may exert its therapeutic effect through thermal or mechanical fragmentation of intracranial lesions, or by enhancing delivery of pharmaceutical agents across the blood-brain barrier. In this review, we summarise the mechanisms, clinical applications and potential future of FUS for the treatment of neurological disease. We have searched for and described the recently completed and on-going clinical trials investigating FUS for the treatment of neurological disorders. We identified phase one trials investigating utility of FUS in: movement disorders (including essential tremor and Parkinson's disease), chronic pain, obsessive-compulsive disorder and cerebral tumours. Current literature also reports pre-clinical work exploring utility in epilepsy, neurodegenerative conditions (such as Alzheimer's disease) and thrombolysis. Safety and early efficacy data are now emerging, suggesting that transcalvarial FUS is a feasible and safe intervention. Further evidence is required to determine whether FUS is an effective alternative in comparison to current neurosurgical interventions. The cost of requisite hardware is currently a barrier to widespread uptake in UK neurosurgical centres.
27101140	Neuropsychiatric Symptoms in Parkinson's Disease Dementia Are More Similar to Alzheimer's Disease than Dementia with Lewy Bodies: A Case-Control Study.	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Previous studies on the clinical and pathological manifestations of Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD) have reported findings more similar to dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) than to Alzheimer's disease (AD). The aim of this study was to investigate the neuropsychiatric symptoms of PDD compared to DLB and AD. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective case-control study on 125 newly diagnosed consecutive PDD patients and age- and dementia stage-matched controls with either DLB (N = 250) or AD (N = 500) who visited the same hospital over the same period. For each case and control, neuropsychiatric symptoms were assessed using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI). RESULTS: Overall, 513 (58.6%) patients were female and 362 (41.4%) were male. Comparisons of clinical data revealed that the PDD group, similar to the AD group, had a lower NPI total score, NPI caregiver burden score, and rate of antipsychotic use (all p < 0.001) than the DLB group. One or more psychiatric symptoms were reported in 95.2% of the PDD, 99.2% of the DLB, and 96.8% of the AD patients. The PDD group had lower subscores in the items of delusions, hallucinations, agitation, anxiety, irritation, aberrant motor behavior compared to the DLB group. Severe neuropsychiatric symptoms among all dementia patients were associated with younger age, more advanced stage, and a diagnosis of DLB. CONCLUSION: Neuropsychiatric symptoms in PDD were more like those in AD than in DLB. Severe neuropsychiatric symptoms in degenerative dementia were associated with younger age, more advanced stage of dementia, and a diagnosis of DLB.
27099354	Transthyretin variants with improved inhibition of beta-amyloid aggregation.	Aggregation of beta-amyloid (Abeta) is widely believed to cause neuronal dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease. Transthyretin (TTR) binds to Abeta and inhibits its aggregation and neurotoxicity. TTR is a homotetrameric protein, with each monomer containing a short alpha-helix and two anti-parallel beta-sheets. Dimers pack into tetramers to form a hydrophobic cavity. Here we report the discovery of a TTR mutant, N98A, that was more effective at inhibiting Abeta aggregation than wild-type (WT) TTR, although N98A and WT bound Abeta equally. The N98A mutation is located on a flexible loop distant from the putative Abeta-binding sites and does not alter secondary and tertiary structures nor prevent correct assembly into tetramers. Under non-physiological conditions, N98A tetramers were kinetically and thermodynamically less stable than WT, suggesting a difference in the tetramer folded structure. In vivo, the lone cysteine in TTR is frequently modified by S-cysteinylation or S-sulfonation. Like the N98A mutation, S-cysteinylation of TTR modestly decreased tetramer stability and increased TTR's effectiveness at inhibiting Abeta aggregation. Collectively, these data indicate that a subtle change in TTR tetramer structure measurably increases TTR's ability to inhibit Abeta aggregation.
27099072	Human wild-type full-length tau accumulation disrupts mitochondrial dynamics and the functions via increasing mitofusins.	Intracellular accumulation of tau protein is hallmark of sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD), however, the cellular mechanism whereby tau accumulation causes neurodegeneration is poorly understood. Here we report that overexpression of human wild-type full-length tau (termed htau) disrupted mitochondrial dynamics by enhancing fusion and induced their perinuclear accumulation in HEK293 cells and rat primary hippocampal neurons. The htau accumulation at later stage inhibited mitochondrial functions shown by the decreased ATP level, the ratio of ATP/ADP and complex I activity. Simultaneously, the cell viability was decreased with retraction of the cellular/neuronal processes. Further studies demonstrated that htau accumulation increased fusion proteins, including OPA1 and mitofusins (Mfn1, Mfn2) and reduced the ubiquitination of Mfn2. Downregulation of the mitofusins by shRNA to ~45% or ~52% of the control levels attenuated the htau-enhanced mitochondrial fusion and restored the functions, while downregulation of OPA1 to ~50% of the control level did not show rescue effects. Finally, abnormal mitochondrial accumulation and dysfunction were also observed in the brains of htau transgenic mice. Taken together, our data demonstrate that htau accumulation decreases cell viability and causes degeneration via enhancing mitofusin-associated mitochondrial fusion, which provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying tauopathies.
27098829	Cingulate island sign on FDG-PET is associated with medial temporal lobe atrophy in dementia with Lewy bodies.	OBJECTIVE: The cingulate island sign (CIS), which refers to sparing of the posterior cingulate relative to the precuneus and cuneus, has been proposed as an FDG-PET imaging feature of dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). The sign is reportedly associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) type neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) pathology in autopsy cases. To confirm this relationship using neuroimaging modalities in vivo, we investigated associations between CIS and the medial temporal lobe (MTL) atrophy in DLB. METHODS: Twenty-four patients each of DLB and AD underwent both (18)F-FDG-PET and MRI with voxel-based morphometry. Dopamine transporter (DAT) density was also measured by DAT-SPECT in all those with DLB and in five with AD. The accumulation of FDG in the posterior cingulate ROI was divided by that in the precuneus plus cuneus ROI to derive the CIS ratio from the FDG-PET images. Values for cognitive function of Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB) and Ray Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT) and scores for the core-feature triad of fluctuation, hallucination and parkinsonism were also statistically analyzed. RESULTS: The CIS ratio was higher in DLB than in AD (p < 0.001). The degree of MTL atrophy was lower in DLB than in AD (p < 0.001). The CIS ratio and the degree of MTL atrophy were inversely correlated with DLB (p < 0.001) and with AD (p < 0.05). The CIS ratio did not significantly correlate with DAT density in DLB or with MMSE, FAB, fluctuation score and parkinsonism score. However, the CIS ratio significantly correlated with RAVLT and hallucination scores (both, p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The CIS on FDG-PET in DLB was associated with MTL atrophy but not with striatal DAT density, suggesting that the CIS is a useful neuroimaging biomarker to evaluate coexisting AD-type NFT pathology in vivo. The CIS was also associated with memory impairment and visual hallucination in DLB.
27097852	Untangling the brain's neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative transcriptional responses.	A common approach to understanding neurodegenerative disease is comparing gene expression in diseased versus healthy tissues. We illustrate that expression profiles derived from whole tissue RNA highly reflect the degenerating tissues' altered cellular composition, not necessarily transcriptional regulation. To accurately understand transcriptional changes that accompany neuropathology, we acutely purify neurons, astrocytes and microglia from single adult mouse brains and analyse their transcriptomes by RNA sequencing. Using peripheral endotoxemia to establish the method, we reveal highly specific transcriptional responses and altered RNA processing in each cell type, with Tnfr1 required for the astrocytic response. Extending the method to an Alzheimer's disease model, we confirm that transcriptomic changes observed in whole tissue are driven primarily by cell type composition, not transcriptional regulation, and identify hundreds of cell type-specific changes undetected in whole tissue RNA. Applying similar methods to additional models and patient tissues will transform our understanding of aberrant gene expression in neurological disease.
27097664	Classification of the primary progressive aphasias: principles and review of progress since 2011.	Highly influential recommendations published in 2011 for the classification of the primary progressive aphasias (PPA) distinguished three subtypes: the semantic variant, the nonfluent/agrammatic variant, and the logopenic variant. We review empirical evidence published after 2011 that bears relevance to the validity of the recommended classification scheme. The studies that we review principally rely on monocentric, memory clinic-based consecutive series of PPA patients. We review whether a data-driven analysis of neurolinguistic test scores confirms the subtyping that was based on expert consensus, whether the 2011 subtyping covers the diversity of PPA in a comprehensive manner, and whether the proposed subgroups differ along dimensions that are not explicitly part of the defining criteria, such as diffusion tractography. Data-driven mathematical analyses of neurolinguistic data in PPA broadly confirm the presence of separate clusters corresponding to the subtypes but also leave 15-30% unclassified. A comprehensive description of PPA requires the addition of the mixed variant as a fourth subtype and needs to leave room for cases fulfilling the criteria for a root diagnosis of PPA but not those of any of the three subtypes. Finally, given the limited predictive value of the clinical phenotype for the underlying neuropathology, biomarkers of the underlying pathology are likely of clinical utility in PPA.
27097226	Intra-Individual Variability of Physical Activity in Older Adults With and Without Mild Alzheimer's Disease.	Physical activity shows promise for protection against cognitive decline in older adults with and without Alzheimer's disease (AD). To better understand barriers to adoption of physical activity in this population, a clear understanding of daily and weekly activity patterns is needed. Most accelerometry studies report average physical activity over an entire wear period without considering the potential importance of the variability of physical activity. This study evaluated individual differences in the amount and intra-individual variability of physical activity and determined whether these differences could be predicted by AD status, day of wear, age, gender, education, and cardiorespiratory capacity. Physical activity was measured via accelerometry (Actigraph GT3X+) over one week in 86 older adults with and without AD (n = 33 and n = 53, respectively). Mixed-effects location-scale models were estimated to evaluate and predict individual differences in the amount and intra-individual variability of physical activity. Results indicated that compared to controls, participants with AD averaged 21% less activity, but averaged non-significantly greater intra-individual variability. Women and men averaged similar amounts of physical activity, but women were significantly less variable. The amount of physical activity differed significantly across days of wear. Increased cardiorespiratory capacity was associated with greater average amounts of physical activity. Investigation of individual differences in the amount and intra-individual variability of physical activity provided insight into differences by AD status, days of monitor wear, gender, and cardiovascular capacity. All individuals regardless of AD status were equally consistent in their physical activity, which may have been due to a highly sedentary sample and/or the early disease stage of those participants with AD. These results highlight the value of considering individual differences in both the amount and intra-individual variability of physical activity.
27096746	Design of Peptide Substrate for Sensitively and Specifically Detecting Two Abeta-Degrading Enzymes: Neprilysin and Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme.	Upregulation of neprilysin (NEP) to reduce Abeta accumulation in the brain is a promising strategy for the prevention of Alzheimer's disease (AD). This report describes the design and synthesis of a quenched fluorogenic peptide substrate qf-Abeta(12-16)AAC (with the sequence VHHQKAAC), which has a fluorophore, Alexa-350, linked to the side-chain of its C-terminal cysteine and a quencher, Dabcyl, linked to its N-terminus. This peptide emitted strong fluorescence upon cleavage. Our results showed that qf-Abeta(12-16)AAC is more sensitive to NEP than the previously reported peptide substrates, so that concentrations of NEP as low as 0.03 nM could be detected at peptide concentration of 2 muM. Moreover, qf-Abeta(12-16)AAC had superior enzymatic specificity for both NEP and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), but was inert with other Abeta-degrading enzymes. This peptide, used in conjunction with a previously reported peptide substrate qf-Abeta(1-7)C [which is sensitive to NEP and insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE)], could be used for high-throughput screening of compounds that only upregulate NEP. The experimental results of cell-based activity assays using both qf-Abeta(1-7)C and qf-Abeta(12-16)AAC as the substrates confirm that somatostatin treatment most likely upregulates IDE, but not NEP, in neuroblastoma cells.
27096739	Learning Biomarker Models for Progression Estimation of Alzheimer's Disease.	Being able to estimate a patient's progress in the course of Alzheimer's disease and predicting future progression based on a number of observed biomarker values is of great interest for patients, clinicians and researchers alike. In this work, an approach for disease progress estimation is presented. Based on a set of subjects that convert to a more severe disease stage during the study, models that describe typical trajectories of biomarker values in the course of disease are learned using quantile regression. A novel probabilistic method is then derived to estimate the current disease progress as well as the rate of progression of an individual by fitting acquired biomarkers to the models. A particular strength of the method is its ability to naturally handle missing data. This means, it is applicable even if individual biomarker measurements are missing for a subject without requiring a retraining of the model. The functionality of the presented method is demonstrated using synthetic and--employing cognitive scores and image-based biomarkers--real data from the ADNI study. Further, three possible applications for progress estimation are demonstrated to underline the versatility of the approach: classification, construction of a spatio-temporal disease progression atlas and prediction of future disease progression.
27095366	The Science of Vascular Contributions to Cognitive Impairment and Dementia (VCID): A Framework for Advancing Research Priorities in the Cerebrovascular Biology of Cognitive Decline.	The World Health Organization reports that 47.5 million people are affected by dementia worldwide. With aging populations and 7.7 million new cases each year, the burden of illness due to dementia approaches crisis proportions. Despite significant advances in our understanding of the biology of Alzheimer's disease (AD), the leading dementia diagnosis, the actual causes of dementia in affected individuals are unknown except for rare fully penetrant genetic forms. Evidence from epidemiology and pathology studies indicates that damage to the vascular system is associated with an increased risk of many types of dementia. Both Alzheimer's pathology and cerebrovascular disease increase with age. How AD affects small blood vessel function and how vascular dysfunction contributes to the molecular pathology of Alzheimer's are areas of intense research. The science of vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID) integrates diverse aspects of biology and incorporates the roles of multiple cell types that support the function of neural tissue. Because of the proven ability to prevent and treat cardiovascular disease and hypertension with population benefits for heart and stroke outcomes, it is proposed that understanding and targeting the biological mechanisms of VCID can have a similarly positive impact on public health.
27095262	The cytoskeleton as a novel therapeutic target for old neurodegenerative disorders.	Cytoskeleton defects, including alterations in microtubule stability, in axonal transport as well as in actin dynamics, have been characterized in several unrelated neurodegenerative conditions. These observations suggest that defects of cytoskeleton organization may be a common feature contributing to neurodegeneration. In line with this hypothesis, drugs targeting the cytoskeleton are currently being tested in animal models and in human clinical trials, showing promising effects. Drugs that modulate microtubule stability, inhibitors of posttranslational modifications of cytoskeletal components, specifically compounds affecting the levels of tubulin acetylation, and compounds targeting signaling molecules which regulate cytoskeleton dynamics, constitute the mostly addressed therapeutic interventions aiming at preventing cytoskeleton damage in neurodegenerative disorders. In this review, we will discuss in a critical perspective the current knowledge on cytoskeleton damage pathways as well as therapeutic strategies designed to revert cytoskeleton-related defects mainly focusing on the following neurodegenerative disorders: Alzheimer's Disease, Parkinson's Disease, Huntington's Disease, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis and Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease.
27094783	Identifying GSK-3beta kinase inhibitors of Alzheimer's disease: Virtual screening, enzyme, and cell assays.	Glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK-3beta) is widely known as a critical target protein for treating Alzheimer's disease (AD). We utilized virtual screening to search databases for compounds with the potential to be used in drugs targeting GSK-3beta kinase, and kinase as well as cell assays to investigate top-scored, selected compounds. Virtual screening of >1.1 million compounds in the ZINC and in-house databases was conducted using an optimized computational protocol in the docking program GOLD. Of the top-ranked compounds, 16 underwent a luminescent kinase assay and a cell assay using HEK293 cells expressing DsRed-tagged DeltaK280 in the repeat domain of tau (tauRD). The compounds VB-003 (a potent GSK-3beta inhibitor) and VB-008 (AM404, an anandamide transport inhibitor), with determined IC50 values of 0.25 and 5.4muM, respectively, were identified as reducing tau aggregation. Both compounds increased expression of phospho-GSK-3beta (Ser9) and reduced endogenous tau phosphorylation at the sites of Ser202, Thr231, and Ser396. In the K280 tauRD-DsRed SH-SY5Y cells, VB-008, but not VB-003, enhanced HSPB1 and GRP78 expression, increased K280 tauRD-DsRed solubility, and promoted neurite outgrowth. Thus VB-008 performed best to the end of the present study. The identified compound VB-008 may guide the identification and synthesis of potential inhibitors analogous to this compound.
27094761	Characterization of a sensitive mouse Abeta40 PD biomarker assay for Alzheimer's disease drug development in wild-type mice.	AIM: Transgenic mice that overexpress human amyloid precursor protein with Swedish or London (APPswe or APPlon) mutations have been widely used for preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD) drug development. AD patients, however, rarely possess these mutations or overexpress APP. RESULTS: We developed a sensitive ELISA that specifically and accurately measures low levels of endogenous Abeta40 in mouse plasma, brain and CSF. In wild-type mice treated with a bispecific anti-TfR/BACE1 antibody, significant Abeta reductions were observed in the periphery and the brain. APPlon transgenic mice showed a slightly less reduction, whereas APPswe mice did not have any decrease. CONCLUSION: This sensitive and well-characterized mouse Abeta40 assay enables the use of wild-type mice for preclinical PK/PD and efficacy studies of potential AD therapeutics.
27094739	CRTC1 gene is differentially methylated in the human hippocampus in Alzheimer's disease.	BACKGROUND: CRTC1 (CREB regulated transcription coactivator 1) gene plays a role in synaptic plasticity, learning and long-term memory formation in the hippocampus. Recently, CRTC1 has been shown to be downregulated in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Nevertheless, the mechanisms underlying CRTC1 dysregulation in AD remain unclear. METHODS: To understand better the epigenetic mechanisms regulating CRTC1 expression that may be altered in AD, we profiled DNA methylation at CpG site resolution by bisulfite cloning sequencing in two promoter regions (referred to as Prom1 and Prom2) of the CRTC1 gene in human hippocampus from controls and AD cases. Next, we correlated DNA methylation levels with AD-related pathology, i.e., beta-amyloid and phosphorylated-tau (p-tau) burden and also measured CRTC1 mRNA levels by RT-qPCR. RESULTS: Methylation levels were lower in AD cases as compared to controls within both promoter regions (Prom1: 0.95% vs. 5%, p-value < 0.01 and Prom2: 2.80% vs. 17.80%, p-value < 0.001). Interestingly, CRTC1 methylation levels inversely correlated with AD-related neuropathological changes, particularly with p-tau deposition (rSpearman = -0.903, p < 0.001). Moreover, a 1.54-fold decrease in CRTC1 mRNA levels was observed in hippocampus of AD cases compared to controls (p < 0.05) supporting the notion that CRTC1 is downregulated in the AD hippocampus. CONCLUSIONS: DNA methylation levels within two distinct promoter regions of the CRTC1 gene were decreased in human hippocampus affected by AD compared with controls and methylation within Prom1 showed a strong inverse correlation with p-tau deposition. Further studies are guaranteed to elucidate the precise role that CRTC1 methylation plays in AD pathophysiology.
27094314	Comparison between MRI-based attenuation correction methods for brain PET in dementia patients.	INTRODUCTION: The combination of Positron Emission Tomography (PET) with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in hybrid PET/MRI scanners offers a number of advantages in investigating brain structure and function. A critical step of PET data reconstruction is attenuation correction (AC). Accounting for bone in attenuation maps (mu-map) was shown to be important in brain PET studies. While there are a number of MRI-based AC methods, no systematic comparison between them has been performed so far. The aim of this work was to study the different performance obtained by some of the recent methods presented in the literature. To perform such a comparison, we focused on [18F]-Fluorodeoxyglucose-PET/MRI neurodegenerative dementing disorders, which are known to exhibit reduced levels of glucose metabolism in certain brain regions. METHODS: Four novel methods were used to calculate mu-maps from MRI data of 15 patients with Alzheimer's dementia (AD). The methods cover two atlas-based methods, a segmentation method, and a hybrid template/segmentation method. Additionally, the Dixon-based and a UTE-based method, offered by a vendor, were included in the comparison. Performance was assessed at three levels: tissue identification accuracy in the mu-map, quantitative accuracy of reconstructed PET data in specific brain regions, and precision in diagnostic images at identifying hypometabolic areas. RESULTS: Quantitative regional errors of -20--10 % were obtained using the vendor's AC methods, whereas the novel methods produced errors in a margin of +/-5 %. The obtained precision at identifying areas with abnormally low levels of glucose uptake, potentially regions affected by AD, were 62.9 and 79.5 % for the two vendor AC methods, the former ignoring bone and the latter including bone information. The precision increased to 87.5-93.3 % in average for the four new methods, exhibiting similar performances. CONCLUSION: We confirm that the AC methods based on the Dixon and UTE sequences provided by the vendor are inferior to alternative techniques. As a novel finding, there was no substantial difference between the recently proposed atlas-based, template-based and segmentation-based methods.
27094158	Poor self-rated health did not increase risk of permanent nursing placement or mortality in people with mild Alzheimer's disease.	BACKGROUND: Self-rated health (SRH) has in many population-based studies predicted adverse health outcomes, e.g. morbidity, permanent nursing home (NH) placement, and mortality. However, the predictive value of SRH to NH placement and mortality among elderly people is not consistent. This may be due to cognitive impairment. Since the SRH item is widely used, it is important to know whether SRH has different predictive value among people with cognitive impairments. We aimed to examine SRH and the risk of permanent NH placement and mortality among people with mild Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHODS: Data are from The Danish Alzheimer Intervention StudY (DAISY), a large randomized controlled trial of psychosocial intervention for patients with mild dementia and their caregivers with 3-years' follow-up. Five out of 14 Danish counties participated and 321 home-living elderly (mean age: 76.2 years) with mild AD (46.4 % male) were included during 2004 and 2005. Self-rated SRH, cognitive function (MMSE), quality of life (proxy-rated QOL-AD), activities of daily living (ADCS-ADL), insight, and socio-demographics were assessed at baseline. Comorbidities and information about NH placement and mortality was obtained over 3-years' follow-up from registries. With Cox proportional hazard regression we analysed the association between SRH (dichotomised into good vs. poor) and NH placement and mortality adjusted for potential confounders. RESULTS: At baseline 66 % reported excellent or good, and 34 % fair, poor or very poor SRH. Mean MMSE was 24.0 (range: 20-30). NH placement and mortality totalled 28.1 % and 16.5 % at 3-years' follow-up, respectively. Poor SRH at baseline was not related to increased risk of NH placement or to increased mortality neither in the univariable nor in multivariable analysis: In the fully adjusted models HR was 0.63 (95 % CI 0.38-1.05) and 1.28 (95 % CI 0.67-2.45), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: When poor SRH was present we found no increased risk for NH placement or death among elderly people with mild AD. SRH is a widely used parameter in clinical and epidemiological research but may not be a valid indicator of health in patients with AD due to loss of insight.
27094132	Progress in drug development for Alzheimer's disease: An overview in relation to mitochondrial energy metabolism.	Current possibilities of Alzheimer's disease (AD) treatment are very limited and are based on administration of cholinesterase inhibitors (donepezil, rivastigmine, galantamine) and/or N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonist, memantine. Newly synthesized drugs affect multiple AD pathophysiological pathways and can act as inhibitors of cholinesterases (AChE, BuChE), inhibitors of monoamine oxidases (MAO-A, MAO-B), modulators of mitochondrial permeability transition pores, modulators of amyloid-beta binding alcohol dehydrogenase and antioxidants. Effects of clinically used as well as newly developed AD drugs were studied in relation to energy metabolism and mitochondrial functions, including oxidative phosphorylation, activities of enzymes of citric acid cycle or electron transfer system, mitochondrial membrane potential, calcium homeostasis, production of reactive oxygen species and MAO activity.
27092780	APP Is a Context-Sensitive Regulator of the Hippocampal Presynaptic Active Zone.	The hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are characterized by cognitive decline and behavioral changes. The most prominent brain region affected by the progression of AD is the hippocampal formation. The pathogenesis involves a successive loss of hippocampal neurons accompanied by a decline in learning and memory consolidation mainly attributed to an accumulation of senile plaques. The amyloid precursor protein (APP) has been identified as precursor of Abeta-peptides, the main constituents of senile plaques. Until now, little is known about the physiological function of APP within the central nervous system. The allocation of APP to the proteome of the highly dynamic presynaptic active zone (PAZ) highlights APP as a yet unknown player in neuronal communication and signaling. In this study, we analyze the impact of APP deletion on the hippocampal PAZ proteome. The native hippocampal PAZ derived from APP mouse mutants (APP-KOs and NexCreAPP/APLP2-cDKOs) was isolated by subcellular fractionation and immunopurification. Subsequently, an isobaric labeling was performed using TMT6 for protein identification and quantification by high-resolution mass spectrometry. We combine bioinformatics tools and biochemical approaches to address the proteomics dataset and to understand the role of individual proteins. The impact of APP deletion on the hippocampal PAZ proteome was visualized by creating protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks that incorporated APP into the synaptic vesicle cycle, cytoskeletal organization, and calcium-homeostasis. The combination of subcellular fractionation, immunopurification, proteomic analysis, and bioinformatics allowed us to identify APP as structural and functional regulator in a context-sensitive manner within the hippocampal active zone network.
27092308	Influence of APOE Genotype on Alzheimer's Disease CSF Biomarkers in a Spanish Population.	OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the association between apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers and to study the influence of APOE genotype on the development of AD in a Spanish population. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study comprised 29 amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients and 27 control subjects. Using ELISA methodology, CSF biomarkers and tau/Abeta ratios were obtained. ANOVA and adjusted odds ratios were calculated. RESULTS: We observed the effect of APOE genotype and age on CSF AD variables. The progression to AD was more clearly influenced by CSF AD variables than by age or APOE status. CONCLUSIONS: APOE status influences CSF AD variables. However, the presence of APOE epsilon4 does not appear to be a deterministic factor for the development of AD, because CSF variables have a greater influence on progression to the disease. These results confirm previous observations and, to our knowledge, are the first published in a Spanish population.
27091549	Reduced fibrillar beta-amyloid in subcortical structures in a butyrylcholinesterase-knockout Alzheimer disease mouse model.	The serine hydrolase, butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) is known to have a variety of enzymatic and non-enzymatic functions. In the brain, BChE is expressed mainly in glia, white matter and in distinct populations of neurons in areas important in cognition. In Alzheimer's disease (AD), many beta-amyloid (Abeta) plaques become associated with BChE activity, the significance of which is unclear. A mouse model of AD containing five familial AD genes (5XFAD) also exhibits Abeta plaques associated with BChE. We developed a comparable strain (5XFAD/BChE-KO) that is unable to synthesize BChE and reported diminished fibrillar Abeta deposits in the cerebral cortex of 5XFAD/BChE-KO mice, compared to 5XFAD counterparts at the same age. This effect was most significant in male mice. The present study extends comparison of the two strains with a detailed examination of fibrillar Abeta plaque burden in other regions of the brain that typically accumulate pathology and exhibit neurodegeneration. This work demonstrates that, as in the cerebral cortex, the absence of BChE leads to diminished fibrillar Abeta deposition in amygdala, hippocampal formation, thalamus and basal ganglia. This reduction is statistically significant in males, with a trend towards such reduction in female mice.
27091528	The Relationship between Sleep Quality and Brain Amyloid Burden.	STUDY OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the association between self-reported sleep quality and levels of brain beta-amyloid (Abeta) burden, and to determine the effect of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) epsilon4 allele on any associations found. METHODS: This study is a cross-sectional analysis of 184 cognitively healthy men and women aged over 60 y. We measured sleep quality factors: specifically, sleep duration, latency (time taken to fall asleep), disturbances, efficiency, daytime dysfunction, and overall sleep quality, using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. All participants underwent Abeta positron emission tomography imaging for the quantification of brain Abeta burden and were APOE genotyped. Linear regression analyses were used to evaluate the relationship between sleep quality factors and brain Abeta burden, adjusting for age, body mass index, cardiovascular disease, and symptoms of depression, with APOE epsilon4 carriage entered as a moderator. RESULTS: Of the sleep factors, longer sleep latency was associated with higher levels of brain Abeta (B = 0.003 [standard error = 0.001], P = 0.02). APOE epsilon4 allele (carrier/noncarrier) did not moderate the relationship between sleep latency and brain Abeta burden. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest a relationship between brain Abeta burden and sleep latency, independent of APOE epsilon4 genotype.
27090596	Hypothalamic hamartoma with neurofibrillary tangles.	Hypothalamic hamartomas are rare tumors that typically present in childhood, often with gelastic seizures, precocious puberty, or as a manifestation of Pallister-Hall syndrome. Neurofibrillary tangles are cytoplasmic aggregates of hyperphosphorylated tau that are best recognized in Alzheimer disease, other tau-associated neurodegenerative diseases, or as part of aging, but occasionally may be seen in low-grade neoplasms with a ganglion cell component as gangliocytoma or ganglioglioma. Herein, we report a case of hypothalamic hamartoma with neurofibrillary tangles.
27090093	High Resolution Dissection of Reactive Glial Nets in Alzheimer's Disease.	Fixed human brain samples in tissue repositories hold great potential for unlocking complexities of the brain and its alteration with disease. However, current methodology for simultaneously resolving complex three-dimensional (3D) cellular anatomy and organization, as well as, intricate details of human brain cells in tissue has been limited due to weak labeling characteristics of the tissue and high background levels. To expose the potential of these samples, we developed a method to overcome these major limitations. This approach offers an unprecedented view of cytoarchitecture and subcellular detail of human brain cells, from cellular networks to individual synapses. Applying the method to AD samples, we expose complex features of microglial cells and astrocytes in the disease. Through this methodology, we show that these cells form specialized 3D structures in AD that we refer to as reactive glial nets (RGNs). RGNs are areas of concentrated neuronal injury, inflammation, and tauopathy and display unique features around beta-amyloid plaque types. RGNs have conserved properties in an AD mouse model and display a developmental pattern coinciding with the progressive accumulation of neuropathology. The method provided here will help reveal novel features of the healthy and diseased human brain, and aid experimental design in translational brain research.
27089852	Mild cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease versus Alzheimer's disease.	INTRODUCTION: No known studies have compared longitudinal characteristics between individuals with incident mild cognitive impairment due to Parkinson's disease (PD-MCI) versus Alzheimer's Disease (AD-MCI). METHODS: We used longitudinal data from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center's Uniform Data Set to compare 41 PD-MCI and 191 AD-MCI participants according to their demographics, presence of >/=1 APOE e4 allele, and baseline and change over time in clinical characteristics, neuropsychological test scores, and Clinical Dementia Rating sum of boxes (CDR-SB). Multivariable linear regression models with generalized estimating equations were used to account for clustered data and to test for baseline and longitudinal differences in neuropsychological test scores. RESULTS: PD-MCI and AD-MCI participants differed by many demographic and clinical characteristics. Significantly fewer PD-MCI participants developed dementia over one year. Compared to AD-MCI participants, PD-MCI participants performed better at baseline and over time on a global measure of cognition (Mini Mental State Exam), memory measures (immediate and delayed Logical Memory), and a language measure (Boston Naming Test), and additionally performed better over time on an attention measure (Digit Span Forward), a language measure (Vegetable List), a processing speed measure (Digit Symbol), and an overall measure of memory and functional impairment (CDR-SB). CONCLUSION: Our study provides further evidence that PD-MCI is clinically distinct from AD-MCI and requires different tools for diagnosis and monitoring clinical progression. More importantly, this study suggests that PD-MCI takes longer to convert into dementia than AD-MCI, findings that require replication by other studies.
27089818	New strategies for neuroprotection in glaucoma, a disease that affects the central nervous system.	Glaucoma is a disease where retinal ganglion cells (RGC) are specifically affected though a number of evidences endorse the hypothesis that glaucoma is a neuro-degenerative disorder of the central nervous system and suggest a possible connection between glaucomatous damage and cerebrovascular alterations. The mechanisms underlying RGC loss are not yet fully known but alterations of the autophagy machinery have been recently proposed as a potential contributing factor as for Alzheimer's disease. Here we review the current literature on new strategies for neuroprotection in glaucoma, focusing on pharmacologic strategies to minimize RGC damage.
27089037	Portuguese version of Wechsler Memory Scale-3rd edition's utility with demented elderly adults.	The purpose of this study is to analyze the utility of the Portuguese version of the Wechsler Memory Scale-3rd edition (WMS-III) with demented elderly people, namely its capacity to detect and discriminate between subcortical vascular dementia (SVD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). We assessed early demented patients (SVD = 16; AD = 36) aged 65 or older who were compared to a control group (n = 40). Both clinical groups were adequately matched in terms of disease severity, overall cognitive functioning, depressive symptomatology, and pre-morbid intelligence. Between-group's differences were evaluated using the Quade's rank analysis of covariance. We also computed indexes and subtests optimal cut-off scores, and the corresponding sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values, which were able to successfully discriminate between patients and healthy subjects. The SVD patients had a better overall memory performance than AD patients on the majority of the indexes and the delayed condition subtests of the WMS-III. The AD patients only showed a better performance on digit span subtest. Several measures discriminated patients from healthy subjects. This study suggests some recommendations for the diagnostic accuracy of the Portuguese version of WMS-III in dementia and about differential diagnosis between SVD and AD.
27087745	Human Neural Stem Cells Overexpressing Choline Acetyltransferase Restore Unconditioned Fear in Rats with Amygdala Injury.	Amygdala is involved in the fear memory that recognizes certain environmental cues predicting threatening events. Manipulation of neurotransmission within the amygdala affects the expression of conditioned and unconditioned emotional memories such as fear freezing behaviour. We previously demonstrated that F3.ChAT human neural stem cells (NSCs) overexpressing choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) improve cognitive function of Alzheimer's disease model rats with hippocampal or cholinergic nerve injuries by increasing acetylcholine (ACh) level. In the present study, we examined the effect of F3.ChAT cells on the deficit of unconditioned fear freezing. Rats given N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) in their amygdala 2 weeks prior to cat odor exposure displayed very short resting (freezing) time compared to normal animals. NMDA induced neuronal degeneration in the amygdala, leading to a decreased ACh concentration in cerebrospinal fluid. However, intracerebroventricular transplantation of F3.ChAT cells attenuated amygdala lesions 4 weeks after transplantation. The transplanted cells were found in the NMDA-injury sites and produced ChAT protein. In addition, F3.ChAT-receiving rats recuperated freezing time staying remote from the cat odor source, according to the recovery of brain ACh concentration. The results indicate that human NSCs overexpressing ChAT may facilitate retrieval of unconditioned fear memory by increasing ACh level.
27087245	Vaccination to Alzheimer Disease. Is it a Promising Tool or a Blind Way?	Alzheimer disease (AD) is an irreversible neurodegenerative disorder associated with cognitive dysfunction. The disease incidence has growing tendency worldwide with strong impact on healthcare funds. The fact that there is no effective therapy makes the disorder more serious. Currently, AD manifestation can be suppressed by having impact on enzyme acetylcholinesterase: donepezil, rivastigmine, and galantamine or ionotropic glutamate NMDA receptor ( memanitine). Contrary to the drugs effecting symptomatically, vaccination against amyloid plaques or neurofibrillary tangles and their precursors amyloid beta and hyperphosphorylated tau are expected to be more suitable. Huge numbers of works have been done on the issue. Unfortunately, the promising vaccines like the AN 1792 were halted during clinical trials because of adverse effects like meningoencephalitis. Monoclonal antibody specific to amyloid plaques, Bapineuzumab, was closest to the practical performance but the clinical trials were also stopped. The review summarizes facts about AD, opportunities in AD vaccination, and obstacles that limit the vaccination including reasons why the recent trials have fallen.
27087243	Management of Inflammation by Natural Polyphenols: A Comprehensive Mechanistic Update.	Inflammation generates a systemic response against injury or infection from bacteria, viruses, and other pathogens. The welfare of host is the primary target of this process. However, uncontrolled or inadequate regulation of the inflammatory response produces detrimental effects leading to the generation of various chronic disorders including atherosclerosis, type-2 diabetes, neurodegenerative disease, cancer and Alzheimer's disease with severe tissue damage. The exact identity of the inflammatory stimuli is still elusive as they function in multiple pathways; therefore targeting a particular pathway does not resolve the problem. Existing therapeutics targeting the inflammatory responses include steroidal antiinflammatory drugs (SAIDs) and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). In spite of their numerous beneficial effects, both SAIDs as well as NSAIDs have their independent, unavoidable side effects, which discourage their prolonged therapeutic applications. Since the management of uncontrolled inflammation is critical for the general wellbeing, therefore an alternative source of multi-targeted non-toxic therapeutic intervention is mandatory. Plant-derived phenols constitute such a group of molecules that can be utilised to manage inflammation. They synergistically modulate several important components involved in multiple signalling pathways that regulate uncontrolled inflammation to exhibit their beneficial health effects. This review discusses the recent advances in structure-function activity of some antiinflammatory polyphenols, their bioavailability enhancement, clinical/ preclinical findings with a view to provide knowledge for developing novel antiinflammatory drugs by following system biology of proinflammatory responses with minimal side effects.
27086111	Pharmacokinetic properties of tandem d-peptides designed for treatment of Alzheimer's disease.	Peptides are more and more considered for the development of drug candidates. However, they frequently exhibit severe disadvantages such as instability and unfavourable pharmacokinetic properties. Many peptides are rapidly cleared from the organism and oral bioavailabilities as well as in vivo half-lives often remain low. In contrast, some peptides consisting solely of d-enantiomeric amino acid residues were shown to combine promising therapeutic properties with high proteolytic stability and enhanced pharmacokinetic parameters. Recently, we have shown that D3 and RD2 have highly advantageous pharmacokinetic properties. Especially D3 has already proven promising properties suitable for treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Here, we analyse the pharmacokinetic profiles of D3D3 and RD2D3, which are head-to-tail tandem d-peptides built of D3 and its derivative RD2. Both D3D3 and RD2D3 show proteolytic stability in mouse plasma and organ homogenates for at least 24h and in murine and human liver microsomes for 4h. Notwithstanding their high affinity to plasma proteins, both peptides are taken up into the brain following i.v. as well as i.p. administration. Although both peptides contain identical d-amino acid residues, they are arranged in a different sequence order and the peptides show differences in pharmacokinetic properties. After i.p. administration RD2D3 exhibits lower plasma clearance and higher bioavailability than D3D3. We therefore concluded that the amino acid sequence of RD2 leads to more favourable pharmacokinetic properties within the tandem peptide, which underlines the importance of particular sequence motifs, even in short peptides, for the design of further therapeutic d-peptides.
27085394	Identification and modification of amyloid-independent phenotypes of APOE4 mice.	BACKGROUND: Over 70 million Americans inherit the strongest genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD), apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4), but have no course for reducing their risk. The association of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use with reduced risk of AD for APOE4-carriers suggests that NSAIDs may be useful in AD prevention. METHODS: We identified phenotypes associated with APOE4 in APOE knock-in mice in order to define modifiable measures that correlate with risk of AD. RESULTS: APOE4 mouse brains showed altered post-translational modifications and biochemical distribution of APOE compared to APOE3 mice; these differences were also observed in brains of human APOE4 carriers. Two-month treatment with ibuprofen significantly altered the expression pattern of APOE in APOE4 mice to that of APOE3 mice; PPAR-gamma agonist pioglitazone also had a significant effect. APOE4 mice also show deficits in dendritic spine density, and ibuprofen and pioglitazone significantly increased dendritic spine density. CONCLUSIONS: We report new phenotypes associated with APOE4 in human and APOE knock-in mice and their mitigation with NSAID treatment, through COX-2 inhibition and PPAR-gamma activation.
27084732	False-Positive Error Rates for Reliable Digit Span and Auditory Verbal Learning Test Performance Validity Measures in Amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment and Early Alzheimer Disease.	OBJECTIVE: The objective is to examine failure on three embedded performance validity tests [Reliable Digit Span (RDS), Auditory Verbal Learning Test (AVLT) logistic regression, and AVLT recognition memory] in early Alzheimer disease (AD; n = 178), amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI; n = 365), and cognitively intact age-matched controls (n = 206). METHOD: Neuropsychological tests scores were obtained from subjects participating in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). RESULTS: RDS failure using a </=7 RDS threshold was 60/178 (34%) for early AD, 52/365 (14%) for MCI, and 17/206 (8%) for controls. A </=6 RDS criterion reduced this rate to 24/178 (13%) for early AD, 15/365 (4%) for MCI, and 7/206 (3%) for controls. AVLT logistic regression probability of >/=.76 yielded unacceptably high false-positive rates in both clinical groups [early AD = 149/178 (79%); MCI = 159/365 (44%)] but not cognitively intact controls (13/206, 6%). AVLT recognition criterion of </=9/15 classified 125/178 (70%) of early AD, 155/365 (42%) of MCI, and 18/206 (9%) of control scores as invalid, which decreased to 66/178 (37%) for early AD, 46/365 (13%) for MCI, and 10/206 (5%) for controls when applying a </=5/15 criterion. Despite high false-positive rates across individual measures and thresholds, combining RDS </= 6 and AVLT recognition </=9/15 classified only 9/178 (5%) of early AD and 4/365 (1%) of MCI patients as invalid performers. CONCLUSIONS: Embedded validity cutoffs derived from mixed clinical groups produce unacceptably high false-positive rates in MCI and early AD. Combining embedded PVT indicators lowers the false-positive rate.
27084229	Polymorphisms of small ubiquitin-related modifier genes are associated with risk of Alzheimer's disease in Korean: A case-control study.	Sumoylation regulates transcription factor transactivation, protein-protein interactions, and appropriate subcellular localization of certain proteins. Previous studies have shown that sumoylation of amyloid precursor protein (APP) is associated with decreased levels of amyloid beta (Abeta) proteins, suggesting that sumoylation may play a role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We investigated the association between polymorphisms of the SUMO genes and the risk of AD. Our study subjects consisted of 144 AD patients and 335 healthy controls without dementia. We focused on tagged single nucleotide polymorphisms (tagSNPs) of the SUMO1 and SUMO2 genes. The tagSNPs were amplified by PCR and sequenced. We used binary logistic regression to calculate odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the associations between SUMO gene polymorphisms and the risk of AD. We found that rs12472035 polymorphism of SUMO1 was significantly associated with an increased risk of AD in male group (the CT genotype of rs12472035: adjusted OR=8.737, 95% CI=2.041-37.41, p-value=0.003). In addition, two polymorphisms of SUMO2 were significantly associated with an increased risk of AD in female group (the GA genotype of rs35271045: adjusted OR=2.879, 95% CI=1.399-5.924, p-value=0.004; and the TC genotype of rs9913676: adjusted OR=2.460, 95% CI=1.197-5.057, p-value=0.014). Furthermore, three combinations were associated with an increased risk of AD. Our data suggest that three individual polymorphisms and three combinations may be potential risk factors for AD in Korean population.
27082868	Diabetes mellitus Type II and cognitive capacity in healthy aging, mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease.	While diabetes mellitus (DM) Type II has repeatedly been linked to Alzheimer s disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI), longitudinal research is scarce and disease duration has not always been taken into account. In a birth cohort born between 1930 and 1932 we investigated the influence of DM Type II and disease duration on neuropsychological functioning (memory/learning, attention, verbal fluency, visuospatial thinking and abstract thinking) across 14 years. Subjects who developed MCI or AD performed significantly poorer on all neuropsychological tests applied. While significant main effects DM Type II did not arise, its presence led to a significant deterioration of performance in the digit symbol test and visuospatial thinking over time. Additionally, in visuospatial thinking this change was more pronounced for individuals suffering from MCI/AD. We found that, as a concomitant disease DM Type II does not affect memory functioning, which is typically compromised in MCI and early AD. Rather, it may lead to deficits in cognitive flexibility and visuospatial thinking. DM Type II can be considered a frequent comorbid condition which can aggravate the course of MCI and AD. In this respect it may serve as a model for other comorbid conditions in AD.
27082275	Relevance of defensin beta-2 and alpha defensins (HNP1-3) in Alzheimer's disease.	The DEFB4 gene copy numbers were investigated in 206 AD patients and in 250 controls. The levels of the human defensin beta-2 (hBD2) and alpha-defensins (HNP 1-3) in the sera and in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of the patients and the controls were determined. Higher copy numbers of the DEFB4 gene was observed in AD patients as compared with the controls. The levels of hBD-2 and HNP 1-3 were significantly elevated in the sera and in the CSF of the AD patients These data suggest that both defensin beta-2 and alpha-defensins have potential role in the development of AD.
27081089	Alterations in white matter volume and its correlation with neuropsychological scales in patients with Alzheimer's disease: a DARTEL-based voxel-based morphometry study.	Background Non-invasive imaging markers can be used to diagnose Alzheimer's disease (AD) in its early stages, but an optimized quantification analysis to measure the brain integrity has been less studied. Purpose To evaluate white matter volume change and its correlation with neuropsychological scales in patients with AD using a diffeomorphic anatomical registration through exponentiated lie algebra (DARTEL)-based voxel-based morphometry (VBM). Material and Methods The 21 participants comprised 11 patients with AD and 10 age-matched healthy controls. High-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data were processed by VBM analysis based on DARTEL algorithm. Results The patients showed significant white matter volume reductions in the posterior limb of the internal capsule, cerebral peduncle of the midbrain, and parahippocampal gyrus compared to healthy controls. In correlation analysis, the parahippocampal volume was positively correlated with the Korean-mini mental state examination score in AD. Conclusion This study provides an evidence for localized white matter volume deficits in conjunction with cognitive dysfunction in AD. These findings would be helpful to understand the neuroanatomical mechanisms in AD and to robust the diagnostic accuracy for AD.
27080914	[German Society of Nuclear Medicine procedure guideline on beta-amyloid brain PET imaging].	Recently, a number of positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracers have been approved for clinical use. These tracers target cerebral beta-amyloid (Abeta) plaques, a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease. Increasing use of this method implies the need for respective standards. This German Society of Nuclear Medicine guideline describes adequate procedures for Abeta plaque PET imaging. It not only discusses the tracers used for that purpose, but also lists measures for correct patient preparation, image data generation, processing, analysis and interpretation. With that, this "S1" category (according to the German Association of the Scientific Medical Societies standard) guideline aims at contributing to quality assurance of nuclear imaging in Germany.
27080380	The Parkinson Disease gene SNCA: Evolutionary and structural insights with pathological implication.	After Alzheimer, Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder. Alpha synuclein (SNCA) is deemed as a major component of Lewy bodies, a neuropathological feature of PD. Five point mutations in SNCA have been reported so far, responsible for autosomal dominant PD. This study aims to decipher evolutionary and structural insights of SNCA by revealing its sequence and structural evolutionary patterns among sarcopterygians and its paralogous counterparts (SNCB and SNCG). Rate analysis detected strong purifying selection on entire synuclein family. Structural dynamics divulges that during the course of sarcopterygian evolutionary history, the region encompassed 32 to 58 of N-terminal domain of SNCA has acquired its critical functional significance through the epistatic influence of the lineage specific substitutions. In sum, these findings provide an evidence that the region from 32 to 58 of N-terminal lipid binding alpha helix domain of SNCA is the most critical region, not only from the evolutionary perspective but also for the stability and the proper conformation of the protein as well as crucial for the disease pathogenesis, harboring critical interaction sites.
27080313	CCNF mutations in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia.	Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) are overlapping, fatal neurodegenerative disorders in which the molecular and pathogenic basis remains poorly understood. Ubiquitinated protein aggregates, of which TDP-43 is a major component, are a characteristic pathological feature of most ALS and FTD patients. Here we use genome-wide linkage analysis in a large ALS/FTD kindred to identify a novel disease locus on chromosome 16p13.3. Whole-exome sequencing identified a CCNF missense mutation at this locus. Interrogation of international cohorts identified additional novel CCNF variants in familial and sporadic ALS and FTD. Enrichment of rare protein-altering CCNF variants was evident in a large sporadic ALS replication cohort. CCNF encodes cyclin F, a component of an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase complex (SCF(Cyclin F)). Expression of mutant CCNF in neuronal cells caused abnormal ubiquitination and accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins, including TDP-43 and a SCF(Cyclin F) substrate. This implicates common mechanisms, linked to protein homeostasis, underlying neuronal degeneration.
27080260	Fracture and Growth Are Competing Forces Determining the Fate of Conformers in Tau Fibril Populations.	Tau fibrils are pathological aggregates that can transfer between neurons and then recruit soluble Tau monomers by template-assisted conversion. The propagation of different fibril polymorphs is thought to be a contributing factor to phenotypic diversity in Alzheimer disease and other Tauopathies. We found that a homogeneous population of Tau fibrils composed of the truncated version K18 (residues 244-372) gradually converted to a new set of fibril conformers when subjected to multiple cycles of seeding and growth. Using double electron-electron resonance (DEER) spectroscopy, we observed that the distances between spin labels at positions 311 and 328 in the fibril core progressively decreased. The findings were corroborated by changes in turbidity, morphology, and protease sensitivity. Fibrils that were initially formed under stirring conditions exhibited an increased fragility compared with fibrils formed quiescently after multiple cycles of seeding. The quiescently formed fibrils were marked by accelerated growth. The difference in fragility and growth between the different conformers explains how the change in incubation condition could lead to the amplification of a minor subpopulation of fibrils. Under quiescent conditions where fibril breakage is minimal, faster growing fibrils have a selective advantage. The findings are of general importance as they suggest that changes in selective pressures during fibril propagation in the human brain could result in the emergence of new fibril conformers with varied clinicopathological consequences.
27080144	MiR-299-5p regulates apoptosis through autophagy in neurons and ameliorates cognitive capacity in APPswe/PS1dE9 mice.	Abnormalities of autophagy can result in neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Nevertheless, the regulatory mechanisms of autophagy in AD are not well understood. Here, we describe our findings that microRNA (miR)-299-5p functions as an autophagy inhibitor by suppressing Atg5 and antagonizing caspase-dependent apoptosis. We observed decreased levels of miR-299-5p both in primary neurons under conditions of starvation and in hippocampi of APPswe/PS1dE9 mice. Additionally, low levels of miR-299-5p were observed in cerebrospinal fluid of AD patients. MiR-299-5p treatment resulted in attenuation of Atg5 and autophagy in primary neurons from APPswe/PS1dE9 mice, N2a cells and SH-SY5Y cells, whereas antagomiR-299-5p enhanced autophagy. Atg5 was verified as a direct target of miR-299-5p by dual luciferase reporter assays. Furthermore, transfection of miR-299-5p into primary hippocampal neurons caused the attenuation of caspase-mediated apoptosis, which was reversed upon starvation-induced autophagy. Inhibition of autophagy by shRNA knockdown of LC3beta reduced apoptotic neuron death induced by antagomiR-299-5p. Injection of agomiR-299-5p into the cerebral ventricles of AD mice inhibited both autophagy and apoptosis and also improved the cognitive performance of mice. Overall, our results suggest that miR-299-5p modulates neuron survival programs by regulating autophagy. Thus, miR-299-5p serves as a potential neuroprotective factor in AD.
27079722	Collapsin Response Mediator Protein-2 (CRMP2) is a Plausible Etiological Factor and Potential Therapeutic Target in Alzheimer's Disease: Comparison and Contrast with Microtubule-Associated Protein Tau.	Alzheimer's disease (AD) has long been viewed as a pathology that must be caused either by aberrant amyloid-beta protein precursor (AbetaPP) processing, dysfunctional tau protein processing, or a combination of these two factors. This is a reasonable assumption because amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) accumulation and tau hyperphosphorylation are the defining histological features in AD, and because AbetaPP and tau mutations can cause AD in humans or AD-like features in animal models. Nonetheless, other protein players are emerging that one can argue are significant etiological players in subsets of AD and potentially novel, druggable targets. In particular, the microtubule-associated protein CRMP2 (collapsin response mediator protein-2) bears striking analogies to tau and is similarly relevant to AD. Like tau, CRMP2 dynamically regulates microtubule stability; it is acted upon by the same kinases; collects similarly in neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs); and when sequestered in NFTs, complexes with critical synapse-stabilizing factors. Additionally, CRMP2 is becoming recognized as an important adaptor protein involved in vesicle trafficking, amyloidogenesis and autophagy, in ways that tau is not. This review systematically compares the biology of CRMP2 to that of tau in the context of AD and explores the hypothesis that CRMP2 is an etiologically significant protein in AD and participates in pathways that can be rationally engaged for therapeutic benefit.
27078700	Roles of O-GlcNAcylation on amyloid-beta precursor protein processing, tau phosphorylation, and hippocampal synapses dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease.	Alzheimer disease (AD), a central nervous system degenerative disease, is characterized by abnormal deposition of amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta), neurofibrillary tangles formed by hyperphosphorylated tau and synaptic loss. It is widely accepted that Abeta is the chief culprit of AD. Abeta peptide is the cleavage product of amyloid-beta precursor protein (APP). Recently, more attention has been paid to O-linked beta-N-acetylglucosaminylation (O-GlcNAcylation) modification of protein. O-GlcNAcylation plays a significant role in hippocampal synaptic function. Abated O-GlcNAcylation might be a modulator in progression of AD through regulating activity of pertinent enzymes and factors. Evidence suggests that enhanced O-GlcNAcylation interacts with tau phosphorylation and prevents brain from tau and Abeta-induced impairment. Here, we review the roles of O-GlcNAcylation in APP cleavage, tau phosphorylation and hippocampal synapses function.
27078154	Development of a Melting Curve-Based Allele-Specific PCR of Apolipoprotein E (APOE) Genotyping Method for Genomic DNA, Guthrie Blood Spot, and Whole Blood.	Genetic polymorphisms of apolipoprotein E (APOE) are associated with various health conditions and diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes, etc. Hence, genotyping of APOE has broad applications in biomedical research and clinical settings, particularly in the era of precision medicine. The study aimed to develop a convenient and accurate method with flexible throughput to genotype the APOE polymorphisms. A melting curve-based allele-specific PCR method was developed to genotype two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of APOE, i.e. rs429358 at codon 112 and rs7412 at codon 158. These two SNPs determine the genotype of APOE2, E3, and E4. PCR-based Sanger sequencing was used as the reference method for APOE genotyping. A 100% concordance rate was obtained in 300 subjects between the melting curve-based allele-specific PCR method and the Sanger sequencing method. This method was applied to a genetic association analysis of APOE and schizophrenia consisting of 711 patients with schizophrenia and 665 control subjects from Taiwan. However, no significant differences in the allele and genotype frequencies were detected between these two groups. Further experiments showed that DNA dissolved from blood collected on Guthrie filter paper and total blood cell lysate without DNA extraction can be used in the melting curve-based allele-specific PCR method. Thus, we suggest that this is a fast, accurate and robust APOE genotyping method with a flexible throughput and suitable for DNA template from different preparations. This convenient method shall meet the different needs of various research and clinical laboratories.
27077851	Redox Proteomic Profiling of Specifically Carbonylated Proteins in the Serum of Triple Transgenic Alzheimer's Disease Mice.	Oxidative stress is a key event in the onset and progression of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). To investigate the role of oxidative stress in AD and to search for potential biomarkers in peripheral blood, serums were collected in this study from the 3-, 6-, and 12-month-old triple transgenic AD mice (3xTg-AD mice) and the age- and sex-matched non-transgenic (non-Tg) littermates. The serum oxidized proteins were quantified by slot-blot analysis and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to investigate the total levels of serum protein carbonyl groups. Western blotting, in conjunction with two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2D-Oxyblot), was employed to identify and quantify the specifically-carbonylated proteins in the serum of 3xTg-AD mice. The results showed that the levels of serum protein carbonyls were increased in the three month old 3xTg-AD mice compared with the non-Tg control mice, whereas no significant differences were observed in the six and 12 months old AD mice, suggesting that oxidative stress is an early event in AD progression. With the application of 2D-Oxyblot analysis, (immunoglobin) Ig gamma-2B chain C region (IGH-3), Ig lambda-2 chain C region (IGLC2), Ig kappa chain C region (IGKC), and Ig kappa chain V-V region HP R16.7 were identified as significantly oxidized proteins compared with the control. Among them IGH-3 and IGKC were validated via immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis. Identification of oxidized proteins in the serums of 3xTg-AD mice can not only reveal potential roles of those proteins in the pathogenesis of AD but also provide potential biomarkers of AD at the early stage.
27077117	Biomarkers for Early Diagnostic of Mild Cognitive Impairment in Type-2 Diabetes Patients: A Multicentre, Retrospective, Nested Case-Control Study.	BACKGROUND: Both type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) are common age-associated disorders and T2DM patients show an increased risk to suffer from AD, however, there is currently no marker to identify who in T2DM populations will develop AD. Since glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta) activity, ApoE genotypes and olfactory function are involved in both T2DM and AD pathogenesis, we investigate whether alterations of these factors can identify cognitive impairment in T2DM patients. METHODS: The cognitive ability was evaluated using Minimum Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR), and the mild cognitive impairment (MCI) was diagnosed by Petersen's criteria. GSK-3beta activity in platelet, ApoE genotypes in leucocytes and the olfactory function were detected by Western/dot blotting, the amplification refractory mutation system (ARMS) PCR and the Connecticut Chemosensory Clinical Research Center (CCCRC) test, respectively. The odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) of the biomarkers for MCI diagnosis were calculated by logistic regression. The diagnostic capability of the biomarkers was evaluated by receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analyses. FINDINGS: We recruited 694 T2DM patients from Jan. 2012 to May. 2015 in 5 hospitals (Wuhan), and 646 of them met the inclusion criteria and were included in this study. 345 patients in 2 hospitals were assigned to the training set, and 301 patients in another 3 hospitals assigned to the validation set. Patients in each set were randomly divided into two groups: T2DM without MCI (termed T2DM-nMCI) or with MCI (termed T2DM-MCI). There were no significant differences for sex, T2DM years, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, coronary disease, complications, insulin treatment, HbA1c, ApoE epsilon2, ApoE epsilon3, tGSK3beta and pS9GSK3beta between the two groups. Compared with the T2DM-nMCI group, T2DM-MCI group showed lower MMSE score with older age, ApoE epsilon4 allele, higher olfactory score and higher rGSK-3beta (ratio of total GSK-3beta to Ser9-phosphorylated GSK-3beta) in the training set and the validation set. The OR values of age, ApoE epsilon4 gene, olfactory score and rGSK-3beta were 1.09, 2.09, 1.51, 10.08 in the training set, and 1.06, 2.67, 1.47, 7.19 in the validation set, respectively. The diagnostic accuracy of age, ApoE epsilon4 gene, olfactory score and rGSK-3beta were 0.76, 0.72, 0.66, 0.79 in the training set, and 0.70, 0.68, 0.73, 0.79 in the validation set, respectively. These four combined biomarkers had the area under the curve (AUC) of 82% and 86%, diagnostic accuracy of 83% and 81% in the training set and the validation set, respectively. INTERPRETATION: Aging, activation of peripheral circulating GSK-3beta, expression of ApoE epsilon4 and increase of olfactory score are diagnostic for the mild cognitive impairment in T2DM patients, and combination of these biomarkers can improve the diagnostic accuracy.
27076125	Principles of Vaccination.	While many of the currently available vaccines have been developed empirically, with limited understanding on how they activate the immune system and elicit protective immunity, the recent progress in basic sciences like immunology, microbiology, genetics, and molecular biology has fostered our understanding on the interaction of microorganisms with the human immune system. In consequence, modern vaccine development strongly builds on the precise knowledge of the biology of microbial pathogens, their interaction with the human immune system, as well as their capacity to counteract and evade innate and adaptive immune mechanisms. Strategies engaged by pathogens strongly determine how a vaccine should be formulated to evoke potent and efficient protective immune responses. The improved knowledge of immune response mechanisms has facilitated the development of new vaccines with the capacity to defend against challenging pathogens and can help to protect individuals particular at risk like immunocompromised and elderly populations. Modern vaccine development technologies include the production of highly purified antigens that provide a lower reactogenicity and higher safety profile than the traditional empirically developed vaccines. Attempts to improve vaccine antigen purity, however, may result in impaired vaccine immunogenicity. Some of such disadvantages related to highly purified and/or genetically engineered vaccines yet can be overcome by innovative technologies, such as live vector vaccines, and DNA or RNA vaccines. Moreover, recent years have witnessed the development of novel adjuvant formulations that specifically focus on the augmentation and/or control of the interplay between innate and adaptive immune systems as well as the function of antigen-presenting cells. Finally, vaccine design has become more tailored, and in turn has opened up the potential of extending its application to hitherto not accessible complex microbial pathogens plus providing new immunotherapies to tackle diseases such as cancer, Alzheimer's disease, and autoimmune disease. This chapter gives an overview of the key considerations and processes involved in vaccine development. It also describes the basic principles of normal immune respoinses and its their function in defense of infectious agents by vaccination.
27074540	Antioxidant modulation in restoring mitochondrial function in neurodegeneration.	Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) are the leading causes of disability associated with neurodegeneration worldwide. These diseases are influenced by multiple genetic and environmental factors and share similar mechanisms as both are characterized by accumulation and aggregation of misfolded proteins - amyloid-beta (Abeta) in AD and alpha-synuclein in PD. Over the past decade, increasing evidence has shown that mitochondrial dysfunction and the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) are involved in the pathology of these diseases, and the contributions of these defects to the cellular and molecular changes that eventually cause neuronal death have been explored. Using mitochondrial protective agents, such as antioxidants, to combat ROS provides a new strategy for neurodegenerative treatment. In this review, we highlight the potential of multiple types of antioxidants, including vitamins, phytochemicals, fatty acids and minerals, as well as synthetic antioxidants specifically targeting the mitochondria, which can restore mitochondrial function, in the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders at both the pre-clinical and clinical stages by focusing on AD and PD.
27074410	Translocator Protein 18 kDa (TSPO): An Old Protein with New Functions?	Translocator protein 18 kDa (TSPO) was previously known as the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) in eukaryotes, where it is mainly localized to the mitochondrial outer membrane. Considerable evidence indicates that it plays regulatory roles in steroidogenesis and apoptosis and is involved in various human diseases, such as metastatic cancer, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, inflammation, and anxiety disorders. Ligands of TSPO are widely used as diagnostic tools and treatment options, despite there being no clear understanding of the function of TSPO. An ortholog in the photosynthetic bacterium Rhodobacter was independently discovered as the tryptophan-rich sensory protein (TspO) and found to play a role in the response to changes in oxygen and light conditions that regulate photosynthesis and respiration. As part of this highly conserved protein family found in all three kingdoms, the rat TSPO is able to rescue the knockout phenotype in Rhodobacter, indicating functional as well as structural conservation. Recently, a major breakthrough in the field was achieved: the determination of atomic-resolution structures of TSPO from different species by several independent groups. This now allows us to reexamine the function of TSPO with a molecular perspective. In this review, we focus on recently determined structures of TSPO and their implications for potential functions of this ubiquitous multifaceted protein. We suggest that TSPO is an ancient bacterial receptor/stress sensor that has developed additional interactions, partners, and roles in its mitochondrial outer membrane environment in eukaryotes.
27074338	Quality of life in young onset dementia: an updated systematic review.	INTRODUCTION: Young onset dementia (YOD) develops before 65 years of age and has specific age-related adverse consequences for quality of life (QoL). We systematically examined factors related to the QoL of people with YOD and their caregivers. METHOD: This systematic review used the PRISMA methodology. The literature search was undertaken on July 5, 2015, using Cochrane, PubMed, SciELO, PsycINFO, Scopus and Thomson Reuters Web of Science electronic databases. The search keywords included early onset and young onset combined with, dementia, Alzheimer, vascular dementia, mixed dementia, frontotemporal dementia, quality of life, well-being and unmet needs. Nine studies were included. We revised objectives, study design, sample, instruments and results related to QoL. RESULTS: People with YOD rated their own QoL significantly higher than their caregivers. Greater awareness of disease among people with YOD is associated with better QoL in caregivers. A relationship was found between unmet needs and daytime activities, lack of companionship and difficulties with memory. Issues associated with unmet needs were prolonged time to diagnosis, available health services and lack of caregiver's own future perspective. CONCLUSION: Consideration should be given to conducting investigations with more homogeneous samples and use of a clear concept of QoL. The present study highlights the need for future research in a wider range of countries, using instruments specifically for YOD. It would be interesting if studies could trace parallels with late onset dementia groups.
27073700	Amyloid-beta-Induced Dysregulation of AMPA Receptor Trafficking.	Evidence from neuropathological, genetic, animal model, and biochemical studies has indicated that the accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) is associated with, and probably induces, profound neuronal changes in brain regions critical for memory and cognition in the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). There is considerable evidence that synapses are particularly vulnerable to AD, establishing synaptic dysfunction as one of the earliest events in pathogenesis, prior to neuronal loss. It is clear that excessive Abeta levels can disrupt excitatory synaptic transmission and plasticity, mainly due to dysregulation of the AMPA and NMDA glutamate receptors in the brain. Importantly, AMPA receptors are the principal glutamate receptors that mediate fast excitatory neurotransmission. This is essential for synaptic plasticity, a cellular correlate of learning and memory, which are the cognitive functions that are most disrupted in AD. Here we review recent advances in the field and provide insights into the molecular mechanisms that underlie Abeta-induced dysfunction of AMPA receptor trafficking. This review focuses primarily on NMDA receptor- and metabotropic glutamate receptor-mediated signaling. In particular, we highlight several mechanisms that underlie synaptic long-term depression as common signaling pathways that are hijacked by the neurotoxic effects of Abeta.
27073005	Caregiver burden and perceived health competence when caring for family members diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease and related dementia.	PURPOSE: To identify if there is a relationship between perceived health competence and burden of care of informal caregivers of family members with Alzheimer's disease and related dementia (ADRD). DATA SOURCES: Informal caregivers 18 years and older who received services from the Alzheimer's Resource of Alaska were invited to complete a survey. CONCLUSIONS: Findings indicate that there was a negative correlation between perceived health competence and burden of care (N = 64, r = -.54, p < .001). Additionally, there was a negative correlation within the three subscales of the Modified Montgomery-Borgatta Caregiver Burden Scale: objective burden (r = -.65, p = < .001), stress burden (r = -.41, p = .001), and relationship burden (r = -.29, p = .021, p = .001). IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Based on the findings of an association between increased caregiver burden and the perception of decreased health competence, nurse practitioners (NPs) can play an important role in assessing caregiver burden. The results of this study enlighten NPs about informal caregiver burden and will help guide discussions and assessments during routine healthcare visits with the goal of achieving optimal health for informal caregivers.
27072699	Stressing Out Hsp90 in Neurotoxic Proteinopathies.	A toxic accumulation of proteins is the hallmark pathology of several neurodegenerative disorders. Protein accumulation is regularly prevented by the network of molecular chaperone proteins, including and especially Hsp90. For reasons not yet elucidated, Hsp90 and the molecular chaperones interact with, but do not degrade, these toxic proteins resulting in the pathogenic accumulation of proteins such as tau, in Alzheimer's Disease, and alpha-synuclein, in Parkinson's Disease. In this review, we describe the associations between Hsp90 and the pathogenic and driver proteins of several neurodegenerative disorders. We additionally describe how the inhibition of Hsp90 promotes the degradation of both mutant and pathogenic protein species in models of neurodegenerative diseases. We also examine the current state of Hsp90 inhibitors capable of crossing the blood-brain barrier; compounds which may be capable of slowing, preventing, and possible reversing neurodegenerative diseases.
27072087	Discovering EEG resting state alterations of semantic dementia.	OBJECTIVE: Diagnosis of semantic dementia relies on cost-intensive MRI or PET, although resting EEG markers of other dementias have been reported. Yet the view still holds that resting EEG in patients with semantic dementia is normal. However, studies using increasingly sophisticated EEG analysis methods have demonstrated that slightest alterations of functional brain states can be detected. METHODS: We analyzed the common four resting EEG microstates (A, B, C, and D) of 8 patients with semantic dementia in comparison with 8 healthy controls and 8 patients with Alzheimer's disease. RESULTS: Topographical differences between the groups were found in microstate classes B and C, while microstate classes A and D were comparable. The data showed that the semantic dementia group had a peculiar microstate E, but the commonly found microstate C was lacking. Furthermore, the presence of microstate E was significantly correlated with lower MMSE and language scores. CONCLUSION: Alterations in resting EEG can be found in semantic dementia. Topographical shifts in microstate C might be related to semantic memory deficits. SIGNIFICANCE: This is the first study that discovered resting state EEG abnormality in semantic dementia. The notion that resting EEG in this dementia subtype is normal has to be revised.
27071994	Behavioral and psychological symptoms and psychotropic drugs among people with cognitive impairment in nursing homes in 2007 and 2013.	PURPOSE: The use of psychotropic drugs to treat behavioral and psychological symptoms among people with dementia has been widely questioned because of its limited efficacy and risk of harmful side-effects. The objectives of this study was to compare the prevalence of behavioral and psychological symptoms and the use of psychotropic drug treatments among old people with cognitive impairment living in geriatric care units in 2007 and 2013. METHODS: Two questionnaire surveys were performed in 2007 and 2013, comprising all those living in geriatric care units in the county of Vasterbotten in northern Sweden. A comparison was made between 1971 people from 2007 and 1511 people from 2013. Data were collected concerning psychotropic and antidementia drug use, functioning in the activities of daily living (ADL), cognition, and behavioral and psychological symptoms, using the Multi-Dimensional Dementia Assessment Scale (MDDAS). RESULTS: Between 2007 and 2013, the use of antipsychotic drugs declined from 25.4 to 18.9 %, and of anxiolytic, hypnotic, and sedative drugs from 35.5 to 29.4 %. The prevalence of people prescribed antidepressant drugs remained unchanged while antidementia drug prescription increased from 17.9 to 21.5 %. When controlled for demographic changes, 36 out of 39 behavioral and psychological symptoms showed no difference in prevalence between the years. CONCLUSIONS: The use of antipsychotic, anxiolytic, hypnotic, and sedative drugs declined considerably between 2007 and 2013 among old people with cognitive impairment living in geriatric care units. Despite this reduction, the prevalences of behavioral and psychological symptoms remained largely unchanged.
27071766	Semi-synthesis of a tag-free O-GlcNAcylated tau protein by sequential chemoselective ligation.	In this paper, the first semi-synthesis of the Alzheimer-relevant tau protein carrying an O-GlcNAcylation is demonstrated by using sequential chemoselective ligation. The 52-amino acid C-terminus of tau was obtained by native chemical ligation between two synthetic peptide fragments, one carrying the O-GlcNAc moiety on Ser400, which has recently been demonstrated to inhibit tau phosphorylation and to hinder tau oligomerization, and the other equipped with a photocleavable biotin handle. After desulfurization to deliver a native alanine at the ligation junction, the N-terminal cysteine was unmasked, and the peptide was further used for expressed protein ligation to generate the full-length tau protein, which was purified by a photocleavable biotin tag. We thus provide a synthetic route to obtain a homogenous tag-free O-GlcNAcylated tau protein that can further help to elucidate the significance of posttranslational modification on the tau protein and pave the way for evaluating possible drug targets in Alzheimer's disease.

27071749	Cytomegalovirus infection is associated with an increase in systolic blood pressure in older individuals.	BACKGROUND: Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a chronic infection that is widely distributed in the population. CMV infects a range of tissues, including endothelium, and viral replication is suppressed by the host immune system. Infection is associated with increased risk of mortality from vascular disease in older people, but the mechanisms behind this have not been determined. AIM: We investigated the association between CMV infection and cardiovascular phenotype in a cohort of healthy elderly donors. DESIGN: CMV serostatus and cardiovascular parameters were determined in the Lothian Birth cohort, which comprises 1091 individuals aged 70 years in whom many environmental, biochemical and radiological correlates of vascular function have been determined. METHODS: CMV serostatus was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay and correlated with a range of biochemical and phenotypic measures. RESULTS: Sixty-five percent of participants were CMV seropositive, which indicates chronic infection. The mean sitting systolic blood pressure (SBP) was 149.2 mmHg in CMV seropositive individuals compared with 146.2 mmHg in CMV seronegative subjects (SD 18.7 vs. 19.7; P < 0.017). This association between CMV infection and SBP was not attenuated after adjustment for a wide range of biological and socio-economic factors. CONCLUSIONS: These data show that CMV infection is associated with an increase in SBP in individuals at age 70 years. The magnitude is comparable to environmental variables such as obesity, diabetes or high salt intake. This is the first evidence to show that a chronic infection may be an important determinant of blood pressure and could have significant implications for the future management of hypertension.
27071695	Sleep Disordered Breathing and White Matter Hyperintensities in Community-Dwelling Elders.	STUDY OBJECTIVES: To examine the association between markers of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) and white matter hyperintensity (WMH) volume in an elderly, multiethnic, community-dwelling cohort. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional analysis from the Washington Heights-Inwood Columbia Aging Project (WHICAP), a community-based epidemiological study of older adults. Structural magnetic resonance imaging was obtained starting in 2004; the Medical Outcomes Study-Sleep Scale (MOS-SS) was administered to participants starting in 2007. Linear regression models were used to assess the relationship between the two MOS-SS questions that measure respiratory dysfunction during sleep and quantified WMH volume among WHICAP participants with brain imaging. RESULTS: A total of 483 older adults had both structural magnetic resonance imaging and sleep assessment. Self-reported SDB was associated with WMH. After adjusting for demographic and vascular risk factors, WMH volumes were larger in individuals with frequent snoring (beta = 2.113, P = 0.004) and among those who reported waking short of breath or with headache (beta = 1.862, P = 0.048). CONCLUSIONS: In community-dwelling older adults, self-reported measures of SDB are associated with larger WMH volumes. The cognitive effects of SDB that are increasingly being recognized may be mediated at the small vessel level.
27071311	Cell-free expression of the APP transmembrane fragments with Alzheimer's disease mutations using algal amino acid mixture for structural NMR studies.	Structural investigations need ready supply of the isotope labeled proteins with inserted mutations n the quantities sufficient for the heteronuclear NMR. Though cell-free expression system has been widely used in the past years, high startup cost and complex compound composition prevent many researches from the developing this technique, especially for membrane protein production. Here we demonstrate the utility of a robust, cost-optimized cell-free expression technique for production of the physiologically important transmembrane fragment of amyloid precursor protein, APP686-726, containing Alzheimer's disease mutations in the juxtamembrane (E693G, Arctic form) and the transmembrane parts (V717G, London form, or L723P, Australian form). The protein cost was optimized by varying the FM/RM ratio as well as the amino acid concentration. We obtained the wild-type and mutant transmembrane fragments in the pellet mode of continuous exchange cell-free system consuming only commercial algal mixture of the (13)C,(15)N-labeled amino acids. Scaling up analytical tests, we achieved milligram quantity yields of isotope labeled wild-type and mutant APP686-726 for structural studies by high resolution NMR spectroscopy in membrane mimicking environment. The described approach has from 5 to 23-fold cost advantage over the bacterial expression methods described earlier and 1.5 times exceeds our previous result obtained with the longer APP671-726WT fragment.
27071083	A transcriptional signature of Alzheimer's disease is associated with a metastable subproteome at risk for aggregation.	It is well-established that widespread transcriptional changes accompany the onset and progression of Alzheimer's disease. Because of the multifactorial nature of this neurodegenerative disorder and its complex relationship with aging, however, it remains unclear whether such changes are the result of nonspecific dysregulation and multisystem failure or instead are part of a coordinated response to cellular dysfunction. To address this problem in a systematic manner, we performed a meta-analysis of about 1,600 microarrays from human central nervous system tissues to identify transcriptional changes upon aging and as a result of Alzheimer's disease. Our strategy to discover a transcriptional signature of Alzheimer's disease revealed a set of down-regulated genes that encode proteins metastable to aggregation. Using this approach, we identified a small number of biochemical pathways, notably oxidative phosphorylation, enriched in proteins vulnerable to aggregation in control brains and encoded by genes down-regulated in Alzheimer's disease. These results suggest that the down-regulation of a metastable subproteome may help mitigate aberrant protein aggregation when protein homeostasis becomes compromised in Alzheimer's disease.
27070645	Absence of a Role for Phosphorylation in the Tau Pathology of Alzheimer's Disease.	Alzheimer's disease is characterized by redistribution of the tau protein pool from soluble to aggregated states. Aggregation forms proteolytically stable core polymers restricted to the repeat domain, and this binding interaction has prion-like properties. We have compared the binding properties of tau and tubulin in vitro using a system in which we can measure binding affinities for proteins alternated between solid and aqueous phases. The study reveals that a phase-shifted repeat domain fragment from the Paired Helical Filament core contains all that is required for high affinity tau-tau binding. Unlike tau-tubulin binding, tau-tau binding shows concentration-dependent enhancement in both phase directions due to an avidity effect which permits one molecule to bind to many as the concentration in the opposite phase increases. Phosphorylation of tau inhibits tau-tau binding and tau-tubulin binding to equivalent extents. Tau-tau binding is favoured over tau-tubulin binding by factors in the range 19-41-fold, irrespective of phosphorylation status. A critical requirement for tau to become aggregation-competent is prior binding to a solid-phase substrate, which induces a conformational change in the repeat domain permitting high-affinity binding to occur even if tau is phosphorylated. The endogenous species enabling this nucleation event to occur in vivo remains to be identified. The findings of the study suggest that development of disease-modifying drugs for tauopathies should not target phosphorylation, but rather should target inhibitors of tau-tau binding or inhibitors of the binding interaction with as yet unidentified endogenous polyanionic substrates required to nucleate tau assembly.
27070562	Navigating the Chemical Space of Multitarget-Directed Ligands: From Hybrids to Fragments in Alzheimer's Disease.	Multitarget drug discovery is one of the hottest topics and most active fields in the search for new molecules against Alzheimer's disease (AD). Over the last 20 years, many promising multitarget-directed ligands (MTDLs) have been identified and developed at a pre-clinical level. However, how to design them in a rational way remains the most fundamental challenge of medicinal chemists. This is related to the foundational question of achieving an optimized activity towards multiple targets of interest, while preserving drug-like properties. In this respect, large hybrid molecules and small fragments are poles apart. In this review article, our aim is to appraise what we have accomplished in the development of both hybrid- and fragment-like molecules directed to diverse AD targets (i.e., acetylcholinesterase, NMDA receptors, metal chelation, BACE-1 and GSK-3beta). In addition, we attempt to highlight what are the persistent needs that deserve to be improved and cared for, with the ultimate goal of moving an MTDL to AD clinical studies.
27070561	Inhibition of Nitric Oxide Production in BV2 Microglial Cells by Triterpenes from Tetrapanax papyriferus.	It is well known that activated microglia produce nitric oxide (NO), which has an important role in the pathophysiology of several neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. In the course of searching for novel therapeutic agents from medicinal plants against neuroinflammatory diseases, the methanolic extract of Tetrapanax papyriferus was found to have significant NO inhibitory activity in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated BV2 microglia cells. Nine oleanane-type triterpenes, including two new compounds, epipapyriogenin C-3-O-beta-d-glucopyranoside (6) and 11-O-butylpapyrioside LIIc (9), were isolated from the leaves and stems of Tetrapanax papyriferus. The structures of these compounds were elucidated with 1D- and 2D-NMR and MS data. Among these Delta(11,13) oleanane-type triterpenes, compound 3 showed significant NO inhibitory activity in BV-2 cells, reducing the LPS-induced expression of COX-2 and pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-alpha and IL-6. Compounds 7 and 9 also showed NO inhibitory activities among the Delta(12) oleanane-type triterpene saponins. These results show that oleanane-type triterpenes isolated from T. papyriferus could be a potential natural resource of NO inhibitors used in the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders.
27070276	Reduced O-GlcNAcase expression promotes mitotic errors and spindle defects.	Alterations in O-GlcNAc cycling, the addition and removal of O-GlcNAc, lead to mitotic defects and increased aneuploidy. Herein, we generated stable O-GlcNAcase (OGA, the enzyme that removes O-GlcNAc) knockdown HeLa cell lines and characterized the effect of the reduction in OGA activity on cell cycle progression. After release from G1/S, the OGA knockdown cells progressed normally through S phase but demonstrated mitotic exit defects. Cyclin A was increased in the knockdown cells while Cyclin B and D expression was reduced. Retinoblastoma protein (RB) phosphorylation was also increased in the knockdown compared to control. At M phase, the knockdown cells showed more compact spindle chromatids than control cells and had a greater percentage of cells with multipolar spindles. Furthermore, the timing of the inhibitory tyrosine phosphorylation of Cyclin Dependent Kinase 1 (CDK1) was altered in the OGA knockdown cells. Although expression and localization of the chromosomal passenger protein complex (CPC) was unchanged, histone H3 threonine 3 phosphorylation was decreased in one of the OGA knockdown cell lines. The Ewing Sarcoma Breakpoint Region 1 Protein (EWS) participates in organizing the CPC at the spindle and is a known substrate for O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT, the enzyme that adds O-GlcNAc). EWS O-GlcNAcylation was significantly increased in the OGA knockdown cells promoting uneven localization of the mitotic midzone. Our data suggests that O-GlcNAc cycling is an essential mechanism for proper mitotic signaling and spindle formation, and alterations in the rate of O-GlcNAc cycling produces aberrant spindles and promotes aneuploidy.
27070146	Humanized Tau Mice with Regionalized Amyloid Exhibit Behavioral Deficits but No Pathological Interaction.	Alzheimer's disease (AD) researchers have struggled for decades to draw a causal link between extracellular Abeta aggregation and intraneuronal accumulation of microtubule-associated protein tau. The amyloid cascade hypothesis posits that Abeta deposition promotes tau hyperphosphorylation, tangle formation, cell loss, vascular damage, and dementia. While the genetics of familial AD and the pathological staging of sporadic disease support this sequence of events, attempts to examine the molecular mechanism in transgenic animal models have largely relied on models of other inherited tauopathies as the basis for testing the interaction with Abeta. In an effort to more accurately model the relationship between Abeta and wild-type tau in AD, we intercrossed mice that overproduce human Abeta with a tau substitution model in which all 6 isoforms of the human protein are expressed in animals lacking murine tau. We selected an amyloid model in which pathology was biased towards the entorhinal region so that we could further examine whether the anticipated changes in tau phosphorylation occurred at the site of Abeta deposition or in synaptically connected regions. We found that Abeta and tau had independent effects on locomotion, learning, and memory, but found no behavioral evidence for an interaction between the two transgenes. Moreover, we saw no indication of amyloid-induced changes in the phosphorylation or aggregation of human tau either within the entorhinal area or elsewhere. These findings suggest that robust amyloid pathology within the medial temporal lobe has little effect on the metabolism of wild type human tau in this model.
27069691	P2Y Receptors in Synaptic Transmission and Plasticity: Therapeutic Potential in Cognitive Dysfunction.	ATP released from neurons and astrocytes during neuronal activity or under pathophysiological circumstances is able to influence information flow in neuronal circuits by activation of ionotropic P2X and metabotropic P2Y receptors and subsequent modulation of cellular excitability, synaptic strength, and plasticity. In the present paper we review cellular and network effects of P2Y receptors in the brain. We show that P2Y receptors inhibit the release of neurotransmitters, modulate voltage- and ligand-gated ion channels, and differentially influence the induction of synaptic plasticity in the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum. The findings discussed here may explain how P2Y1 receptor activation during brain injury, hypoxia, inflammation, schizophrenia, or Alzheimer's disease leads to an impairment of cognitive processes. Hence, it is suggested that the blockade of P2Y1 receptors may have therapeutic potential against cognitive disturbances in these states.
27069366	Cognitive impairment and stroke in elderly patients.	We reviewed current knowledge about the interaction between stroke and vascular risk factors and the development of cognitive impairment and dementia. Stroke is increasingly recognized as an important cause of cognitive problems and has been implicated in the development of both Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia. The prevalence of cognitive impairment after stroke is high, and their combined effects significantly increase the cost of care and health resource utilization, with reflections on hospital readmissions and increased mortality rates. There is also substantial evidence that vascular risk factors (such as hypertension, diabetes, obesity, dyslipidemia, and tobacco smoking) are independently associated with an increased risk of cognitive decline and dementia. Thus, a successful management of these factors, as well as optimal acute stroke management, might have a great impact on the development of cognitive impairment. Notwithstanding, the pathological link between cognitive impairment, stroke, and vascular risk factors is complex and still partially unclear so that further studies are needed to better elucidate the boundaries of this relationship. Many specific pharmacological treatments, including anticholinergic drugs and antihypertensive medications, and nonpharmacological approaches, such as diet, cognitive rehabilitation, and physical activity, have been studied for patients with vascular cognitive impairment, but the optimal care is still far away. Meanwhile, according to the most recent knowledge, optimal stroke care should also include cognitive assessment in the short and long term, and great efforts should be oriented toward a multidisciplinary approach, including quality-of-life assessment and support of caregivers.
27068745	An Alzheimer Disease-linked Rare Mutation Potentiates Netrin Receptor Uncoordinated-5C-induced Signaling That Merges with Amyloid beta Precursor Protein Signaling.	A missense mutation (T835M) in the uncoordinated-5C (UNC5C) netrin receptor gene increases the risk of late-onset Alzheimer disease (AD) and also the vulnerability of neurons harboring the mutation to various insults. The molecular mechanisms underlying T835M-UNC5C-induced death remain to be elucidated. In this study, we show that overexpression of wild-type UNC5C causes low-grade death, which is intensified by an AD-linked mutation T835M. An AD-linked survival factor, calmodulin-like skin protein (CLSP), and a natural ligand of UNC5C, netrin1, inhibit this death. T835M-UNC5C-induced neuronal cell death is mediated by an intracellular death-signaling cascade, consisting of death-associated protein kinase 1/protein kinase D/apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1)/JNK/NADPH oxidase/caspases, which merges at ASK1 with a death-signaling cascade, mediated by amyloid beta precursor protein (APP). Notably, netrin1 also binds to APP and partially inhibits the death-signaling cascade, induced by APP. These results may provide new insight into the amyloid beta-independent pathomechanism of AD.
27068704	Functional test of PCDHB11, the most human-specific neuronal surface protein.	BACKGROUND: Brain-expressed proteins that have undergone functional change during human evolution may contribute to human cognitive capacities, and may also leave us vulnerable to specifically human diseases, such as schizophrenia, autism or Alzheimer's disease. In order to search systematically for those proteins that have changed the most during human evolution and that might contribute to brain function and pathology, all proteins with orthologs in chimpanzee, orangutan and rhesus macaque and annotated as being expressed on the surface of cells in the human central nervous system were ordered by the number of human-specific amino acid differences that are fixed in modern populations. RESULTS: PCDHB11, a beta-protocadherin homologous to murine cell adhesion proteins, stood out with 12 substitutions and maintained its lead after normalizing for protein size and applying weights for amino acid exchange probabilities. Human PCDHB11 was found to cause homophilic cell adhesion, but at lower levels than shown for other clustered protocadherins. Homophilic adhesion caused by a PCDHB11 with reversion of human-specific changes was as low as for modern human PCDHB11; while neither human nor reverted PCDHB11 adhered to controls, they did adhere to each other. A loss of function in PCDHB11 is unlikely because intra-human variability did not increase relative to the other human beta-protocadherins. CONCLUSIONS: The brain-expressed protein with the highest number of human-specific substitutions is PCDHB11. In spite of its fast evolution and low intra-human variability, cell-based tests on the only proposed function for PCDHB11 did not indicate a functional change.
27067483	Bone marrow amyloid spherulites in a case of AL amyloidosis.	Parallel arrangement of beta-pleated sheets by amyloidogenic proteins is a well known phenomenon. Rarely, amyloid fibrils undergo radial orientation to form globular structures called spherulites. These amyloid spherulites show Maltese cross pattern under polarized microscopy. The clinical significance of amyloid spherulites is undetermined. Amyloidogenic proteins like insulin and beta-lactoglobulin form spherulites in vitro. The senile plaques of Alzheimer's disease rarely form in vivo spherulites. Amyloid spherulites have been described in the liver and small intestine. For the first time, we document amyloid spherulite formation in the bone marrow biopsy of an AL amyloidosis patient.
27066274	Parietal Fast Sleep Spindle Density Decrease in Alzheimer's Disease and Amnesic Mild Cognitive Impairment.	Several studies have identified two types of sleep spindles: fast (13-15 Hz) centroparietal and slow (11-13 Hz) frontal spindles. Alterations in spindle activity have been observed in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). Only few studies have separately assessed fast and slow spindles in these patients showing a reduction of fast spindle count, but the possible local specificity of this phenomenon and its relation to cognitive decline severity are not clear. Moreover, fast and slow spindle density have never been assessed in AD/MCI. We have assessed fast and slow spindles in 15 AD patients, 15 amnesic MCI patients, and 15 healthy elderly controls (HC). Participants underwent baseline polysomnographic recording (19 cortical derivations). Spindles during nonrapid eye movements sleep were automatically detected, and spindle densities of the three groups were compared in the derivations where fast and slow spindles exhibited their maximum expression (parietal and frontal, resp.). AD and MCI patients showed a significant parietal fast spindle density decrease, positively correlated with Minimental State Examination scores. Our results suggest that AD-related changes in spindle density are specific for frequency and location, are related to cognitive decline severity, and may have an early onset in the pathology development.
27065111	Influence of APOE Genotype on Hippocampal Atrophy over Time - An N=1925 Surface-Based ADNI Study.	The apolipoprotein E (APOE) e4 genotype is a powerful risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD). In the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort, we previously reported significant baseline structural differences in APOE e4 carriers relative to non-carriers, involving the left hippocampus more than the right--a difference more pronounced in e4 homozygotes than heterozygotes. We now examine the longitudinal effects of APOE genotype on hippocampal morphometry at 6-, 12- and 24-months, in the ADNI cohort. We employed a new automated surface registration system based on conformal geometry and tensor-based morphometry. Among different hippocampal surfaces, we computed high-order correspondences, using a novel inverse-consistent surface-based fluid registration method and multivariate statistics consisting of multivariate tensor-based morphometry (mTBM) and radial distance. At each time point, using Hotelling's T(2) test, we found significant morphological deformation in APOE e4 carriers relative to non-carriers in the full cohort as well as in the non-demented (pooled MCI and control) subjects at each follow-up interval. In the complete ADNI cohort, we found greater atrophy of the left hippocampus than the right, and this asymmetry was more pronounced in e4 homozygotes than heterozygotes. These findings, combined with our earlier investigations, demonstrate an e4 dose effect on accelerated hippocampal atrophy, and support the enrichment of prevention trial cohorts with e4 carriers.
27065061	ApoE: In Vitro Studies of a Small Molecule Effector.	Apolipoprotein E4 (apoE4), one of three isoforms of apoE, is the major risk factor for developing late onset Alzheimer's disease. The only differences among these isoforms (apoE2, apoE3, and apoE4) are single amino acid changes. Yet these proteins are functionally very different. One approach to ameliorating the effect of apoE4 with respect to Alzheimer's disease would be to find small molecular weight compounds that affect the behavior of apoE4. Few studies of this approach have been carried out in part because there was no complete structure of any full-length apoE isoform until 2011. Here, we focus on one small molecular weight compound, EZ-482, and explore the effects of its binding to apoE. Using hydrogen-deuterium exchange, we determined that EZ-482 binds to the C-terminal domains of both apoE3 and apoE4. The binding to apoE4, however, is accompanied by a unique N-terminal allosteric effect. Using fluorescence methods, we determined an apparent dissociation constant of approximately 8 muM. Although EZ-482 binds to the C-terminal domain, it blocks heparin binding to the N-terminal domain. The residues of apoE that bind heparin are the same as those involved in apoE binding to LDL and LRP-1 receptors. The methods and the data presented here may serve as a template for future studies using small molecular weight compounds to modulate the behavior of apoE.
27064442	Multimodal Image Analysis in Alzheimer's Disease via Statistical Modelling of Non-local Intensity Correlations.	The joint analysis of brain atrophy measured with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and hypometabolism measured with positron emission tomography with fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG-PET) is of primary importance in developing models of pathological changes in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Most of the current multimodal analyses in AD assume a local (spatially overlapping) relationship between MR and FDG-PET intensities. However, it is well known that atrophy and hypometabolism are prominent in different anatomical areas. The aim of this work is to describe the relationship between atrophy and hypometabolism by means of a data-driven statistical model of non-overlapping intensity correlations. For this purpose, FDG-PET and MRI signals are jointly analyzed through a computationally tractable formulation of partial least squares regression (PLSR). The PLSR model is estimated and validated on a large clinical cohort of 1049 individuals from the ADNI dataset. Results show that the proposed non-local analysis outperforms classical local approaches in terms of predictive accuracy while providing a plausible description of disease dynamics: early AD is characterised by non-overlapping temporal atrophy and temporo-parietal hypometabolism, while the later disease stages show overlapping brain atrophy and hypometabolism spread in temporal, parietal and cortical areas.
27063583	Omega-3 fatty acids for the treatment of dementia.	BACKGROUND: Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (omega-3 PUFAs) from fish and plant sources are commonly considered as a promising non-medical alternative to improve brain functions and slow down the progression of dementia. This assumption is mostly based on findings of preclinical studies and epidemiological research. Resulting explanatory models aim at the role omega-3 PUFAs play in the development and integrity of the brain's neurons, their protective antioxidative effect on cell membranes and potential neurochemical mechanisms directly related to Alzheimer-specific pathology. Epidemiological research also found evidence of malnutrition in people with dementia. Considering this and the fact that omega-3 PUFA cannot be synthesised by humans, omega-3 PUFAs might be a promising treatment option for dementia. OBJECTIVES: To assess the efficacy and safety of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) supplementation for the treatment of people with dementia. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group (ALOIS), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization (WHO) portal/ICTRP on 10 December 2015. We contacted manufacturers of omega-3 supplements and scanned reference lists of landmark papers and included articles. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in which omega-3 PUFA in the form of supplements or enriched diets were administered to people with Alzheimer's disease (AD), vascular dementia (VaD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD) or frontotemporal dementia (FTD). DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: The primary outcome measures of interest were changes in global and specific cognitive functions, functional performance, dementia severity and adverse effects. Two review authors independently selected studies, extracted data and assessed the quality of trials according to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. We rated the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach. We received unpublished data from the trial authors and collected adverse effects information from the published articles. We conducted meta-analyses for available outcome measures at six months. MAIN RESULTS: We included three comparable randomised, placebo-controlled trials investigating omega-3 PUFA supplements in 632 participants with mild to moderate AD over six, 12 and 18 months. We found no studies investigating other types of dementia. All trials were of high methodological quality. The overall quality of evidence for most of the outcomes was high.There was no evidence of a benefit from omega-3 PUFAs on cognitive function when measured at six months with the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale - Cognitive subscale (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.02, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.19 to 0.15; 566 participants; 3 studies; high quality evidence) or Mini-Mental State Examination (mean difference (MD) 0.18, 95% CI -1.05 to 1.41; 202 participants; 2 studies; high quality evidence) or on activities of daily living (SMD -0.02, 95% CI -0.19 to 0.16; 544 participants; 2 studies; high quality evidence). There was also no effect at six months of treatment on severity of dementia measured with the Clinical Dementia Rating - Sum of Boxes (MD -0.00, 95% CI -0.58 to 0.57; 542 participants; 2 studies; high quality evidence) or on quality of life measured with the Quality of Life Alzheimer's Disease scale (MD -0.10, 95% CI -1.28 to 1.08; 322 participants; 1 study; high quality evidence). There was no difference at six months on mental health measured with the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MD -0.10, 95% CI -0.74 to 0.54; 178 participants: 1 study; high quality of evidence) or the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (SMD 0.10, 95% CI -0.07 to 0.27; 543 participants; 2 studies; high quality of evidence). One very small study showed a benefit for omega-3 PUFAs in instrumental activities of daily living after 12 months of treatment (MD -3.50, 95% CI -4.30 to -2.70; 22 participants; moderate quality evidence). The included studies did not measure specific cognitive function. The studies did not report adverse events well. Two studies stated that all adverse events were mild and that they did not differ in overall frequency between omega-3 PUFA and placebo groups. Data from one study showed no difference between groups in frequency of any adverse event (risk ratio (RR) 1.02, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.10; 402 participants; 1 study; moderate quality evidence) or any serious adverse event (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.41; 402 participants; 1 study; high quality evidence) at 18 months of treatment. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We found no convincing evidence for the efficacy of omega-3 PUFA supplements in the treatment of mild to moderate AD. This result was consistent for all outcomes relevant for people with dementia. Adverse effects of omega-3 PUFAs seemed to be low, but based on the evidence synthesised in this review, we cannot make a final statement on tolerability. The effects on other populations remain unclear.
27062894	AChE and the amyloid precursor protein (APP) - Cross-talk in Alzheimer's disease.	The amyloid precursor protein (APP) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) are multi-faceted proteins with a wide range of vital functions, both crucially linked with the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). APP is the precursor of the Abeta peptide, the pathological agent in AD, while AChE is linked to its pathogenesis either by increasing cholinergic deficit or exacerbating Abeta fibril formation and toxicity. As such, both proteins are the main targets in AD therapeutics with AChE inhibitors being currently the only clinically available AD drugs. In our studies we have demonstrated an important inter-relation in functioning of these proteins. Both can be released from the cell membrane and we have shown that AChE shedding involves a metalloproteinase-mediated mechanism which, like the alpha-secretase dependent cleavage of APP, is stimulated by cholinergic agonists. Overexpression of the neuronal specific isoform APP695 in neuronal cells substantially decreased levels of the AChE mRNA, protein and catalytic activity accompanied by a similar decrease in mRNA levels of the AChE membrane anchor, PRiMA (proline rich membrane anchor). We further established that this regulation does not involve APP processing and its intracellular domain (AICD) but requires the E1 region of APP, specifically its copper-binding domain. On the contrary, siRNA knock-down of APP in cholinergic SN56 cells resulted in a significant upregulation of AChE mRNA levels. Hence APP may influence AChE physiology while released AChE may regulate amyloidogenesis through multiple mechanisms suggesting novel therapeutic targets.
27062261	Neuropathological diagnosis of vascular cognitive impairment and vascular dementia with implications for Alzheimer's disease.	Vascular dementia (VaD) is recognised as a neurocognitive disorder, which is explained by numerous vascular causes in the general absence of other pathologies. The heterogeneity of cerebrovascular disease makes it challenging to elucidate the neuropathological substrates and mechanisms of VaD as well as vascular cognitive impairment (VCI). Consensus and accurate diagnosis of VaD relies on wide-ranging clinical, neuropsychometric and neuroimaging measures with subsequent pathological confirmation. Pathological diagnosis of suspected clinical VaD requires adequate postmortem brain sampling and rigorous assessment methods to identify important substrates. Factors that define the subtypes of VaD include the nature and extent of vascular pathologies, degree of involvement of extra and intracranial vessels and the anatomical location of tissue changes. Atherosclerotic and cardioembolic diseases appear the most common substrates of vascular brain injury or infarction. Small vessel disease characterised by arteriolosclerosis and lacunar infarcts also causes cortical and subcortical microinfarcts, which appear to be the most robust substrates of cognitive impairment. Diffuse WM changes with loss of myelin and axonal abnormalities are common to almost all subtypes of VaD. Medial temporal lobe and hippocampal atrophy accompanied by variable hippocampal sclerosis are also features of VaD as they are of Alzheimer's disease. Recent observations suggest that there is a vascular basis for neuronal atrophy in both the temporal and frontal lobes in VaD that is entirely independent of any Alzheimer pathology. Further knowledge on specific neuronal and dendro-synaptic changes in key regions resulting in executive dysfunction and other cognitive deficits, which define VCI and VaD, needs to be gathered. Hereditary arteriopathies such as cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy or CADASIL have provided insights into the mechanisms of dementia associated with cerebral small vessel disease. Greater understanding of the neurochemical and molecular investigations is needed to better define microvascular disease and vascular substrates of dementia. The investigation of relevant animal models would be valuable in exploring the pathogenesis as well as prevention of the vascular causes of cognitive impairment.
27061977	Benzimidazolone bioisosteres of potent GluN2B selective NMDA receptor antagonists.	Overactivation of the NMDA receptor is associated with excitotoxic events leading to neurodegenerative processes as observed during the development of Alzheimer's disease, ParFnson's disease, Chorea Huntington and epilepsy. Negative allosteric modulators addressing selectively the ifenprodil binding site of GluN2B subunit containing NMDA receptors are of major interest due to their neuroprotective potential accompanied by few side effects. Herein benzimidazolone bioisosteres of potent GluN2B antagonists 1-5 were designed and synthesized. A seven step sequence provided the central intermediate 19 in 28% yield. Elimination of water, methylation, epoxidation, epoxide rearrangement and finally reductive amination afforded the [7]annulenobenzimidazolone 30 with a 3-phenylpropylamino substituent in 6-position. Although 30 fits nicely into the pharmacophore of potent GluN2B antagonists, the gluN2B binding affinity of 30 was only moderate (Ki = 697 nM). Additionally, 30 shows low selectivity over the sigma2 receptor (Ki = 549 nM). The moderate GluN2B affinity was explained by the rigid tricyclic structure of the [7]annulenobenzimidazolone 30.
27061625	Multitarget Drug Discovery and Polypharmacology.	Promising promiscuity: Guest editors Maria Laura Bolognesi and Andrea Cavalli set the stage for this ChemMedChem Special Issue on Polypharmacology and Multitarget Drugs. They highlight cases in which a departure from the "one target, one drug" paradigm has proven advantageous, with single molecules that can engage two or more targets to address a given pathology. Articles in this issue underscore the importance of focusing ever more attention to polypharmacology in drug discovery efforts.
27061321	Proteomics as an innovative tool to investigate frontotemporal disorders.	Neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by slow progressive loss of one or more functions of the CNS. Worldwide, the number of people affected by neurodegeneration is dramatically high and the social impact is upsetting. While being a heterogeneous group of diseases, most of these pathologies manifest similar clinical features and illness progression, thus making their diagnosis elusive. With its ability to meet the needs of neurodegenerative research, proteomics could help facilitate the diagnosis of these disorders. This strategy, recently emerged as complementary to genomics, has led in the last years to substantial achievements in deciphering molecular mechanisms and the follow-up of neurodegenerative diseases. Specifically, aim of this review is to cover the main proteomic investigations realized in the field of familial frontotemporal dementias. This disorder is less common than Alzheimer's disease and disproportionately affects younger individuals, thus representing a major psychological and economic burden for both patients and families. Although early and accurate differential diagnosis of frontotemporal dementias is crucial because of its implications for heritability, prognosis, therapeutics, and environmental management of patients, the investigative methods currently available to clinicians are incomplete. Certainly, the development of a focused therapy cannot be separated from the investigation of biochemical pathways involved in the pathogenesis.
27060959	The Memory Binding Test: Development of Two Alternate Forms into Spanish and Catalan.	BACKGROUND: The Memory Binding Test (MBT) is emerging as a promising tool for the detection of subtle memory impairment suggestive of Alzheimer's disease (AD). For such a test to be widely accessed and used, the availability of both alternate forms and language adaptations is required. OBJECTIVES: To develop a thorough methodology for obtaining alternate forms (A and B) of the MBT in Spanish and Catalan and to assess their equivalence. METHOD: According to the original development of the test, frequency was taken as the lexical variable of reference for the Spanish and Catalan adaptations. A crossed design protocol by form and language was used to compare the MBT results in a sample of 290 cognitively normal middle-aged participants. Pairwise Intraclass Correlation Coefficients (ICCs) were calculated among the six possible combinations. RESULTS: The Spanish and Catalan lists of words for the MBT A and B resulting from the adaptation process as well as the original lists in English are presented. ICC indices for the comparisons between forms and languages ranged from 0.56 to 0.82. CONCLUSION: The MBT A and B in Spanish and Catalan showed similar outcomes and can be considered equivalent. Moreover, the thorough methodology presented here for the transcultural adaptation and equivalence study, could serve as a model for future adaptations of the MBT and other verbal tests.
27060956	Shared Genetic Risk Factors for Late-Life Depression and Alzheimer's Disease.	BACKGROUND: Considerable evidence has been reported for the comorbidity between late-life depression (LLD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD), both of which are very common in the general elderly population and represent a large burden on the health of the elderly. The pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the link between LLD and AD are poorly understood. Because both LLD and AD can be heritable and are influenced by multiple risk genes, shared genetic risk factors between LLD and AD may exist. OBJECTIVE: The objective is to review the existing evidence for genetic risk factors that are common to LLD and AD and to outline the biological substrates proposed to mediate this association. METHODS: A literature review was performed. RESULTS: Genetic polymorphisms of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, apolipoprotein E, interleukin 1-beta, and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase have been demonstrated to confer increased risk to both LLD and AD by studies examining either LLD or AD patients. These results contribute to the understanding of pathophysiological mechanisms that are common to both of these disorders, including deficits in nerve growth factors, inflammatory changes, and dysregulation mechanisms involving lipoprotein and folate. Other conflicting results have also been reviewed, and few studies have investigated the effects of the described polymorphisms on both LLD and AD. CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that common genetic pathways may underlie LLD and AD comorbidity. Studies to evaluate the genetic relationship between LLD and AD may provide insights into the molecular mechanisms that trigger disease progression as the population ages.
27060955	Strong Impact of Chronic Cerebral Hypoperfusion on Neurovascular Unit, Cerebrovascular Remodeling, and Neurovascular Trophic Coupling in Alzheimer's Disease Model Mouse.	Although chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH) may affect Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis, the mechanism remains elusive. In the present study, we investigated the role of CCH on an AD mouse model in neurovascular unit, cerebrovascular remodeling, and neurovascular trophic coupling. Moreover, examined protective effect of galantamine. Alzheimer's disease transgenic mice (APP23) were subjected to bilateral common carotid arteries stenosis with ameroid constrictors for slowly progressive cerebral hypoperfusion. CCH exacerbated neuronal loss and decrease of alpha7 subunit of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (alpha7-nAChRs) expression in hippocampus and thalamus at 12 months. Meanwhile, CCH greatly induced advanced glycation end products expression, and blood-brain barrier leakage through observing IgG and MMP9 expressions. Furthermore, a significant number of dramatic enlarged cerebral vessels with remodeling, BDNF/TrkB decreased in neurovascular trophic coupling. The present study demonstrated that CCH strongly enhanced primary AD pathology including neurodegeneration, neurovascular unit disruption, cerebrovascular remodeling and neurovascular trophic coupling damage in AD mice, and that galantamine treatment greatly ameliorated such neuropathologic abnormalities.
27060954	Netrin-1 Interrupts Amyloid-beta Amplification, Increases sAbetaPPalpha in vitro and in vivo, and Improves Cognition in a Mouse Model of Alzheimer's Disease.	Recent studies have shown that inoculation of susceptible mice with amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides accelerates Abeta deposition in the brain, supporting the idea that Abeta may be self-amplifying; however, the exact mechanism is not understood. Here we provide evidence that Abeta may self-amplify, in part, by inhibiting alpha-secretase ADAM10 (a disintegrin and metalloprotease) cleavage of full-length Abeta precursor protein (FL AbetaPP) and therefore allow greater beta-secretase processing, and that Abeta itself is a substrate for ADAM10. Exposure of primary neuronal cultures from PDAbetaPP mice to exogenous rat Abeta1- 40 resulted in increased de novo human Abeta1-42 production and exposure of cells to Abeta decreased production of ADAM10 cleavage product soluble AbetaPPalpha (sAbetaPPalpha). In a cell-free assay, Abeta decreased ADAM10 cleavage of the chimeric substrate MBP-AbetaPPC125 and Abeta itself was apparently cleaved by the enzyme. The axonal guidance and trophic factor netrin-1, however, reduced the Abeta1- 40-induced Abeta1-42 increase, increased sAbetaPPalpha, and reversed the Abeta-induced sAbetaPPalpha decrease in vitro. In vivo, induction of netrin-1 expression in PDAbetaPPSwe/Ind transgenic mice resulted in reductions in both Abeta1-42 and Abeta1- 40, and ICV delivery of netrin-1 to PDAbetaPPSwe/Ind mice increased sAbetaPPalpha, decreased Abeta, and improved working memory. Finally, to support further study of netrin-1's potential as a therapeutic for Alzheimer's disease, pilot gene therapy studies were performed and a netrin mimetic peptide synthesized and tested that, like netrin, can increase sAbetaPPalpha and decrease Abeta1-42in vitro. Taken together, these data provide mechanistic insights into Abeta self-amplification and the ability of netrin-1 to disrupt it.
27060953	Searching for Primary Predictors of Conversion from Mild Cognitive Impairment to Alzheimer's Disease: A Multivariate Follow-Up Study.	Recent proposals of diagnostic criteria within the healthy aging-Alzheimer's disease (AD) continuum stressed the role of biomarker information. More importantly, such information might be critical to predict those mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients at a higher risk of conversion to AD. Usually, follow-up studies utilize a reduced number of potential markers although the conversion phenomenon may be deemed as multifactorial in essence. In addition, not only biological but also cognitive markers may play an important role. Considering this background, we investigated the role of cognitive reserve, cognitive performance in neuropsychological testing, hippocampal volumes, APOE genotype, and magnetoencephalography power sources to predict the conversion to AD in a sample of 33 MCI patients. MCIs were followed up during a 2-year period and divided into two subgroups according to their outcome: The "stable" MCI group (sMCI, 21 subjects) and the "progressive" MCI group (pMCI, 12 subjects). Baseline multifactorial information was submitted to a hierarchical logistic regression analysis to build a predictive model of conversion to AD. Results indicated that the combination of left hippocampal volume, occipital cortex theta power, and clock drawing copy subtest scores predicted conversion to AD with a 100% of sensitivity and 94.7% of specificity. According to these results it might be suggested that anatomical, cognitive, and neurophysiological markers may be considered as "first order" predictors of progression to AD, while APOE or cognitive reserve proxies might play a more secondary role.
27060950	Development of a Standardized Approach to Disclosing Amyloid Imaging Research Results in Mild Cognitive Impairment.	The increased use of PET amyloid imaging in clinical research has sparked numerous concerns about whether and how to return such research test results to study participants. Chief among these is the question of how best to disclose amyloid imaging research results to individuals who have cognitive symptoms that could impede comprehension of the information conveyed. We systematically developed and evaluated informational materials for use in pre-test counseling and post-test disclosures of amyloid imaging research results in mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Using simulated sessions, persons with MCI and their family care partners (N = 10 dyads) received fictitious but realistic information regarding brain amyloid status, followed by an explanation of how results impact Alzheimer's disease risk. Satisfaction surveys, comprehension assessments, and focus group data were analyzed to evaluate the materials developed. The majority of persons with MCI and their care partners comprehended and were highly satisfied with the information presented. Focus group data reinforced findings of high satisfaction and included 6 recommendations for practice: 1) offer pre-test counseling, 2) use clear graphics, 3) review participants' own brain images during disclosures, 4) offer take-home materials, 5) call participants post-disclosure to address emerging questions, and 6) communicate seamlessly with primary care providers. Further analysis of focus group data revealed that participants understood the limitations of amyloid imaging, but nevertheless viewed the prospect of learning one's amyloid status as valuable and empowering.
27060949	Specific Features of Subjective Cognitive Decline Predict Faster Conversion to Mild Cognitive Impairment.	BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a silent disorder that needs the earliest possible intervention in order to reduce its high economic and social impact. It has been recently suggested that subjective cognitive decline (SCD) appears at preclinical stages many years before the onset of AD. Therefore, SCD could become an ideal target for early therapeutic intervention. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to evaluate the clinical significance of SCD on the conversion from a cognitively healthy stage to a mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in one-year follow-up. METHODS: A total of 608 cognitively intact individuals from the Vallecas Project's cohort, a community-based prospective study to identify early markers of AD, were enrolled in this study. Participants were classified in three groups: i) No Complaints (NCg), ii) Subjects with complaints in one or more cognitive domains (SCDg), and iii) Subjects who, besides complaints, fulfilled the features of SCD Plus proposed by the International Working Group of SCD (SCD-Pg). RESULTS: Individuals were followed up for a mean of 13.1 months (range 10.7-22.4). During this time, 41 volunteers developed MCI (6.7% of total sample). The conversion rate for SCD-Pg (18.9%) was significantly higher than SCDg (5.6%) and NCg (4.9%). CONCLUSION: Specific features associated with SCD may help to identify individuals at high risk of fast conversion to MCI. These results highlight the importance of a close follow-up of subjects with SCD-P and include them in early intervention programs because of their increased risk for the development of MCI.
27060946	Glutamine and Glutamate Complex, as Measured by Functional Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy, Alters During Face-Name Association Task in Patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment and Alzheimer's Disease.	BACKGROUND: The metabolite response during a memory task in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the metabolite changes in subjects with AD, amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), and cognitively normal (CN) elderly during a memory task using functional magnetic resonance spectroscopy (fMRS). METHODS: This study involved 23 young normal controls (YC), 24 CN elderly, 24 aMCI, and 24 mild and probable AD individuals. fMRS data were acquired at the precuneus and posterior cingulate brain regions during a face-name association task. Statistical analyses of quantified metabolites were performed to evaluate differences of the metabolite values between the stimulation conditions and among the four subject groups. Receiver operating curve analysis was performed to evaluate whether the metabolic changes after functional activations can differentiate the subject groups. RESULT: Glutamine and glutamate complex (Glx) was statistically significantly different between the fixation and repeat conditions in aMCI (p = 0.0492) as well as between the fixation and the novel conditions in the AD (p = 0.0412) group. The total N-acetylaspartate (tNAA) was statistically significantly different among the four subject groups in the fixation condition (DF = 3, F = 7.673, p < 0.001), the novel condition (DF = 3, F = 6.945, p < 0.001), and the repeat condition (DF = 3, F = 7.127, p < 0.001). tNAA, tCr, and mIns could be used to differentiate CN from aMCI. Furthermore, tNAA, tCr, Glx, and Glu could also differentiate CN from AD, and aMCI from AD. CONCLUSION: Glx was altered during a stimulation that may be used to evaluate neuronal dysfunction in a demented patient. tNAA and tCr were reduced in patients with AD.
27060942	Does Microglial Activation Influence Hippocampal Volume and Neuronal Function in Alzheimer's Disease and Parkinson's Disease Dementia?	BACKGROUND: The influence of neuroinflammation on neuronal function and hippocampal atrophy in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD) is still unclear. OBJECTIVES: Here we investigated whether microglial activation measured by [11C]PK11195 PET is associated with neuronal function measured by cerebral glucose metabolic rate (rCMRGlc) using FDG-PET and hippocampal volume measurements. METHODS: We enrolled 25 subjects (9 PDD, 8 AD, and 8 controls) who underwent PET scans with [11C](R)PK11195, [18F]FDG, and volumetric MRI scanning. RESULTS: SPM correlation analysis in AD and PDD showed a negative correlation between hippocampal volume and microglial activation within hippocampus or parahippocampus and with cortical and subcortical areas of projections from hippocampus, while there was a positive correlation between rCMRGlc in cortical and subcortical areas of projections from hippocampus and hippocampal volume. Hippocampal volume was significantly reduced in AD compared to controls but not in PDD. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that microglial activation inversely correlated with hippocampal volume and hippocampal rCMRGlc in neurodegenerative diseases with dementia, providing further evidence for the central role of microglial activation in neurodegenerative diseases.
27060941	Differences in Depressive Patterns According to Disease Severityin Early-Onset Alzheimer's Disease.	BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVE: Depression frequently combines with dementia, including early-onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD). We investigated differences in prevalence and characteristics of depressive symptoms according to dementia severity in EOAD patients. METHODS: The 15-item Korean version of the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-15) was administered to 412 EOAD patients. Factor analysis was used to assess GDS-15 factor structure. We subdivided participants into three groups by disease severity, then compared the frequencies and scores of individual GDS-15 items and performed logistic regression analysis to assess associations between depressive symptoms and EOAD stage. RESULTS: Factor analysis yielded three factor categories: 1) "hopelessness and ominousness" (symptoms no. 6, 8, 12, 14, 15); 2) "unhappiness and dissatisfaction" (no. 1, 3, 5, 7, 11); and 3) "monotony and lack of energy" (no. 2, 4, 9, 10, 13). Factor 2 depressive symptoms (no. 1, 5, 11) were less common in moderate EOAD. The risk of Factor 1 symptoms: no. 12 (OR, 2.04; 95% CI, 1.19-3.50; p = 0.010) and 14 (OR, 1.84; 95% CI, 1.07-3.16; p = 0.028) was higher in mild than very mild EOAD. The risk of Factor 2 symptoms: no. 9 (OR, 2.69; 95% CI, 1.08-6.71; p = 0.033) and 13 (OR, 2.12; 95% CI, 1.02-4.40; p = 0.043) was higher in moderate than mild EOAD. CONCLUSION: We confirmed that depressive symptoms differ according to EOAD severity. When assessing depressive symptoms related to dementia progression, we recommend focusing on "hopelessness and ominousness" in very mild EOAD and "unhappiness and dissatisfaction" in mild EOAD.
27060904	Candidate gene resequencing to identify rare, pedigree-specific variants influencing healthy aging phenotypes in the long life family study.	BACKGROUND: The Long Life Family Study (LLFS) is an international study to identify the genetic components of various healthy aging phenotypes. We hypothesized that pedigree-specific rare variants at longevity-associated genes could have a similar functional impact on healthy phenotypes. METHODS: We performed custom hybridization capture sequencing to identify the functional variants in 464 candidate genes for longevity or the major diseases of aging in 615 pedigrees (4,953 individuals) from the LLFS, using a multiplexed, custom hybridization capture. Variants were analyzed individually or as a group across an entire gene for association to aging phenotypes using family based tests. RESULTS: We found significant associations to three genes and nine single variants. Most notably, we found a novel variant significantly associated with exceptional survival in the 3' UTR OBFC1 in 13 individuals from six pedigrees. OBFC1 (chromosome 10) is involved in telomere maintenance, and falls within a linkage peak recently reported from an analysis of telomere length in LLFS families. Two different algorithms for single gene associations identified three genes with an enrichment of variation that was significantly associated with three phenotypes (GSK3B with the Healthy Aging Index, NOTCH1 with diastolic blood pressure and TP53 with serum HDL). CONCLUSIONS: Sequencing analysis of family-based associations for age-related phenotypes can identify rare or novel variants.
27060329	[Progress in epigenetic research on Alzheimer disease].	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder, which features mainly with memory impairment as the initial symptom of progressive loss of cognitive function. Its main pathological changes include senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. The pathogenesis of AD is still unclear, though it may be connected with aging, genetic factors and environmental factors. Among these, aging and environmental factors can be modified by epigenetics. In this paper, advances in the study of epigenetic mechanisms related to the pathogenesis of AD are reviewed.
27059953	Presenilin 1 and Presenilin 2 Target gamma-Secretase Complexes to Distinct Cellular Compartments.	gamma-Secretase complexes achieve the production of amyloid peptides playing a key role in Alzheimer disease. These proteases have many substrates involved in important physiological functions. They are composed of two constant subunits, nicastrin and PEN2, and two variable ones, presenilin (PS1 or PS2) and APH1 (APH1aL, APH1aS, or APH1b). Whether the composition of a given gamma-secretase complex determines a specific cellular targeting remains unsolved. Here we combined a bidirectional inducible promoter and 2A peptide technology to generate constructs for the temporary, stoichiometric co-expression of six different combinations of the four gamma-secretase subunits including EGFP-tagged nicastrin. These plasmids allow for the formation of functional gamma-secretase complexes displaying specific activities and maturations. We show that PS1-containing gamma-secretase complexes were targeted to the plasma membrane, whereas PS2-containing ones were addressed to the trans-Golgi network, to recycling endosomes, and, depending on the APH1-variant, to late endocytic compartments. Overall, these novel constructs unravel a presenilin-dependent subcellular targeting of gamma-secretase complexes. These tools should prove useful to determine whether the cellular distribution of gamma-secretase complexes contributes to substrate selectivity and to delineate regulations of their trafficking.
27059738	An EEG-Based Fuzzy Probability Model for Early Diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease.	Alzheimer's disease is a degenerative brain disease that results in cardinal memory deterioration and significant cognitive impairments. The early treatment of Alzheimer's disease can significantly reduce deterioration. Early diagnosis is difficult, and early symptoms are frequently overlooked. While much of the literature focuses on disease detection, the use of electroencephalography (EEG) in Alzheimer's diagnosis has received relatively little attention. This study combines the fuzzy and associative Petri net methodologies to develop a model for the effective and objective detection of Alzheimer's disease. Differences in EEG patterns between normal subjects and Alzheimer patients are used to establish prediction criteria for Alzheimer's disease, potentially providing physicians with a reference for early diagnosis, allowing for early action to delay the disease progression.
27059687	Rhodiola rosea L. and Alzheimer's Disease: From Farm to Pharmacy.	Rhodiola rosea L. (roseroot) is a common member of the family Crassulaceae, known as one of the most important popular medicinal plants in the northern region of Europe. The roots of R. rosea possess a wide range of pharmacological activities such as antioxidant, antiinflammatory, anticancer, cardioprotective, and neuroprotective effects that are because of the presence of different phytochemicals such as phenols and flavonoids. In addition, the presence of salidroside, rosavins, and p-tyrosol are responsible for its beneficial effects for the treatment of on depression, fatigue, and cognitive dysfunction. A plethora of studies report that R. rosea has potent neuroprotective effects through the suppression of oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and excitotoxicity in brain tissues and antagonism of oncogenic p21-activated kinase. However, to our knowledge, no review articles have been published addressing the neuroprotective effects of R. rosea. Therefore, the present article aims at critically reviewing the available literature on the beneficial effects of R. rosea on as a therapeutic strategy for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative diseases where oxidative stress plays a major role in disease development and progression. We also discuss the cultivation, phytochemistry, clinical impacts, and adverse effects of R. rosea to provide a broader insight on the therapeutic potential for this plant.
27058954	Amyloid Beta-Mediated Hypomethylation of Heme Oxygenase 1 Correlates with Cognitive Impairment in Alzheimer's Disease.	To identify epigenetically regulated genes involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) we analyzed global mRNA expression and methylation profiles in amyloid precursor protein (APP)-Swedish mutant-expressing AD model cells, H4-sw and selected heme oxygenase-1 (HMOX1), which is associated with pathological features of AD such as neurofibrillary tangles and senile plaques. We examined the epigenetic regulatory mechanism of HMOX1 and its application as a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker for AD. Our results show that HMOX1 mRNA and protein expression was approximately 12.2-fold and 7.9-fold increased in H4-sw cells, respectively. Increased HMOX1 expression was also detected in the brain, particularly the hippocampus, of AD model transgenic mice. However, the methylation of specific CpG sites within its promoter, particularly at CpG located -374 was significantly decreased in H4-sw cells. Treatment of neuroglioma cells with the demethylating agent 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine resulted in reduced methylation of HMOX1 promoter accompanied by enhanced HMOX1 expression strongly supporting DNA methylation-dependent transcriptional regulation of HMOX1. Toxic Abeta-induced aberrant hypomethylation of HMOX1 at -374 promoter CpG site was correlated with increased HMOX1 expression. In addition to neuroglioma cells, we also found Abeta-induced epigenetic regulation of HMOX1 in human T lymphocyte Jurkat cells. We evaluated DNA methylation status of HMOX1 at -374 promoter CpG site in blood samples from AD patients, patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and control individuals using quantitative methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction. We observed lower methylation of HMOX1 at the -374 promoter CpG site in AD patients compared to MCI and control individuals, and a correlation between Mini-Mental State Examination score and demethylation level. Receiver operating characteristics analysis revealed good discrimination of AD patients from MCI patients and control individuals. Our findings suggest that the methylation status of HMOX1 at a specific promoter CpG site is related to AD progression.
27058526	Diabetes Mellitus Induces Alzheimer's Disease Pathology: Histopathological Evidence from Animal Models.	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the major causative disease of dementia and is characterized pathologically by the accumulation of senile plaques (SPs) and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) in the brain. Although genetic studies show that beta-amyloid protein (Abeta), the major component of SPs, is the key factor underlying AD pathogenesis, it remains unclear why advanced age often leads to AD. Interestingly, several epidemiological and clinical studies show that type II diabetes mellitus (DM) patients are more likely to exhibit increased susceptibility to AD. Moreover, growing evidence suggests that there are several connections between the neuropathology that underlies AD and DM, and there is evidence that the experimental induction of DM can cause cognitive dysfunction, even in rodent animal models. This mini-review summarizes histopathological evidence that DM induces AD pathology in animal models and discusses the possibility that aberrant insulin signaling is a key factor in the induction of AD pathology.
27057929	3D compartmented model to study the neurite-related toxicity of Abeta aggregates included in collagen gels of adaptable porosity.	UNLABELLED: Insoluble deposits of beta-amyloid (Abeta) are associated to neurodegenerative pathologies, in particular Alzheimer's Disease (AD). The toxicity of synthetic amyloid-like peptides has been largely demonstrated and shown to depend upon their aggregation state. However, standard 2D cell culture conditions are not well suited to study the role of the close vicinity of Abeta aggregates and growing neurites in the degenerative process. Here, we have designed a compartmented set-up where model neural cells are differentiated on the surface of Abeta-containing collagen matrices. The average pore size can be modulated, from below 0.2mum to more than 0.5mum by simple treatment with collagenase, to respectively hamper or permit neurite outgrowth towards the depth of the matrix. Dense Abeta aggregates (Congo red and ThT-positive) were obtained inside the collagen matrix with a homogeneous distribution and dimensions similar to those observed in post-mortem brain slices from Alzheimer's patients. The aggregates are not toxic to cells when the pore size is small, in spite of relatively high concentrations of 0.05-0.62mg of peptide per gram of collagen (equivalent to 11.3-113muM). In contrast, on Abeta-containing matrices with large pores, massive neural death is observed when the cells are seeded in the same conditions. It is the first time to our knowledge that Abeta aggregates with a typical morphology of dense plaques are obtained within a porous biomimetic matrix, and are shown to be toxic only when accessible to differentiating cells. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Insoluble deposits of beta-amyloid (Abeta) are associated to neurodegenerative pathologies, in particular Alzheimer's Disease (AD). In this study, we have formed Abeta aggregates directly inside a biomimetic collagen matrix loaded with growth factors to induce the differentiation of PC12 or SH-SY6Y cells. For the first time, we show that when the contact between cells and Abeta aggregates is allowed by opening up the matrix porosity, the close vicinity with aggregates induces neurite dystrophy. The compartmented 3D culture model developed and used in this study is a valuable tool to study the cytotoxicity of preformed dense Abeta aggregates and proves that contact between the aggregates and neurons is required to induce neurodegenerative processes.
27057365	The Neuroprotective Effect of the Association of Aquaporin-4/Glutamate Transporter-1 against Alzheimer's Disease.	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that is characterized by memory loss and cognitive dysfunction. Aquaporin-4 (AQP4), which is primarily expressed in astrocytes, is the major water channel expressed in the central nervous system (CNS). This protein plays an important role in water and ion homeostasis in the normal brain and in various brain pathological conditions. Emerging evidence suggests that AQP4 deficiency impairs learning and memory and that this may be related to the expression of glutamate transporter-1 (GLT-1). Moreover, the colocalization of AQP4 and GLT-1 has long been studied in brain tissue; however, far less is known about the potential influence that the AQP4/GLT-1 complex may have on AD. Research on the functional interaction of AQP4 and GLT-1 has been demonstrated to be of great significance in the study of AD. Here, we review the interaction of AQP4 and GLT-1 in astrocytes, which might play a pivotal role in the regulation of distinct cellular responses that involve neuroprotection against AD. The association of AQP4 and GLT-1 could greatly supplement previous research regarding neuroprotection against AD.
27057360	Topological Properties of Large-Scale Cortical Networks Based on Multiple Morphological Features in Amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment.	Previous studies have demonstrated that amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) has disrupted properties of large-scale cortical networks based on cortical thickness and gray matter volume. However, it is largely unknown whether the topological properties of cortical networks based on geometric measures (i.e., sulcal depth, curvature, and metric distortion) change in aMCI patients compared with normal controls because these geometric features of cerebral cortex may be related to its intrinsic connectivity. Here, we compare properties in cortical networks constructed by six different morphological features in 36 aMCI participants and 36 normal controls. Six cortical features (3 volumetric and 3 geometric features) were extracted for each participant, and brain abnormities in aMCI were identified by cortical network based on graph theory method. All the cortical networks showed small-world properties. Regions showing significant differences mainly located in the medial temporal lobe and supramarginal and right inferior parietal lobe. In addition, we also found that the cortical networks constructed by cortical thickness and sulcal depth showed significant differences between the two groups. Our results indicated that geometric measure (i.e., sulcal depth) can be used to construct network to discriminate individuals with aMCI from controls besides volumetric measures.
27056864	[Development of Disease-modifying Therapy for Alzheimer's Disease].	The development of disease-modifying therapy (DMT) that can arrest the pathological processes of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has emerged as one of the highest priorities of medical research. Two pathological hallmarks, amyloid-beta (Abeta) protein deposition and tau accumulation, are the major targets of DMT. Immunotherapy for Abeta removal and secretase inhibitors/modulators that reduce total or accumulation-prone Abeta are candidate DMTs against Abeta. Compounds that prevent tau aggregation are also under development. Clinical trials that test the efficacy of these DMT candidates are in preparation or ongoing. Recent studies of biomarkers of AD brain lesions have indicated that Abeta and tau accumulation appears 10 to 30 years before the occurrence of dementia and gradually propagate to reach the level that causes symptoms. Therefore, efficacy of DMT has to be evaluated in the preclinical stage of AD. The incidence of preclinical AD in the cognitively normal, aged population are estimated to be around 19%. Thus, currently available biomarkers, amyloid/tau PET imaging and cerebrospinal fluid measurements of Abeta and tau, are, perhaps, too invasive and costly. An international collaborative effort is needed to overcome this issue.
27056862	[How Treatable is Vascular Dementia?].	Vascular dementia is an umbrella term, encompassing the pathological changes in the brain due to cerebrovascular disease that result in dementia. Vascular dementia is the second most common form of dementia, after Alzheimer's disease. In this paper, I outline the concept of vascular dementia, the key aspects of the disease that are yet to be clarified, and the current status of clinical trials. Assessing these factors, I discuss how treatable vascular dementia presently is. Use of the term'vascular dementia'is riddled with uncertainties regarding disease classification, and non-standardized diagnostic criteria. There are difficulties in determining the exact relationship between cerebrovascular pathology and cognitive impairment. The comorbid effects of Alzheimer's pathology in some individuals also present an obstacle to reliable clinical diagnosis, and hinder research into effective management approaches. Vascular dementia is preventable and treatable, as there are established primary and secondary prevention measures for the causative cerebrovascular diseases, such as vascular risk factor intervention, antiplatelet therapy, and anticoagulation, amongst others. However, unlike Alzheimer's disease, there are no established symptomatic treatments for vascular dementia. Clinical trials of cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine indicate that they produce small cognitive benefits in patients with vascular dementia, though the exact clinical significance of these is uncertain. Data are insufficient to support the widespread use of these drugs in vascular dementia. Rehabilitation and physical and cognitive exercise may be beneficial, but evidence of cognitive benefit and relief of neuropsychiatric symptoms due to exercise is lacking.
27056858	[Dementia due to Endocrine Diseases].	Endocrine diseases affecting various organs, such as the pituitary gland, the thyroid, the parathyroid, the adrenal glands and the pancreas, occasionally cause dementia. While Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the main cause of dementia in the elderly and is untreatable, dementia caused by endocrine diseases is treatable in most cases. However, patients with dementia associated with endocrine diseases show memory impairments similar to those found in AD, often leading to misdiagnoses. Patients with endocrine diseases often present with other characteristic systemic and neuropsychiatric symptoms caused by altered hormone levels. Such neuropsychiatric symptoms include involuntary movements, depression, seizures, and muscle weakness. In these cases, abnormalities in imaging and blood or urine tests are helpful in making a differential diagnosis. As delays in the diagnosis and treatment of these patients may cause irreversible brain damage, it is imperative for clinicians to carefully exclude the possibility of latent endocrine diseases when treating patients with dementia.
27056856	[Malignant Lymphoma of the Brain, and Dementia].	A differential diagnosis of acute and subacute progressive dementias includes malignant lymphoma of the brain. We reviewed primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL), intravascular lymphomatosis (IVL), lymphomatosis cerebri, and the relapse and invasion of systemic lymphomas. PCNSL is confined to the central nervous system; the infiltration and compression by the lymphoma result in adverse neurological symptoms. IVL is a rare form of malignant lymphoma that is characterized by the proliferation of primarily B-cell type lymphoma cells within the blood vessels of various organs. This causes ischemia and results in the associated neurological symptoms. Medical history and neuroimaging studies provide crucial informations to distinguish the lymphomas from other diseases that cause dementia, such an Alzheimer's disease. MRI imaging of the brain using contrast agent, and the biopsy of diseased tissues are essential for the diagnosis of the lymphomas. A histopathological examination is the most effective way to diagnose malignant lymphomas of the brain. Presently, the treatment of choice for PCNSL is the intravenous administration of high dose methotrexate with and without radiation therapy. Futhermore, Rituximab-containing chemotherapy has proved to greatly improve the prognosis of IVL. A better outcome can be achieved with the earlier diagnosis and treatment of the malignant lymphoma of the brain.
27056849	[Neurosyphilis and Dementia].	The incidence of neurosyphilis has declined dramatically because of the availability of penicillin. However, in recent years there has been an increase in the occurence of neurosyphilis. General paresis, a form of parenchymatous neurosyphilis, causes dementia. Some of the symptoms include loss of memory, poor understanding and judgment, and behavioral changes. It is important to distinguish general paresis from neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, because with precise diagnosis and treatment, complete recovery is possible We describe epidemiological data, diagnosis and treatment of neurosyphilis as well as present our cases.
27056675	Structural neuroimaging correlates of cognitive status in older adults: A person-oriented approach.	Person-oriented approaches to clinical research aim to uncover subgroups of patients with different patterns of clinically relevant variables. Such approaches, however, are not yet widely employed in clinical neuroimaging research. This paper demonstrates an accessible approach to person-oriented research using model-based clustering in high-dimensional structural neuroimaging data. Cortical thickness measurements for 369 older adults (182 women, 187 men) were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. Model-based cluster analysis was performed on these imaging variables and then validated using variables that were not used in the clustering process. Variable selection identified two specific regions that contributed to cluster formation: the left and right entorhinal cortices. Two subgroups were uncovered: a "typical" cluster with higher entorhinal thickness (M=3.59mm, 95% confidence interval=3.57, 3.62), and an "atypical" cluster with relatively lower thickness (M=2.84mm, 95% confidence interval=2.75, 2.92). Members of the atypical cluster also had lower hippocampal volumes, memory scores, and executive function scores, and were also more likely to be clinically classified as cognitively impaired. These findings demonstrate the utility of model-based clustering of structural neuroimaging data in studies of ageing. The role of the entorhinal cortices in cluster formation is consistent with the known pathological substrate of Alzheimer's disease. The entorhinal cortices are implicated in the early genesis of the disease and atrophy of these regions is strongly associated with the cognitive phenotype. Overall, this approach can be readily applied to future neuroimaging investigations.
27056481	A new strategy to reduce amyloid deposition using peptide-imprinted membranes.	BACKGROUND: The accumulation of amyloid beta protein in the brain causes the cognitive impairment observed in neurodegenerative pathologies such as Alzheimer's disease. The present study aimed to test the hypothesis that a rapid removal of amyloid beta protein peptides from the blood by an extracorporeal purification system could represent an alternative solution for the treatment of patients suffering from this neurodegenerative disease. METHODS: In this regard, we investigated the specific recognition properties of a molecularly imprinted membrane based on poly(ethylene-co-vinyl alcohol) toward the amyloid beta protein fragment 25-35 (AbP), the more neurotoxic domain of amyloid beta protein. A chemical modification of the copolymer backbone using succinic anhydride was also performed to favor the formation of carboxylic groups and thus improve imprinting performance. RESULTS: The physico-chemical, morphological, mechanical and functional characterisations gave interesting results confirming the ability of imprinted membranes to in vitro rebind AbP. CONCLUSIONS: This work represents a proof of concept regarding the development of a biocompatible polymer membrane capable of selectively removing amyloid beta peptide from the blood and consequently from the cerebrospinal fluid.
27056331	Mapping of the Allosteric Site in Cholesterol Hydroxylase CYP46A1 for Efavirenz, a Drug That Stimulates Enzyme Activity.	Cytochrome P450 46A1 (CYP46A1) is a microsomal enzyme and cholesterol 24-hydroxylase that controls cholesterol elimination from the brain. This P450 is also a potential target for Alzheimer disease because it can be activated pharmacologically by some marketed drugs, as exemplified by efavirenz, the anti-HIV medication. Previously, we suggested that pharmaceuticals activate CYP46A1 allosterically through binding to a site on the cytosolic protein surface, which is different from the enzyme active site facing the membrane. Here we identified this allosteric site for efavirenz on CYP46A1 by using a combination of hydrogen-deuterium exchange coupled to MS, computational modeling, site-directed mutagenesis, and analysis of the CYP46A1 crystal structure. We also mapped the binding region for the CYP46A1 redox partner oxidoreductase and found that the allosteric and redox partner binding sites share a common border. On the basis of the data obtained, we propose the mechanism of CYP46A1 allostery and the pathway for the signal transmission from the P450 allosteric site to the active site.
27056326	Distinct Membrane Disruption Pathways Are Induced by 40-Residue beta-Amyloid Peptides.	Cellular membrane disruption induced by beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptides has been considered one of the major pathological mechanisms for Alzheimer disease. Mechanistic studies of the membrane disruption process at a high-resolution level, on the other hand, are hindered by the co-existence of multiple possible pathways, even in simplified model systems such as the phospholipid liposome. Therefore, separation of these pathways is crucial to achieve an in-depth understanding of the Abeta-induced membrane disruption process. This study, which utilized a combination of multiple biophysical techniques, shows that the peptide-to-lipid (P:L) molar ratio is an important factor that regulates the selection of dominant membrane disruption pathways in the presence of 40-residue Abeta peptides in liposomes. Three distinct pathways (fibrillation with membrane content leakage, vesicle fusion, and lipid uptake through a temporarily stable ionic channel) become dominant in model liposome systems under specific conditions. These individual systems are characterized by both the initial states of Abeta peptides and the P:L molar ratio. Our results demonstrated the possibility to generate simplified Abeta-membrane model systems with a homogeneous membrane disruption pathway, which will benefit high-resolution mechanistic studies in the future. Fundamentally, the possibility of pathway selection controlled by P:L suggests that the driving forces for Abeta aggregation and Abeta-membrane interactions may be similar at the molecular level.
27055803	Preservation of the Semantic Verbal Fluency Advantage in a Large Population-Based Sample: Normative Data from the TILDA Study.	OBJECTIVES: It is widely believed that phonemic fluency is more difficult than naming exemplars from a semantic category. Normative data in this regard are scarce, and there is considerable disagreement in the literature regarding the pattern in normal ageing and neurodegenerative conditions. Our objective was to provide normative data for semantic phonemic discrepancy scores from a large sample of older adults. METHODS: A total of 5780 community-dwelling older adults were included in this prospective, longitudinal study. Discrepancy scores were calculated by subtracting phonemic fluency score from semantic fluency score for each participant. Quantile regression was used to estimate normative values stratified for age. RESULTS: Subjects did better on testing of semantic fluency. The average discrepancy score was 9.18+/-6.89 words, (range, -20 to 37; n=5780). At the fiftieth percentile, those in their fifth decade produced 10 more "animals" than "letter F" words. Subjects scored one word less per decade, with an average of seven more "animal" words produced by those in their eighth decade. CONCLUSIONS: Our study is the first to provide normative data and confirms that, for animal versus letter F fluency, the semantic advantage persists into later life in a population-based sample of community-dwelling older adults. Given that a majority of clinical samples have confirmed a reverse of this pattern in Alzheimer's dementia (i.e., loss of semantic advantage in Alzheimer's disease, yielding a phonemic advantage), our findings support the clinical utility of brief fluency tests and encourage further research into their use in diagnosis and prediction of progression to dementia.
27055550	Month and Season of Birth as a Risk Factor for Alzheimer's Disease: A Nationwide Nested Case-control Study.	OBJECTIVES: Season of birth, an exogenous indicator of early life environment, has been related to higher risk of adverse psychiatric outcomes but the findings for Alzheimer's disease (AD) have been inconsistent. We investigated whether the month or season of birth are associated with AD. METHODS: A nationwide nested case-control study including all community-dwellers with clinically verified AD diagnosed in 2005 to 2012 (n=70 719) and up to four age- sex- and region of residence-matched controls (n=282 862) residing in Finland. Associations between month and season of birth and AD were studied with conditional logistic regression. RESULTS: Month of birth was not associated with AD (p=0.09). No strong associations were observed with season (p=0.13), although in comparison to winter births (December-February) summer births (June-August) were associated with higher odds of AD (odds ratio, 1.03; 95% confidence interval, 1.00 to 1.05). However, the absolute difference in prevalence in winter births was only 0.5% (prevalence of those born in winter were 31.7% and 32.2% for cases and controls, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Although our findings do not support the hypothesis that season of birth is related to AD/dementia risk, they do not invalidate the developmental origins of health and disease hypothesis in late-life cognition. It is possible that season does not adequately capture the early life circumstances, or that other (postnatal) risk factors such as lifestyle or socioeconomic factors overrule the impact of prenatal and perinatal factors.
27055069	Benzothiazole Amphiphiles Ameliorate Amyloid beta-Related Cell Toxicity and Oxidative Stress.	Oxidative stress from the increase of reactive oxygen species in cells is a common part of the normal aging process and is accelerated in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Herein, we report the evaluation of three benzothiazole amphiphiles (BAMs) that exhibit improved biocompatibility without loss of biological activity against amyloid-beta induced cell damage compared to a previously reported hexa(ethylene glycol) derivative of benzothiazole aniline (BTA-EG6). The reduced toxicity of these BAM agents compared to BTA-EG6 corresponded with their reduced propensity to induce membrane lysis. In addition, all of the new BAMs were capable of protecting differentiated SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells from toxicity and concomitant oxidative stress induced by AD-related aggregated Abeta (1-42) peptides. Binding and microscopy studies support that these BAM agents target Abeta and inhibit the interactions of catalase with Abeta in cells, which, in turn, can account for an observed inhibition of Abeta-induced increases in hydrogen peroxide in cells treated with these compounds. These results support that this family of benzothiazole amphiphiles may have therapeutic potential for treating cellular damage associated with AD and other Abeta-related neurologic diseases.
27054356	Advanced Glycation End-Products and Their Receptors: Related Pathologies, Recent Therapeutic Strategies, and a Potential Model for Future Neurodegeneration Studies.	Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) are the result of a nonenzymatic reaction between sugars and proteins, lipids, or nucleic acids. AGEs are both consumed and endogenously formed; their accumulation is accelerated under hyperglycemic and oxidative stress conditions, and they are associated with the onset and complication of many diseases, such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and Alzheimer's disease. AGEs exert their deleterious effects by either accumulating in the circulation and tissues or by receptor-mediated signal transduction. Several receptors bind AGEs: some are specific and contribute to clearance of AGEs, whereas others, like the RAGE receptor, are nonspecific, associated with inflammation and oxidative stress, and considered to be mediators of the aforementioned AGE-related diseases. Although several anti-AGE compounds have been studied, understanding the underlying mechanisms of RAGE and targeting it as a therapeutic strategy is becoming increasingly desirable. For achieving these goals efficiently and expeditiously, the C. elegans model has been suggested. This model is already used for studying several human diseases and, by expressing RAGE, could also be used to study RAGE-related pathways and pathologies to facilitate the development of novel therapeutic strategies.
27053028	Self-Reported Sleep Disordered Breathing as Risk Factor for Mortality in the Elderly.	BACKGROUND: This study aimed to examine the association between self-reported sleep disordered breathing (SDB) ("awaken short of breath or with a headache") and mortality in a large and ethnically diverse group of community-dwelling elderly people. METHODS: A total of 1288 participants, 65 years and older, were examined longitudinally. Sleep problems were estimated using the Medical Outcomes Study Sleep Scale examining sleep disturbance, snoring, awaken short of breath or with a headache, sleep adequacy, and sleep somnolence. Cox regression analysis was used to examine the association between sleep problems and mortality. Age, gender, education, ethnicity, and body mass index were included as covariates. In further analyses we included hypertension, diabetes, heart disease, and stroke as additional covariates. RESULTS: The participants were followed for up to 6 years (mean = 2.9, standard deviation = 1.1), and 239 (18.6%) participants died during the follow-up. In unadjusted models, SDB at the initial visit was associated with mortality (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.37; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.21-1.55; P < .0001). After adjusting for all the covariates, the relationship between SDB and mortality remained significant (HR = 1.48; 95% CI 1.29-1.70; P < .0001). Participants with Caribbean-Hispanic ancestry have higher risk for mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that SDB is a risk factor for mortality in a large and ethnically diverse group of older adults, independent of demographic and clinical factors. Further research is needed to examine the underlying mechanisms of this association.
27052960	People with dementia in nursing home research: a methodological review of the definition and identification of the study population.	BACKGROUND: There are various definitions and diagnostic criteria for dementia, leading to discrepancies in case ascertainment in both clinical practice and research. We reviewed the different definitions, approaches and measurements used to operationalize dementia in health care studies in German nursing homes with the aim of discussing the implications of different approaches. METHODS: We conducted a systematic search of the MEDLINE and CINAHL databases to identify pre-2016 studies conducted in German nursing homes that focused on residents with dementia or cognitive impairment. In- or exclusion of studies were consented by all authors; data extraction was independently carried out by 2 authors (RP, SJ). The studies' sampling methods were compared with respect to their inclusion criteria, assessment tools and methods used to identify the study population. RESULTS: We summarized case ascertainment methods from 64 studies. Study participants were identified based on a diagnosis that was evaluated during the study, or a recorded medical dementia diagnosis, or a recorded medical diagnosis either with additional cognitive screenings or using screening tests exclusively. The descriptions of the diagnostics that were applied to assess a diagnosis of dementia were not fully transparent in most of the studies with respect to either a clear reference definition of dementia or applied diagnostic criteria. If reported, various neuropsychological tests were used, mostly without a clear rationale for their selection. CONCLUSION: Pragmatic considerations often determine the sampling strategy; they also may explain the variances we detected in the different studies. Variations in sampling methods impede the comparability of study results. There is a need to consent case ascertainment strategies in dementia studies in health service research in nursing homes. These strategies should consider resource constraints and ethical issues that are related to the vulnerable population of nursing home residents. Additionally, reporting about dementia studies in nursing homes need to be improved. If a diagnosis cannot be evaluated based on either ICD or DSM criteria, the study population may not be reported as having dementia. If a diagnosis is evaluated based on ICD or DSM criteria within the study, there is a need for more transparency of the diagnostic process.
27051467	TREM2 upregulation correlates with 5-hydroxymethycytosine enrichment in Alzheimer's disease hippocampus.	BACKGROUND: Recent genome-wide association studies revealed TREM2 rs75932628-T variant to be associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other neurodegenerative diseases. However, the role that TREM2 plays in sporadic AD is largely unknown. Our aim was to assess messenger RNA (mRNA) expression levels and DNA methylation profiling of TREM2 in human hippocampus in AD brain. We measured TREM2 mRNA levels in the hippocampus in a cohort of neuropathologically confirmed controls and pure AD cases showing no other protein deposits than beta-amyloid and phosphorylated tau. We also examined DNA methylation levels in the TREM2 transcription start site (TSS)-associated region by bisulfite cloning sequencing and further extended the study by measuring 5-hydroxymethycytosine (5hmC) enrichment at different regions of TREM2 by 5hmC DNA immunoprecipitation combined with real-time qPCR. RESULTS: A 3.4-fold increase in TREM2 mRNA levels was observed in the hippocampus of AD cases compared to controls (p = 1.1E-05). Interestingly, TREM2 methylation was higher in AD cases compared to controls (76.2 % +/- 15.5 versus 57.9 % +/- 17.1; p = 0.0016). Moreover, TREM2 mRNA levels in the AD hippocampus correlated with enrichment in 5hmC at the TREM2 gene body (r = 0.771; p = 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: TREM2 mRNA levels are increased in the human hippocampus in AD cases compared to controls. DNA methylation, and particularly 5hmC, may be involved in regulating TREM2 mRNA expression in the AD brain. Further studies are guaranteed to investigate in depth the role of 5hmC in AD and other neurodegenerative disorders.
27050677	Small molecules, big targets: drug discovery faces the protein-protein interaction challenge.	Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are of pivotal importance in the regulation of biological systems and are consequently implicated in the development of disease states. Recent work has begun to show that, with the right tools, certain classes of PPI can yield to the efforts of medicinal chemists to develop inhibitors, and the first PPI inhibitors have reached clinical development. In this Review, we describe the research leading to these breakthroughs and highlight the existence of groups of structurally related PPIs within the PPI target class. For each of these groups, we use examples of successful discovery efforts to illustrate the research strategies that have proved most useful.
27050411	Identification of Differentially Expressed Genes through Integrated Study of Alzheimer's Disease Affected Brain Regions.	BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia in older adults that damages the brain and results in impaired memory, thinking and behaviour. The identification of differentially expressed genes and related pathways among affected brain regions can provide more information on the mechanisms of AD. In the past decade, several studies have reported many genes that are associated with AD. This wealth of information has become difficult to follow and interpret as most of the results are conflicting. In that case, it is worth doing an integrated study of multiple datasets that helps to increase the total number of samples and the statistical power in detecting biomarkers. In this study, we present an integrated analysis of five different brain region datasets and introduce new genes that warrant further investigation. METHODS: The aim of our study is to apply a novel combinatorial optimisation based meta-analysis approach to identify differentially expressed genes that are associated to AD across brain regions. In this study, microarray gene expression data from 161 samples (74 non-demented controls, 87 AD) from the Entorhinal Cortex (EC), Hippocampus (HIP), Middle temporal gyrus (MTG), Posterior cingulate cortex (PC), Superior frontal gyrus (SFG) and visual cortex (VCX) brain regions were integrated and analysed using our method. The results are then compared to two popular meta-analysis methods, RankProd and GeneMeta, and to what can be obtained by analysing the individual datasets. RESULTS: We find genes related with AD that are consistent with existing studies, and new candidate genes not previously related with AD. Our study confirms the up-regualtion of INFAR2 and PTMA along with the down regulation of GPHN, RAB2A, PSMD14 and FGF. Novel genes PSMB2, WNK1, RPL15, SEMA4C, RWDD2A and LARGE are found to be differentially expressed across all brain regions. Further investigation on these genes may provide new insights into the development of AD. In addition, we identified the presence of 23 non-coding features, including four miRNA precursors (miR-7, miR570, miR-1229 and miR-6821), dysregulated across the brain regions. Furthermore, we compared our results with two popular meta-analysis methods RankProd and GeneMeta to validate our findings and performed a sensitivity analysis by removing one dataset at a time to assess the robustness of our results. These new findings may provide new insights into the disease mechanisms and thus make a significant contribution in the near future towards understanding, prevention and cure of AD.
27050297	Chronic cerebral hypoperfusion enhances Tau hyperphosphorylation and reduces autophagy in Alzheimer's disease mice.	Cerebral hypoperfusion and impaired autophagy are two etiological factors that have been identified as being associated with the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Nevertheless, the exact relationships among these pathological processes remain unknown. To elucidate the impact of cerebral hypoperfusion in AD, we created a unilateral common carotid artery occlusion (UCCAO) model by occluding the left common carotid artery in both young and old 3xTg-AD mice. Two months after occlusion, we found that ligation increases phospho-Tau (p-Tau) at Serine 199/202 in the hippocampus of 3-month-old AD mice, compared to sham-operated AD mice; whereas, there is no change in the wild type (WT) mice after ligation. Moreover, cerebral hypoperfusion led to significant increase of p-Tau in both the hippocampus and cortex of 16-month-old AD mice and WT mice. Notably, we did not detect any change in Abeta42 level in either young or old AD and WT mice after ligation. Interestingly, we observed a downregulation of LC3-II in the cortex of aged AD mice and WT mice after ligation. Our results suggest that elevated p-Tau and reduced autophagy are major cellular changes that are associated with hypoperfusion in AD. Therefore, targeting p-Tau and autophagy pathways may ameliorate hypoperfusion-induced brain damage in AD.
27050105	Brain in situ hybridization maps as a source for reverse-engineering transcriptional regulatory networks: Alzheimer's disease insights.	Microarray data have been a valuable resource for identifying transcriptional regulatory relationships among genes. As an example, brain region-specific transcriptional regulatory events have the potential of providing etiological insights into Alzheimer Disease (AD). However, there is often a paucity of suitable brain-region specific expression data obtained via microarrays or other high throughput means. The Allen Brain Atlas in situ hybridization (ISH) data sets (Jones et al., 2009) represent a potentially valuable alternative source of high-throughput brain region-specific gene expression data for such purposes. In this study, Allen Brain Atlas mouse ISH data in the hippocampal fields were extracted, focusing on 508 genes relevant to neurodegeneration. Transcriptional regulatory networks were learned using three high-performing network inference algorithms. Only 17% of regulatory edges from a network reverse-engineered based on brain region-specific ISH data were also found in a network constructed upon gene expression correlations in mouse whole brain microarrays, thus showing the specificity of gene expression within brain sub-regions. Furthermore, the ISH data-based networks were used to identify instructive transcriptional regulatory relationships. Ncor2, Sp3 and Usf2 form a unique three-party regulatory motif, potentially affecting memory formation pathways. Nfe2l1, Egr1 and Usf2 emerge among regulators of genes involved in AD (e.g. Dhcr24, Aplp2, Tia1, Pdrx1, Vdac1, and Syn2). Further, Nfe2l1, Egr1 and Usf2 are sensitive to dietary factors and could be among links between dietary influences and genes in the AD etiology. Thus, this approach of harnessing brain region-specific ISH data represents a rare opportunity for gleaning unique etiological insights for diseases such as AD.
27048338	Insights into the Structural Features Essential for JAK2 Inhibition and Selectivity.	The Janus kinase 2 (JAK2)-mediated signaling pathway plays an important role in controlling cell survival, proliferation, and differentiation. A mutation of JAK2 (V617F in specific) that results in constitutive activation of the enzyme is found in patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), such as polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia, and primary myelofibrosis. The genetic, biological, and physiological evidence available to date has established JAK2 inhibitors as effective chemotherapeutic agents for the treatment of MPNs as well as solid tumors, hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease. Important features essential for JAK2 inhibitors are potent enzymatic inhibition and a high degree of selectivity among other isoforms of JAK. The extent of the potency and selectivity of JAK2 inhibitors is dependent upon receptor-ligand interactions and structural difference between isoenzymes. Thus, detailed knowledge regarding structural characteristics and the binding mode between JAK2 and its inhibitors is necessary. Accordingly, we compiled in this review a comprehensive summary of the three dimensional (3D) structural features of reported JAK2-ligand complexes and the structureactivity relationship (SAR) of JAK2 inhibitors, with particular focus on potent JAK2 inhibition and specificity.
27048170	Safety and tolerability of BAN2401--a clinical study in Alzheimer's disease with a protofibril selective Abeta antibody.	BACKGROUND: Several monoclonal antibodies for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD) have been in development over the last decade. BAN2401 is a monoclonal antibody that selectively binds soluble amyloid beta (Abeta) protofibrils. METHODS: Here we describe the first clinical study with BAN2401. Safety and tolerability were investigated in mild to moderate AD. A study design was used with staggered parallel single and multiple ascending doses, from 0.1 mg/kg as a single dose to 10 mg/kg biweekly for four months. The presence of amyloid related imaging abnormalities (ARIA, E for edema, H for hemorrhage) was assessed with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma samples were analyzed to investigate pharmacokinetics (PK) and effects on biomarkers. RESULTS: The incidence of ARIA-E/H on MRI was comparable to that of placebo. BAN2401 exposure was approximately dose proportional, with a serum terminal elimination half-life of ~7 days. Only a slight increase of plasma Abeta(1-40) was observed but there were no measurable effects of BAN2401 on CSF biomarkers. On the basis of these findings Phase 2b efficacy study has been initiated in early AD. CONCLUSIONS: BAN2401 was well-tolerated across all doses. The PK profile has guided us for selecting dose and dose regimens in the ongoing phase 2b study. There was no clear guidance for an effective dose based on biomarkers. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT01230853 ClinicalTrials.gov Registered October 27, 2010.
27046268	The Immune System and Neuroinflammation as Potential Sources of Blood-Based Biomarkers for Alzheimer's Disease, Parkinson's Disease, and Huntington's Disease.	Neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by a loss of neurons that leads to cognitive and behavioral dysfunction. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder affecting millions of people in the United States and worldwide, followed by Parkinson's disease (PD). While some early onset forms of AD and PD are hereditary, the sporadic or late-onset cases are believed to result from lifestyle and environmental factors. On the contrary, Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disease solely caused by mutations in the gene for huntingtin protein. The disease mechanisms at play for all three disorders remain elusive, hampering efforts to develop effective therapeutic interventions. In light of this, the discovery of robust biomarkers is crucial in order to identify people at risk for AD and PD, preferably before symptoms arise. For all three diseases, the identification of biomarkers would not only allow development of treatments but also evaluation and adjustment of these with disease progression. It is now understood that neuroinflammation plays a crucial role in neurodegenerative diseases, along with subsequent immune activation. Therefore, research is actively ongoing to discover and evaluate inflammatory and immune-related biomarkers. Recent progress in this area for AD, PD, and HD is presented here.
27046230	Novel benzylidenephenylpyrrolizinones with pleiotropic activities potentially useful in Alzheimer's disease treatment.	This work describes the synthesis and the biological evaluation of novel benzylidenephenylpyrrolizinones as potential antioxidant, metal chelating or amyloid beta (betaA) aggregation inhibitors. Some derivatives exhibited interesting results in regard to several of the performed evaluations and appear as valuable Multi-Target Directed Ligands with potential therapeutic interest in Alzheimer's disease. Among them, compound 29 particularly appears as a valuable radical and NO scavenger, a Cu(II) and Fe(II) chelating agent and exhibits moderate betaA aggregation inhibition properties. These activities, associated to a good predictive bioavailability and a lack of cytotoxicity, design it as a promising hit for further in vivo investigation.
27045845	Advanced brain aging: relationship with epidemiologic and genetic risk factors, and overlap with Alzheimer disease atrophy patterns.	We systematically compared structural imaging patterns of advanced brain aging (ABA) in the general-population, herein defined as significant deviation from typical BA to those found in Alzheimer disease (AD). The hypothesis that ABA would show different patterns of structural change compared with those found in AD was tested via advanced pattern analysis methods. In particular, magnetic resonance images of 2705 participants from the Study of Health in Pomerania (aged 20-90 years) were analyzed using an index that captures aging atrophy patterns (Spatial Pattern of Atrophy for Recognition of BA (SPARE-BA)), and an index previously shown to capture atrophy patterns found in clinical AD (Spatial Patterns of Abnormality for Recognition of Early Alzheimer's Disease (SPARE-AD)). We studied the association between these indices and risk factors, including an AD polygenic risk score. Finally, we compared the ABA-associated atrophy with typical AD-like patterns. We observed that SPARE-BA had significant association with: smoking (P<0.05), anti-hypertensive (P<0.05), anti-diabetic drug use (men P<0.05, women P=0.06) and waist circumference for the male cohort (P<0.05), after adjusting for age. Subjects with ABA had spatially extensive gray matter loss in the frontal, parietal and temporal lobes (false-discovery-rate-corrected q<0.001). ABA patterns of atrophy were partially overlapping with, but notably deviating from those typically found in AD. Subjects with ABA had higher SPARE-AD values; largely due to the partial spatial overlap of associated patterns in temporal regions. The AD polygenic risk score was significantly associated with SPARE-AD but not with SPARE-BA. Our findings suggest that ABA is likely characterized by pathophysiologic mechanisms that are distinct from, or only partially overlapping with those of AD.
27045704	Mechanisms of protein homeostasis in health, aging and disease.	When emerging from the ribosomes, new polypeptides need to fold properly, eventually translocate, and then assemble into stable, yet functionally flexible complexes. During their lifetime, native proteins are often exposed to stresses that can partially unfold and convert them into stably misfolded and aggregated species, which can in turn cause cellular damage and propagate to other cells. In animal cells, especially in aged neurons, toxic aggregates may accumulate, induce cell death and lead to tissue degeneration via different mechanisms, such as apoptosis as in Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases and aging in general. The main cellular mechanisms effectively controlling protein homeostasis in youth and healthy adulthood are: (1) the molecular chaperones, acting as aggregate unfolding and refolding enzymes, (2) the chaperone-gated proteases, acting as aggregate unfolding and degrading enzymes, (3) the aggresomes, acting as aggregate compacting machineries, and (4) the autophagosomes, acting as aggregate degrading organelles. For unclear reasons, these cellular defences become gradually incapacitated with age, leading to the onset of degenerative diseases. Understanding these mechanisms and the reasons for their incapacitation in late adulthood is key to the design of new therapies against the progression of aging, degenerative diseases and cancers.
27045242	[Location and functions of secretagogin protein].	Secretagogin (SCGN) is a novel member of EF-hand Ca2+-binding proteins, which was identified in islet beta cells by Wagner. SCGN is a six EF-hand Ca2+-binding protein, primarily expressed on the neuroendocrine axis and the central nervous system. The protein has abundant biological functions. A certain concentration of calcium ion can lead to conformation change of SCGN, resulting in the change of intracellular signal transduction. Preliminary studies showed that SCGN would be used to treat stress reaction, such as mental illness (depression), burns or post-traumatic stress disorder and chronic stress reaction caused by pain. In Alzheimer's disease, the expression of SCGN in the hippocampus can boycott neurodegeneration. In neuroendocrine tumors, SCGN presents a good consistency with neuroendocrine markers such as CgA, Syn, and NSE, with a higher overall sensitivity and specificity. In addition, SCGN is released into serum after neural damage in cerebral ischemic diseases, suggesting that SCGN can be used as a marker for brain trauma. In this article, we review the recent research progress of secretagogin, focus on its distribution and functions in various tumorous diseases and non-tumorous diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease.
27044837	A possible significant role of zinc and GPR39 zinc sensing receptor in Alzheimer disease and epilepsy.	Zinc the essential trace element, plays a significant role in the brain development and in the proper brain functions at every stage of life. Misbalance of zinc (Zn(2+)) ions in the central nervous system is involved in the pathogenesis of numerous neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, Depression, and Epilepsy. In brain, Zn(2+) has been identified as a ligand, capable of activating and inhibiting the receptors including the NMDA-type glutamate receptors (NMDARs), GABAA receptors, nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), glycine receptors (glyR) and serotonin receptors (5-HT3). Recently GPR39 has been identified as a zinc-specific receptor, widely expressed in brain tissues including the frontal cortex, amygdala, and hippocampus. GPR39, when binding with Zn(2+) has shown promising therapeutic potentials. This review presents current knowledge regarding the role of GPR39 zinc sensing receptor in brain, with a focus on Alzheimer's disease and Epilepsy. Although the results are encouraging, further research is needed to clarify zinc and GPR39 role in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and Epilepsy.
27044501	Brain biometals and Alzheimer's disease - boon or bane?	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia. Several hypotheses have been put forward to explain the basis of disease onset and progression. A complicated array of molecular events has been implicated in the pathogenesis of AD. It is attributed to a variety of pathological conditions that share similar critical processes, such as oxidative stress, proteinaceous aggregations, mitochondrial dysfunctions and energy failure. There is increasing evidence suggesting that metal homeostasis is dysregulated in the pathology of AD. Biometals play an important role in the normal body functioning but AD may be mediated or triggered by disproportion of metal ions leading to changes in critical biological systems and initiating a cascade of events finally leading to neurodegeneration and cell death. The link is multifactorial, and although the source of the shift in oxidative homeostasis is still unclear, current evidence points to changes in the balance of redox transition metals, especially iron, copper (Cu) and other trace metals. Their levels in the brain are found to be elevated in AD. In other neurodegenerative disorders, Cu, zinc, aluminum and manganese are involved. This paper is a review of recent advances of the role of metals in the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of AD and related neurodegenerative diseases.
27044417	Exploring psychosocial interventions for people with dementia that enhance personhood and relate to legacy- an integrative review.	BACKGROUND: Epidemiological predictions suggest that dementia will continue to rise and that this will have social and economic ramifications. Effective interventions, beyond pharmacological management are needed. Psychosocial interventions have largely been investigated in relation to carers of people with dementia, or with regards to their ability to manage dementia symptoms, improve cognition, and reduce challenging behaviour. However, since dementia is a life-limiting illness and people with dementia are at risk of having their personhood compromised, psychosocial interventions should seek to enhance personhood, and offer the potential for the person to leave a legacy. METHODS: An integrative review was carried out to identify, assess, appraise and synthesise studies featuring interventions, which relate to both personhood and legacy. Search strategies were developed in key databases: MEDLINE; PsycINFO; Embase; Joanna Briggs Institute; CINAHL; Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews; ASSIA. Grey literature was also identified through free-text searches. RESULTS: Thirty six articles were included in the final review, these were tabulated and were assessed based on how the intervention related to personhood and legacy. Classification resulted in three themes being identified: Offering aspects of legacy; Acknowledging the person behind the patient; Facilitating meaningful engagement. Generally, personhood aspects of interventions were well reported, but further research is required to explore legacy potential of psychosocial interventions for people with dementia. CONCLUSION: The integrative review provides an overview and exploration of an under-researched area, and provides directions for future research, which will help expand the evidence base and ultimately help improve patient care for people with dementia and their families.
27044136	Bioactive Lipids Safeguard Our Brain from Various Challenges.	The bioactive lipids plasmalogens (Pls), especially the ethanolamine types, PlsEtn, are found to be enriched in the central nervous system (CNS). Previous reports showed that the brain and serum Pls levels were reduced in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the role of the Pls in AD is mostly elusive. Furthermore Pls have been suggested to have pathophysiological significance in ageing and stress responses in the CNS, which often involve neuroinflammation characterized by glial cell activation. Focusing on these lipids function in the murine brain, we first show that Pls can ameliorate microglial activation induced by systemic inflammatory stimuli. Then their protective effects on the neuronal cell death are demonstrated. The precise mechanism of how these lipids function in the brain is now under investigation but our study will reveal the myth of these crucial lipid components in the CNS. Future study also could suggest novel therapeutics to safeguard our brain from various stresses including ageing, neuroinflammation as well as the memory disturbance in AD.
27042911	Ethical Considerations for the Use of Next-Generation Alzheimer Drugs in Symptomatic and At-Risk Patients.	This article presents a case in which a patient with mild Alzheimer disease requests a prescription for a newly developed Alzheimer disease drug, after which the patient's daughter inquires about its potential usefulness as a prevention strategy for herself. The article discusses the physician's responsibility to balance the ethical principles of beneficence, nonmaleficence, and respect for patient autonomy when evaluating requests for medications from patients with neurocognitive disease as well as from asymptomatic but at-risk patients.
27042903	Lewy Body Dementias: Dementia With Lewy Bodies and Parkinson Disease Dementia.	PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This article provides an overview of the clinical features, neuropathologic findings, diagnostic criteria, and management of dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Parkinson disease dementia (PDD), together known as the Lewy body dementias. RECENT FINDINGS: DLB and PDD are common, clinically similar syndromes that share characteristic neuropathologic changes, including deposition of alpha-synuclein in Lewy bodies and neurites and loss of tegmental dopamine cell populations and basal forebrain cholinergic populations, often with a variable degree of coexisting Alzheimer pathology. The clinical constellations of DLB and PDD include progressive cognitive impairment associated with parkinsonism, visual hallucinations, and fluctuations of attention and wakefulness. Current clinical diagnostic criteria emphasize these features and also weigh evidence for dopamine cell loss measured with single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging and for rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder, a risk factor for the synucleinopathies. The timing of dementia relative to parkinsonism is the major clinical distinction between DLB and PDD, with dementia arising in the setting of well-established idiopathic Parkinson disease (after at least 1 year of motor symptoms) denoting PDD, while earlier cognitive impairment relative to parkinsonism denotes DLB. The distinction between these syndromes continues to be an active research question. Treatment for these illnesses remains symptomatic and relies on both pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic strategies. SUMMARY: DLB and PDD are important and common dementia syndromes that overlap in their clinical features, neuropathology, and management. They are believed to exist on a spectrum of Lewy body disease, and some controversy persists in their differentiation. Given the need to optimize cognition, extrapyramidal function, and psychiatric health, management can be complex and should be systematic.
27042902	Alzheimer Disease.	PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This article discusses the recent advances in the diagnosis and treatment of Alzheimer disease (AD). RECENT FINDINGS: In recent years, significant advances have been made in the fields of genetics, neuroimaging, clinical diagnosis, and staging of AD. One of the most important recent advances in AD is our ability to visualize amyloid pathology in the living human brain. The newly revised criteria for diagnosis of AD dementia embrace the use for biomarkers as supportive evidence for the underlying pathology. Guidelines for the responsible use of amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) have been developed, and the clinical and economic implications of amyloid PET imaging are actively being explored. SUMMARY: Our improved understanding of the clinical onset, progression, neuroimaging, pathologic features, genetics, and other risk factors for AD impacts the approaches to clinical diagnosis and future therapeutic interventions.
27042901	Mild Cognitive Impairment.	PURPOSE OF REVIEW: As individuals age, the quality of cognitive function becomes an increasingly important topic. The concept of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) has evolved over the past 2 decades to represent a state of cognitive function between that seen in normal aging and dementia. As such, it is important for health care providers to be aware of the condition and place it in the appropriate clinical context. RECENT FINDINGS: Numerous international population-based studies have been conducted to document the frequency of MCI, estimating its prevalence to be between 15% and 20% in persons 60 years and older, making it a common condition encountered by clinicians. The annual rate in which MCI progresses to dementia varies between 8% and 15% per year, implying that it is an important condition to identify and treat. In those MCI cases destined to develop Alzheimer disease, biomarkers are emerging to help identify etiology and predict progression. However, not all MCI is due to Alzheimer disease, and identifying subtypes is important for possible treatment and counseling. If treatable causes are identified, the person with MCI might improve. SUMMARY: MCI is an important clinical entity to identify, and while uncertainties persist, clinicians need to be aware of its diagnostic features to enable them to counsel patients. MCI remains an active area of research as numerous randomized controlled trials are being conducted to develop effective treatments.
27041696	Admission into a Nursing Home. Delay or prevention with the use of a complete support network?	BACKGROUND: Becoming older in Germany often leads to admission into a nursing home. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate if a complete support network (CSN) can contribute to preventing admission into a nursing home. Organizational and financial prerequisites of a CSN were documented. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this study 32 patients with psychiatric disorders diagnosed according to the International Classification of Diseases 10 (ICD 10, 16 as F00 dementia in Alzheimer disease and 16 as F31-33 bipolar affective disorder, depressive episode and recurrent depressive disorder) were observed over a period of 2 years. The intervention consisted of participation in a defined CSN, which was developed by the Alexian Research Centre in Krefeld (ARCK). A cooperation of all persons and institutions involved in the care of elderly patients with psychiatric disorders was initiated. An individualized help plan was compiled for each patient. The primary outcome was admittance to a nursing home or remaining at home. The duration of staying at home was measured in days. User satisfaction was assessed with a 5step Likert scale questionnaire. The steering process and the financial efforts necessary to run the CSN were descriptively evaluated. RESULTS: At the end of the observation period 28 out of 32 patients were not admitted to a nursing home. During the observational period one patient dropped out, one died and two were admitted to a nursing home. User satisfaction achieved a median score of 5 (very satisfied). No additional funding was necessary to run the CSN. CONCLUSION: The CSN can prevent admission to a nursing home without needing additional funding and the whole process can be guided by the patient.
27039903	New Genetic Approaches to AD: Lessons from APOE-TOMM40 Phylogenetics.	Clinical trials for Alzheimer's disease are now focusing on the earliest stages of the disease with the goal of delaying dementia onset. There is great utility in using genetic variants to identify individuals at high age-dependent risk when the goal is to begin treatment before the development of any cognitive symptoms. Genetic variants identified through large-scale genome-wide association studies have not substantially improved the accuracy provided by APOE genotype to identify people at high risk of late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD). We describe novel approaches, focused on molecular phylogenetics, to finding genetic variants that predict age at LOAD onset with sufficient accuracy and precision to be useful. We highlight the discovery of a polymorphism in TOMM40 that, in addition to APOE, may improve risk prediction and review how TOMM40 genetic variants may impact the develop of LOAD independently from APOE. The analysis methods described in this review may be useful for other genetically complex human diseases.
27039371	GWAS and transcriptional analysis prioritize ITPR1 and CNTN4 for a serum uric acid 3p26 QTL in Mexican Americans.	BACKGROUND: The variation in serum uric acid concentrations is under significant genetic influence. Elevated SUA concentrations have been linked to increased risk for gout, kidney stones, chronic kidney disease, and cardiovascular disease whereas reduced serum uric acid concentrations have been linked to multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. Previously, we identified a novel locus on chromosome 3p26 affecting serum uric acid concentrations in Mexican Americans from San Antonio Family Heart Study. As a follow up, we examined genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism data in an extended cohort of 1281 Mexican Americans from multigenerational families of the San Antonio Family Heart Study and the San Antonio Family Diabetes/Gallbladder Study. We used a linear regression-based joint linkage/association test under an additive model of allelic effect, while accounting for non-independence among family members via a kinship variance component. RESULTS: Univariate genetic analysis indicated serum uric acid concentrations to be significant heritable (h (2) = 0.50 +/- 0.05, p < 4 x 10(-35)), and linkage analysis of serum uric acid concentrations confirmed our previous finding of a novel locus on 3p26 (LOD = 4.9, p < 1 x 10(-5)) in the extended sample. Additionally, we observed strong association of serum uric acid concentrations with variants in following candidate genes in the 3p26 region; inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor, type 1 (ITPR1), contactin 4 (CNTN4), decapping mRNA 1A (DCP1A); transglutaminase 4 (TGM4) and rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) 26 (ARHGEF26) [p < 3 x 10(-7); minor allele frequencies ranged between 0.003 and 0.42] and evidence of cis-regulation for ITPR1 transcripts. CONCLUSION: Our results confirm the importance of the chromosome 3p26 locus and genetic variants in this region in the regulation of serum uric acid concentrations.
27038189	Brain imaging of neurovascular dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease.	Neurovascular dysfunction, including blood-brain barrier (BBB) breakdown and cerebral blood flow (CBF) dysregulation and reduction, are increasingly recognized to contribute to Alzheimer's disease (AD). The spatial and temporal relationships between different pathophysiological events during preclinical stages of AD, including cerebrovascular dysfunction and pathology, amyloid and tau pathology, and brain structural and functional changes remain, however, still unclear. Recent advances in neuroimaging techniques, i.e., magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET), offer new possibilities to understand how the human brain works in health and disease. This includes methods to detect subtle regional changes in the cerebrovascular system integrity. Here, we focus on the neurovascular imaging techniques to evaluate regional BBB permeability (dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI), regional CBF changes (arterial spin labeling- and functional-MRI), vascular pathology (structural MRI), and cerebral metabolism (PET) in the living human brain, and examine how they can inform about neurovascular dysfunction and vascular pathophysiology in dementia and AD. Altogether, these neuroimaging approaches will continue to elucidate the spatio-temporal progression of vascular and neurodegenerative processes in dementia and AD and how they relate to each other.
27037912	GAMDB: a web resource to connect microRNAs with autophagy in gerontology.	OBJECTIVES: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous ~23 nucleotides (nt) RNAs, regulating gene expression by pairing to the mRNAs of protein-coding genes to direct their post-transcriptional repression. Both in normal and aberrant activities, miRNAs contribute to a recurring paradigm of cellular behaviors in pathological settings, especially in gerontology. Autophagy, a multi-step lysosomal degradation process with function to degrade long-lived proteins and damaged organelles, has significant impact on gerontology. Thus, elucidating how miRNAs participate in autophagy may enlarge the scope of miRNA in autophagy and facilitate researches in gerontology. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Herein, based upon the published studies, predicted targets and gerontology-related diseases, we constructed a web resource named Gerontology-Autophagic-MicroRNA Database (GAMDB) (http://gamdb.liu-lab.com/index.php), which contained 836 autophagy-related miRNAs, 197 targeted genes/proteins and 56 aging-related diseases such as Parkinson' disease, Alzheimer's disease and Huntington's disease. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: We made use of large amounts of data to elucidate the intricate relationships between microRNA-regulated autophagic mechanisms and gerontology. This database will facilitate better understanding of autophagy regulation network in gerontology and thus promoting gerontology-related therapy in the future.
27037872	Effects of Exercise on Cognition: The Finnish Alzheimer Disease Exercise Trial: A Randomized, Controlled Trial.	OBJECTIVES: To examine whether a regular, long-term exercise program performed by individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD) at home or as group-based exercise at an adult daycare center has beneficial effects on cognition; to examine secondary outcomes of a trial that has been published earlier. DESIGN: Randomized, controlled trial. SETTING: Community. PARTICIPANTS: Community-dwelling dyads (N = 210) of individuals with AD and their spousal caregivers randomized into three groups. INTERVENTION: Two types of intervention comprising customized home-based exercise (HE) and group-based exercise (GE), each twice a week for 1 year, were compared with a control group (CG) receiving usual community care. MEASUREMENTS: Cognitive function was measured using the Clock Drawing Test (CDT), Verbal Fluency (VF), Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR), and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) at baseline and 3, 6, and 12 months of follow-up. RESULTS: Executive function, measured using CDT, improved in the HE group, and changes in the score were significantly better than those of the CG at 12 months (adjusted for age, sex, and CDR, P = .03). All groups deteriorated in VF and MMSE score during the intervention, and no significant differences between the groups were detected at 12-month follow-up when analyses were adjusted for age, sex, and CDR. CONCLUSION: Regular, long-term, customized HE improved the executive function of community-dwelling older people with memory disorders, but the effects were mild and were not observed in other domains of cognition.
27036949	Upregulation of calpain activity precedes tau phosphorylation and loss of synaptic proteins in Alzheimer's disease brain.	Alterations in calcium homeostasis are widely reported to contribute to synaptic degeneration and neuronal loss in Alzheimer's disease. Elevated cytosolic calcium concentrations lead to activation of the calcium-sensitive cysteine protease, calpain, which has a number of substrates known to be abnormally regulated in disease. Analysis of human brain has shown that calpain activity is elevated in AD compared to controls, and that calpain-mediated proteolysis regulates the activity of important disease-associated proteins including the tau kinases cyclin-dependent kinase 5 and glycogen kinase synthase-3. Here, we sought to investigate the likely temporal association between these changes during the development of sporadic AD using Braak staged post-mortem brain. Quantification of protein amounts in these tissues showed increased activity of calpain-1 from Braak stage III onwards in comparison to controls, extending previous findings that calpain-1 is upregulated at end-stage disease, and suggesting that activation of calcium-sensitive signalling pathways are sustained from early stages of disease development. Increases in calpain-1 activity were associated with elevated activity of the endogenous calpain inhibitor, calpastatin, itself a known calpain substrate. Activation of the tau kinases, glycogen-kinase synthase-3 and cyclin-dependent kinase 5 were also found to occur in Braak stage II-III brain, and these preceded global elevations in tau phosphorylation and the loss of post-synaptic markers. In addition, we identified transient increases in total amyloid precursor protein and pre-synaptic markers in Braak stage II-III brain, that were lost by end stage Alzheimer's disease, that may be indicative of endogenous compensatory responses to the initial stages of neurodegeneration. These findings provide insight into the molecular events that underpin the progression of Alzheimer's disease, and further highlight the rationale for investigating novel treatment strategies that are based on preventing abnormal calcium homeostasis or blocking increases in the activity of calpain or important calpain substrates.
27036734	Identification of the novel activity-driven interaction between synaptotagmin 1 and presenilin 1 links calcium, synapse, and amyloid beta.	BACKGROUND: Synaptic loss strongly correlates with memory deterioration. Local accumulation of amyloid beta (Abeta) peptide, and neurotoxic Abeta42 in particular, due to abnormal neuronal activity may underlie synaptic dysfunction, neurodegeneration, and memory impairments. To gain an insight into molecular events underlying neuronal activity-regulated Abeta production at the synapse, we explored functional outcomes of the newly discovered calcium-dependent interaction between Alzheimer's disease-associated presenilin 1 (PS1)/gamma-secretase and synaptic vesicle proteins. RESULTS: Mass spectrometry screen of mouse brain lysates identified synaptotagmin 1 (Syt1) as a novel synapse-specific PS1-binding partner that shows Ca(2+)-dependent PS1 binding profiles in vitro and in vivo. We found that Abeta level, and more critically, conformation of the PS1 and the Abeta42/40 ratio, are affected by Syt1 overexpression or knockdown, indicating that Syt1 and its interaction with PS1 might regulate Abeta production at the synapse. Moreover, beta-secretase 1 (BACE1) stability, beta- and gamma-secretase activity, as well as intracellular compartmentalization of PS1 and BACE1, but not of amyloid precursor protein (APP), nicastrin (Nct), presenilin enhancer 2 (Pen-2), or synaptophysin (Syp) were altered in the absence of Syt1, suggesting a selective effect of Syt1 on PS1 and BACE1 trafficking. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings identify Syt1 as a novel Ca(2+)-sensitive PS1 modulator that could regulate synaptic Abeta, opening avenues for novel and selective synapse targeting therapeutic strategies.
27036121	Pathological tau deposition in Motor Neurone Disease and frontotemporal lobar degeneration associated with TDP-43 proteinopathy.	It has been suggested that patients with motor neurone disease (MND) and those with MND combined with behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) (ie FTD + MND) or with FTD alone might exist on a continuum based on commonalities of neuropathology and/or genetic risk. Moreover, it has been reported that both a neuronal and a glial cell tauopathy can accompany the TDP-43 proteinopathy in patients with motor neurone disease (MND) with cognitive changes, and that the tauopathy may be fundamental to disease pathogenesis and clinical phenotype. In the present study, we sought to substantiate these latter findings, and test this concept of a pathological continuum, in a consecutive series of 41 patients with MND, 16 with FTD + MND and 23 with FTD without MND. Paraffin sections of frontal, entorhinal, temporal and occipital cortex and hippocampus were immunostained for tau pathology using anti-tau antibodies, AT8, pThr(175) and pThr(217), and for amyloid beta protein (Abeta) using 4G8 antibody. Twenty four (59 %) patients with MND, 7 (44 %) patients with FTD + MND and 10 (43 %) patients with FTD showed 'significant' tau pathology (ie more than just an isolated neurofibrillary tangle or a few neuropil threads in one or more brain regions examined). In most instances, this bore the histological characteristics of an Alzheimer's disease process involving entorhinal cortex, hippocampus, temporal cortex, frontal cortex and occipital cortex in decreasing frequency, accompanied by a deposition of Abeta up to Thal phase 3, though 2 patients with MND, and 1 with FTD did show tau pathology beyond Braak stage III. Four other patients with MND showed novel neuronal tau pathology, within the frontal cortex alone, specifically detected by pThr(175) antibody, which was characterised by a fine granular or more clumped aggregation of tau without neurofibrillary tangles or neuropil threads. However, none of these 4 patients had clinically evident cognitive disorder, and this type of tau pathology was not seen in any of the FTD + MND or FTD patients. Finally, two patients, one with MND and one with FTD, showed a tau pathology consistent with Argyrophilic Grain Disease (AGD). Western blotting and use of 3- and 4-repeat tau antibodies confirmed the histological interpretation of Alzheimer's disease type pathology in all instances except for those patients with accompanying AGD where a banding pattern on western blot, and immunohistochemistry, confirmed 4-repeat tauopathy. In all 3 patient groups, amyloid pathology was more likely to be present in patients dying after 65 years of age, and in the presence of APOE epsilon4 allele. We conclude that tau pathological changes are equally common amongst patients with MND, FTD + MND and FTD though, in most instances, these are limited in extent. In patients with MND, when cognitive impairment is present this is most likely due to an accompanying/evolving (coincidental) Alzheimer's disease process or, as in a single case, Dementia with Lewy bodies, within the cerebral cortex rather than as a result of TDP-43 proteinopathy. Conversely, in FTD and FTD + MND dementia is more likely to be associated with TDP-43 proteinopathy than tau. Hence, present study shows no progression in severity of (tau) pathology from MND through FTD + MND to FTD, and does not support the concept of these conditions forming a continuum of clinical or pathological change.
27036079	Assessment of the genetic variance of late-onset Alzheimer's disease.	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex genetic disorder with no effective treatments. More than 20 common markers have been identified, which are associated with AD. Recently, several rare variants have been identified in Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP), Triggering Receptor Expressed On Myeloid Cells 2 (TREM2) and Unc-5 Netrin Receptor C (UNC5C) that affect risk for AD. Despite the many successes, the genetic architecture of AD remains unsolved. We used Genome-wide Complex Trait Analysis to (1) estimate phenotypic variance explained by genetics; (2) calculate genetic variance explained by known AD single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs); and (3) identify the genomic locations of variation that explain the remaining unexplained genetic variance. In total, 53.24% of phenotypic variance is explained by genetics, but known AD SNPs only explain 30.62% of the genetic variance. Of the unexplained genetic variance, approximately 41% is explained by unknown SNPs in regions adjacent to known AD SNPs, and the remaining unexplained genetic variance outside these regions.
27034957	Usability Pitfalls of Diabetes mHealth Apps for the Elderly.	Diabetes mellitus has high prevalence in the ageing population and is often accompanied by other comorbidities, such as Alzheimer's disease, and general disabilities, such as poor eyesight. These comorbidities have redefined ways in which patients use mHealth apps, including diabetes apps. The latter have proven benefits for monitoring blood glucose levels and insulin tracking in the general population. In this paper, we analyse a diabetes monitoring app DeStress Assistant (DeSA), which was developed as a part of an EU project and tested in a hospital setting. Due to the increasing number of older adults, we wanted to ensure the app was suitable for that demographic. Based on a number of supervised tests, we show that the app, which was developed with the help of workshops and feedback from tech-savvy patients and clinicians, is difficult to use by elderly users. We demonstrate that with a small number of changes it is possible to raise the usability of the app in a number of categories. We summarise the lessons learned in the discussion. Our findings demonstrate that special care needs to be taken when developing mHealth apps for the elderly population.
27034851	Nucleolar PARP-1 Expression Is Decreased in Alzheimer's Disease: Consequences for Epigenetic Regulation of rDNA and Cognition.	Synaptic dysfunction is thought to play a major role in memory impairment in Alzheimer's disease (AD). PARP-1 has been identified as an epigenetic regulator of plasticity and memory. Thus, we hypothesize that PARP-1 may be altered in postmortem hippocampus of individuals with AD compared to age-matched controls without neurologic disease. We found a reduced level of PARP-1 nucleolar immunohistochemical staining in hippocampal pyramidal cells in AD. Nucleolar PARP-1 staining ranged from dispersed and less intense to entirely absent in AD compared to the distinct nucleolar localization in hippocampal pyramidal neurons in controls. In cases of AD, the percentage of hippocampal pyramidal cells with nucleoli that were positive for both PARP-1 and the nucleolar marker fibrillarin was significantly lower than in controls. PARP-1 nucleolar expression emerges as a sensitive marker of functional changes in AD and suggests a novel role for PARP-1 dysregulation in AD pathology.
27034847	Chronic Stress and Glucocorticoids: From Neuronal Plasticity to Neurodegeneration.	Stress and stress hormones, glucocorticoids (GCs), exert widespread actions in central nervous system, ranging from the regulation of gene transcription, cellular signaling, modulation of synaptic structure, and transmission and glial function to behavior. Their actions are mediated by glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid receptors which are nuclear receptors/transcription factors. While GCs primarily act to maintain homeostasis by inducing physiological and behavioral adaptation, prolonged exposure to stress and elevated GC levels may result in neuro- and psychopathology. There is now ample evidence for cause-effect relationships between prolonged stress, elevated GC levels, and cognitive and mood disorders while the evidence for a link between chronic stress/GC and neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's (AD) and Parkinson's (PD) diseases is growing. This brief review considers some of the cellular mechanisms through which stress and GC may contribute to the pathogenesis of AD and PD.
27034741	Overview of Alzheimer's Disease and Some Therapeutic Approaches Targeting Abeta by Using Several Synthetic and Herbal Compounds.	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex age-related neurodegenerative disease. In this review, we carefully detail amyloid-beta metabolism and its role in AD. We also consider the various genetic animal models used to evaluate therapeutics. Finally, we consider the role of synthetic and plant-based compounds in therapeutics.
27034475	Advances in clinical determinants and neurological manifestations of B vitamin deficiency in adults.	B vitamin deficiency is a leading cause of neurological impairment and disability throughout the world. Multiple B vitamin deficiencies often coexist, and thus an understanding of the complex relationships between the different biochemical pathways regulated in the brain by these vitamins may facilitate prompter diagnosis and improved treatment. Particular populations at risk for multiple B vitamin deficiencies include the elderly, people with alcoholism, patients with heart failure, patients with recent obesity surgery, and vegetarians/vegans. Recently, new clinical settings that predispose individuals to B vitamin deficiency have been highlighted. Moreover, other data indicate a possible pathogenetic role of subclinical chronic B vitamin deficiency in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. In light of these findings, this review examines the clinical manifestations of B vitamin deficiency and the effect of B vitamin deficiency on the adult nervous system. The interrelationships of multiple B vitamin deficiencies are emphasized, along with the clinical phenotypes related to B vitamin deficiencies. Recent advances in the clinical determinants and diagnostic clues of B vitamin deficiency, as well as the suggested therapies for B vitamin disorders, are described.
27034412	High-Throughput Phenotypic Screening of Human Astrocytes to Identify Compounds That Protect Against Oxidative Stress.	UNLABELLED: Astrocytes are the predominant cell type in the nervous system and play a significant role in maintaining neuronal health and homeostasis. Recently, astrocyte dysfunction has been implicated in the pathogenesis of many neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Astrocytes are thus an attractive new target for drug discovery for neurological disorders. Using astrocytes differentiated from human embryonic stem cells, we have developed an assay to identify compounds that protect against oxidative stress, a condition associated with many neurodegenerative diseases. This phenotypic oxidative stress assay has been optimized for high-throughput screening in a 1,536-well plate format. From a screen of approximately 4,100 bioactive tool compounds and approved drugs, we identified a set of 22 that acutely protect human astrocytes from the consequences of hydrogen peroxide-induced oxidative stress. Nine of these compounds were also found to be protective of induced pluripotent stem cell-differentiated astrocytes in a related assay. These compounds are thought to confer protection through hormesis, activating stress-response pathways and preconditioning astrocytes to handle subsequent exposure to hydrogen peroxide. In fact, four of these compounds were found to activate the antioxidant response element/nuclear factor-E2-related factor 2 pathway, a protective pathway induced by toxic insults. Our results demonstrate the relevancy and utility of using astrocytes differentiated from human stem cells as a disease model for drug discovery and development. SIGNIFICANCE: Astrocytes play a key role in neurological diseases. Drug discovery efforts that target astrocytes can identify novel therapeutics. Human astrocytes are difficult to obtain and thus are challenging to use for high-throughput screening, which requires large numbers of cells. Using human embryonic stem cell-derived astrocytes and an optimized astrocyte differentiation protocol, it was possible to screen approximately 4,100 compounds in titration to identify 22 that are cytoprotective of astrocytes. This study is the largest-scale high-throughput screen conducted using human astrocytes, with a total of 17,536 data points collected in the primary screen. The results demonstrate the relevancy and utility of using astrocytes differentiated from human stem cells as a disease model for drug discovery and development.
27033742	Associative memory and underlying brain correlates in older adults with mild cognitive impairment.	This study investigated associative recognition memory by using unique features of the Chinese language and the underlying neuroanatomical correlates. The study participants were 22 Chinese speakers with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 25 cognitively normal (CN) Chinese speakers. The results revealed that the MCI group demonstrated impaired associative memory performance, despite exhibiting item memory performance comparable with that of the CN group, and that associative memory performance in older adults was associated with gray matter integrity in the medial temporal regions as well as executive function. An abnormal elevation was also observed in false-positive errors related to features unique to Chinese characters, namely orthographical errors, in addition to rearranged and semantic errors in the MCI group relative to the CN group, and the three error subtypes were differentially associated with gray matter integrity in the hippocampus or lateral prefrontal regions. Overall, these results demonstrate the value of evaluating associative memory in people with prodromal Alzheimer's disease (AD), and further elucidate the underlying neural substrates related to associative recognition memory in older adults.
27033407	Cholesteryl ester transfer protein genotype modifies the effect of apolipoprotein epsilon4 on memory decline in older adults.	Apolipoprotein epsilon4 (ApoE4) is a strong genetic risk factor for sporadic Alzheimer's disease and memory decline in older adults. A single-nucleotide polymorphism in the cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) gene (isoleucine to valine; V405) is associated with slower memory decline and a lower risk of Alzheimer's disease. As both genes regulate cholesterol, we hypothesized that the favorable CETPV405 allele may buffer the effect of ApoE4 on memory decline in older adults. Using linear regression, we examined the interactive effect of ApoE4 by CETPV405 on memory decline among 909 community-dwelling, nondemented, older adults (>/=70 years) from the Einstein Aging Study. Episodic memory was measured using the picture version of the Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test with immediate recall (pFCSRT+IR). There was a significant ApoE x CETP interaction on decline in pFCSRT+IR scores (p = 0.01). ApoE4 carriers experienced faster decline than noncarriers among CETPI405I homozygotes (p = 0.007) and in CETPI405V heterozygotes (p = 0.015) but not in CETPV405V homozygotes (p = 0.614). Results suggest that the CETPV405 allele buffers ApoE4-associated memory decline in a gene dose-dependent manner.
27032917	Sports-related brain injuries: connecting pathology to diagnosis.	Brain injuries are becoming increasingly common in athletes and represent an important diagnostic challenge. Early detection and management of brain injuries in sports are of utmost importance in preventing chronic neurological and psychiatric decline. These types of injuries incurred during sports are referred to as mild traumatic brain injuries, which represent a heterogeneous spectrum of disease. The most dramatic manifestation of chronic mild traumatic brain injuries is termed chronic traumatic encephalopathy, which is associated with profound neuropsychiatric deficits. Because chronic traumatic encephalopathy can only be diagnosed by postmortem examination, new diagnostic methodologies are needed for early detection and amelioration of disease burden. This review examines the pathology driving changes in athletes participating in high-impact sports and how this understanding can lead to innovations in neuroimaging and biomarker discovery.
27032538	The importance of high quality trials of cognitive interventions in Alzheimer's disease.	Currently available treatments for Alzheimer's disease (AD) are disappointing and their modest benefits do not reflect the increased understanding of the condition that has arisen from the last 50 years of research or the huge investments made by the pharmaceutical industry and academia in developing therapies. Cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine are evidence-based symptomatic treatments that offer benefits at the margins of clinical significance, but successive failures in trials of putative disease-modifying drugs have led researchers to investigate the potential efficacy of non-drug interventions. Exercise and cognitive-based interventions have received the most attention, but we are still a long way from understanding whether any can offer real benefit to patients with AD (Huntley et al., 2015).
27032526	A High Affinity Red Fluorescence and Colorimetric Probe for Amyloid beta Aggregates.	A major challenge in the Alzheimer's disease (AD) is its timely diagnosis. Amyloid beta (Abeta) aggregates have been proposed as the most viable biomarker for the diagnosis of AD. Here, we demonstrate hemicyanine-based benzothiazole-coumarin (TC) as a potential probe for the detection of highly toxic Abeta42 aggregates through switch-on, enhanced (~30 fold) red fluorescence (Emax = 654 nm) and characteristic colorimetric (light red to purple) optical outputs. Interestingly, TC exhibits selectivity towards Abeta42 fibrils compared to other abnormal protein aggregates. TC probe show nanomolar binding affinity (Ka = 1.72 x 10(7) M(-1)) towards Abeta42 aggregates and also displace ThT bound to Abeta42 fibrils due to its high binding affinity. The Abeta42 fibril-specific red-shift in the absorption spectra of TC responsible for the observed colorimetric optical output has been attributed to micro-environment change around the probe from hydrophilic-like to hydrophobic-like nature. The binding site, binding energy and changes in optical properties observed for TC upon interaction with Abeta42 fibrils have been further validated by molecular docking and time dependent density functional theory studies.
27031478	Insight into the Dissociation of Behavior from Histology in Synucleinopathies and in Related Neurodegenerative Diseases.	Recent clinical trials using immunization approaches against Alzheimer's disease (AD) have failed to demonstrate improved cognitive functions in patients, despite potent suppression in the formation of both senile plaques and other amyloid-beta deposits in postmortem brains. Similarly, we observed that treatment with ibuprofen, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, was effective in improving the histopathology, such as reducing both protein aggregation and glial activation, in the brains of transgenic mice expressing dementia with Lewy bodies-linked P123H beta-synuclein. In contrast, only a small improvement in cognitive functions was observed in these mice. Collectively, it is predicted that histology does not correlate with behavior that is resilient and resistant to therapeutic stimuli. Notably, such a 'discrepancy between histology and behavior' is reminiscent of AD-like pathologies and incidental Lewy bodies, which are frequently encountered in postmortem brains of the elderly who had been asymptomatic for memory loss and Parkinsonism during their lives. We suggest that 'the discrepancy between histology and behavior' may be a universal feature that is associated with various aspects of neurodegenerative diseases. Furthermore, given that the cognitive reserve is specifically observed in human brains, human behavior may be evolutionally distinct from that in other animals, thus, contributing to the differential efficiency of therapy between human and lower animals, an important issue in the therapy of neurodegenerative diseases. Overall, it is important to better understand 'the discrepancy between histology and behavior' in the mechanism of neurodegeneration for the development of effective therapies against neurodegenerative diseases.
27031477	"Missed" Mild Cognitive Impairment: High False-Negative Error Rate Based on Conventional Diagnostic Criteria.	Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is typically diagnosed using subjective complaints, screening measures, clinical judgment, and a single memory score. Our prior work has shown that this method is highly susceptible to false-positive diagnostic errors. We examined whether the criteria also lead to "false-negative" errors by diagnostically reclassifying 520 participants using novel actuarial neuropsychological criteria. Results revealed a false-negative error rate of 7.1%. Participants' neuropsychological performance, cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers, and rate of decline provided evidence that an MCI diagnosis is warranted. The impact of "missed" cases of MCI has direct relevance to clinical practice, research studies, and clinical trials of prodromal Alzheimer's disease.
27031476	Homocysteine and Alzheimer's Disease: Evidence for a Causal Link from Mendelian Randomization.	BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: The relationship between plasma homocysteine (Hcy) levels and Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been studied for many years, but remains controversial. While a recent meta-analysis of epidemiological studies, which included observational studies, indicated that homocysteine may be a risk factor for AD, there remains a need to further demonstrate this link due to the large degree of heterogeneity between studies. Epidemiological studies have certain limitations, as their results can be affected by confounding factors and reverse causation. In this study, we evaluated the relationship between plasma homocysteine and AD by using a Mendelian randomization method to avoid problems of confounding bias and reverse causality. METHODS: We searched the PubMed and EMBASE databases for reports regarding the MTHFR C677T polymorphism (rs1801133) from the time of their inception to September 2015. These reports were combined with related observational studies, and used to evaluate the effect of MTHFR C677T (rs1801133) on the risk for AD. A recent meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies had previously suggested a relationship between homocysteine and MTHFR C677T (rs 1801133). RESULTS: Our met-analysis included 34 studies with 9397 subjects, and demonstrated a significant relationship between plasma total homocysteine levels and the risk for AD (OR = 3.37; 95% CI = 1.90-5.95; p = 2.9x10-5). CONCLUSION: Our meta-analysis demonstrated a causal link between plasma total homocysteine and the risk for AD, and provides a new insight into the etiology and prevention of AD.
27031475	Aquaporin-4 and Alzheimer's Disease.	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia. Although the pathogenesis of AD remains unclear, AD is thought to result from an imbalance in the production and clearance of amyloid-beta protein (Abeta). Aquaporin-4 (AQP4) is the major aquaporin in the mammalian brain, is mostly expressed on astrocytic endfeet, and functions as a water transporter. However, the distribution and expression of AQP4 are altered in both AD clinical populations and animal models. Recent studies have revealed that AQP4 is important to the clearance of Abeta in brain via lymphatic clearance, transcytotic delivery, and glial degradation, as well as to the synaptic function. Thus, AQP4 likely plays an important role in the pathogenesis of AD. Further studies would provide new targets for prevention, ultimately leading to improved treatment options for AD.
27031474	High Risk of Dementia in Ventricular Enlargement with Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus Related Symptoms1.	BACKGROUND: Differential diagnosis of ventricular enlargement with normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) related symptoms is challenging. Patients with enlarged ventricles often manifest cognitive deterioration but their long-term outcome is not well known. OBJECTIVES: We aim to evaluate long-term cognitive outcome in patients with enlarged ventricles and clinically suspected NPH. METHODS: A neurologist and a neurosurgeon clinically evaluated 468 patients with enlarged ventricles and suspected NPH using radiological methods, intraventricular pressure monitoring, and frontal cortical brain biopsy. The neurologist confirmed final diagnoses after a median follow-up interval of 4.8 years. RESULTS: Altogether, 232 patients (50%) with enlarged ventricles did not fulfill the criteria for shunt surgery. The incidence of dementia among patients with enlarged ventricles, and at least one NPH-related symptom with adequate follow-up data (n = 446) was high, varying from 77 (iNPH, shunt responders) to 141/1000 person-years (non-shunted patients with enlarged ventricles). At the end of the follow-up, 59% of all these patients were demented. The demented population comprised 73% of non-shunted patients with enlarged ventricles, 63% of shunted iNPH patients that did not respond to treatment, and 46% of iNPH patients that were initially responsive to shunting. The most common cause of dementia was Alzheimer's disease (n = 94, 36%), followed by vascular dementia (n = 68, 26%). CONCLUSIONS: One-half of patients with enlarged ventricles and clinically suspected NPH were not shunted after intraventricular pressure monitoring. Dementia caused by various neurodegenerative diseases was frequently seen in patients with ventricular enlargement. Thus, careful diagnostic evaluation in collaboration with neurologists and neurosurgeons is emphasized.
27031473	Vitamin D Supplementation Appears to Increase Plasma Abeta40 in Vitamin D Insufficient Older Adults: A Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial.	Low plasma amyloid-beta (Abeta) is linked to Alzheimer's disease. Since vitamin D cleared brain Abeta in vitro, this 8-week trial examined whether vitamin D increased plasma Abeta40. Vitamin D insufficient adults (6/18 M/F; 64.3 +/- 10.9 y) were randomized to placebo or vitamin (50,000 IU/week) treatments. The vitamin group experienced greater plasma Abeta40 change than controls, +14.9 +/- 12.0 and +12.8 +/- 12.8 pg/mL (p = 0.045; effect size, 0.228). Change in Abeta40 for older participants (>/=60 y) was +18.3 +/- 33.6 and -3.2 +/- 44.5 pg/mL for vitamin (n = 4) and placebo (n = 4) groups (effect size, 0.295). Thus, vitamin D may increase plasma Abeta, particularly in older adults, suggesting decreased brain Abeta.
27031472	Cortical Amyloid Burden Differences Across Empirically-Derived Mild Cognitive Impairment Subtypes and Interaction with APOE varepsilon4 Genotype.	We examined cortical amyloid-beta (Abeta) levels and interactions with apolipoprotein (APOE) varepsilon4 genotype status across empirically-derived mild cognitive impairment (MCI) subgroups and cognitively normal older adults. Participants were 583 ADNI participants (444 MCI, 139 normal controls [NC]) with baseline florbetapir positron emission tomography (PET) amyloid imaging and neuropsychological testing. Of those with ADNI-defined MCI, a previous cluster analysis [1] classified 51% (n = 227) of the current sample as amnestic MCI, 8% (n = 37) as dysexecutive/mixed MCI, and 41% (n = 180) as cluster-derived normal (cognitively normal). Results demonstrated that the dysexecutive/mixed and amnestic MCI groups showed significantly greater levels of amyloid relative to the cluster-derived normal and NC groups who did not differ from each other. Additionally, 78% of the dysexecutive/mixed, 63% of the amnestic MCI, 42% of the cluster-derived normal, and 34% of the NC group exceeded the amyloid positivity threshold. Finally, a group by APOE genotype interaction demonstrated that APOE varepsilon4 carriers within the amnestic MCI, cluster-derived normal, and NC groups showed significantly greater amyloid accumulation compared to non-carriers of their respective group. Such an interaction was not revealed within the dysexecutive/mixed MCI group which was characterized by both greater cognitive impairment and amyloid accumulation compared to the other participant groups. Our results from the ADNI cohort show considerable heterogeneity in Abeta across all groups studied, even within a group of robust NC participants. Findings suggest that conventional criteria for MCI may be susceptible to false positive diagnostic errors, and that onset of Abeta accumulation may occur earlier in APOE varepsilon4 carriers compared to non-carriers.
27031470	Fibrillar Amyloid-beta Accumulation Triggers an Inflammatory Mechanism Leading to Hyperphosphorylation of the Carboxyl-Terminal End of Tau Polypeptide in the Hippocampal Formation of the 3xTg-AD Transgenic Mouse.	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a degenerative and irreversible disorder whose progressiveness is dependent on age. It is histopathologically characterized by the massive accumulation of insoluble forms of tau and amyloid-beta (Abeta) asneurofibrillary tangles and neuritic plaques, respectively. Many studies have documented that these two polypeptides suffer several posttranslational modifications employing postmortem tissue sections from brains of patients with AD. In order to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the posttranslational modifications of key players in this disease, including Abeta and tau, several transgenic mouse models have been developed. One of these models is the 3xTg-AD transgenic mouse, carrying three transgenes encoding APPSWE, S1M146V, and TauP301L proteins. To further characterize this transgenicmouse, we determined the accumulation of fibrillar Abeta as a function of age in relation to the hyperphosphorylation patterns of TauP301L at both its N- and C-terminus in the hippocampal formation by immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy. Moreover, we searched for the expression of activated protein kinases and mediators of inflammation by western blot of wholeprotein extracts from hippocampal tissue sections since 3 to 28 months as well. Our results indicate that the presence of fibrillar Abeta deposits correlates with a significant activation of astrocytes and microglia in subiculum and CA1 regions of hippocampus. Accordingly, we also observed a significant increase in the expression of TNF-alpha associated to neuritic plaques and glial cells. Importantly, there is an overexpression of the stress activated protein kinases SAPK/JNK and Cdk-5 in pyramidal neurons, which might phosphorylate several residues at the C-terminus of TauP301L. Therefore, the accumulation of Abeta oligomers results in an inflammatory environment that upregulates kinases involved in hyperphosphorylation of TauP301L polypeptide.
27031469	Detection of Striatal Amyloid Plaques with [18F]flutemetamol: Validation with Postmortem Histopathology.	Amyloid imaging is limited by an inconsistent relationship between cerebral cortex amyloid- beta (Abeta) plaques and dementia. Autopsy studies suggest that Abeta plaques first appear in the cerebral cortex while subcortical plaques are present only later in the disease course. The presence of abundant plaques in both cortex and striatum is more strongly correlated with the presence of dementia than cortical Abeta plaques alone. Additionally, detection of striatal plaques may allow, for the first time, pathology-based clinical staging of AD. Striatal plaques are reportedly identifiable by amyloid imaging but the accuracy and reliability of striatal amyloid imaging has never been tested against postmortem histopathology. To determine this, we correlated the presence of histopathologically-demonstrated striatal Abeta deposits with a visually positive panel consensus decision of a positive [18F]flutemetamol striatal PET signal in 68 subjects that later came to autopsy. The sensitivity of [18F]flutemetamol PET striatal amyloid imaging, for several defined density levels of histological striatal Abeta deposits, ranged between 69% and 87% while the specificity ranged between 96% and 100%. Sensitivity increased with higher histological density thresholds while the reverse was found for specificity. In general, as compared with PET alone, PET with CT had slightly higher sensitivities but slightly lower specificities. In conclusion, amyloid imaging of the striatum with [18F]flutemetamol PET has reasonable accuracy for the detection of histologically-demonstrated striatal Abeta plaques when present at moderate or frequent densities. Amyloid imaging of the cerebral cortex and striatum together may allow for a more accurate clinicopathological diagnosis of AD and enable pathology-based clinical staging of AD.
27031467	Impact of Depressive Symptoms on Memory for Emotional Words in Mild Cognitive Impairment and Late-Life Depression.	BACKGROUND: Amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) and late-life depression (LLD) are associated with increased risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD). This is also true for aMCI with concomitant depressive symptoms (aMCI/D+), but few studies have investigated this syndrome. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to clarify the association between cognitive and depressive symptoms in individuals at risk for AD by examining episodic memory for emotional stimuli in aMCI, aMCI/D+, and LLD. METHODS: Participants were 34 patients with aMCI, 20 patients with aMCI/D+, 19 patients with LLD, and 28 healthy elderly adults. In an implicit encoding task, participants rated the emotional valence of 12 positive, 12 negative, and 12 neutral words. Immediately and 20 minutes later, participants recalled as many words as possible. They were also asked to identify previously presented words during a yes/no recognition trial. RESULTS: At immediate recall, aMCI participants displayed better recall of emotional words, particularly positive words. aMCI/D+ and control participants displayed better recall of positive and negative words compared to neutral words. LLD participants recalled more negative than neutral words. At delayed recall, emotional words were generally better-remembered than neutral words by all groups. At recognition, all subjects responded more liberally to emotional than to neutral words. CONCLUSION: We find that the type of emotional information remembered by aMCI patients at immediate recall depends on the presence or absence of depressive symptoms. These findings contribute to identifying sources of heterogeneity in individuals at risk for AD, and suggest that the cognitive profile of aMCI/D+ is different from that of aMCI and LLD. Future studies should systematically consider the presence of depressive symptoms in elderly at-risk individuals.
27031466	Alcohol Consumption and Incident Dementia: Evidence from the Sydney Memory and Ageing Study.	Alcohol consumption is a potentially modifiable risk factor for dementia, but the literature is not completely consistent. This inconsistency may be partly due to an interaction with the apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype, an established risk factor for Alzheimer's dementia. The aim of this study was to examine whether alcohol consumption is associated with incident dementia or decline in specific cognitive domains over 4 years, and if this effect is modified by APOEvarepsilon4 status. Non-demented community dwelling older adults (70-90 years) from an ongoing longitudinal study were assessed for cognitive impairment in attention/processing speed, language, executive function, visuospatial ability, and memory. Incident dementia was diagnosed according to DSM-IV criteria. Compared to those who did not drink in the previous 12 months, neither low consumption (HR 0.64 95% CI 0.3-1.4) or risky consumption (HR 0.58 95% CI 0.2-1.5) was associated with incident dementia. Carriers of the APOEvarepsilon4 allele were more likely to develop dementia, but there was no significant interaction with alcohol consumption.
27031465	Neuropsychological Markers of Medial Perirhinal and Entorhinal Cortex Functioning are Impaired Twelve Years Preceding Diagnosis of Alzheimer's Dementia.	Neurofibrillary pathology in Alzheimer's dementia (AD) is associated with cognitive impairments and cortical thinning, and begins in medial perirhinal cortex (mPRC) before entering entorhinal cortex (ERC). Thus, mPRC dysfunction (e.g., semantic object memory impairments) may predate or accompany ERC (i.e., episodic memory) dysfunction in the preclinical course of typical AD. We developed formulae estimating mPRC and ERC integrity (i.e., cortical thickness) using common neuropsychological tests in 31 healthy individuals and 58 early AD patients. These formulae estimated the longitudinal courses of mPRC and ERC functioning in independent groups of 28 optimally healthy individuals who developed AD (NC-AD) over 2.8-13.4 years and 28 pairwise-matched, stable, healthy individuals (NC-NC). Mixed models demonstrated significantly worse NC-AD than NC-NC estimated mPRC and ERC functioning at the earliest observation, 12 years preceding diagnosis, and a significant decline 4 years preceding the AD diagnosis. These findings demonstrate that specific neuropsychological impairments occur early in the course of preclinical AD and that tasks measuring mPRC functioning may serve as additional, powerful markers of preclinical AD.
27030769	ABCA7 Deficiency Accelerates Amyloid-beta Generation and Alzheimer's Neuronal Pathology.	UNLABELLED: In Alzheimer's disease (AD), the accumulation and deposition of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides in the brain is a central event. Abeta is cleaved from amyloid precursor protein (APP) by beta-secretase and gamma-secretase mainly in neurons. Although mutations inAPP,PS1, orPS2cause early-onset familial AD,ABCA7encoding ATP-binding cassette transporter A7 is one of the susceptibility genes for late-onset AD (LOAD), in which itsloss-of-functionvariants increase the disease risk. ABCA7 is homologous to a major lipid transporter ABCA1 and is highly expressed in neurons and microglia in the brain. Here, we show that ABCA7 deficiency altered brain lipid profile and impaired memory in ABCA7 knock-out (Abca7(-/-)) mice. When bred to amyloid model APP/PS1 mice, plaque burden was exacerbated by ABCA7 deficit.In vivomicrodialysis studies indicated that the clearance rate of Abeta was unaltered. Interestingly, ABCA7 deletion facilitated the processing of APP to Abeta by increasing the levels of beta-site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) and sterol regulatory element-binding protein 2 (SREBP2) in primary neurons and mouse brains. Knock-down of ABCA7 expression in neurons caused endoplasmic reticulum stress highlighted by increased level of protein kinase R-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) and increased phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2alpha (eIF2alpha). In the brains of APP/PS1;Abca7(-/-)mice, the level of phosphorylated extracellular regulated kinase (ERK) was also significantly elevated. Together, our results reveal novel pathways underlying the association of ABCA7 dysfunction and LOAD pathogenesis. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Gene variants inABCA7encoding ATP-binding cassette transporter A7 are associated with the increased risk for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD). Importantly, we found the altered brain lipid profile and impaired memory in ABCA7 knock-out mice. The accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides cleaved from amyloid precursor protein (APP) in the brain is a key event in AD pathogenesis and we also found that ABCA7 deficit exacerbated brain Abeta deposition in amyloid AD model APP/PS1 mice. Mechanistically, we found that ABCA7 deletion facilitated the processing of APP and Abeta production by increasing the levels of beta-secretase 1 (BACE1) in primary neurons and mouse brains without affecting the Abeta clearance rate in APP/PS1 mice. Our study demonstrates a novel mechanism underlying how dysfunctions of ABCA7 contribute to the risk for AD.
27030596	Neuronal heparan sulfates promote amyloid pathology by modulating brain amyloid-beta clearance and aggregation in Alzheimer's disease.	Accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide in the brain is the first critical step in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Studies in humans suggest that Abeta clearance from the brain is frequently impaired in late-onset AD. Abeta accumulation leads to the formation of Abeta aggregates, which injure synapses and contribute to eventual neurodegeneration. Cell surface heparan sulfates (HSs), expressed on all cell types including neurons, have been implicated in several features in the pathogenesis of AD including its colocalization with amyloid plaques and modulatory role in Abeta aggregation. We show that removal of neuronal HS by conditional deletion of the Ext1 gene, which encodes an essential glycosyltransferase for HS biosynthesis, in postnatal neurons of amyloid model APP/PS1 mice led to a reduction in both Abeta oligomerization and the deposition of amyloid plaques. In vivo microdialysis experiments also detected an accelerated rate of Abeta clearance in the brain interstitial fluid, suggesting that neuronal HS either inhibited or represented an inefficient pathway for Abeta clearance. We found that the amounts of various HS proteoglycans (HSPGs) were increased in postmortem human brain tissues from AD patients, suggesting that this pathway may contribute directly to amyloid pathogenesis. Our findings have implications for AD pathogenesis and provide insight into therapeutic interventions targeting Abeta-HSPG interactions.
27030402	The Effects of Physiological and Methodological Determinants on 18F-FDG Mouse Brain Imaging Exemplified in a Double Transgenic Alzheimer Model.	INTRODUCTION: In this study, the influence of physiological determinants on 18F-fluoro-d-glucose ((18)F-FDG) brain uptake was evaluated in a mouse model of Alzheimer disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: TASTPM (Tg) and age-matched C57BL/6 J (WT) mice were fasted for 10 hours, while another group was fasted for 20 hours to evaluate the effect of fasting duration. The effect of repeatedly scanning was evaluated by scanning Tg and WT mice at days 1, 4, and 7. Brain (18)F-FDG uptake was evaluated in the thalamus being the most indicative region. Finally, the cerebellum was tested as a reference region for the relative standard uptake value (rSUV). RESULTS: When correcting the brain uptake for glucose, the effect of different fasting durations was attenuated and the anticipated hypometabolism in Tg mice was demonstrated. Also, with repeated scanning, the brain uptake values within a group and the hypometabolism of the Tg mice only remained stable over time when glucose correction was applied. Finally, hypometabolism was also observed in the cerebellum, yielding artificially higher rSUV values for Tg mice. CONCLUSION: Corrections for blood glucose levels have to be applied when semiquantifying (18)F-FDG brain uptake in mouse models for AD. Potential reference regions for normalization should be thoroughly investigated to ensure that they are not pathologically affected also by afferent connections.
