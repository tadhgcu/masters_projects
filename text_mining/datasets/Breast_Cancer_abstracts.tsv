28424130	Invasive Pleomorphic Lobular Histology Is an Adverse Prognostic Factor on Survival in Patients with Breast Cancer.	Invasive pleomorphic lobular carcinoma (IPLC) is defined to be an uncommon and different subtype of classical invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC). This special variant is characterized by significant cytological atypia and pleomorphism which differs from the cytological uniformity of ILC. IPLC has been shown to have some poor prognostic factors such as axillary node metastasis and higher histological grade which may lead to poor clinical courses including a short relapse time, increased risk of recurrence and a decreased survival. The aim of this study is to investigate the clinicopathological characteristics and prognosis of IPLC in comparison with ILC and also to evaluate if IPLC is a different clinical entity compared to ILC. A total number of 4418 breast cancer patients treated between 1996 and 2015 in Hacettepe University Cancer Institute, were retrospectively analyzed. Among 4418 patients, 210 were diagnosed with ILC and 23 patients diagnosed with pure IPLC. In this present study, clinicopathological characteristics, disease free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) of patients with ILC and IPLC were compared. This study design is one of the rare face to face comparison of pure IPLC and ILC. Patients with IPLC had an increased rate of higher histologic grade, extracapsular extension, lymphovascular invasion and lower percentage of hormone positivity than those of patients with ILC. During the follow-up time, IPLC group experienced 4 cases (17.3%) of recurrence, 5 cases (21.7%) of death and 2 cases (8.7%) of progression in 3 metastatic patients compared to that of 27 cases (12.9%) of recurrence, 29 cases (13,8%) of death and 14 cases (6.7%) of progression in 19 metastatic patients in the ILC group. Patients with IPLC had a worse DFS and OS duration than patients with ILC (P = 0.02 for OS, P = 0.04 for DFS). In conclusion, IPLC is a different and a special breast cancer subtype. This study suggests that IPLC is a distinct clinical entity with an advanced stage and more aggressive clinical course. Patients with IPLC reveal poorer prognostic factors such as higher histological grade, relative lower percentages of hormone positivity, and increased rate of recurrences resulting in poor clinical outcomes and worse survival. Nowadays, it is observed that current treatment methods for IPLC do not seem as successful as in ILC and failed to be effective. Thence, individual therapies including more aggressive surgery and adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy even in the earlier stages of breast cancer should be performed for this distinct variant.
28423035	Genetic profiling of putative breast cancer stem cells from malignant pleural effusions.	A common symptom during late stage breast cancer disease is pleural effusion, which is related to poor prognosis. Malignant cells can be detected in pleural effusions indicating metastatic spread from the primary tumor site. Pleural effusions have been shown to be a useful source for studying metastasis and for isolating cells with putative cancer stem cell (CSC) properties. For the present study, pleural effusion aspirates from 17 metastatic breast cancer patients were processed to propagate CSCs in vitro. Patient-derived aspirates were cultured under sphere forming conditions and isolated primary cultures were further sorted for cancer stem cell subpopulations ALDH1+ and CD44+CD24-/low. Additionally, sphere forming efficiency of CSC and non-CSC subpopulations was determined. In order to genetically characterize the different tumor subpopulations, DNA was isolated from pleural effusions before and after cell sorting, and compared with corresponding DNA copy number profiles from primary tumors or bone metastasis using low-coverage whole genome sequencing (SCNA-seq). In general, unsorted cells had a higher potential to form spheres when compared to CSC subpopulations. In most cases, cell sorting did not yield sufficient cells for copy number analysis. A total of five from nine analyzed unsorted pleura samples (55%) showed aberrant copy number profiles similar to the respective primary tumor. However, most sorted subpopulations showed a balanced profile indicating an insufficient amount of tumor cells and low sensitivity of the sequencing method. Finally, we were able to establish a long term cell culture from one pleural effusion sample, which was characterized in detail. In conclusion, we confirm that pleural effusions are a suitable source for enrichment of putative CSC. However, sequencing based molecular characterization is impeded due to insufficient sensitivity along with a high number of normal contaminating cells, which are masking genetic alterations of rare cancer (stem) cells.
28422972	Challenges in enumeration of CTCs in breast cancer using techniques independent of cytokeratin expression.	INTRODUCTION: Given the current postulated plasticity between epithelial and mesenchymal states of migratory cancer cells the detection of non-epithelial CTCs is an important scientific and clinical goal. METHODS: We used the filtration-based ISET technology to enrich circulating tumour cells (CTCs) in early breast cancer blood samples and identify them using a morphology-based immunocytochemistry (ICC) approach. RESULTS: We found greater numbers of putative CTCs by this approach than by the cytokeratin-based CellSearch technology, but a high number of CTC false positives were identified in healthy volunteer samples which were not reduced in successive blood draws. Preliminary work using an oestrogen receptor (ER)-based multiplex ICC method in metastatic breast cancer ISET samples indicated a low number of ER+ CTCs even at this advanced stage. CONCLUSIONS: This work highlights the challenges in enumerating CTCs without conventional epithelial markers.
28420378	A cross-sectional survey assessing factors associated with reading cancer screening information: previous screening behaviour, demographics and decision-making style.	BACKGROUND: There is broad agreement that cancer screening invitees should know the risks and benefits of testing before deciding whether to participate. In organised screening programmes, a primary method of relaying this information is via leaflets provided at the time of invitation. Little is known about why individuals do not engage with this information. This study assessed factors associated with reading information leaflets provided by the three cancer screening programmes in England. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey asked screening-eligible members of the general population in England about the following predictor variables: uptake of previous screening invitations, demographic characteristics, and 'decision-making styles' (i.e. the extent to which participants tended to make decisions in a way that was avoidant, rational, intuitive, spontaneous, or dependent). The primary outcome measures were the amount of the leaflet that participants reported having read at their most recent invitation, for any of the three programmes for which they were eligible. Associations between these outcomes and predictor variables were assessed using binary or ordinal logistic regression. RESULTS: After exclusions, data from 275, 309, and 556 participants were analysed in relation to the breast, cervical, and bowel screening programmes, respectively. Notable relationships included associations between regularity of screening uptake and reading (more of) the information leaflets for all programmes (e.g. odds ratio: 0.16 for participants who never/very rarely attended breast screening vs. those who always attended previously; p = .009). Higher rational decision-making scores were associated with reading more of the cervical and bowel screening leaflets (OR: 1.13, p < .0005 and OR: 1.11, p = .045, respectively). Information engagement was also higher for White British participants compared with other ethnic groups for breast (OR: 3.28, p = .008) and bowel (OR: 2.58, p = .015) information; an opposite relationship was observed for older participants (OR: 0.96, p = .048; OR: 0.92, p = .029). CONCLUSIONS: Interventions that increase screening uptake may also increase subsequent engagement with information. Future research could investigate how to improve engagement at initial invitations. There may also be scope to reduce barriers to accessing non-English information and alternative communication strategies may benefit participants who are less inclined to weigh up advantages and disadvantages as part of their decision-making.
28420351	Prognostic significance of TRAIL-R3 and CCR-2 expression in tumor epithelial cells of patients with early breast cancer.	BACKGROUND: Tumor epithelial cells (TEpCs) and spindle-shaped stromal cells, not associated with the vasculature, of patients with early breast cancer express osteoprotegerin (OPG), tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand, stromal cell derived factor-1, interleukin-6, macrophage colony stimulating factor, chemokine (C-C motif) ligand-2 (CCL-2) and their receptors at significantly higher levels compared with non-neoplastic breast tissues. We evaluated the clinicopathological significance of these ligands and receptors in TEpC and spindle-shaped stromal cells, not associated with the vasculature, to determine their impact on prognosis of patients with early-stage breast cancer. METHODS: We conducted immunohistochemical analyses of protein expression in primary tumors of patients with early breast cancer and analyzed their association with standard prognostic parameters and clinical outcomes, including local relapse, metastatic recurrence, disease-free survival (DFS), metastasis-free survival (MFS), and overall survival (OS). RESULTS: Elevated levels of TRAIL-R3 and chemokine (C-C motif) receptor 2 (CCR-2) in TEpCs and OPG and CCL-2 in stromal cells were significantly associated with a higher risk of metastasis (p = 0.032, p = 0.003, p = 0.038, and p = 0.049; respectively). Moreover, high expression of TRAIL-R3 and CCR-2 in TEpCs was associated with shorter DFS, MFS, and OS. High TRAIL-R3 expression in TEpCs was an independent prognostic factor for DFS and OS, and high CCR-2 expression in these cells was an independent prognostic factor for MFS. CONCLUSIONS: High levels of TRAIL-R3 and CCR-2 expression in TEpCs identified patients with early breast cancer with poor outcomes.
28418819	Cancer Genomics and Important Oncologic Mutations: A Contemporary Guide for Body Imagers.	The field of cancer genomics is rapidly evolving and has led to the development of new therapies. Knowledge of commonly involved cellular pathways and genetic mutations is now essential for radiologists reading oncology cases. Radiogenomics is an emerging area of research that seeks to correlate imaging features with cancer genotypes. Such knowledge may extend the utility of multiparametric imaging to yield information regarding cancer prognosis and likelihood of therapeutic response. To date, only a handful of radiogenomics studies have been performed to evaluate solid tumors of the body, and there is much to explore. Before doing so, however, it behooves us to have adequate background knowledge of clinical cancer genomics to design meaningful radiogenomics projects and explore imaging phenotypes. Herein, an up-to-date, detailed overview is provided of well-known and common mutations of solid body tumors (such as human epithelial growth factor receptor 2, breast cancer susceptibility protein), newer genomic alterations with potential for clinical relevance, and a discussion of known related imaging findings, including existing radiogenomics data and other radiologic patterns of disease.

28415974	Evaluation of the association between quantitative mammographic density and breast cancer occurred in different quadrants.	BACKGROUND: To investigate the relationship between mammographic density measured in four quadrants of a breast with the location of the occurred cancer. METHODS: One hundred and ten women diagnosed with unilateral breast cancer that could be determined in one specific breast quadrant were retrospectively studied. Women with previous cancer/breast surgery were excluded. The craniocaudal (CC) and mediolateral oblique (MLO) mammography of the contralateral normal breast were used to separate a breast into 4 quadrants: Upper-Outer (UO), Upper-Inner (UI), Lower-Outer (LO), and Lower-Inner (LI). The breast area (BA), dense area (DA), and percent density (PD) in each quadrant were measured by using the fuzzy-C-means segmentation. The BA, DA, and PD were compared between patients who had cancer occurring in different quadrants. RESULTS: The upper-outer quadrant had the highest BA (37 +/- 15 cm2) and DA (7.1 +/- 2.9 cm2), with PD = 20.0 +/- 5.8%. The order of BA and DA in the 4 separated quadrants were: UO > UI > LO > LI, and almost all pair-wise comparisons showed significant differences. For tumor location, 67 women (60.9%) had tumor in UO, 16 (14.5%) in UI, 7 (6.4%) in LO, and 20 (18.2%) in LI quadrant, respectively. The estimated odds and the 95% confidence limits of tumor development in the UO, UI, LO and LI quadrants were 1.56 (1.06, 2.29), 0.17 (0.10, 0.29), 0.07 (0.03, 0.15), and 0.22 (0.14, 0.36), respectively. In these 4 groups of women, the order of quadrant BA and DA were all the same (UO > UI > LO > LI), and there was no significant difference in BA, DA or PD among them (all p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Breast cancer was most likely to occur in the UO quadrant, which was also the quadrant with highest BA and DA; but for women with tumors in other quadrants, the density in that quadrant was not the highest. Therefore, there was no direct association between quadrant density and tumor occurrence.
28415963	Impact of the MDM2 splice-variants MDM2-A, MDM2-B and MDM2-C on cytotoxic stress response in breast cancer cells.	BACKGROUND: The murine double minute 2 (MDM2) is an oncogene and a negative regulator of the tumor suppressor protein p53. MDM2 is known to be amplified in numerous human cancers, and upregulation of MDM2 is considered to be an alternative mechanism of p53 inactivation. The presence of many splice variants of MDM2 has been observed in both normal tissues and malignant cells; however their impact and functional properties in response to chemotherapy treatment are not fully understood. Here, we investigate the biological effects of three widely expressed alternatively spliced variants of MDM2; MDM2-A, MDM2-B and MDM2-C, both in unstressed MCF-7 breast cancer cells and in cells subjected to chemotherapy. We assessed protein stability, subcellular localization and induction of downstream genes known to be regulated by the MDM2-network, as well as impact on cellular endpoints, such as apoptosis, cell cycle arrest and senescence. RESULTS: We found both the splice variants MDM2-B and -C, to have a much longer half-life than MDM2 full-length (FL) protein after chemotherapy treatment indicating that, under stressed conditions, the regulation of degradation of these two variants differs from that of MDM2-FL. Interestingly, we observed all three splice variants to deviate from MDM2-FL protein with respect to subcellular distribution. Furthermore, while MDM2-A and -B induced the expression of the pro-apoptotic gene PUMA, this effect did not manifest in an increased level of apoptosis. CONCLUSION: Although MDM2-B induced slight changes in the cell cycle profile, overall, we found the impact of the three MDM2 splice variants on potential cellular endpoints upon doxorubicin treatment to be limited.
28414807	Interactions between the breast cancer-associated MUC1 mucins and C-type lectin characterized by optical tweezers.	Carbohydrate-protein interactions govern many crucial processes in biological systems including cell recognition events. We have used the sensitive force probe optical tweezers to quantify the interactions occurring between MGL lectins and MUC1 carrying the cancer-associated glycan antigens mucins Tn and STn. Unbinding forces of 7.6 pN and 7.1 pN were determined for the MUC1(Tn)-MGL and MUC1(STn)-MGL interactions, at a force loading rate of ~40 pN/s. The interaction strength increased with increasing force loading rate, to 27 and 37 pN at a force loading rate of ~ 310 pN/s. No interactions were detected between MGL and MUC1(ST), a glycoform of MUC1 also expressed by breast carcinoma cells. Interestingly, this glycan (ST) can be found on proteins expressed by normal cells, although in this case not on MUC1. Additionally, GalNAc decorated polyethylene glycol displayed similar rupture forces as observed for MUC1(Tn) and MUC1(STn) when forced to unbind from MGL, indicating that GalNAc is an essential group in these interactions. Since the STn glycan decoration is more frequently found on the surface of carcinomas than the Tn glycan, the binding of MUC1 carrying STn to MGL may be more physiologically relevant and may be in part responsible for some of the characteristics of STn expressing tumours.
28412966	TFAP2A is a component of the ZEB1/2 network that regulates TGFB1-induced epithelial to mesenchymal transition.	BACKGROUND: The transition between epithelial and mesenchymal phenotypes (EMT) occurs in a variety of contexts. It is critical for mammalian development and it is also involved in tumor initiation and progression. Master transcription factor (TF) regulators of this process are conserved between mouse and human. METHODS: From a computational analysis of a variety of high-throughput sequencing data sets we initially inferred that TFAP2A is connected to the core EMT network in both species. We then analysed publicly available human breast cancer data for TFAP2A expression and also studied the expression (by mRNA sequencing), activity (by monitoring the expression of its predicted targets), and binding (by electrophoretic mobility shift assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation) of this factor in a mouse mammary gland EMT model system (NMuMG) cell line. RESULTS: We found that upon induction of EMT, the activity of TFAP2A, reflected in the expression level of its predicted targets, is up-regulated in a variety of systems, both murine and human, while TFAP2A's expression is increased in more "stem-like" cancers. We provide strong evidence for the direct interaction between the TFAP2A TF and the ZEB2 promoter and we demonstrate that this interaction affects ZEB2 expression. Overexpression of TFAP2A from an exogenous construct perturbs EMT, however, in a manner similar to the downregulation of endogenous TFAP2A that takes place during EMT. CONCLUSIONS: Our study reveals that TFAP2A is a conserved component of the core network that regulates EMT, acting as a repressor of many genes, including ZEB2. REVIEWERS: This article has been reviewed by Dr. Martijn Huynen and Dr. Nicola Aceto.
28410687	The evaluation of the feasibility of carotid sparing intensity modulated radiation therapy technique for comprehensive breast irradiation.	PURPOSE: To investigate the feasibility of carotid sparing intensity modulated radiation therapy (CS-IMRT) to minimize the radiation dose to carotid arteries for comprehensive irradiation of breast cancer patients who have risk factors for atherosclerosis. The dose distribution of CS-IMRT technique and the conventional irradiation technique were also compared. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Ten patients who were previously treated with comprehensive three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3DCRT) were selected. DICOM data were used to contour the carotid artery and to create the virtual CS-IMRT plans for each patient. 3DCRT and CS-IMRT plans were compared in terms of conformity index, homogeneity index, and the doses to organ at risk and carotid arteries. RESULTS: The homogeneity and conformity indices were better with CS-IMRT plans compared to 3DCRT plan. The homogeneity index was 1.13 vs 1.11 (p=0.007) for 3DCRT and CS-IMRT and the conformity index was 0.96 vs 0.97 (p=0.006) for 3DCRT and CS-IMRT. The radiation dose to the carotid arteries were reduced by applying CS-IMRT without compromising the target volume coverage. When the carotid artery was considered as organ at risk for CS-IMRT planning, the median of V50 was decreased to 0% from 12.5% compared to 3DCRT plans (p=0.017). The median of the maximum dose to the carotid artery was decreased under 50Gy with CS-IMRT. CONCLUSIONS: CS-IMRT can significantly reduce the unnecessary radiation dose to the carotid arteries compared with conventional 3DCRT technique while maintaining target volume coverage. CS-IMRT technique can be considered for breast cancer patient with high risk of atherosclerosis.
28410616	Breast masses in mammography classification with local contour features.	BACKGROUND: Mammography is one of the most popular tools for early detection of breast cancer. Contour of breast mass in mammography is very important information to distinguish benign and malignant mass. Contour of benign mass is smooth and round or oval, while malignant mass has irregular shape and spiculated contour. Several studies have shown that 1D signature translated from 2D contour can describe the contour features well. METHODS: In this paper, we propose a new method to translate 2D contour of breast mass in mammography into 1D signature. The method can describe not only the contour features but also the regularity of breast mass. Then we segment the whole 1D signature into different subsections. We extract four local features including a new contour descriptor from the subsections. The new contour descriptor is root mean square (RMS) slope. It can describe the roughness of the contour. KNN, SVM and ANN classifier are used to classify benign breast mass and malignant mass. RESULTS: The proposed method is tested on a set with 323 contours including 143 benign masses and 180 malignant ones from digital database of screening mammography (DDSM). The best accuracy of classification is 99.66% using the feature of root mean square slope with SVM classifier. CONCLUSION: The performance of the proposed method is better than traditional method. In addition, RMS slope is an effective feature comparable to most of the existing features.
28410587	Overview of cancer incidence and mortality among people living with HIV/AIDS in British Columbia, Canada: Implications for HAART use and NADM development.	BACKGROUND: The objective of this study is to evaluate the incidence of non-AIDS defining malignancies (NADMs) among people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) in British Columbia, focusing on clinical correlates, highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) use, and survival, in order to elucidate mechanisms for NADM development. METHODS: A retrospective population based analysis was carried out for individuals with HIV/AIDS that began their treatment between 1996 and 2008. RESULTS: There were 145 (2.95%) NADMs and 123 (2.50%) AIDS defining malignancies (ADMs) identified in 4918 PLWHA in the study population. NADMs were represented by a range of cancer types including, most commonly, lung cancer, followed by anal, breast, head/neck, prostate, liver, rectal, and renal cancers. PLWHA had a SIR of 2.05 (CI:1.73, 2.41) for the development of NADMs compared to individuals without an HIV/AIDS diagnosis in the general population. Independent factors significantly associated with a NADM were: male gender, older age, lower CD4 cell counts, previous NADM, absence of HAART (non-HAART versus HAART) and treatment during the early-HAART era (before 2000 versus after 2000). CONCLUSIONS: NADMs represent an important source of morbidity for PLWHA. Use of HAART with its associated improvement in immune-restoration, and tailored targeted cancer screening interventions, may be beneficial and improve outcomes in this unique patient population.
28407998	A Cost-Effectiveness Evaluation of Germline BRCA1 and BRCA2 Testing in UK Women with Ovarian Cancer.	OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the long-term cost-effectiveness of germline BRCA1 and BRCA2 (collectively termed "BRCA") testing in women with epithelial ovarian cancer, and testing for the relevant mutation in first- and second-degree relatives of BRCA mutation-positive individuals, compared with no testing. Female BRCA mutation-positive relatives of patients with ovarian cancer could undergo risk-reducing mastectomy and/or bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. METHODS: A cost-effectiveness model was developed that included the risks of breast and ovarian cancer; the costs, utilities, and effects of risk-reducing surgery on cancer rates; and the costs, utilities, and mortality rates associated with cancer. RESULTS: BRCA testing of all women with epithelial ovarian cancer each year is cost-effective at a UK willingness-to-pay threshold of pound20,000/quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) compared with no testing, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of pound4,339/QALY. The result was primarily driven by fewer cases of breast cancer (142) and ovarian cancer (141) and associated reductions in mortality (77 fewer deaths) in relatives over the subsequent 50 years. Sensitivity analyses showed that the results were robust to variations in the input parameters. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that the probability of germline BRCA mutation testing being cost-effective at a threshold of pound20,000/QALY was 99.9%. CONCLUSIONS: Implementing germline BRCA testing in all patients with ovarian cancer would be cost-effective in the United Kingdom. The consequent reduction in future cases of breast and ovarian cancer in relatives of mutation-positive individuals would ease the burden of cancer treatments in subsequent years and result in significantly better outcomes and reduced mortality rates for these individuals.
28407996	A Multigene Test Could Cost-Effectively Help Extend Life Expectancy for Women at Risk of Hereditary Breast Cancer.	BACKGROUND: The National Comprehensive Cancer Network recommends that women who carry gene variants that confer substantial risk for breast cancer consider risk-reduction strategies, that is, enhanced surveillance (breast magnetic resonance imaging and mammography) or prophylactic surgery. Pathogenic variants can be detected in women with a family history of breast or ovarian cancer syndromes by multigene panel testing. OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether using a seven-gene test to identify women who should consider risk-reduction strategies could cost-effectively increase life expectancy. METHODS: We estimated effectiveness and lifetime costs from a payer perspective for two strategies in two hypothetical cohorts of women (40-year-old and 50-year-old cohorts) who meet the National Comprehensive Cancer Network-defined family history criteria for multigene testing. The two strategies were the usual test strategy for variants in BRCA1 and BRCA2 and the seven-gene test strategy for variants in BRCA1, BRCA2, TP53, PTEN, CDH1, STK11, and PALB2. Women found to have a pathogenic variant were assumed to undergo either prophylactic surgery or enhanced surveillance. RESULTS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for the seven-gene test strategy compared with the BRCA1/2 test strategy was $42,067 per life-year gained or $69,920 per quality-adjusted life-year gained for the 50-year-old cohort and $23,734 per life-year gained or $48,328 per quality-adjusted life-year gained for the 40-year-old cohort. In probabilistic sensitivity analysis, the seven-gene test strategy cost less than $100,000 per life-year gained in 95.7% of the trials for the 50-year-old cohort. CONCLUSIONS: Testing seven breast cancer-associated genes, followed by risk-reduction management, could cost-effectively improve life expectancy for women at risk of hereditary breast cancer.
28407011	Anthracyclines induce early changes in left ventricular systolic and diastolic function: A single centre study.	AIMS: 2 dimensional (2D) strain analysis detects subclinical left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction. Our aim was to evaluate changes in LV systolic and diastolic function in breast cancer patients early after anthracycline chemotherapy, and to identify predisposing factors. METHODS AND RESULTS: 140 patients were assessed by detailed echocardiography before and within seven days post treatment. LV ejection fraction (LVEF), global longitudinal strain (GLS), strain rate and radial and circumferential strain were assessed. Additionally, left atrial volumes and LV diastolic parameters were evaluated. LVEF although reduced after treatment, remained within the normal range (60+/-3% vs. 59+/-3%, p = 0.04). Triplane GLS was significantly reduced after treatment (-20.0+/-1.6% vs. -19.1+/-1.8%, p<0.001). Subclinical LV dysfunction (>11% reduction in GLS compared to before therapy) occurred in 22% (29/135). Impaired diastolic function grade significantly increased from 46% to 57% (p<0.001) after treatment. Furthermore, diastolic dysfunction was more common in the subgroup group with reduced systolic GLS compared to those without changes in GLS (30% vs. 11%; p = 0.04). No risk factors or clinical parameters were associated with the development of subclinical LV dysfunction; however the percentage change in early diastolic strain rate and the E velocity were independent predictors of >11% reduction in GLS. CONCLUSION: Twenty two percent of patients had subclinical LV dysfunction by GLS, whilst none had cardiotoxicity defined by LVEF, demonstrating that GLS is more sensitive for detection of subclinical LV systolic dysfunction immediately after anthracycline therapy. Diastolic dysfunction increased, particularly in the group with reduced GLS, demonstrating the close pathophysiological relationship between systolic and diastolic function.
28406988	Peptide probes derived from pertuzumab by molecular dynamics modeling for HER2 positive tumor imaging.	A high level of HER2 expression in breast cancer correlates with a higher tumor growth rate, high metastatic potential, and a poor long-term patient survival rate. Pertuzumab, a human monoclonal antibody, can reduce the effect of HER2 overexpression by preventing HER2 dimerization. In this study, a combination protocol of molecular dynamics modeling and MM/GBSA binding free energy calculations was applied to design peptides that interact with HER2 based on the HER2/pertuzumab crystal structure. Based on a beta hairpin in pertuzumab from Glu46 to Lys65-which plays a key role in interacting with HER2-mutations were carried out in silico to improve the binding free energy of the hairpin that interacts with the Phe256-Lys314 of the HER2 protein. Combined the use of one-bead-one-compound library screening, among all the mutations, a peptide (58F63Y) with the lowest binding free energy was confirmed experimentally to have the highest affinity, and it may be used as a new probe in diagnosing and treating HER2-positive breast cancer.
28404630	miR-424(322)/503 is a breast cancer tumor suppressor whose loss promotes resistance to chemotherapy.	The female mammary gland is a very dynamic organ that undergoes continuous tissue remodeling during adulthood. Although it is well established that the number of menstrual cycles and pregnancy (in this case transiently) increase the risk of breast cancer, the reasons are unclear. Growing clinical and experimental evidence indicates that improper involution plays a role in the development of this malignancy. Recently, we described the miR-424(322)/503 cluster as an important regulator of mammary epithelial involution after pregnancy. Here, through the analysis of approximately 3000 primary tumors, we show that miR-424(322)/503 is commonly lost in a subset of aggressive breast cancers and describe the genetic aberrations that inactivate its expression. Furthermore, through the use of a knockout mouse model, we demonstrate for the first time that loss of miR-424(322)/503 promotes breast tumorigenesis in vivo. Remarkably, we found that loss of miR-424(322)/503 promotes chemoresistance due to the up-regulation of two of its targets: BCL-2 and insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF1R). Importantly, targeted therapies blocking the aberrant activity of these targets restore sensitivity to chemotherapy. Overall, our studies reveal miR-424(322)/503 as a tumor suppressor in breast cancer and provide a link between mammary epithelial involution, tumorigenesis, and the phenomenon of chemoresistance.
28403116	Influence of occupation and education level on breast cancer stage at diagnosis, and treatment options in China: A nationwide, multicenter 10-year epidemiological study.	The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of occupation and education level of Chinese female breast cancer patients on their cancer staging at diagnosis, clinical and pathological features, rate of implementation, and selection of treatment.The medical charts of 4211 confirmed female breast cancer cases diagnosed between 1999 and 2008, from 7 breast cancer centers spread across the whole of China, were reviewed. Data including information on the patient's sociodemographic status, clinical and pathological characteristics, implementation of clinical examination and treatment modalities were analyzed. In parallel, the associations between different occupations and level of educational attainment were analyzed in relation to tumor stage through TNM staging, clinical and pathological characteristics, implementation of clinical examination, and treatment patterns. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify whether the occupation and education level of patients are independent factors of TNM staging at diagnosis.There were significant differences among different occupation groups and the education level of patients in regards to pathological characteristics and treatment choice. Both the occupation and education level of patients were independent factors of TNM staging at diagnosis. For patients within the lower-income occupation or lower educational attainment group, the tumor stage was later, the rates of implementation of relevant investigations were lower, as were the rates of radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and endocrine therapy.This study suggests that strategies should work toward developing more accurate and effective breast cancer prevention and treatment strategies aimed specifically at patients with lower educational attainment levels and at specific occupation groups.
28403086	A case report of apatinib in treating osteosarcoma with pulmonary metastases.	RATIONALE: Osteosarcoma is the most common malignant bone tumor in children and adolescents. Pulmonary metastases lead to a significantly increased risk of death. Apatinib, a new potent oral small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor targeting the intracellular domain of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR-2), shows survival benefits in treating advanced or metastatic gastric adenocarcinoma, non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer and metastatic breast cancer. However, its efficacy in metastatic osteosarcoma has not been reported yet. PATIENT CONCERNS: Herein, we presented a 50-year-old man patient who visited hospital due to local bone pain in the left leg. DIAGNOSES: He was initially diagnosed with osteoblastic osteosarcoma. INTERVENTIONS: The patient suffered repeated resection surgeries but developed multiple lung metastases. Positive staining for CD31, CD34, and VEGFR-2 were detected in the tumor section. As he refused to receive chemotherapy due to concerns regarding the chemotherapy toxicities and sorafenib due to high cost, apatinib was given at a dose of 500 mg daily. OUTCOMES: Eleven months following apatinib administration, the patient achieved a partial response according to the RECIST 1.1 standard. No severe toxicity or drug-related side effect was observed during the treatment. LESSONS: Therefore, apatinib could be a new option for the treatment of metastatic osteosarcoma. Clinical trials are required to further confirm the efficacy and safety of apatinib in treating pulmonary metastases from osteosarcoma.
28403069	Using a pedicle pectoralis major musculocutaneous flap in head and neck reconstruction after modified radical mastectomy: A case report.	RATIONALE: A pedicle pectoralis major musculocutaneous (PMMC) flap is one of the strategies for head and neck reconstruction. Seldom studies reported the case in which the skin area of previous modified radical mastectomy (MRM) had been used as a PMMC flap in head and neck reconstruction. PATIENT CONCERNS: An 84-year-old female who had suffered from left breast cancer and undergone a left modified radical mastectomy (MRM) more than 20 years earlier. DIAGNOSES: She had squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue and had undergone partial glossection and left modified radial neck dissection. Four months later, a left submandibular mass was noted with progressive enlargement and the biopsy revealed recurrent carcinoma. INTERVENTIONS: Left marginal mandibulectomy with radical neck dissection was performed and the neck area was reconstructed by a left pedicle PMMC flap harvested from the left chest wall which had the previous MRM scar. OUTCOMES: The post-operative course was uneventful with complete survival of the flap. The patient received post-operative adjuvant radiotherapy at the left neck and no delayed wound disruption or flap necrosis was noted six months after surgery. LESSONS: A pedicle PMMC flap may be harvested to achieve a functionally as well as an aesthetically pleasing outcome without compromising its viability despite the previous MRM.
28402860	IDH1 Mutation Promotes Tumorigenesis by Inhibiting JNK Activation and Apoptosis Induced by Serum Starvation.	Two hallmarks of cancer cells are their resistance to apoptosis and ability to thrive despite reduced levels of vital serum components. c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activation is crucial for apoptosis triggered by serum starvation (SS), and isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) mutations are tumorigenic, in part, because they produce the abnormal metabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG). However, it is unknown whether 2-HG-induced tumorigenesis is partially due to JNK inhibition and thus defective SS-induced apoptosis. We show here, using IDH1-R132Q knockin mutant mouse cells, that 2-HG inhibits JNK activation induced only by SS and not by UV or doxorubicin, and thus can block apoptosis. Upon SS, Cdc42 normally disrupts mixed lineage kinase 3's (MLK3's) auto-inhibition, triggering the MLK3-MKK4/7-JNK-Bim apoptotic cascade. 2-HG binds to Cdc42 and abolishes its association with MLK3, inactivating MLK3 and apoptosis. Allograft tumor assays in mice demonstrate that this mechanism contributes to tumorigenesis driven by mutant IDH1, a result confirmed by detection of JNK inactivation in human gliomas harboring IDH1-R132H mutations.
28393315	Identification and characterization of biomarkers and their functions for Lapatinib-resistant breast cancer.	Lapatinib, a novel oral dual tyrosine kinase inhibitor blocking HER1 and HER2 pathways, has presented beneficial effects on breast cancer with positive HER2. However, its efficacy is largely limited by the occurrence of acquired drug resistance. In this study, we aimed to explore the underlying molecular mechanisms of Lapatinib resistance using bioinformatics strategies. The gene expression profile of SKBR3-R (acquired Lapatinib-resistant) and SKBR3 (Lapatinib-sensitive) cell line was downloaded from gene expression omnibus database. Then, the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were selected using dChip software. Furthermore, gene ontology (GO) and pathway enrichment analyses were carried out by using DAVID database. Finally, the protein-protein interaction network was constructed, and the hub genes in the network were analyzed by using STRING database. A total of 300 DEGs, such as HSPA5, MAP1LC3A and RASSF2, were screened out. GO functional enrichment analysis showed that the genes were associated with cell membrane component-related, stimulus-related and binding-related items. KEGG pathway analysis indicated that three dysfunctional pathways, including PPAR signaling pathway, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction and pathways in cancer, were enriched. Protein-protein interaction network construction revealed that some hub genes, such as PPARG, TGFBI, TGFBR2, TIMP1, CTGF, UBA52 and JUN, might have an association with Lapatinib resistance. The present study offered new insights into the molecular mechanisms of Lapatinib resistance and identified a series of important hub genes that have the potential to be the targets for treatment of Lapatinib-resistant breast cancer.
28383433	Aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 (ALDH1) expression is an independent prognostic factor in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC).	Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a subset of breast cancer that is highly aggressive and has a poor prognosis. Meanwhile, cancer stem cells (CSCs) are also characterized by a strong tumorigenic potential, which might be partly responsible for the aggressive behavior of TNBC. We previously showed that CSCs are enriched in TNBC cell lines and tissues. Further experiments in animal models revealed higher tumorigenicity of CSCs sorted from TNBC cell lines. In this study, we aimed to determine the clinical relationship between CSCs and TNBC by exploring the expression of aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 (ALDH1), which is a putative marker of breast CSCs, in TNBC tissues.ALDH1 levels in paraffin-embedded tumor tissues from 158 TNBC patients were evaluated by immunohistochemistry staining using an ALDH1A1 primary antibody. Staining evaluation was performed independently by two pathologists, and the expression level of ALDH1 was evaluated in terms of the percentage and intensity of positive cells. The association of immunohistochemistry staining of ALDH1 expression with clinical parameters was also analyzed.ALDH1 expression in tumor cells was observed in 88 out of 158 cases (55.7%). Analysis of clinicopathological parameters showed that the immunohistochemistry staining of ALDH1 was significantly correlated with tumor size (P = 0.02) and stage (P = 0.04). Survival analysis in patients with ALDH1 expression demonstrated shorter relapse-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) times (P = 0.01; P = 0.001). Moreover, Cox multivariate analysis revealed that ALDH1 expression was an independent prognostic indicator of RFS and OS (P = 0.04; P = 0.04).Immunohistochemistry staining of ALDH1 in tumor cells is an independent prognostic indicator of RFS and OS in TNBC patients.
28383279	Accuracy of diffusion kurtosis imaging in characterization of breast lesions.	OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of diffusion kurtosis in the characterization and differentiation of breast lesions. METHODS: 49 females with 53 breast lesions underwent breast MRI. The MRI magnetic field is 1.5 T, and the protocol is standard MRI sequences, dynamic sequences pre- and post-contrast agent administration and diffusion images. Diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) was applied as part of our standard breast MRIota protocol. Two experienced radiologists on breast MRI, blinded to the final diagnosis, reviewed the parametric maps and placed a volume of interest on all slices including each lesion. Kurtosis [K apparent (Kapp)] and corrected apparent diffusion coefficient [D apparent (Dapp)] median values were then calculated from the whole-lesion histogram analysis. Receiver-operating characteristic analysis was used to determine the most effective cut-off values for the differentiation between benign and malignant pathologies. Histological analysis of the breast lesions was performed, and further comparative analysis of the results was performed to investigate the accuracy of the method. RESULTS: Benign (n = 19) and malignant lesions (n = 34) had mean diameters of 20.8 mm (10.1-31.5 mm) and 26.4 mm (10.5-42.3 mm), respectively. The lowest and the highest kurtosis values (Kapp) of malignant lesions were significantly higher than those of benign lesions. A cut-off of 0.71 provided specificity of 93.7% and sensitivity 97.1%, and the area under the curve (AUC) was 0.976 (p < 0.0001). The lowest and the highest Dapp values of malignant lesions were lower than those of benign lesions. A cut-off value of 1.57 x 10-3 mm2 s-1 provided specificity of 93.7% and sensitivity of 91.2% with AUC of 0.949 (p < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: DKI is an accurate additional tool for the characterization and differentiation of breast lesions with high Kapp and Dapp sensitivity and specificity rates. Advances in knowledge: DKI is able to distinguish benign from malignant breast pathologies. DKI increases the specificity of breast MRI.
28382476	Regulation of matrix stiffness on the epithelial-mesenchymal transition of breast cancer cells under hypoxia environment.	Substrate stiffness and hypoxia are associated with tumor development and progression, respectively. However, the synergy of them on the biological behavior of human breast cancer cell is still largely unknown. This study explored how substrate stiffness regulates the cell phenotype, viability, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of human breast cancer cells MCF-7 under hypoxia (1% O2). TRITC-phalloidin staining showed that MCF-7 cells transformed from round to irregular polygon with stiffness increase either in normoxia or hypoxia. While being accompanied with the upward tendency from a 0.5- to a 20-kPa substrate, the percentage of cell apoptosis was significantly higher in hypoxia than that in normoxia, especially on the 20-kPa substrate. Additionally, it was hypoxia, but not normoxia, that promoted the EMT of MCF-7 by upregulating hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha), vimentin, Snail 1, and matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP 2) and 9 (MMP 9), and downregulating E-cadherin simultaneously regardless of the change of substrate stiffness. In summary, this study discovered that hypoxia and stiffer substrate (20 kPa) could synergistically induce phenotype change, apoptosis, and EMT of MCF-7 cells. Results of this study have an important significance on further exploring the synergistic effect of stiffness and hypoxia on the EMT of breast cancer cells and its molecular mechanism.
28381193	Gene promoter methylation and protein expression of BRMS1 in uterine cervix in relation to high-risk human papilloma virus infection and cancer.	Cervical cancer is strongly related to certain high-risk types of human papilloma virus infection. Breast cancer metastasis suppressor 1 (BRMS1) is a tumor suppressor gene, its expression being regulated by DNA promoter methylation in several types of cancers. This study aims to evaluate the methylation status of BRMS1 promoter in relation to high-risk types of human papilloma virus infection and the development of pre-cancerous lesions and describe the pattern of BRMS1 protein expression in normal, high-risk types of human papilloma virus-infected pre-cancerous and malignant cervical epithelium. We compared the methylation status of BRMS1 in cervical smears of 64 women with no infection by high-risk types of human papilloma virus to 70 women with proven high-risk types of human papilloma virus infection, using real-time methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction. The expression of BRMS1 protein was described by immunohistochemistry in biopsies from cervical cancer, pre-cancerous lesions, and normal cervices. Methylation of BRMS1 promoter was detected in 37.5% of women with no high-risk types of human papilloma virus infection and was less frequent in smears with high-risk types of human papilloma virus (11.4%) and in women with pathological histology (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia) (11.9%). Methylation was detected also in HeLa cervical cancer cells. Immunohistochemistry revealed nuclear BRMS1 protein staining in normal high-risk types of human papilloma virus-free cervix, in cervical intraepithelial neoplasias, and in malignant tissues, where staining was occasionally also cytoplasmic. In cancer, expression was stronger in the more differentiated cancer blasts. In conclusion, BRMS1 promoter methylation and aberrant protein expression seem to be related to high-risk types of human papilloma virus-induced carcinogenesis in uterine cervix and is worthy of further investigation.
28381188	Elevated expression of protein arginine methyltransferase 5 predicts the poor prognosis of breast cancer.	Protein arginine methyltransferase 5 is one of the type II protein arginine methyltransferase family members that can symmetrically dimethylate arginine residues on target proteins in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus. Protein arginine methyltransferase 5 was reported to be an oncoprotein that participates in tumor progression through both epigenetic silencing and organelle biogenesis. So far, it has been implicated in various cancers, but its expression pattern in breast cancer has not been elucidated thoroughly. We analyzed the protein arginine methyltransferase 5 expression patterns in several breast cancer samples and tissue arrays to better characterize its contribution to breast cancer. Primary breast tumors showed increased protein arginine methyltransferase 5 expression compared with adjacent normal tissues in both the fresh tissue samples and tissue arrays. Also, there was a tendency that metastatic lymph nodes demonstrated enhanced protein arginine methyltransferase 5 expression compared to primary sites. Moreover, we found a significant correlation between protein arginine methyltransferase 5 and Ki-67, with higher Ki-67 and protein arginine methyltransferase 5 expressions in primary breast tumors compared with normal breast tissues. Moreover, the Cancer Genome Atlas cohort analysis revealed that high protein arginine methyltransferase 5 messenger RNA expression was associated with an unfavorable prognosis in human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2) positive and triple negative breast cancer patients. Finally, the roles and mechanisms of protein arginine methyltransferase 5 in the proliferation, cell cycle progression, and apoptosis of MDA-MB-231 cells were assessed using protein arginine methyltransferase 5 and shPRMT5 transfection. In conclusion, we proposed that protein arginine methyltransferase 5 is an independent prognostic biomarker for breast cancer, and targeting protein arginine methyltransferase 5 might be a promising strategy for breast cancer treatment.
28381187	Expression of tripartite motif-containing protein 28 in primary breast carcinoma predicts metastasis and is involved in the stemness, chemoresistance, and tumor growth.	The prediction of who develops metastasis has been the most difficult aspect in the management of breast cancer patients. The lymph node metastasis has been the most useful predictor of prognosis and patient management. However, a good proportion of patients with lymph node positivity remain disease free for 5 years or more, while about a third of those who were lymph node negative develop distant metastasis within the same period. This warrants a robust biomarker(s), preferably gene expression based. In order to elucidate gene-based biomarkers for prognosis of breast cancers, gene expression profiling of primary tumors and follow-up for over 5 years has been performed. The analysis revealed a network of genes centered around the tripartite motif-containing protein 28 as an important indicator of disease progression. Short hairpin RNA-mediated knockdown of tripartite motif-containing protein 28 in breast cancer cells revealed a decreased expression of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition markers and increased expression of epithelial markers, decreased migration and invasion, and increased chemosensitivity to doxorubicin, 5-fluorouracil, and methotrexate. Furthermore, knockdown of tripartite motif-containing protein 28 resulted in the decrease of stemness as revealed by sphere formation assay as well as decreased expression of CD44 and Bmi1. Moreover, tripartite motif-containing protein 28 knockdown significantly reduced the tumor size and lung metastasis in orthotopic tumor xenograft assay in immunocompromised mice. The tumor size was further reduced when these mice were treated with doxorubicin. These data provide evidence for tripartite motif-containing protein 28 as a biomarker and a potential therapeutic target for breast cancer.
28381183	Expression of claudin 1, claudin 4, and claudin 7 in colorectal cancer and its relation with CLDN DNA methylation patterns.	Altered claudin expression has been described in colon, prostatic, ovarian, and breast carcinoma. However, the role of epigenetic modifications in these genes and their role in colorectal cancer is unknown. We aimed our study to investigate whether claudin protein expression and methylation of CLDN can influence the tumorigenesis of colorectal cancer. A total of 31 patients diagnosed with colorectal carcinoma was used in this study. Immunohistochemical staining was used to study protein expression in both tumor and the adjacent nonneoplastic mucosa of claudin 1, 4, and 7. To detect the DNA methylation pattern of CLDN1, 4, and 7, genomic DNA was extracted from both the tumor and the adjacent nonneoplastic mucosa. Methylation analysis was carried out using bisulfite pyrosequencing. Cell membrane staining intensity of all claudins was found significantly lower in colorectal cancer tissues when compared to paired normal mucosa (p </= 0.001). For claudin 4, the percentage of cells staining positively was also significantly reduced (p = 0.04). In normal mucosa, cytoplasm showed no staining for claudins in any patient, whereas in paired colorectal cancer tissues, significant cytoplasmic staining appeared both for claudin 1 (p = 0.04) and claudin 4 (p = 0.01). Tumor samples were significantly hypomethylated in CLDN1 (p < 0.05). In conclusion, our results show that CLDN1 is significantly hypomethylated in tumor samples and that the membrane staining intensity for claudin 1, 4, and 7 is significantly lower in colorectal cancer tissues than in adjacent nonneoplastic tissue. Colorectal cancer cells showed dystopic cytoplasmic location of claudins.
28381172	The effects and mechanisms of SLC34A2 on maintaining stem cell-like phenotypes in CD147+ breast cancer stem cells.	The cancer stem cell (CSC) hypothesis has gained significant recognition in describing tumorigenesis. Identification of the factors critical to development of breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs) may provide insight into the improvement of effective therapies against breast cancer. In this study, we aim to investigate the biological function of SLC34A2 in affecting the stem cell-like phenotypes in BCSCs and its underlying mechanisms. We demonstrated that CD147+ cells from breast cancer tissue samples and cell lines possessed BCSC-like features, including the ability of self-renewal in vitro, differentiation, and tumorigenic potential in vivo. Flow cytometry analysis showed the presence of a variable fraction of CD147+ cells in 9 of 10 tumor samples. Significantly, SLC34A2 expression in CD147+ BCSCs was enhanced compared with that in differentiated adherent progeny of CD147+ BCSCs and adherently cultured cell line cells. In breast cancer patient cohorts, SLC34A2 expression was found increased in 9 of 10 tumor samples. By using lentiviral-based approach, si-SLC34A2-transduced CD147+ BCSCs showed decreased ability of sphere formation, cell viability in vitro, and tumorigenicity in vivo, which suggested the essential role of SLC34A2 in CD147+ BCSCs. Furthermore, PI3K/AKT pathway and SOX2 were found necessary to maintain the stemness of CD147+ BCSCs by using LY294002 or lentiviral-si-SOX2. Finally, we indicated that SLC34A2 could regulate SOX2 to maintain the stem cell-like features in CD147+ BCSCs through PI3K/AKT pathway. Therefore, our report identifies a novel role of SLC34A2 in BCSCs' state regulation and establishes a rationale for targeting the SLC34A2/PI3K/AKT/SOX2 signaling pathway for breast cancer therapy.
28381169	The role of sphingosine-1-phosphate in the tumor microenvironment and its clinical implications.	Elucidating the interaction between cancer and non-cancer cells, such as blood vessels, immune cells, and other stromal cells, in the tumor microenvironment is imperative in understanding the mechanisms underlying cancer progression and metastasis, which is expected to lead to the development of new therapeutics. Sphingosine-1-phosphate is a bioactive lipid mediator that promotes cell survival, proliferation, migration, angiogenesis/lymphangiogenesis, and immune responsiveness, which are all factors involved in cancer progression. Sphingosine-1-phosphate is generated inside cancer cells by sphingosine kinases and then exported into the tumor microenvironment. Although sphingosine-1-phosphate is anticipated to play an important role in the tumor microenvironment and cancer progression, determining sphingosine-1-phosphate levels in the tumor microenvironment has been difficult due to a lack of established methods. We have recently developed a method to measure sphingosine-1-phosphate levels in the interstitial fluid that bathes cancer cells in the tumor microenvironment, and reported that high levels of sphingosine-1-phosphate exist in the tumor interstitial fluid. Importantly, sphingosine-1-phosphate can be secreted from cancer cells and non-cancer components such as immune cells and vascular/lymphatic endothelial cells in the tumor microenvironment. Furthermore, sphingosine-1-phosphate affects both cancer and non-cancer cells in the tumor microenvironment promoting cancer progression. Here, we review the roles of sphingosine-1-phosphate in the interaction between cancer and non-cancer cells in tumor microenvironment, and discuss future possibilities for targeted therapies against sphingosine-1-phosphate signaling for cancer patients.
28381157	Repressor activator protein 1-promoted colorectal cell migration is associated with the regulation of Vimentin.	Repressor activator protein 1 plays important roles in telomere protection, while repressor activator protein 1 binds to extra-telomeric DNA and exerts the function as a transcriptional regulator. Previous study showed that repressor activator protein 1 regulates the transcriptional activity of nuclear factor-kappaB, and it was highly expressed in breast cancer tissues; however, the clinical significance of repressor activator protein 1 expression in cancer remains to be elucidated. In this study, we discovered that repressor activator protein 1 was highly expressed in colorectal cancer tissues. High expression of repressor activator protein 1 was significantly correlated with poor prognosis and distant metastasis. Knockdown of repressor activator protein 1 in colorectal cancer cells did not affect cell proliferation or colony formation, but dramatically decreased cell migration and F-actin-enriched membrane protrusions. Microarray screening revealed that Vimentin was downregulated after repressor activator protein 1 knockdown, which was validated by analysis of a colorectal cancer dataset. Furthermore, knockdown of Vimentin attenuated repressor activator protein 1-enhanced cell migration. Thus, our study suggests that repressor activator protein 1 is a prognostic marker and a potential target for colorectal cancer therapy.
28378641	Downregulation of PRDM1 promotes cellular invasion and lung cancer metastasis.	The zinc-finger transcription factor PRDM1 (PR domain containing 1) plays key roles in the development of malignant lymphoma, leukaemia and some non-haematopoietic cancers, including breast cancer, colorectal cancer and glioma. However, little is known regarding the function of PRDM1 in the progression of lung cancer. Here, we found that PRDM1 is expressed in normal human lung epithelium but is downregulated in lung cancer cells. Decreased expression of PRDM1 correlates with poor prognosis in lung cancer. Depletion of PRDM1 in lung cancer cells promotes cellular invasion and anoikis resistance in vitro and lung metastasis in vivo. PRDM1 is silenced by an ectopically expressed lymphocyte-specific transcription factor Aiolos. The transcription of these two genes is negatively correlated in 206 lung epithelial cell lines. Our results indicate that PRDM1 functions as a tumour suppressor in lung cancer.
28378631	Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and breast cancer: Beyond the prognostic and predictive utility.	The importance of the immune system as a potent anti-tumor defense has been consolidated in recent times, and novel immune-related therapies are today demonstrating a strong clinical benefit in the setting of several solid neoplasms. Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes reflect the attempt of the host to eradicate malignancies, and during the last decades, they have been shown to possess an interesting prognostic utility for breast cancer, especially in case of HER2 positive and triple-negative molecular subtypes. In parallel, the clinical evaluation of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes has been shown to effectively predict treatment outcomes in both neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings. Currently, tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes are promising further predictive utility in view of novel immune-related therapeutic strategies which are coming into the clinical setting launching a solid rationale for the future next-generation treatment options. In this scenario, tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes might represent an important resource for the selection of the most appropriate therapeutic strategy, as well as further evaluations of the molecular mechanisms underlying tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and the immunoediting process would eventually provide new insights to augment therapeutic success. Considering these perspectives, we review the potential utility of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in the definition of breast cancer prognosis and in the prediction of treatment outcomes, along with the new promising molecular-based therapeutic discoveries.
28377926	Platinum-Based Drugs Differentially Affect the Ultrastructure of Breast Cancer Cell Types.	Breast cancer (BC) is the most common cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Although platinum-based drugs (PBDs) are effective anticancer agents, responsive patients eventually become resistant. While resistance of some cancers to PBDs has been explored, the cellular responses of BC cells are not studied yet. Therefore, we aim to assess the differential effects of PBDs on BC ultrastructure. Three representative cells were treated with different concentrations and timing of Cisplatin, Carboplatin, and Oxaliplatin. Changes on cell surface and ultrastructure were detected by scanning (SEM) and transmission electron microscope (TEM). In SEM, control cells were semiflattened containing microvilli with extending lamellipodia while treated ones were round with irregular surface and several pores, indicating drug entry. Prolonged treatment resembled distinct apoptotic features such as shrinkage, membrane blebs, and narrowing of lamellipodia with blunt microvilli. TEM detected PBDs' deposits that scattered among cellular organelles inducing structural distortion, lumen swelling, chromatin condensation, and nuclear fragmentation. Deposits were attracted to fat droplets, explained by drug hydrophobic properties, while later they were located close to cell membrane, suggesting drug efflux. Phagosomes with destructed organelles and deposits were detected as defending mechanism. Understanding BC cells response to PBDs might provide new insight for an effective treatment.
28375433	Breast Tumor Resembling Tall Cell Variant of Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma: A Solid Papillary Neoplasm With Characteristic Immunohistochemical Profile and Few Recurrent Mutations.	Objectives: Breast tumor resembling tall cell variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma (BTRPTC) is a rare breast lesion that is unrelated to thyroid carcinoma. Morphologically, it shows a solid papillary lesion with bland cytology, eosinophilic/amphophilic secretions, nuclear grooves, reversal of nuclear polarity (recently described), and nuclear inclusions. Clinical course is often uneventful with few exceptions reported in the literature. Herein, we report three additional cases. Methods: Immunohistochemical staining and next-generation sequencing was performed on all three cases. Results: The lesional cells on all cases were positive for cytokeratin 5 and S100, with weak expression/lack of estrogen receptor. No staining was observed for myoepithelial markers (p63 and myosin heavy chain) around the lesion. IDH2 mutations were identified in two cases at nucleotide 172 (cases 1 and 3). ATM gene mutation was identified in cases 2 and 3 and PIK3CA mutation in case 3. All patients are currently without disease. Conclusions: BTRPTC is a slow-growing neoplastic lesion that needs to be distinguished from other papillary lesions for optimizing therapy.
28374222	The Evolving Role of the Estrogen Receptor Mutations in Endocrine Therapy-Resistant Breast Cancer.	Recurrent ligand-binding domain ESR1 mutations have recently been detected in a substantial number of patients with metastatic ER+ breast cancer and evolve under the selective pressure of endocrine treatments. In this review, we evaluate the current understanding of the biological and clinical significance of these mutations. The preclinical studies revealed that these mutations lead to constitutive ligand-independent activity, indicating resistance to aromatase inhibitors and decreased sensitivity to tamoxifen and fulvestrant. Retrospective analyses of ESR1 mutations in baseline plasma circulating tumor DNA from completed clinical trials suggest that these mutations are prognostic and predictive of resistance to aromatase inhibitors in metastatic disease. Currently, we are lacking prospective studies to confirm these results and to determine the optimal treatment combinations for patients with the ESR1 mutations. In addition, the clinical development of novel agents to overcome resistance engendered by these mutations is also needed.
28373448	Defining New Colorectal Cancer Syndromes in a Population-based Cohort of the Disease.	BACKGROUND/AIM: Most known cancer syndromes confer an increased risk of more than one tumour types, and families with more than one colorectal cancer often segregate other cancers as well. The aim of this study was to examine if there is a general increased risk of other cancers in colorectal cancer families, which are defined as having two or more cases of colorectal cancer in close relatives. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study used a detailed family history of cancer diagnoses in a cohort of more than 3,000 consecutive colorectal cancer cases. A comparison was made between families with sporadic and those with familial colorectal cancer cases. Detailed morphology data were used to find further support for putative syndromes. RESULTS: There were significantly more non-colorectal cancers in the family history of the familial CRC cases (p<0.001), with significantly more gastric cancers (p<0.001), prostate cancers (p<0.001), urinary bladder cancers (p<0.001) and melanomas (p=0.002), leukaemia/lymphomas (p=0.004), gynaecological cancers (p=0.007) and breast cancers (p=0.023). There was also some support for different morphological profiles for four of the five tested syndromes. CONCLUSION: This study found support for a general increased risk of one or more different cancer syndromes involving families with colorectal cancer and other cancers. Further studies will define the different possible syndromes and determine the genetic background.
28373443	Dynamic Phenotypic Transition of Breast Cancer Cells In Vitro Revealed by Self-floating Cell Culture.	BACKGROUND: Breast tumor heterogeneity leads to phenotypic diversity, such as tumor-initiating and metastatic properties and drug sensitivity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We found that a self-floating cell (SFC) culture enriches a drug-resistant subpopulation in a HER2-positive breast cancer cell line. SFCs were analyzed for cancer stem cell markers, gene expression profiles, and sensitivity for anticancer drugs. RESULTS: SFCs expressed cancer stem cell markers, such as aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity and elevated HER2 autophosphorylation. Gene expression profiles of SFCs showed a dramatic difference compared to those of parental or forced floating cells. SFCs also expressed CD133, a marker of drug resistance, and resisted cytotoxic drugs by drug efflux transporters. In contrast, HER2 kinase inhibitors efficiently reduced SFC viability. CONCLUSION: SFCs enrich drug-resistant subpopulations even in vitro and might reflect the highly plastic nature of breast cancer cells even in vitro.
28373442	Relationship Between Circulating Tumor Cells and Tissue Plasminogen Activator in Patients with Early Breast Cancer.	AIM: Cancer increases the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) and circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are associated with an increased risk of VTE and, thus, with increased D-dimers as a product of fibrinolysis. Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is one of the key enzymes in the fibrinolytic pathway. Its activity is crucial in maintaining the balance between blood coagulation and fibrinolysis. This study aimed to analyze the association between CTCs and tPA in patients with primary breast cancer before surgery. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This prospective study included 110 patients in whom CTCs were detected by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction targeted at epithelial (CK19) or epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-associated genes[TWIST1, SNAI1, SNAI2, zinc finger E-box-binding homeobox 1 (ZEB1), forkhead box protein C2 (FOXC2)]. Plasma tPA protein was detected using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). RESULTS: CTCs were detected in 31 (28.2%) patients. There was no association between plasma tPA and CTCs. Although on average, higher levels of tPA were detected in patients with CTCs expressing EMT-associated genes, this difference did not reach statistical significance. There was no association of plasma tPA with any of the observed patient or tumor characteristics. CONCLUSION: Even though the blood coagulation pathway may be activated in more aggressive disease related to an elevated CTC count, in this study, we did not find any association between CTCs and plasma concentrations of tPA.
28373437	Salinomycin Induces Reactive Oxygen Species and Apoptosis in Aggressive Breast Cancer Cells as Mediated with Regulation of Autophagy.	BACKGROUND/AIM: Chemotherapy is a critical option for cancer treatment. However, consistent exposure to chemotherapeutic drugs promotes chemoresistance in cancer cells through diverse mechanisms. Accordingly, we investigated whether salinomycin, a monocarboxylic ionophore, could induce apoptosis in aggressive breast cancer cells or not, as well as its underlying mechanism. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using salinomycin on two breast cancer cell lines, MCF-7 cells and MDA-MB-231 cells, cell viability, annexin V/propidium iodide staining, acridine orange staining, caspase-3/9 activity, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) were assayed. RESULTS: In this study, salinomycin induced apoptosis and autophagy in MDA-MB-231 cells. Salinomycin-mediated ROS production led to mitochondrial dysfunction in MDA-MB-231 cells. Interestingly, treatment of N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), a scavenger of ROS, attenuated salinomycin-induced apoptosis and autophagy. Moreover, autophagy inhibition is involved in acceleration of apoptosis induced by salinomycin. CONCLUSION: Salinomycin induced apoptosis and ROS production, that were blocked by autophagy, thus resulting in protecting cancer cells. This crosstalk of two different physiological responses (autophagy and apoptosis) induced by salinomycin might play pivotal roles in the relationship between autophagy and apoptosis of cancer cells.
28373435	Clinical Significance of DNA Damage Response Factors and Chromosomal Instability in Primary Lung Adenocarcinoma.	AIM: The purpose of this study was to investigate the biological role of DNA damage-response genes and chromosomal instability in primary lung adenocarcinoma. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We investigated 60 surgically-resected lung adenocarcinomas. Levels of checkpoint kinase 2 gene (CHEK2) and breast cancer type 1 susceptibility protein gene (BRCA1) mRNA expression were evaluated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations (exon 19 deletion and exon 21 mutation) were detected by the PCR clamp method. Mutations in Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog gene (KRAS) and TP53 were examined by direct sequencing. Expression levels of p27 and p16 proteins were assessed by immunohistochemistry. Chromosomal aberrations (CA) were examined in 20 samples with single-nucleotide polymorphism-comparative genomic hybridization. RESULTS: CHEK2 mRNA levels were significantly increased in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues (p=0.0123, paired t-test), whereas BRCA mRNA levels were not increased. TP53 mutation positivity and BRCA1 mRNA expression were positively associated with CHEK2 mRNA expression status (p=0.022 and p=0.0008). High CHEK2 mRNA expression was associated with poor recurrence-free survival (p=0.028). CHEK2 mRNA levels were higher in samples with a high CA frequency than in those with a low CA frequency (averages: 0.326 vs. 0.185; p=0.0129). CONCLUSION: The CHEK2 mRNA expression level was found elevated in lung adenocarcinoma and was related to a poor prognostic outcome. The CHEK2 pathway may be important for the proliferation of lung adenocarcinoma, especially in tumors with chromosomal instability.
28373426	Actinomycin D Down-regulates SOX2 Expression and Induces Death in Breast Cancer Stem Cells.	BACKGROUND/AIM: One of the major hurdles in the treatment of breast cancers is the inability of anti-cancer drugs to eliminate the breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs) population, which leads to disease relapse. The dearth in anti-cancer drugs that target BCSCs can be attributed to the absence of in vitro screening models that can not only recapitulate the tumor microenvironment consisting of BCSCs but also preserve the 3-dimensional (3D) architecture of in vivo tumors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In our present study, we have developed a 3D cell culture system that shows: (i) enrichment of BCSCs, (ii) increased drug resistance, and (iii) generation of hypoxic conditions similar to tumors. RESULTS: Using this model, we were able to screen a FDA-approved diversity set and identify as well as validate actinomycin D as a potential anti-breast cancer agent. Interestingly, we show that actinomycin D specifically targets and down-regulates the expression of the stem cell transcription factor, Sox-2. Additionally, down-regulation of Sox-2 leads to depletion of the stem-cell population resulting in the inability of breast cancer cells to initiate tumor progression. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the utility of an in vivo-like 3D cell culture system for the identification and validation of anti-cancer agents that will have a better probability of success in the clinic.
28373422	Differential Effect of Wortmannolone Derivatives on MDA-MB-231 Breast Cancer Cells.	BACKGROUND/AIM: The survival rate of women diagnosed with triple-negative breast-cancer (TNBC) remains low. Hence, this study aimed at the chemical and biological optimization of furanosteroid derivatives for the treatment of this type of malignancy using TNBC cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Semi-synthetic analogs of wortmannolone (1-6) that negatively affected the aberrant pathways in tumor cells were evaluated in hormone-independent breast cancer cells using western blot and cell-cycle analysis. RESULTS: Wortmannolone derivatization generated NF-kB inhibitors as new lead structures for further development. Compound (3) was found to be the most significantly active lead. CONCLUSION: Structure-activity analysis in the present study showed that acetylation of the hydroxyl groups and substitution on C3 and C17 of wortmannolone enhanced biological activity. Alpha-substitution of the acetyl group in C3 on ring A (compound 3) resulted in ROS inducing effect; however, presence of an acetyl group in beta-position of C3 displayed the highest NF-kB p65 inhibitory activity (0.60 muM).
28373421	Self-efficacy for Coping Moderates the Effects of Distress on Quality of Life in Palliative Cancer Care.	Recent aggressive chemotherapeutic and combined treatments have resulted in increased survivorship for advanced stage breast cancer. In some patients, treatment produces an actual abatement of their cancer, while in others treatment mitigates the progression of cancer bringing those patients into palliative care where their chronic disease requires continuous management. There is also evidence that the majority of palliative-care cancer patients have a deteriorating quality of life that only precipitously declines in the final few weeks of life. The new paradigm of patient-centered care for palliative patients is resulting in a new model of treatment in which the self-efficacy seems to play an important role. The present study represents an extension of the role of self-efficacy for coping to palliative care. Using a stress-coping model, the primary aim of this study was to evaluate a process model, in which self-efficacy for coping with cancer is a moderator between stress and the quality of life in a sample of breast cancer patients in palliative care. The secondary aim was to validate a specific domain coping self-efficacy scale, the Cancer Behavior Inventory. The current study confirmed the role of self-efficacy for coping with cancer as moderator of the relationship between stress and quality of life of a sample of breast cancer patients in palliative care. In addition, this study confirmed the structure, reliability and validity of the scale.
28373418	Differing Mechanisms of Death Induction by Fluorinated Taxane SB-T-12854 in Breast Cancer Cells.	BACKGROUND/AIM: Classical taxanes are routinely used in cancer therapy. In this study, mechanisms involved in death induction by the novel fluorine-containing taxane SB-T-12854 were investigated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We employed breast cancer SK-BR-3, MCF-7 and T47D cell lines to assess activation of individual caspases, changes in the expression of proteins of the Bcl-2 family, and the release of pro-apoptotic factors from mitochondria into the cytosol after SB-T-12854 treatment. RESULTS: Caspase-2, -8, and -9 were activated in SK-BR-3 and MCF-7 cells. Only caspase-8 was activated in T47D cells. Caspase-7 and -6 were activated in all tested cells while caspase-3 was activated only in SK-BR-3 cells. Pro-apoptotic Bad protein seems to be important for cell death induction in all tested cells. Anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and pro-apoptotic Bim, Bok, Bid and Bik seem to be also associated with cell death induction in some of the tested cells. The mitochondrial apoptotic pathway was significantly activated in association with the release of cytochrome c and Smac from mitochondria, but only in SK-BR-3 cells, not in MCF-7 and T47D cells. CONCLUSION: Cell death induced by SB-T-12854, in the tested breast cancer cells, differs regarding activation of caspases, changes in levels of pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic proteins of the Bcl-2 family and activation of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway.
28369154	Modeling Variables With a Spike at Zero: Examples and Practical Recommendations.	In most epidemiologic studies and in clinical research generally, there are variables with a spike at zero, namely variables for which a proportion of individuals have zero exposure (e.g., never smokers) and among those exposed the variable has a continuous distribution. Different options exist for modeling such variables, such as categorization where the nonexposed form the reference group, or ignoring the spike by including the variable in the regression model with or without some transformation or modeling procedures. It has been shown that such situations can be analyzed by adding a binary indicator (exposed/nonexposed) to the regression model, and a method based on fractional polynomials with which to estimate a suitable functional form for the positive portion of the spike-at-zero variable distribution has been developed. In this paper, we compare different approaches using data from 3 case-control studies carried out in Germany: the Mammary Carcinoma Risk Factor Investigation (MARIE), a breast cancer study conducted in 2002-2005 (Flesch-Janys et al., Int J Cancer. 2008;123(4):933-941); the Rhein-Neckar Larynx Study, a study of laryngeal cancer conducted in 1998-2000 (Dietz et al., Int J Cancer. 2004;108(6):907-911); and a lung cancer study conducted in 1988-1993 (Jockel et al., Int J Epidemiol. 1998;27(4):549-560). Strengths and limitations of different procedures are demonstrated, and some recommendations for practical use are given.
28366183	Fruit and vegetable intake and breast cancer prognosis: a meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies.	The effect of fruit and vegetable intake on breast cancer prognosis is controversial. Thus, a meta-analysis was carried out to explore their associations. A comprehensive search was conducted in PubMed, Web of Science, OVID, ProQuest and Chinese databases from inception to April 2016. The summary hazard ratios (HR) and 95 % CI were estimated using a random effects model if substantial heterogeneity existed and using a fixed effects model if not. Subgroup analyses and sensitivity analyses were also performed. In total, twelve studies comprising 41 185 participants were included in the meta-analysis. Comparing the highest with the lowest, the summary HR for all-cause mortality were 1.01 (95 % CI 0.72, 1.42) for fruits and vegetables combined, 0.96 (95 % CI 0.83, 1.12) for total vegetable intake, 0.99 (95 % CI 0.89, 1.11) for cruciferous vegetable intake and 0.88 (95 % CI 0.74, 1.05) for fruit intake; those for breast cancer-specific mortality were 1.05 (95 % CI 0.77, 1.43) for total vegetable intake and 0.94 (95 % CI 0.69, 1.26) for fruit intake; and those for breast cancer recurrence were 0.89 (95 % CI 0.53, 1.50) for total vegetable intake and 0.98 (95 % CI 0.76, 1.26) for cruciferous vegetable intake. This meta-analysis found no significant associations between fruit and vegetable intake and breast cancer prognosis.
28364779	The effects of Nobiletin, Hesperetin, and Letrozole in a combination on the activity and expression of aromatase in breast cancer cells.	Nobiletin (NOB) and hesperetin (HES) are the citrus polymethoxyflavone and flavonone. Aromatase or cytochrome P450 (CYP19) enzyme is a key enzyme in estrogen biosynthesis. The objective of this study was to investigate the combinational effects of HES, NOB and letrozole (LET) as aromatase inhibitors on the activity and expression of aromatase in MCF-7 cells. In this study, aromatase enzyme activity based on the conversion of androgen substrate testosterone to 17beta-Estradiol was determined. Estradiol concentrations were measured using an electrochemiluminescence immunoassay. CYP19 gene expression was determined by quantitative real-time PCR. Our findings demonstrated that none of combinations including LET+NOB, LET+HES, LET+NOB+HES, and NOB+HES had no significant effects on aromatase activity and expression. The present study showed for the first time that the combination of HES, NOB, and LET had no effects on activity and expression of aromatase in MCF-7 breast cancer cells.
28364270	SAFE trial: an ongoing randomized clinical study to assess the role of cardiotoxicity prevention in breast cancer patients treated with anthracyclines with or without trastuzumab.	Over the years, thanks to the addition of new generation systemic agents, as well as the use of more advanced and precise radiotherapy techniques, it was able to obtain a high curability rate for breast cancer. Anthracyclines play a key role in the treatment of breast disease, with a well-known benefit on disease-free survival of patients with positive nodal status. Trastuzumab have shown a significant outcome advantage after 1-year administration in case of HER2-positive disease. Unfortunately, significant increase in cardiotoxicity has been observed after anthracyclines and trastuzumab therapies. Even though the cardiology and oncology community strongly recommend a cardiotoxicity prevention strategy for this subset of patients, there is still no consensus on the optimal patient's approach. We aimed to review the published and ongoing researches on cardioprevention strategies and to present the SAFE trial (CT registry ID: NCT2236806; EudraCT number: 2015-000914-23). It is a randomized phase 3, four-arm, single-blind, placebo-controlled study that aims to evaluate the effect of bisoprolol, ramipril or both drugs, compared to placebo, on subclinical heart damage evaluated by speckle tracking cardiac ultrasound in non-metastatic breast cancer patients.
28364269	Systemic therapies and cognitive impairment for breast cancer: an overview of the current literature.	Both endocrine and chemotherapy can be utilized for breast cancer patients' management, in multiple setting (i.e., primary systemic therapy, adjuvant, metastatic treatment). Health-related quality of life in breast cancer survivors can be significantly influenced by cognitive impairment, which has been related in several previously reported experiences to systemic therapies administration. However, although the growing body of literature, the impact of both chemo- and endocrine therapy on cognitive function is currently unclear, due to many confounding factors (i.e., multiple therapies, duration of therapy, comorbidity, age). The aim of the present review is to present an overview of the current literature concerning the possible influence of endocrine and systemic therapy on breast cancer patients' cognitive impairment.
28362817	Cis-eQTL-based trans-ethnic meta-analysis reveals novel genes associated with breast cancer risk.	Breast cancer is the most common solid organ malignancy and the most frequent cause of cancer death among women worldwide. Previous research has yielded insights into its genetic etiology, but there remains a gap in the understanding of genetic factors that contribute to risk, and particularly in the biological mechanisms by which genetic variation modulates risk. The National Cancer Institute's "Up for a Challenge" (U4C) competition provided an opportunity to further elucidate the genetic basis of the disease. Our group leveraged the seven datasets made available by the U4C organizers and data from the publicly available UK Biobank cohort to examine associations between imputed gene expression and breast cancer risk. In particular, we used reference datasets describing the breast tissue and whole blood transcriptomes to impute expression levels in breast cancer cases and controls. In trans-ethnic meta-analyses of U4C and UK Biobank data, we found significant associations between breast cancer risk and the expression of RCCD1 (joint p-value: 3.6x10-06) and DHODH (p-value: 7.1x10-06) in breast tissue, as well as a suggestive association for ANKLE1 (p-value: 9.3x10-05). Expression of RCCD1 in whole blood was also suggestively associated with disease risk (p-value: 1.2x10-05), as were expression of ACAP1 (p-value: 1.9x10-05) and LRRC25 (p-value: 5.2x10-05). While genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have implicated RCCD1 and ANKLE1 in breast cancer risk, they have not identified the remaining three genes. Among the genetic variants that contributed to the predicted expression of the five genes, we found 23 nominally (p-value < 0.05) associated with breast cancer risk, among which 15 are not in high linkage disequilibrium with risk variants previously identified by GWAS. In summary, we used a transcriptome-based approach to investigate the genetic underpinnings of breast carcinogenesis. This approach provided an avenue for deciphering the functional relevance of genes and genetic variants involved in breast cancer.
28362718	Radioactive seed localization is the preferred technique in nonpalpable breast cancer compared with wire-guided localization and radioguided occult lesion localization.	OBJECTIVES: Three commonly used techniques for localization of nonpalpable breast cancer are radioactive seed localization (RSL), wire-guided localization (WGL) and radioguided occult lesion localization (ROLL). In this study, we analysed the surgical margins of these three techniques. METHODS: Women diagnosed with nonpalpable breast cancer undergoing breast-conserving surgery with one of the above-mentioned techniques were retrospectively included. The primary outcome parameter was tumour-free margin rate. Secondary outcomes were re-excision rate, recurrence of disease and volume of removed tissue. RESULTS: In total, 272 women were included in whom RSL (n=69), WGL (n=76) or ROLL (n=137) was performed. RSL showed a higher tumour-free margin rate [64 (92.8%)] compared with WGL [51 (67.1%)] and ROLL [113 (82.5%)] (P=0.001). In our multivariable analysis, RSL showed a higher tumour-free margin rate as well compared with WGL (P=0.036) and ROLL (P=0.049). Also, fewer re-excisions were encountered using RSL [5 (7.2%)] compared with WGL [13 (17.1%)] and ROLL [15 (10.9%)] (P=0.171). In 11 patients (WGL n=2, ROLL n=9), recurrence of disease occurred, despite a radical excision. The mean resection volumes were comparable within the three groups. CONCLUSION: RSL results in a higher tumour-free margin rate in nonpalpable breast tumours compared with WGL and ROLL. Therefore, we prefer using RSL in nonpalpable breast tumours.
28358798	Screening for Excessive Alcohol Use and Brief Counseling of Adults - 17 States and the District of Columbia, 2014.	Excessive and/or risky alcohol use* resulted in $249 billion in economic costs in 2010 (1) and >88,000 deaths in the United States every year from 2006 to 2010 (2). It is associated with birth defects and disabilities (e.g., fetal alcohol spectrum disorders [FASDs]), increases in chronic diseases (e.g., heart disease and breast cancer), and injuries and violence (e.g., motor vehicle crashes, suicide, and homicide).dagger Since 2004, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) has recommended alcohol misuse screening and brief counseling (also known as alcohol screening and brief intervention or ASBI) for adults aged >/=18 years (3). section sign Among adults, ASBI reduces episodes of binge-level consumption, reduces weekly alcohol consumption, and increases compliance with recommended drinking limits in those who have an intervention in comparison to those who do not (3). A recent study suggested that health care providers rarely talk with patients about alcohol use (4). To estimate the prevalence of U.S. adults who reported receiving elements of ASBI, CDC analyzed 2014 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data from 17 states paragraph sign and the District of Columbia (DC). Weighted crude and age-standardized overall and state-level prevalence estimates were calculated by selected drinking patterns and demographic characteristics. Overall, 77.7% of adults (age-standardized estimate) reported being asked about alcohol use by a health professional in person or on a form during a checkup, but only 32.9% reported being asked about binge-level alcohol consumption (3). Among binge drinkers, only 37.2% reported being asked about alcohol use and advised about the harms of drinking too much, and only 18.1% reported being asked about alcohol use and advised to reduce or quit drinking. Widespread implementation of ASBI and other evidence-based interventions could help reduce excessive alcohol use in adults and related harms.
28353647	Wedelolactone Acts as Proteasome Inhibitor in Breast Cancer Cells.	Wedelolactone is a multi-target natural plant coumestan exhibiting cytotoxicity towards cancer cells. Although several molecular targets of wedelolactone have been recognized, the molecular mechanism of its cytotoxicity has not yet been elucidated. In this study, we show that wedelolactone acts as an inhibitor of chymotrypsin-like, trypsin-like, and caspase-like activities of proteasome in breast cancer cells. The proteasome inhibitory effect of wedelolactone was documented by (i) reduced cleavage of fluorogenic proteasome substrates; (ii) accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteins and proteins with rapid turnover in tumor cells; and (iii) molecular docking of wedelolactone into the active sites of proteasome catalytic subunits. Inhibition of proteasome by wedelolactone was independent on its ability to induce reactive oxygen species production by redox cycling with copper ions, suggesting that wedelolactone acts as copper-independent proteasome inhibitor. We conclude that the cytotoxicity of wedelolactone to breast cancer cells is partially mediated by targeting proteasomal protein degradation pathway. Understanding the structural basis for inhibitory mode of wedelolactone might help to open up new avenues for design of novel compounds efficiently inhibiting cancer cells.
28353630	Detection of 17 beta-Estradiol in Environmental Samples and for Health Care Using a Single-Use, Cost-Effective Biosensor Based on Differential Pulse Voltammetry (DPV).	Environmental estrogen pollution and estrogen effects on the female reproductive system are well recognized scientifically. Among the estrogens, 17 beta-estradiol is a priority in environmental estrogen pollution, and it is also a major contributor to estrogen which regulates the female reproductive system. 17 beta-estradiol is carcinogenic and has a tumor promotion effect relating to breast cancer, lung cancer and others. It also affects psychological well-being such as depression, fatigue and others. Thus, a simple method of detecting 17 beta-estradiol will be important for both environmental estrogen pollution and health care. This study demonstrates a single-use, cost-effective 17 beta-estradiol biosensor system which can be used for both environmental and health care applications. The bio-recognition mechanism is based on the influence of the redox couple, K(3)Fe(CN)(6)/K(4)Fe(CN)(6) by the interaction between 17 beta-estradiol antigen and its alpha-receptor (ER-alpha; alpha-estrogen antibody). The transduction mechanism is an electrochemical analytical technique, differential pulse voltammetry (DPV). The levels of 17 beta-estradiol antigen studied were between 2.25 pg/mL and 2250 pg/mL; Phosphate buffered saline (PBS), tap water from the Cleveland regional water district, and simulated urine were used as the test media covering the potential application areas for 17 beta-estradiol detection. An interference study by testosterone, which has a similar chemical structure and molecular weight as those of 17 beta-estradiol, was carried out, and this 17 beta-estradiol biosensor showed excellent specificity without any interference by similar chemicals.
28353608	Chemotherapy-induced prospective memory impairment in breast cancer patients with different hormone receptor expression.	This study aimed to investigate prospective memory impairment in patients with breast cancer with different expression of hormone receptors, including the estrogen receptor (ER) and the progesterone receptor (PR).A total of 120 patients with breast cancer who underwent chemotherapy following surgery were divided into 2 groups. The A group included 60 patients with ER/PR status, and the B group included 60 patients with ER/PR status. After 6 cycles of postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy, all patients were administered neuropsychological and prospective memory tests, such as the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), verbal fluency test (VFT), and digit span test (DST), as well as examination of event-based prospective memory (EBPM) and time-based prospective memory (TBPM).As the neuropsychological background test results showed, there were no significant differences in MMSE, DST, and TBPM scores (*:P > 0.05) between patients with breast cancer in the ER/PR and ER/PR groups, while the VFT and EBPM scores were significantly greater in patients with breast cancer with ER/PR status than in those with ER/PR status (**: P < 0.01), indicating that patients with ER/PR status have significant impairment in EBPM, although not in TBPM.The results of the present study indicate that different hormone receptor expression in patients with breast cancer may be associated with heterogeneity of chemotherapy-induced prospective memory impairment.
28353380	Characteristics of a Breast Pathology Consultation Practice.	CONTEXT: - Intradepartmental consultation is a routine practice commonly used for new diagnoses. Expert interinstitutional case review provides insight into particularly challenging cases. OBJECTIVE: - To investigate the practice of breast pathology consultation at a large tertiary care center. DESIGN: - We reviewed breast pathology cases sent for private consultation and internal cases reviewed by multiple pathologists at a tertiary center. Requisitions and reports were evaluated for diagnostic reason for consultation, rate of multiple pathologist review at the tertiary center, use of immunohistochemistry, and, for private consultation cases, type of sender and concordance with the outside diagnosis. RESULTS: - In the 985 private consultation cases, the most frequent reasons for review were borderline atypia (292 of 878; 33.3%), papillary lesion classification (151 of 878; 17.2%), evaluating invasion (123 of 878; 14%), subtyping carcinoma (75 of 878; 8.5%), and spindle cell (67 of 878; 7.6%) and fibroepithelial (65 of 878; 7.4%) lesion classification. Of 4981 consecutive internal cases, 358 (7.2%) were reviewed, most frequently for borderline atypia (90 of 358; 25.1%), subtyping carcinoma (63 of 358; 17.6%), staging/prognostic features (59 of 358; 16.5%), fibroepithelial lesion classification (45 of 358; 12.6%), evaluating invasion (37 of 358; 10.3%), and papillary (20 of 358; 5.6%) and spindle cell (18 of 358; 5.0%) lesion classification. Of all internal cases, those with a final diagnosis of atypia had a significantly higher rate of review (58 of 241; 24.1%) than those with benign (119 of 2933; 4.1%) or carcinoma (182 of 1807; 10.1%) diagnoses. Immunohistochemistry aided in diagnosis of 39.7% (391 of 985) and 21.2% (76 of 359) of consultation and internally reviewed cases, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: - This study confirms areas of breast pathology that represent diagnostic challenge and supports that pathologists are appropriately using expert consultation.
28353377	New Developments in Breast Cancer and Their Impact on Daily Practice in Pathology.	Advances in research have transformed our understanding of breast cancers and have altered the daily practice of pathology. Theranostic evaluations performed by pathologists are now critical in triaging the patients into appropriate treatment groups, as are new guidelines that were recently established for the evaluation of HER2/neu gene amplification. Emerging molecular classifications of breast cancers bring novel perspectives to the assessment of individual cases, and opportunities for better treatments. Molecular studies have particularly shed light on distinct biological subsets of triple-negative breast cancers, for which new targeted therapies are being developed. The prognostic and therapeutic utility of new histopathologic parameters, such as tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, are also being elucidated, and new protocols have been devised for the pathologic evaluation of breast specimens that have undergone neoadjuvant treatment. Novel clinical practices, such as radioactive seed localization, also affect the way breast specimens are processed and evaluated. In this brief review, we highlight the developments that are most relevant to pathology and are changing or could potentially impact our daily practice.
28351400	Cerebrospinal fluid abnormalities in meningeosis neoplastica: a retrospective 12-year analysis.	BACKGROUND: Meningeosis neoplastica is a diffuse metastatic spread of tumor cells in the subarachnoid space. Although first recognized in 1870, systematic investigations regarding cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) constituents in this condition are scarce. METHODS: Routine CSF samples analyzed from 2001 to 2012 at the Laboratory of Clinical Neurochemistry, University of Gottingen, were re-evaluated. Patients, whose CSF contained malignant cells were included in this study. RESULTS: Patients (n = 132, age 59.1 +/- 29.1, 58% women) were identified, whose CSF contained malignant cells. The most frequent primary tumor was breast cancer (32.6%), followed by lung cancer (25.0%) and hematologic malignancies (21.2%). The most frequent clinical symptoms were affections of cranial nerves (41.7%), psychiatric abmormalities (32.6%) and radicular lesions of the lower extremities (20.5%). CSF cell counts ranged from 0 to 4692 cells/mul (median 4 cells/mul) and were elevated in 50%. The CSF-to-serum albumin ratio was abnormal in 69.4%. It ranged from 1.8 to 330 x 10-3 (median 17.5 x 10-3). Total CSF protein ranged from 166 to 15,840 mg/l (median 1012 mg/l). CSF lactate was elevated (>2.4 mmol/l) in 65.2% [3.6 mmol/l (1.3/15.6 mmol/l); median (minimum/maximum)]. In 50% of all patients CSF lactate was >/=3.5 mmol/l. The CSF cell counts correlated significantly with the CSF lactate levels and the CSF protein contents. In 56 of 118 CSF samples (47.5%) ferritin was elevated, and in 25 of 65 carcinoma patients (38.5%) an intrathecal production of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) was detected. Granulocytes were found in 52.7% of the CSF samples. The percentages of granulocytes and lymphocytes were higher in samples with an elevated cell count. CONCLUSION: In approximately 50% of CSF samples with meningeosis neoplastica the CSF cell count is not elevated. Diagnosis may be missed when only CSF samples with elevated cell counts are subjected to cytological analysis. CSF lactate and protein and the CSF-to-serum albumin ratio are frequently increased in meningeosis neoplastica. The differential diagnosis between meningeosis neoplastica and central nervous infections, in particular tuberculous or fungal meningitis, can be difficult.
28351333	Splicing factor hnRNPA2B1 contributes to tumorigenic potential of breast cancer cells through STAT3 and ERK1/2 signaling pathway.	Increasing evidence has indicated that the splicing factor hnRNPA2B1 plays a direct role in cancer development, progression, gene expression, and signal transduction. Previous studies have shown that knocking down hnRNPA2B1 in breast cancer cells induces apoptosis, but the mechanism and other functions of hnRNPA2B1 in breast cancer are unknown. The goal of this study was to investigate the biological function, clinical significance, and mechanism of hnRNPA2B1 in breast cancer. The expression of hnRNPA2B1 in 92 breast cancer and adjacent normal tissue pairs was analyzed by immunohistochemical staining. Stable clones exhibiting knockdown of hnRNPA2B1 via small hairpin RNA expression were generated using RNA interference technology in breast cancer cell lines. The effects of hnRNPA2B1 on cell proliferation were examined by MTT and EdU assay, and cellular apoptosis and the cell cycle were examined by flow cytometry. A nude mouse xenograft model was established to elucidate the function of hnRNPA2B1 in tumorigenesis in vivo. The role of hnRNPA2B1 in signaling pathways was investigated in vitro. Our data revealed that hnRNPA2B1 was overexpressed in breast cancer tissue specimens and cell lines. Knockdown of hnRNPA2B1 reduced breast cancer cell proliferation, induced apoptosis, and prolonged the S phase of the cell cycle in vitro. In addition, hnRNPA2B1 knockdown suppressed subcutaneous tumorigenicity in vivo. On a molecular level, hnRNPA2B1 knockdown decreased signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 and extracellular-signal-regulated kinase 1/2 phosphorylation. We concluded that hnRNPA2B1 promotes the tumorigenic potential of breast cancer cells, MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231, through the extracellular-signal-regulated kinase 1/2 or signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 pathway, which may serve as a target for future therapies.
28351330	Stratified aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio index accurately predicts survival in hepatocellular carcinoma patients undergoing curative liver resection.	The aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio index has been reported to predict prognosis of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. This study examined the prognostic potential of stratified aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio index for hepatocellular carcinoma patients undergoing curative liver resection. A total of 661 hepatocellular carcinoma patients were retrieved and the associations between aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio index and clinicopathological variables and survivals (overall survival and disease-free survival) were analyzed. Higher aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio index quartiles were significantly associated with poorer overall survival (p = 0.002) and disease-free survival (p = 0.001). Multivariate analysis showed aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio index to be an independent risk factor for overall survival (p = 0.018) and disease-free survival (p = 0.01). Patients in the highest aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio index quartile were at 44% greater risk of death than patients in the first quartile (hazard ratio = 1.445, 95% confidence interval = 1.081 - 1.931, p = 0.013), as well as 49% greater risk of recurrence (hazard ratio = 1.49, 95% confidence interval = 1.112-1.998, p = 0.008). Subgroup analysis also showed aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio index to be an independent predictor of poor overall survival and disease-free survival in patients positive for hepatitis B surface antigen or with cirrhosis (both p < 0.05). Similar results were obtained when aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio index was analyzed as a dichotomous variable with cutoff values of 0.25 and 0.62. Elevated preoperative aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio index may be independently associated with poor overall survival and disease-free survival in hepatocellular carcinoma patients following curative resection.
28351329	Crocetin shifts autophagic cell survival to death of breast cancer cells in chemotherapy.	The chemotherapy with fluorouracil is not always effective, in which some breast cancer cells may survive the fluorouracil treatment through enhanced autophagy. Crocetin is the major constituent of saffron, a Chinese traditional herb, which has recently found to have multiple pharmacological effects, including anticancer. However, the effects of Crocetin on the outcome of fluorouracil therapy for breast cancer have not been studied. Here, we showed that fluorouracil treatment inhibited the growth of breast cancer cells, in either a Cell Counting Kit-8 assay or an MTT assay. Inhibition of autophagy further suppressed breast cancer cell growth, suggesting that the breast cancer cells increased autophagic cell survival during fluorouracil treatment. However, Crocetin significantly increased the suppressive effects of fluorouracil on breast cancer cell growth, without affecting either cell apoptosis or autophagy. Inhibition of autophagy at the presence of Crocetin partially abolished the suppressive effects on breast cancer cell growth, suggesting that Crocetin may increase autophagic cell death in fluorouracil-treated breast cancer cells. Furthermore, Crocetin decreased Beclin-1 levels but increased ATG1 levels in fluorouracil-treated breast cancer cells. Together, these data suggest that Crocetin may shift autophagic cell survival to autophagic cell death in fluorouracil-treated breast cancer cells, possibly through modulation of the expression of ATG1 and Beclin-1.
28351323	gamma-H2AX: Can it be established as a classical cancer prognostic factor?	Double-strand breaks are among the first procedures taking place in cancer formation and progression as a result of endogenic and exogenic factors. The histone variant H2AX undergoes phosphorylation at serine 139 due to double-strand breaks, and the gamma-H2AX is formatted as a result of genomic instability. The detection of gamma-H2AX can potentially serve as a biomarker for transformation of normal tissue to premalignant and consequently to malignant tissues. gamma-H2AX has already been investigated in a variety of cancer types, including breast, lung, colon, cervix, and ovary cancers. The prognostic value of gamma-H2AX is indicated in certain cancer types, such as breast or endometrial cancer, but further investigation is needed to establish gamma-H2AX as a prognostic marker. This review outlines the role of gamma-H2AX in cell cycle, and its formation as a result of DNA damage. We investigate the role of gamma-H2AX formation in several cancer types and its correlation with other prognostic factors, and we try to find out whether it fulfills the requirements for its establishment as a classical cancer prognostic factor.
28351318	Cytotoxicity of citral against melanoma cells: The involvement of oxidative stress generation and cell growth protein reduction.	Citral is a natural compound that has shown cytotoxic and antiproliferative effects on breast and hematopoietic cancer cells; however, there are few studies on melanoma cells. Oxidative stress is known to be involved in all stages of melanoma development and is able to modulate intracellular pathways related to cellular proliferation and death. In this study, we hypothesize that citral exerts its cytotoxic effect on melanoma cells by the modulation of cellular oxidative status and/or intracellular signaling. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the antiproliferative and cytotoxic effects of citral on B16F10 murine melanoma cells evaluating its effects on cellular oxidative stress, DNA damage, cell death, and important signaling pathways, as these pathways, namely, extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2), AKT, and phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase, are involved in cell proliferation and differentiation. The p53 and nuclear factor kappa B were also investigated due to their ability to respond to intracellular stress. We observed that citral exerted antiproliferative and cytotoxic effects in B16F10; induced oxidative stress, DNA lesions, and p53 nuclear translocation; and reduced nitric oxide levels and nuclear factor kappa B, ERK1/2, and AKT. To investigate citral specificity, we used non-neoplastic human and murine cells, HaCaT (human skin keratinocytes) and NIH-3T3 cells (murine fibroblasts), and observed that although citral effects were not specific for cancer cells, non-neoplastic cells were more resistant to citral than B16F10. These findings highlight the potential clinical utility of citral in melanoma, with a mechanism of action involving the oxidative stress generation, nitric oxide depletion, and interference in signaling pathways related to cell proliferation.
28351315	Obesity-associated digestive cancers: A review of mechanisms and interventions.	The prevalence of obesity has steadily increased over the past few decades. Previous studies suggest that obesity is an oncogenic factor and that over 20% of all cancers are obesity-related. Among such cancers, digestive system malignancies (including esophageal adenocarcinomas, colorectal cancers, and cancers of the gastric cardia, liver, and pancreas) are reported most frequently. While the 5-year survival rates of cancers of the breast and prostate are 90%, that rate is only 45% for digestive cancers. In this review, the mechanisms of obesity-associated digestive cancers are discussed, with an emphasis on obesity-related gene mutations, insulin and insulin-like growth factor signaling pathways, chronic inflammation, and altered adipokine levels. Evidence that these factors often function interdependently rather than independently in carcinogenesis is presented. Recommended interventions that may reduce the burden of obesity-associated digestive cancers, such as participation in physical activity, diet modulation, and calorie restriction, are also described.
28351303	Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase regulatory subunit 1 and phosphatase and tensin homolog as therapeutic targets in breast cancer.	Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer among women in Turkey and worldwide. It is considered a heterogeneous disease and has different subtypes. Moreover, breast cancer has different molecular characteristics, behaviors, and responses to treatment. Advances in the understanding of the molecular mechanisms implicated in breast cancer progression have led to the identification of many potential therapeutic gene targets, such as Breast Cancer 1/2, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase catalytic subunit alpha, and tumor protein 53. The aim of this review is to summarize the roles of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase regulatory subunit 1 (alpha) (alias p85alpha) and phosphatase and tensin homolog in breast cancer progression and the molecular mechanisms involved. Phosphatase and tensin homolog is a tumor suppressor gene and protein. Phosphatase and tensin homolog antagonizes the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT signaling pathway that plays a key role in cell growth, differentiation, and survival. Loss of phosphatase and tensin homolog expression, detected in about 20%-30% of cases, is known to be one of the most common tumor changes leading to phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway activation in breast cancer. Instead, the regulatory subunit p85alpha is a significant component of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway, and it has been proposed that a reduction in p85alpha protein would lead to decreased negative regulation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and hyperactivation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway. Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase regulatory subunit 1 protein has also been reported to be a positive regulator of phosphatase and tensin homolog via the stabilization of this protein. A functional genetic alteration of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase regulatory subunit 1 that results in reduced p85alpha protein expression and increased insulin receptor substrate 1 binding would lead to enhanced phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling and hence cancer development. Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase regulatory subunit 1 underexpression was observed in 61.8% of breast cancer samples. Therefore, expression/alternations of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase regulatory subunit 1 and phosphatase and tensin homolog genes have crucial roles for breast cancer progression. This review will summarize the biological roles of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase regulatory subunit 1 and phosphatase and tensin homolog in breast cancer, with an emphasis on recent findings and the potential of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase regulatory subunit 1 and phosphatase and tensin homolog as a therapeutic target for breast cancer therapy.
28351302	The prognostic efficacy and improvements of the 7th edition Union for International Cancer Control tumor-node-metastasis classifications for Chinese patients with gastric cancer: Results based on a retrospective three-decade population study.	This study aimed to evaluate survival trends for patients with gastric cancer in northeast China in the most recent three decades and analyze the applicability of the UICC tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) classification 7th edition for Chinese patients with gastric cancer. A review of all inpatient and outpatient records of patients with gastric cancer was conducted in the first hospital of China Medical University and the Liaoning Cancer Hospital and Institute. All patients who met the inclusion criteria and were seen from January 1980 through December 2009 were included in the study. The primary outcome was 5-year survival, which was analyzed according to decade of diagnosis and TNM classifications. From 1980 through 2009, the 5-year survival rates for patients with gastric cancer (n=2414) increased from 39.1% to 57.3%. Decade of diagnosis was significantly associated with patient survival (p = 0.013), and the 5-year survival rate in the 2000s was remarkably higher than that in the 1980s and 1990s (p = 0.004 and 0.049, respectively). When classified according to the UICC TNM classification of gastric cancer 7th edition, the prognoses of stage IIIA and stage IIIB patients were not significantly different (p = 0.077). However, if stage T4b and stage N0 patients were classified as stage IIIA, the prognoses of stage IIIA and stage IIIB patients were significantly different (p < 0.001). Hence, there was a significant difference in survival during the three time periods in Northeast China. Classifying stage T4b and stage N0 patients as stage IIIA according to the 7th edition of UICC gastric cancer TNM classifications better stratified Chinese patients and predicted prognoses.

28349835	The role of epithelial cell adhesion molecule N-glycosylation on apoptosis in breast cancer cells.	Glycosylation of cell surface proteins plays an important role in the regulation of apoptosis. It has been demonstrated that knockdown of epithelial cell adhesion molecule promoted apoptosis, inhibited cell proliferation, and caused cell-cycle arrest. In this study, we investigated whether and how N-glycosylation of epithelial cell adhesion molecule influenced the apoptosis in breast cancer cells. We applied the N-glycosylation mutation epithelial cell adhesion molecule plasmid to express deglycosylation of epithelial cell adhesion molecule and then to study its function. Our results showed that deglycosylation of epithelial cell adhesion molecule promoted apoptosis and inhibited cell proliferation. Deglycosylation of epithelial cell adhesion molecule enhanced the cytotoxic effect of 5-fluorouracil, promoting apoptosis by downregulating the expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 and upregulating the expression of the pro-apoptotic proteins Bax and Caspase 3 via the extracellular-signal-regulated kinase 1/2 and c-Jun N-terminal kinase mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathways in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. These findings are important for a better understanding of epithelial cell adhesion molecule apoptosis regulation and suggest epithelial cell adhesion molecule as a potential target for the treatment of breast cancer.
28349828	Silencing of bach1 gene by small interfering RNA-mediation regulates invasive and expression level of miR-203, miR-145, matrix metalloproteinase-9, and CXCR4 receptor in MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells.	BACKGROUND: Recently experimental validation of the networks revealed bach1, a basic leucine zipper transcription factor, as the common regulator of several functional invasive genes. The expression of bach1 and its target genes was linked to the higher risk of breast cancer recurrence in patients. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of specific bach1 small interfering RNAs, on the invasive and expression level of miR-203, miR-145, matrix metalloproteinase-9, and CXCR4 receptor which play a role in cancer metastasis, in MDA-MB-468 cell lines. METHODS: Small interfering RNA transfection was performed with transfection regent. The survival effects of small interfering RNA were determined using trypan blue assay cells. The expression level of messenger RNA and matrix metalloproteinase-9 to assess cell invasion and the expression level of miR-203, miR-145, and CXCR4 receptor were measured by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis on the MDA-MB-468 cell lines. RESULTS: Transfection with small interfering RNA significantly suppressed the expression of bach1 gene in dose-dependent manner after 48 h ( p < 0.0001). A significant reduction in cell invasion and CXCR4 receptor, matrix metalloproteinase-9 expression were observed ( p < 0.0001). It was also a dramatic increase in the expression level of miR-203 and miR-145 ( p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the bach1-specific small interfering RNA effectively decrease CXCR4 receptor, matrix metalloproteinase-9 expression and breast adenocarcinoma cells invasive, also increased the expression of tumor-suppressive microRNA-203 and miR-145. Thus, these microRNAs may play a role in invasive/metastasis of carcinogenic breast cancer cells. Therefore, bach1 knockdown can be considered as a potent adjuvant in breast cancer therapy.
28349825	Methylomics of breast cancer: Seeking epimarkers in peripheral blood of young subjects.	Critical roles of epigenomic alterations in the pathogenesis of breast cancer have recently seized great attentions toward finding epimarkers in either non-invasive or semi-non-invasive samples as well as peripheral blood. In this way, methylated DNA immunoprecipitation microarray (MeDIP-chip) was performed on DNA samples isolated from white blood cells of 30 breast cancer patients compared to 30 healthy controls. A total of 1799 differentially methylated regions were identified including SLC6A3, Rab40C, ZNF584, and FOXD3 whose significant methylation differences were confirmed in breast cancer patients through quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Hypermethylation of APC, HDAC1, and GSK1 genes has been previously reported in more than one study on tissue samples of breast cancer. Methylation of those aforementioned genes in white blood cells of our young patients not only relies on their importance in breast cancer pathogenesis but also may highlight their potential as early epimarkers that makes further assessments necessary in large cohort studies.
28349824	Increased efficacy of a dendritic cell-based therapeutic cancer vaccine with adenosine receptor antagonist and CD73 inhibitor.	Dendritic cells are important in initiating immune responses; therefore, a range of dendritic cell-based approaches have been established to induce immune response against cancer cells. However, the presence of immunosuppressive mediators such as adenosine in the tumor microenvironment reduces the efficacy of dendritic cell-based cancer immunotherapy. In this study, we investigated whether blockade of the A2A adenosine receptor with a selective antagonist and a CD73 inhibitor may increase the efficacy of a dendritic cell-based cancer vaccine. According to the findings, this therapeutic combination reduced tumor growth, prolonged survival of tumor-bearing mice, and enhanced specific antitumor immune responses. Thus, we suggest that targeting cancer-derived adenosine improves the outcomes of dendritic cell-based cancer immunotherapy.
28349820	Efficient killing of radioresistant breast cancer cells by cytokine-induced killer cells.	Recurrence of breast cancer after radiotherapy may be partly explained by the presence of radioresistant cells. Thus, it would be desirable to develop an effective therapy against radioresistant cells. In this study, we demonstrated the intense antitumor activity of cytokine-induced killer cells against MCF-7 and radioresistant MCF-7 cells, as revealed by cytokine-induced killer-mediated cytotoxicity, tumor cell proliferation, and tumor invasion. Radioresistant MCF-7 cells were more susceptible to cytokine-induced killer cell killing. The stronger cytotoxicity of cytokine-induced killer cells against radioresistant MCF-7 cells was dependent on the expression of major histocompatibility complex class I polypeptide-related sequence A/B on radioresistant MCF-7 cells after exposure of cytokine-induced killer cells to sensitized targets. In addition, we demonstrated that cytokine-induced killer cell treatment sensitized breast cancer cells to chemotherapy via the downregulation of TK1, TYMS, and MDR1. These results indicate that cytokine-induced killer cell treatment in combination with radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy may induce synergistic antitumor activities and represent a novel strategy for breast cancer.
28349782	HR+HER2- breast cancers with growth factor receptor-mediated EMT have a poor prognosis and lapatinib downregulates EMT in MCF-7 cells.	Despite an overall good prognosis, a significant proportion of patients with hormone receptor positive human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 negative breast cancers develop distant metastases. The metastatic potential of epithelial cells is known to be regulated by tumor-stromal interaction and mediated by epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Hormone receptor positive human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 negative tumors were used to estimate markers of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, and the luminal breast cancer cell line MCF-7 was used to examine the interactions between integrins and growth factor receptors in causation of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. A total of 140 primary tumors were sub-divided into groups enriched for the markers of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (snail family transcriptional repressor 2 and integrin beta6) versus those with low levels. Within the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition+ tumors, there was a positive correlation between the transcripts of integrin beta6 and growth factor receptors-human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 and epidermal growth factor receptor. In tumors enriched for epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition markers, patients with tumors with the highest quartile of growth factor receptor transcripts had a shorter disease-free survival compared to patients with low growth factor receptor expression by Kaplan-Meier analysis (log rank, p = 0.03). Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition was induced in MCF-7 cells by treatment with transforming growth factor beta 1 and confirmed by upregulation of SNAI1 and SNAI2 transcripts, increase of vimentin and integrin beta6 protein, and repression of E-cadherin. Treatment of these cells with the dual-specificity tyrosine-kinase inhibitor lapatinib led to downregulation of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition as indicated by lower levels of SNAI1 and SNAI2 transcripts, integrin alphavbeta6, and matrix metalloproteinase 9 protein. The results suggest that synergistic interactions between growth factor receptors and integrin beta6 could mediate epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and migration in a subset of luminal breast cancers and lapatinib might be effective in disrupting this interaction.
28349054	Impact of Different Analytic Approaches on the Analysis of the Breast Fibroglandular Tissue Using Diffusion Weighted Imaging.	Purpose. This study investigated the impact of the different region of interest (ROI) approaches on measurement of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values in the breast firbroglandular tissue (FT). Methods. Breast MR images of 38 women diagnosed with unilateral breast cancer were studied. Percent density (PD) and ADC were measured from the contralateral normal breast. Four different ROIs were used for ADC measurement. The measured PD and ADC were correlated. Results. Among the four ROIs, the manually placed small ROI on FT gave the highest mean ADC (ADC = 1839 +/- 343 [x10-6 mm2/s]), while measurement from the whole breast gave the lowest mean ADC (ADC = 933 +/- 383 [x10-6 mm2/s]). The ADC measured from the whole breast was highly correlated with PD with r = 0.95. In slice-to-slice comparison, the central slices with more FT had higher ADC values than the peripheral slices did, presumably due to less partial volume effect from fat. Conclusions. Our results indicated that the measured ADC heavily depends on the composition of breast tissue contained in the ROI used for the ADC measurements. Women with low breast density showing lower ADC values were most likely due to the partial volume effect of fatty tissues.
28347251	Feedback regulation of methyl methanesulfonate and ultraviolet-sensitive gene clone 81 via ATM/Chk2 pathway contributes to the resistance of MCF-7 breast cancer cells to cisplatin.	The methyl methanesulfonate and ultraviolet-sensitive gene clone 81 protein is a structure-specific nuclease that plays important roles in DNA replication and repair. Knockdown of methyl methanesulfonate and ultraviolet-sensitive gene clone 81 has been found to sensitize cancer cells to chemotherapy. However, the underlying molecular mechanism is not well understood. We found that methyl methanesulfonate and ultraviolet-sensitive gene clone 81 was upregulated and the ATM/Chk2 pathway was activated at the same time when MCF-7 cells were treated with cisplatin. By using lentivirus targeting methyl methanesulfonate and ultraviolet-sensitive gene clone 81 gene, we showed that knockdown of methyl methanesulfonate and ultraviolet-sensitive gene clone 81 enhanced cell apoptosis and inhibited cell proliferation in MCF-7 cells under cisplatin treatment. Abrogation of ATM/Chk2 pathway inhibited cell viability in MCF-7 cells in response to cisplatin. Importantly, we revealed that ATM/Chk2 was required for the upregulation of methyl methanesulfonate and ultraviolet-sensitive gene clone 81, and knockdown of methyl methanesulfonate and ultraviolet-sensitive gene clone 81 resulted in inactivation of ATM/Chk2 pathway in response to cisplatin. Meanwhile, knockdown of methyl methanesulfonate and ultraviolet-sensitive gene clone 81 activated the p53/Bcl-2 pathway in response to cisplatin. These data suggest that the ATM/Chk2 may promote the repair of DNA damage caused by cisplatin by sustaining methyl methanesulfonate and ultraviolet-sensitive gene clone 81, and the double-strand breaks generated by methyl methanesulfonate and ultraviolet-sensitive gene clone 81 may activate the ATM/Chk2 pathway in turn, which provide a novel mechanism of how methyl methanesulfonate and ultraviolet-sensitive gene clone 81 modulates DNA damage response and repair.
28347249	Chemoresistance is associated with overexpression of HAX-1, inhibition of which resensitizes drug-resistant breast cancer cells to chemotherapy.	Acquired resistance to standard chemotherapy is the common and critical limitation for cancer therapy. Hematopoietic cell-specific protein 1-associated protein X-1 (HAX-1) has been reported to be upregulated in numerous cancers. However, the role of HAX-1 in oncotherapy remains unclear. In this study, we established MDA-MB-231 cell lines which were resistant to cisplatin (MDA-MB-231/CR) or doxorubicin (MDA-MB-231/DR) to study the chemoresistance in breast cancer. As a result, the HAX-1 which is an apoptosis-associated protein was observed to be overexpressed in both MDA-MB-231/CR and MDA-MB-231/DR compared with the routine MDA-MB-231 cells. Moreover, knockdown of HAX-1 via RNA interference decreased IC50 level of cisplatin by 70.91% in MDA-MB-231/CR cells, and the IC50 level of doxorubicin was decreased by 76.46% in MDA-MB-231/DR cells when the HAX-1 was downregulated. Additionally, we found that the knockdown of HAX-1 induced the release of cytochrome C from mitochondria, resulting in the activation of caspases. Taken together, our study indicates that the overexpression of HAX-1 is essential in the development of chemoresistance in breast cancer. Furthermore, we identify that HAX-1 may become the target for cancer therapy.
28347244	The miR-30 family: Versatile players in breast cancer.	The microRNA family, miR-30, plays diverse roles in regulating key aspects of neoplastic transformation, metastasis, and clinical outcomes in different types of tumors. Accumulating evidence proves that miR-30 family is pivotal in the breast cancer development by controlling critical signaling pathways and relevant oncogenes. Here, we review the roles of miR-30 family members in the tumorigenesis, metastasis, and drug resistance of breast cancer, and their application to predict the prognosis of breast cancer patients. We think miR-30 family members would be promising biomarkers for breast cancer and may bring a novel insight in molecular targeted therapy of breast cancer.
28347241	Nestin and cluster of differentiation 146 expression in breast cancer: Predicting early recurrence by targeting metastasis?	The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between the expression of stem-cell markers nestin and cluster of differentiation 146 with clinicopathological characteristics in breast cancer and to determine whether a prognostic impact of nestin and CD146 expression exists regarding occurrence of disease relapse in breast cancer. A total of 141 patients who were histologically diagnosed with breast cancer and underwent radical operations from November 2006 to October 2013 in Laiko General Hospital, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, were enrolled in the study. CD146 and nestin protein expression were evaluated using immunohistochemistry. Nestin expression was observed in 18.4% (26/141) of the cases, while CD146 expression was observed in 35.5% (50/141) of the cases. Nestin expression is significantly higher in younger patients with breast cancer. Nestin and CD146 expression were not correlated with the tumor size and the presence of lymph node metastasis. On the contrary, a significantly higher expression of nestin and CD146 was observed with triple-negative cancers (p < 0.0001 for both markers), low differentiated tumors (p = 0.021 for nestin and p = 0.008 for CD146), and increased Ki-67 expression (p = 0.007 for nestin and p < 0.0001 for CD146). The nestin-positive group of patients and the CD146-positive group of patients presented significantly higher rates of disease recurrence (log-rank test, p = 0.022 for nestin and p = 0.003 for CD146) with a distant metastasis, 30 months after the primary treatment. CD146 but not nestin, however, predicted independently (p = 0.047) disease recurrence. Nestin and CD146 are expressed in breast cancer cells with highly aggressive potency. They might contribute to disease relapse in breast cancer by activating the epithelial-mesenchymal transition pathway and assist tumor neovascularization.
28347240	Computer-aided prognosis on breast cancer with hematoxylin and eosin histopathology images: A review.	With the advance of digital pathology, image analysis has begun to show its advantages in information analysis of hematoxylin and eosin histopathology images. Generally, histological features in hematoxylin and eosin images are measured to evaluate tumor grade and prognosis for breast cancer. This review summarized recent works in image analysis of hematoxylin and eosin histopathology images for breast cancer prognosis. First, prognostic factors for breast cancer based on hematoxylin and eosin histopathology images were summarized. Then, usual procedures of image analysis for breast cancer prognosis were systematically reviewed, including image acquisition, image preprocessing, image detection and segmentation, and feature extraction. Finally, the prognostic value of image features and image feature-based prognostic models was evaluated. Moreover, we discussed the issues of current analysis, and some directions for future research.
28347225	Magnetic resonance imaging tumor regression shrinkage patterns after neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with locally advanced breast cancer: Correlation with tumor biological subtypes and pathological response after therapy.	The objective of this study is to analyze magnetic resonance imaging shrinkage pattern of tumor regression after neoadjuvant chemotherapy and to evaluate its relationship with biological subtypes and pathological response. We reviewed the magnetic resonance imaging studies of 51 patients with single mass-enhancing lesions (performed at time 0 and at the II and last cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy). Tumors were classified as Luminal A, Luminal B, HER2+, and Triple Negative based on biological and immunohistochemical analysis after core needle biopsy. We classified shrinkage pattern, based on tumor regression morphology on magnetic resonance imaging at the II cycle, as concentric, nodular, and mixed. We assigned a numeric score (0: none; 1: low; 2: medium; 3: high) to the enhancement intensity decrease. Pathological response on the surgical specimen was classified as complete (grade 5), partial (grades 4-3), and non-response (grades 1-2) according to Miller and Payne system. Fisher test was used to relate shrinkage pattern with biological subtypes and final pathological response. Seventeen patients achieved complete response, 25 partial response, and 9 non-response. A total of 13 lesions showed nodular pattern, 20 concentric, and 18 mixed. We found an association between concentric pattern and HER2+ (p < 0.001) and mixed pattern and Luminal A lesions (p < 0.001). We observed a statistical significant correlation between concentric pattern and complete response (p < 0.001) and between mixed pattern and non-response (p = 0.005). Enhancement intensity decrease 3 was associated with complete response (p < 0.001). Shrinkage pattern and enhancement intensity decrease may serve as early response indicators after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Shrinkage pattern correlates with tumor biological subtypes.
28343630	De Novo Truncating Mutations in the Last and Penultimate Exons of PPM1D Cause an Intellectual Disability Syndrome.	Intellectual disability (ID) is a highly heterogeneous disorder involving at least 600 genes, yet a genetic diagnosis remains elusive in approximately 35%-40% of individuals with moderate to severe ID. Recent meta-analyses statistically analyzing de novo mutations in >7,000 individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders highlighted mutations in PPM1D as a possible cause of ID. PPM1D is a type 2C phosphatase that functions as a negative regulator of cellular stress-response pathways by mediating a feedback loop of p38-p53 signaling, thereby contributing to growth inhibition and suppression of stress-induced apoptosis. We identified 14 individuals with mild to severe ID and/or developmental delay and de novo truncating PPM1D mutations. Additionally, deep phenotyping revealed overlapping behavioral problems (ASD, ADHD, and anxiety disorders), hypotonia, broad-based gait, facial dysmorphisms, and periods of fever and vomiting. PPM1D is expressed during fetal brain development and in the adult brain. All mutations were located in the last or penultimate exon, suggesting escape from nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. Both PPM1D expression analysis and cDNA sequencing in EBV LCLs of individuals support the presence of a stable truncated transcript, consistent with this hypothesis. Exposure of cells derived from individuals with PPM1D truncating mutations to ionizing radiation resulted in normal p53 activation, suggesting that p53 signaling is unaffected. However, a cell-growth disadvantage was observed, suggesting a possible effect on the stress-response pathway. Thus, we show that de novo truncating PPM1D mutations in the last and penultimate exons cause syndromic ID, which provides additional insight into the role of cell-cycle checkpoint genes in neurodevelopmental disorders.
28343538	Accelerated hypofractionated adjuvant whole breast radiation with simultaneous integrated boost using volumetric modulated arc therapy for early breast cancer: A phase I/II dosimetric and clinical feasibility study from a tertiary cancer care centre of India.	BACKGROUND: Hypofractionation has become standard of care after Breast Conserving Therapy (BCT) in many European and few others western countries. Though still debatable, tumor cavity boost is routinely practised in our centre. Hypofractionation is not yet the current standard of practice in Asian countries. Employing hypofractionation and simultaneous integrated boost to lumpectomy cavity with conformal technique is not the current practice in this region. Hence the study was performed to see whether accelerated hypofractionation and simultaneous boost can be combined using volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) in treating early breast cancer (EBC) patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Female patients with EBC treated by whole breast radiation and boost were treated simultaneously to a dose of 40.5Gy and 48Gy in fifteen fractions over three weeks to entire breast and tumor cavity respectively with VMAT. Dosimetry including target coverage, OAR (organ at risk) sparing and acute radiation toxicity were evaluated. RESULTS: Ten consecutive patients were treated. Planning target volume (PTV) coverage and OAR sparing were mostly satisfactory. Mean volume of PTVWB and PTVBoost were 786.18cm3 and 228.9cm3 respectively. Mean Dmean to PTVWB and PTVBOOST were 41.9Gy and 49.1Gy respectively. Dmax to PTVWB and PTVBOOST were 127.56% and 110.67% respectively. Ipsilateral lung mean dose and V20 were 13.92Gy and 21.53% respectively. V40 and V25 of heart were 0.17% and 2.25% respectively. All patients are disease free after a median follow up of two years. Most acute toxicities were Grade1. Only two patients out of ten developed Grade 2 skin reaction during radiation. Early cosmesis using Harvard cosmesis scale is good to excellent. CONCLUSIONS: Accelerated hypofractionated RT using SIB-VMAT is a clinically feasible technique with acceptable initial result. Initial results are encouraging. MINI ABSTRACT: Simultaneous integrated boost with accelerated hypofractionated whole breast radiotherapy using Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy is a novel approach. Patient selection and technical considerations are of paramount importance. The present study describes successful implementation of this approach.
28341031	Surveillance of women with a personal history of breast cancer by tumour subtype.	AIM: To determine if the rate and timing of a second breast cancer event (SBCE) in women with a personal history of breast cancer varies by disease subtype or breast imaging method. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective review was performed of women with a SBCE from January 2006 to December 2010 at a single institution. Data analysed included oestrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status of the primary and second breast cancers; mammographic and ultrasound (US) features from SBCE; and the time interval between both events. RESULTS: Of 207 patients diagnosed with a SBCE, the median age at first diagnosis was 50.6 years, range 24.8 to 80.2; at second diagnosis was 56.2 years, range 25.8 to 87.9. Eleven percent of SBCE were diagnosed >10 years after the primary cancer diagnosis. The median time between the first and second diagnosis for ER-positive patients was 2.7 years (range 0.7-17.4 years); and 1.9 years for ER-negative patients, (range 0.4-23.4 years; p<0.002). Patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) had a shorter time between diagnoses than others (p=0.0003). At 3, 5, and 10 years, 85%, 92%, and 97% of ER-negative and 54%, 81%, and 95% of ER-positive tumours, respectively, had recurred. ER-negative tumours and TNBC were more likely to be visible at US. CONCLUSION: There may be a role for customised imaging surveillance of women with a personal history of breast cancer (PHBC) after 10 years. Further studies are necessary to determine if US may be valuable in the surveillance of patients with ER-negative and TNBC tumours.
28339285	Is the necrosis/wall ADC ratio useful for the differentiation of benign and malignant breast lesions?	OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the necrosis/wall apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) ratio is useful for the malignant-benign differentiation of necrotic breast lesions. METHODS: Breast MRI was performed using a 3-T system. In this retrospective study, calculation of the necrosis/wall ADC ratio was based on ADC values measured from the necrosis and from the wall of malignant and benign breast lesions by diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI). By synchronizing post-contrast T1 weighted images, the separate parts of wall and necrosis were maintained. All the diagnoses were pathologically confirmed. Statistical analyses were conducted using an independent sample t-test and receiver operating characteristic analysis. The intraclass and interclass correlations were evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 66 female patients were enrolled, 38 of whom had necrotic breast carcinomas and 28 of whom had breast abscesses. The ADC values were obtained from both the wall and necrosis. The mean necrosis/wall ADC ratio (+/- standard deviation) was 1.61 +/- 0.51 in carcinomas, and it was 0.65 +/- 0.33 in abscesses. The area under the curve values for necrosis ADC, wall ADC and the necrosis/wall ADC ratio were 0.680, 0.068 and 0.942, respectively. A wall/necrosis ADC ratio cut-off value of 1.18 demonstrated a sensitivity of 97%, specificity of 93%, a positive-predictive value of 95%, a negative-predictive value of 96% and an accuracy of 95% in determining the malignant nature of necrotic breast lesions. There was a good intra- and interclass reliability for the ADC values of both necrosis and wall. CONCLUSION: The necrosis/wall ADC ratio appears to be a reliable and promising tool for discriminating breast carcinomas from abscesses using DWI. Advances in knowledge: ADC values of the necrosis obtained by DWI are valuable for malignant-benign differentiation in necrotic breast lesions. The necrosis/wall ADC ratio appears to be a reliable and promising tool in the breast imaging field.
28338879	Evidence for Detection Bias by Medication Use in a Cohort Study of Breast Cancer Survivors.	In previous studies, we found modestly decreased and increased risks of second breast cancer events with the use of statins and antibiotics, respectively, after adjustment for surveillance mammography. We evaluated detection bias by comparing receipt of surveillance mammography among users of these 2 disparate classes of medication. Adult women diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer during 1990-2008 (n = 3,965) while enrolled in an integrated health-care plan (Group Health Cooperative; Washington State) were followed for up to 10 years in the Commonly Used Medications and Breast Cancer Outcomes (COMBO) Study. Categories of antibiotic use included infrequent (1-3 dispensings/12 months) and frequent (>/=4 dispensings/12 months) use, and categories of statin use included less adherent (1 dispensing/6 months) and adherent (>/=2 dispensings/6 months). We examined associations between medication use and surveillance mammography using multivariable generalized estimating equations and evaluated the impact of adjusting for surveillance within Cox proportional hazard models. Frequent antibiotic users were less likely to receive surveillance mammography (odds ratio (OR) = 0.90, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.82, 0.99) than were nonusers; no association was found among infrequent users (OR = 0.96, 95% CI: 0.90, 1.03). Adherent statin use was associated with more surveillance compared with nonuse (OR = 1.11, 95% CI: 1.01, 1.25), but less adherent statin use was not (OR = 1.03, 95% CI: 0.81, 1.31). No difference in associations between medications of interest and second breast cancer events was observed when surveillance was removed from otherwise adjusted models. The influence of detection bias by medication use warrants further exploration.
28335647	Sorafenib for the treatment of breast cancer.	INTRODUCTION: Breast cancer treatment includes many options depending on the tumor clinicopathological profile, which groups breast cancer into various subtypes. Bevacizumab is currently the only drug capable of targeting angiogenesis in breast cancer. Sorafenib has also been studied in combination with other agents. Areas covered: Pharmacological aspects of sorafenib, including results from preclinical studies on breast cancer cells; findings about clinical efficacy and safety in both single-arm and randomized clinical trials; ongoing trials. Expert opinion: Since sorafenib as a single agent has shown limited efficacy in breast cancer, its combination with other drugs is under investigation. Dose reduction is the main challenge when sorafenib is combined with chemotherapy or endocrine therapy. Although randomized phase-II trials on sorafenib plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone have shown potential benefits in progression-free survival, preliminary results from a phase-III study in combination with capecitabine are negative. The definitive results of this trial and results from other ongoing phase-II trials will determine further developments of sorafenib in breast cancer. Although these additional data could help determine the most appropriate dose, drug combination and patient settings, a confirmation of the preliminary negative results reported in the phase-III trial are likely to discourage further use of sorafenib in breast cancer, given its non-negligible toxicity, lack of predicting markers, and the number of more promising drugs for breast cancer.
28335433	Evaluation and Adaptation of a Laboratory-Based cDNA Library Preparation Protocol for Retrospective Sequencing of Archived MicroRNAs from up to 35-Year-Old Clinical FFPE Specimens.	Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) specimens, when used in conjunction with patient clinical data history, represent an invaluable resource for molecular studies of cancer. Even though nucleic acids extracted from archived FFPE tissues are degraded, their molecular analysis has become possible. In this study, we optimized a laboratory-based next-generation sequencing barcoded cDNA library preparation protocol for analysis of small RNAs recovered from archived FFPE tissues. Using matched fresh and FFPE specimens, we evaluated the robustness and reproducibility of our optimized approach, as well as its applicability to archived clinical specimens stored for up to 35 years. We then evaluated this cDNA library preparation protocol by performing a miRNA expression analysis of archived breast ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) specimens, selected for their relation to the risk of subsequent breast cancer development and obtained from six different institutions. Our analyses identified six miRNAs (miR-29a, miR-221, miR-375, miR-184, miR-363, miR-455-5p) differentially expressed between DCIS lesions from women who subsequently developed an invasive breast cancer (cases) and women who did not develop invasive breast cancer within the same time interval (control). Our thorough evaluation and application of this laboratory-based miRNA sequencing analysis indicates that the preparation of small RNA cDNA libraries can reliably be performed on older, archived, clinically-classified specimens.
28334272	17beta-estradiol-induced ACSL4 protein expression promotes an invasive phenotype in estrogen receptor positive mammary carcinoma cells.	Long chain acyl-CoA synthase-4 (ACSL4) expression has been associated with an aggressive phenotype in breast carcinoma cells, whereas its role in ERalpha-positive breast cancer has not been studied. ACSL4 prefers 20-carbon polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) substrates, and along with other ACSLs has been associated with cellular uptake of exogenous fatty acids. 17beta-estradiol induces proliferation and invasive capacities in ERalpha+ve breast carcinoma that is associated with modifications of cellular lipid metabolism. In this study, treatment of steroid-starved ERalpha-positive MCF-7 and T47D mammary carcinoma cells with 17beta-estradiol resulted in increased cellular uptake of the PUFA arachidonic acid (AA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), important building blocks for cellular membranes, and increased ACSL4 protein levels. There was no change in the expression of the ACSL1, ACSL3 and ACSL6 protein isotypes. Increased ACSL4 protein expression was not accompanied by changes in ACSL4 mRNA expression, but was associated with a significant increase in the protein half-life compared to untreated cells. ERalpha silencing reversed the impact of 17beta-estradiol on ACSL4 protein levels and half-life. Silencing of ACSL4 eliminated the 17beta-estradiol-induced increase in AA and EPA uptake, as well as the 17beta-estradiol-induced cell migration, proliferation and invasion capacities. ASCL4 silencing also prevented the 17beta-estradiol induced increases in p-Akt and p-GSK3beta, and decrease in E-cadherin expression, important events in epithelial to mesenchymal transition. Taken together, these results demonstrate that ACSL4 is a target of 17beta-estradiol-stimulated ERalpha and is required for the cellular uptake of exogenous PUFA and the manifestation of a more malignant phenotype in ERalpha+ve breast carcinoma cells.
28334234	Breast cancer risk-associated variants at 6q25.1 influence risk of hepatocellular carcinoma in a Chinese population.	The gender disparity observed in the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) suggests an important role of estrogens in HCC pathogenesis. In this study, we conducted a case-control study to investigate whether breast cancer risk-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located at estrogens loci identified by genome-wide association studies (GWASs) also predispose to HCC in a Chinese population. Three candidate SNPs at 6q25.1 were genotyped in 2025 HCC cases and 2032 healthy controls. Differential expression analyses and expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analyses were conducted to further explore the potential function of significant SNPs and genes they reside in. Two of the three candidate SNPs (rs9383951 and rs9485372) were observed to be significantly associated with HCC risk. Under a dominant model, the odds ratios (OR) for rs9383951 and rs9485372 were 1.28 (95% CI: 1.10-1.49, P = 0.002) and 1.34 (95% CI: 1.17-1.53, P = 2.75 x 10-5), respectively. We also found a significant accumulative effect of these two SNPs and there was a gradual increase in OR with a greater number of hazard genotypes. Moreover, the association between rs9383951 and HCC risk was specific in males. Lower ESR1 and TAB2 expressions were investigated in hepatic tumor tissues than adjacent normal tissues. We found a significant association between rs9383951 and ESR1 expression (P = 0.047). Besides, ESR1 expression was significantly correlated with the expression of TAB2. Taken together, our study identified two genetic variants at 6q25.1 newly associated with HCC risk, suggesting ESR1 and estrogen signaling may play a role in mediating susceptibility to HCC in Chinese population.
28333070	Evaluation of MCT1, MCT4 and CD147 Genes in Peripheral Blood Cells of Breast Cancer Patients and Their Potential Use as Diagnostic and Prognostic Markers.	BACKGROUND: Patients with breast cancer-the deadliest cancer among women-are at constant risk of developing metastasis. Oxidative stress and hypoxia are common feature of tumor cells that can proliferate even in a resultant metabolic acidosis. Despite the low extracellular pH, intracellular pH of tumor cells remains relatively normal, or even more alkaline due to the action of a membrane protein family known as monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs). The objective of this study was to verify the diagnostic and prognostic value of MCT1, MCT4 and CD147 in tumor and peripheral blood samples of patients with breast cancer undergoing chemotherapic treatment. METHODS: Differential expression of MCT1, MCT4 and CD147 obtained by qPCR was determined by 2-DeltaDeltaCq method between biological samples (tumor and serial samples of peripheral) of patients (n = 125) and healthy women (n = 25). RESULTS: tumor samples with higher histological grades have shown higher expression of these markers; this higher expression was also observed in blood samples obtained at diagnosis of patients when compared to healthy women and in patients with positive progression of the disease (metastasis development). CONCLUSION: markers studied here could be a promising strategy in routine laboratory evaluations as breast cancer diagnosis and prognosis.
28332165	Low microchimeric cell density in tumors suggests alternative antineoplastic mechanism.	Microchimerism has generally been shown to protect against cancer (Gilmore et al. in Exp Hematol 36(9):1073-1077, 2008). The mechanism of how this occurs is an area of intense study, as it may lead to new cancer treatments. The leading theory is that microchimeric cells perform immune surveillance by directly fighting cancerous cells and that they also act as stem cells, repairing damaged tissue (Khosrotehrani et al. in JAMA 292:75-80, 2004). However, there is conflicting evidence to support this theory. Several small studies have found few microchimeric cells in tumor tissue (Gadi in Breast Cancer Res Treat 121(1):241-244, 2010; Cirello et al. in Int J Cancer 126:2874-2878, 2010), while another study contradicted these findings by showing microchimeric cells clustered around tumor tissue (O'Donoghue et al. in Reprod Biomed Online 16:382-390, 2008). To date, we have designed the largest and broadest study to investigate this question of whether microchimeric cells really do cluster at tumor tissue. We analyzed 245 samples from a broad range of cancer types. Using PCR for the male chromosome marker TSPY1, we identified only 12 out of 245 samples with microchimerism for a rate of 4.9% (95% confidence interval 2.2-7.6%). Five of these samples were confirmed using Y fluorescence in situ hybridization. This rate of 4.9% microchimerism is the lowest reported in any study. The low percentage of microchimerism observed in our broad study suggests that microchimeric cells do not invade tumors to fight off neoplasm.
28328843	Clinical significance of interval changes in breast lesions initially categorized as probably benign on breast ultrasound.	The aims of this study were to determine the malignancy rate of probably benign lesions that show an interval change on follow-up ultrasound and to evaluate the differences seen on imaging between benign and malignant lesions initially categorized as probably benign but with interval change on follow-up breast ultrasound.We retrospectively reviewed 11,323 lesions from ultrasound-guided core-biopsies performed between June 2004 and December 2014 and identified 289 lesions (266 patients) with an interval change from probably benign (Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System [BI-RADS] category 3) in the previous 2 years. Malignancy rates were compared according to the ultrasound findings and the characteristics of the interval changes, including changes in morphology and/or diameter.The malignancy rate for probably benign lesions that showed an interval change on follow-up ultrasound was 6.9% (20/289). The malignancy rate was higher for clustered cysts (33.3%) and irregular or noncircumscribed masses (12.7%) than for circumscribed oval masses (5%) or complicated cysts (5%) seen on initial ultrasound (P = 0.043). Fifty-five percent of the malignancies were found to be ductal carcinoma in situ and there was 1 case of lymph node metastasis among the patients with invasive disease in whom biopsy was delayed by 6 to 15 months. The extent of invasiveness was greater in missed cases. There was a significant difference in the maximal diameter change between the 20 malignant lesions and the 269 benign lesions (4.0 mm vs 2.7 mm, P = 0.002). The cutoff value for maximal diameter change per initial diameter was 39.0% for predicting malignancy (sensitivity 95%, specificity 53.5%). The malignancy rate for morphologically changed lesions was significantly higher than for morphologically stable lesions (13.6% vs 4.9%; P = 0.024)Our 6.9% of probably benign lesions that showed an interval change finally turned out to be malignancy was mostly DCIS. The sonographic features, interval changes in sonographic features, and lesion size might help in the recategorization of these lesions.
28328217	Development of a Selective Inhibitor of Protein Arginine Deiminase 2.	Protein arginine deiminase 2 (PAD2) plays a key role in the onset and progression of multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and breast cancer. To date, no PAD2-selective inhibitor has been developed. Such a compound will be critical for elucidating the biological roles of this isozyme and may ultimately be useful for treating specific diseases in which PAD2 activity is dysregulated. To achieve this goal, we synthesized a series of benzimidazole-based derivatives of Cl-amidine, hypothesizing that this scaffold would allow access to a series of PAD2-selective inhibitors with enhanced cellular efficacy. Herein, we demonstrate that substitutions at both the N-terminus and C-terminus of Cl-amidine result in >100-fold increases in PAD2 potency and selectivity (30a, 41a, and 49a) as well as cellular efficacy (30a). Notably, these compounds use the far less reactive fluoroacetamidine warhead. In total, we predict that 30a will be a critical tool for understanding cellular PAD2 function and sets the stage for treating diseases in which PAD2 activity is dysregulated.
28325390	Patterns of distribution of giant congenital melanocytic nevi (GCMN): The 6B rule.	BACKGROUND: Garment-related terms have been used to describe the pattern of distribution of giant congenital melanocytic nevi (GCMN). OBJECTIVE: We sought to describe patterns of distribution of GCMN and propose a classification scheme. METHODS: Photographic records of patients with GCMN from the Hospital Clinic of Barcelona were analyzed and a classification based on observed GCMN distribution patterns was created. The classification was independently applied by 8 observers to cases found in the literature. The interobserver agreement was assessed. RESULTS: Among 22 patients we observed 6 repeatable patterns of distribution of GCMN, which we termed the "6B": bolero (involving the upper aspect of the back, including the neck), back (on the back, without involvement of the buttocks or shoulders), bathing trunk (involving the genital region and buttocks), breast/belly (isolated to the chest or abdomen without involvement of bolero or bathing trunk distributions), body extremity (isolated to extremity), and body (both bolero and bathing trunk involvement). Our literature search found 113 cases of GCMN, which we were able to classify into 1 of the 6B patterns with an overall kappa of 0.89. LIMITATIONS: Some patterns occur infrequently with a dearth of images available for analysis. CONCLUSIONS: The anatomic distribution of GCMN occurs in 6 recognizable and repeatable patterns.
28325197	East Versus West: Differences in Surgical Management in Asia Compared with Europe and North America.	In recent decades, there has been considerable worldwide progress in the treatment of gastric cancer. Gastrectomy with a modified D2 lymphadenectomy (sparing the distal pancreas and spleen) has increasingly gained acceptance as a preferable standard surgical approach among surgeons in the East and the West. Despite growing consensus significant differences still exist in surgical techniques in clinical trials and clinical practices secondary to variations in epidemiology, clinicopathologic features, and surgical outcomes among geographic regions. In addition, Western physicians tend to prefer adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy after surgery instead of using S-1 chemotherapy, as is the preference in the East.
28325191	Genetics of Gastric Cancer.	Gastric cancer represents a major cause of cancer mortality worldwide despite a declining incidence. New molecular classification schemes developed from genomic and molecular analyses of gastric cancer have provided a framework for understanding this heterogenous disease, and early findings suggest these classifications will be relevant for designing and implementing new targeted therapies. The success of targeted therapy and immunotherapy in breast cancer and melanoma, respectively, has not been duplicated in gastric cancer, but trastuzumab and ramucirumab have demonstrated efficacy in select populations. New markers that predict therapeutic response are needed to improve patient selection for both targeted and immunotherapies.
28323779	GATA3 and MYB Expression in Cutaneous Adnexal Neoplasms.	Knowledge of staining pattern of certain immunostains might be useful in the classification of cutaneous adnexal tumors that can have clinical importance. We studied GATA3 and MYB expression in archival materials of 220 adnexal tumors comprised of sebaceous carcinomas, follicular tumors, apocrine carcinoma, predominantly apocrine tumors, predominantly eccrine tumors, and others including adenoid cystic carcinomas. Nuclear GATA3 expression was seen in 70% (153/220) of cases, including sebaceous carcinoma (93%), apocrine carcinoma (93%), follicular neoplasms (100%), and predominantly apocrine neoplasms (69%), yet only 38% of predominantly eccrine neoplasms. Nuclear MYB expression was seen in 43% (81/188) of cases, including adenoid cystic carcinoma (90%), predominantly apocrine tumors (66%), follicular neoplasms (49%), apocrine carcinomas (14%), predominantly eccrine tumors (11%), and sebaceous carcinomas (4%). GATA3 and MYB expression were noted in 43% (9/21) and 24% (5/21) of cutaneous metastases, respectively. Expression of both GATA3 and MYB was noted in 33% (60/184) of primary adnexal tumors versus 19% (4/21) of cutaneous metastases. GATA3 preferentially labels tumors with follicular, sebaceous, and apocrine differentiation. MYB is potentially a helpful stain in the distinction of desmoplastic trichoepithelioma versus basal cell carcinoma. The coexpression of GATA3 and MYB might be helpful in the distinction of primary cutaneous adnexal carcinoma versus metastatic breast, salivary gland, or urothelial carcinoma.
28322779	Semisynthetic oleanane triterpenoids inhibit migration and invasion of human breast cancer cells through downregulated expression of the ITGB1/PTK2/PXN pathway.	This paper reports a study on the role of two synthetic derivatives of oleanolic acid (OA), HIMOXOL and Br-HIMOLID, in the regulation of cell migration and invasion and the underlying molecular mechanisms of breast cancer cells. The effect of the compounds on four breast cancer cell lines (MCF7, MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468, and T-47D) and also on noncancerous breast cells, MCF-12A, was reported. The compounds had no effect on the migration of MCF-12A cells. However, both the derivatives revealed a higher cytotoxicity than the maternal compound OA, and in sub-cytotoxic concentrations, they decreased the migration of MCF7, MDA-MB-231, and MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells and also the invasion of MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cells; although, the derivatives had no effect on the migration and invasion of T-47D cells. Both the derivatives of OA inhibited the cell migratory and invasive abilities of breast cancer cells by downregulating the expressions of ITGB1, PTK2, and PXN genes and by decreasing the phosphorylation status and the level of its respective proteins (integrin beta1, FAK, and paxillin, respectively). This study is the first to report the antimigratory and anti-invasive activities of HIMOXOL and Br-HIMOLID in breast cancer cells.
28322778	Down-regulation of cyclin-dependent kinase-4 and MAPK through estrogen receptor mediated cell cycle arrest in human breast cancer induced by gold nanoparticle tagged toxin protein NKCT1.	AIM: The aim of this study was to determine whether gold nanoparticles conjugated cytotoxic protein NKCT1 (GNP-NKCT1) acted through the estrogen receptor mediated pathway in MCF-7 cells and to establish the MAPK and PI3k/Akt signal transduction pathway. METHODS: Apoptosis was done by flow cytometry. BrdU incorporation and nuclear proliferating antigen was measured by flow cytometry. Wound healing assay along with matrigel chamber invasion and migration was done. Expression of MMP9 was checked by flow cytometry and also by gelatin zymography. To analyze the regulation of signaling protein, western blot was done. MTT assay was done to evaluate the ligand receptor pathway using the estrogen receptor negative cell line (MDA-MB-231) for inhibitor effects. RESULTS: Treatment of GNP-NKCT1 (3.9 mug/ml) exhibited 38.04% early apoptosis and 4.29% late apoptotic cell. GNP-NKCT1 significantly inhibited both cell migration and invasion with suppressed expression of MMP9. In addition, treatment of cultured human breast cancer MCF7 cells with GNP-NKCT1 reversely suppressed the incorporation of BrdU, with reduced expression of Ki-67. The western blot analysis showed that GNP-NKCT1 arrested cell cycle progression through upregulation of the kinase inhibitor protein p21 and inactivation of G1-cylin dependent kinase (CDK4). GNP-NKCT1 suppressed nuclear translocation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) and also abrogated the phosphorylation of p38 mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK), phosphatidylinositide-3-kinase (PI3k), Akt and extracellular regulated kinase (ERK1/2). MTT assay indicated that GNP-NKCT1 reduced proliferation in the estrogen receptor induced ER negative breast cancer cell line (MDA-MB-231). Addition of, ER inhibitor (tamoxifen) and PI3K inhibitor (wortmannin) to cells resulted in reduced expression of Ki-67 and MMP-9. CONCLUSION: The data suggested that GNP-NKCT1 induced MCF7 cell inhibition may occur through estrogen receptor pathway via inactivation of CDK4 and inactivation of PI3K/Akt, ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK signaling pathway with inhibitory effects on NF-kappaB, reducing the activity of MMP9. This result provides a new mechanism to explain the role of gold nanoparticles conjugated NKCT1 as a potent anti-metastatic agent in MCF7 cells.
28322144	Antioxidant and Antiproliferative Potential of Fruiting Bodies of the Wild-Growing King Bolete Mushroom, Boletus edulis (Agaricomycetes), from Western Serbia.	The aim of this work was to study the bioactivity of crude aqueous and ethanolic extracts of Boletus edulis prepared from caps and stipes of wild-growing basidiocarps collected from the Prijepolje region (western Serbia). The bioactivity screening included antioxidant (2,2-diphenyl-l-picrylhydrazyl [DPPH], nitric oxide, super-oxide anion*, and hydroxyl radicals and ferric-reducing antioxidant power) and antiproliferative MTT assays (human breast MCF-7 cancer cell line). In addition, all extracts were primarily characterized by ultraviolet/visible spectrophotometry to determine total phenolic and flavonoid contents. The highest anti-DPPH and anti-hydroxyl radical activity were observed in aqueous B. edulis extract from the caps (half maximal inhibitory concentration [IC50] = 50.97 mug/ mL and 2.05 mug/mL, respectively), whereas the highest anti-nitric oxide radical activity was observed in aqueous B. edulis extract from the stipes (IC50 = 10.74 mug/mL). The ethanolic extract obtained from the mushroom stipe showed higher anti-superoxide anion radical activity (IC50 = 9.84 mug/mL) and ferric-reducing antioxidant power (22.14 mg ascorbic acid equivalents/g dry weight) compared with aqueous extracts. Total phenolic content for all extracts was similar but total flavonoid content was significantly higher in the aqueous B. edulis extract from the caps (4.5 mg quercetin equivalents/g dry weight). All crude extracts showed activity against the MCF-7 cell line, with the ethanolic extract of B. edulis prepared from stipes (IC50 = 56 mug/mL) being the most potent. This is, to our knowledge, the first report of the antiproliferative effects of crude aqueous and ethanolic extracts prepared from caps and stipes of wild-growing basidiocarps of B. edulis on the human breast MCF-7 cancer cell line.
28322141	Lessons Learned from Gemcitabine: Impact of Therapeutic Carrier Systems and Gemcitabine's Drug Conjugates on Cancer Therapy.	Currently, drug delivery systems have a high impact in cancer therapy and are receiving more attention than conventional cancer treatment modalities. Compared with current cancer therapies, gemcitabine (2', 2'-difluoro-2'-deoxycytidine) has been proven to be an effective chemotherapeutic agent against pancreatic, colon, bladder, breast, ovarian, non-small-cell lung, and head and neck cancers in combination with other anticancer agents. To improve the safety and efficacy of cytotoxic drugs, several drug delivery systems have been explored. This review outlines the recent work directed toward gemcitabine delivery systems for cancer therapy, including aerosols, polymeric nanoparticles, liposomes, microparticles, carbon nanotubes, and multifunctional theranostic nanomedicines. It also provides insight into the design and development of gemcitabine conjugation for safe and effective cancer therapy. Despite the clinical promises of gemcitabine, many therapeutic challenges remain. Specifically, its therapeutic use in cancer chemotherapy is impeded by a short biological half-life, caused by its rapid metabolism, and resistance due to increased expression of ribonucleotide reductase. In our opinion, many research investigations have contributed to improve the selectivity and efficacy of gemcitabine. This combined approach of drug delivery systems and gemcitabine conjugates has shown promising efficacy in preclinical models and significant potential for future clinical cancer-therapeutic applications. Also, these strategies overcome most of the aforementioned limits of gemcitabine.
28316306	Evolving Trends and Influencing Factors in Mastectomy Decisions.	It is known that survival is unaffected by the choice of surgical management for breast cancer (BC) patients. Despite this fact, recent literature reveals that the number of bilateral mastectomies (BMs) in the United States is increasing. In an effort to elucidate potential factors influencing this trend, we investigated socioeconomic and clinicopathologic characteristics of our patient cohort that could have affected a patient's decision between unilateral mastectomy (UM) versus BM. Five-hundred-eight patients with unilateral BC who underwent mastectomy between 2000 and 2009 were analyzed: 397-UM; 111-BM. Influence of patient's age, insurance status, residence (rural versus urban), subsequent reconstruction, marital status, smoking history, family cancer history, cancer stage and grade on the BM versus UM patient's decision were analyzed using independent sample t tests, chi2 and logistic regression analysis. BM was more likely to be chosen by younger (<50 years) patients (P < 0.001); patients with private insurance [odds ratio (OR) = 2.22, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.4-3.5]; residence in urban settings (OR = 5.09, 95% CI = 2.5-10.4); and plans for subsequent reconstruction (OR = 2.31, 95% CI = 1.4-3.8). Marital status, smoking history, family cancer history, BC stage and grade did not significantly impact patient's choice of BM versus UM. We found that patients with unilateral BC who are younger (<50 year) have private insurance, reside in urban settings, or plan for subsequent reconstruction are more likely to undergo BM for unilateral BC. Genetic specific data were not evaluated for this patient cohort, and will be the subject of future analysis.
28315227	Insulin-like growth factor 1 gene polymorphism in women with breast cancer.	Breast cancer is a disease of unknown etiology; however, the major risk factors are genetic alterations. Studies have demonstrated an association between insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) gene polymorphism and cell proliferation and reduced apoptosis, in addition to its role in breast cancer growth and aggressiveness. Two polymorphic variants of the IGF-1 gene are highlighted in association with breast cancer, rs6220 and rs7136446, although controversy exists as to this relationship. The current study included 137 women (68 breast cancer cases and 69 controls without breast cancer) who had 3 ml of peripheral blood drawn for the study of genomic DNA extracted from leukocytes using the genotyping technique by real-time polymerase chain reaction. The CC genotype (rs7136446) was present in 4 women (5.9%) from the case group and in 2 (3.0%) women from the control group (p = 0.67), while the GG genotype (rs6220) occurred in 8 (11.5%) women from the case group and in 5 (7.2%) women from the control group (p = 0.75). No statistically significant difference was observed between the CC genotype of variant rs7136446 in premenopausal case and control women (p = 0.31), thus as there was also no significant difference between case and control postmenopausal women (p = 1.00). Concerning the GG genotype of rs6220, it occurred in 6 (14.2%) premenopausal case and 4 (8%) control women (p = 0.71) and no difference was found in postmenopausal women (p = 1.00). In the current study, IGF-1 gene polymorphism of SNP variants rs6220 and rs7136446 had no statistically significant association with breast cancer, both in premenopausal and postmenopausal women.
28314326	Impact of Maintenance Therapy for Patients with Non-small Cell Lung Cancer in a Real-world Setting.	BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to explore the role of maintenance therapy for patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in a real-world setting. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a prospective observational cohort multicenter study. Eligible patients were observed from initiation of first-line platinum-based chemotherapy until final follow-up. RESULTS: Between 2010 and 2011, a total of 864 patients were enrolled in this study. The primary study population was 396 patients who had progressive disease during observation after first-line chemotherapy without maintenance. Of these, 113 patients (29%) did not receive second-line therapy. In contrast, only 18% of patients who had progressive disease during maintenance therapy missed second-line therapy. Overall survival of patients without maintenance who received second-line therapy was similar to that of those who received maintenance, but no second-line therapy. CONCLUSION: Maintenance therapy for patients with advanced NSCLC might be an appropriate strategy to maximize the chance of receiving more active therapy.
28314325	MIC1/GDF15 as a Bone Metastatic Disease Biomarker.	AIM: The aim of the study was to evaluate MIC1/GDF15 as a biomarker in the monitoring of bone metastases occurrence. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The assessed group included patients diagnosed with: prostate cancer, breast cancer, lung cancer and colorectal cancer. Patients were divided into two groups based on the scintigraphy of the occurrence of bone metastases. Group 0 contained 55 patients without bone metastases, that served as the control group. Group 1 contained 75 patients with bone metastases. RESULTS: Higher levels (p<0.0001) of MIC1/GDF15 were found in group 1 (with bone metastases) compared to the group 0. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis showed an area under the curve (AUC) 0.87. At the point of 90% specificity we found a 65% sensitivity and cut-off value of 1.48 ng/ml. CONCLUSION: Circulating MIC1/GDF15 is a powerful biomarker for bone metastatic disease but insufficient sensitivity calls for further studies incorporating combinations with other novel or routine markers.
28314314	Familial Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor with Germline KIT Mutations Accompanying Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer Syndrome.	BACKGROUND: Familial gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) is a rare disease with germline mutations in the c-kit gene (KIT) or platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha gene (PDGFRA). We had encountered multiple GISTs in the stomach and small intestine during a screening of ovarian cancer for a woman with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome (HBOC) with breast cancer susceptibility gene II (BRCA2) mutations. The aim of this study was to examine this case in detail. CASE REPORT: A 65-year-old woman diagnosed with HBOC harboring BRCA2 mutations was found to have multiple tumors in the stomach and small intestine by abdominal screening. All tumors were resected, and KIT gene mutations (p.Trp557Leu and p.Lys558Glu) in exon 11 were detected in all tumors and peripheral blood leukocytes. The patient was diagnosed with familial GIST. CONCLUSION: This was an extremely rare case in which familial GIST with germline KIT gene mutations co-existed with HBOC.
28314311	Core Needle Biopsy Specimens Are More Appropriate than Surgical Specimens for Evaluating the Expression of Phosphoproteins as Biological Markers in Invasive Breast Cancer.	BACKGROUND/AIM: To evaluate whether core needle biopsy specimens (CNBS) would be better than surgical specimens (SS) for evaluating phosphoproteins as biological markers in breast cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective analysis included a total of 99 patients who had invasive breast cancer and were treated surgically between January 2012 and July 2013. The expression of phosphorylated ribosomal protein S6-kinase-1 (p-S6K1), phosphorylated protein kinase B (p-AKT), and estrogen receptor (ER) were assessed immunohistochemically on both CNBS and SS for each patient. RESULTS: The expression rate of phosphoprotein at any intensity was higher on CNBS than on SS (p-S6K1, 99.0% versus 59.6%; p-AKT, 94.9% versus 56.6%). p-S6K1and p-AKT expression was classified as negativity (absence to weak staining) or positivity (moderate to strong staining) for further analysis. For p-S6K1, 24.2% of patients showed positivity on CNBS and negativity on SS, while 7% of the patients showed negativity on CNBS and positivity on SS. For p-AKT, 70.7% of the patients showed positivity on CNBS and negativity on SS, while only 1.0% of patients showed negativity on CNBS and positivity on SS. CONCLUSION: CNBS may be the more appropriate specimen type for immunohistochemical examination of phosphoprotein expression in invasive breast cancer.
28314310	First-line Bevacizumab and Paclitaxel for HER2-negative Metastatic Breast Cancer: A French Retrospective Observational Study.	AIM: To assess outcomes in patients treated with first-line bevacizumab-containing therapy for human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER)2-negative metastatic breast cancer (mBC) at a single centre with a homogenous standard-of-care. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Information on patient and disease characteristics, efficacy, and safety was extracted from computer-based records of all patients receiving first-line bevacizumab-paclitaxel at the Curie Institute, Paris, France, between 2008 and 2011. RESULTS: Median progression-free survival in the 116 treated patients was 13.2 months; median overall survival was 38.4 months. Corresponding values were 9.0 and 18.8 months, respectively, in patients with triple-negative mBC, and 19.4 and 58.8 months, respectively, in patients receiving maintenance endocrine therapy. No new safety signals were seen. CONCLUSION: Outcomes in patients treated with bevacizumab-paclitaxel at our center were consistent with efficacy in prospective clinical trials, with notable activity in poor-prognosis disease. Maintenance endocrine or oral therapy with bevacizumab after paclitaxel discontinuation was associated with long-term disease control.
28314290	Parent of Origin and Prognosis in Familial Breast Cancer in Sweden.	BACKGROUND: It has been suggested that prognosis in familial breast cancer could be influenced by the parent of origin, with a worse prognosis when inherited paternally. This study aimed to investigate the effect of the parent of origin on prognosis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Index patients were divided into two study groups depending on the parent of origin. Tumour characteristics and survival data for index patients were collected. RESULTS: In total, 319 families fulfilled the inclusion criteria. No significant difference in overall or recurrence-free survival between those with maternal and those with paternal inheritance was observed, with hazard ratios (HR) of 0.99 (95% confidence interval (CI)=0.54 to 1.80, p=0.97) and 1.22 (95% CI=0.78 to 1.92, p=0.38), respectively. CONCLUSION: We found no evidence for a worse prognosis in patients with paternally inherited breast cancer. However, only large differences in prognosis were excluded and the tendency for worse recurrence-free survival in the group with paternal inheritance therefore merits further study.
28314283	Stable shRNA Silencing of Lactate Dehydrogenase A (LDHA) in Human MDA-MB-231 Breast Cancer Cells Fails to Alter Lactic Acid Production, Glycolytic Activity, ATP or Survival.	BACKGROUND: In the US, African Americans have a high death rate from triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), characterized by lack of hormone receptors (ER, PR, HER2/ERRB2) which are otherwise valuable targets of chemotherapy. There is a need to identify novel targets that negatively impact TNBC tumorigenesis. TNBCs release an abundance of lactic acid, under normoxic, hypoxic and hyperoxic conditions; this referred to as the Warburg effect. Accumulated lactic acid sustains peri-cellular acidity which propels metastatic invasion and malignant aggressive transformation. The source of lactic acid is believed to be via conversion of pyruvate by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in the last step of glycolysis, with most studies focusing on the LDHA isoform. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, LDHA was silenced using long-term MISSION(R) shRNA lentivirus in human breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells. Down-regulation of LDHA transcription and protein expression was confirmed by western blot, immunocytochemistry and qPCR. A number of parameters were measured in fully viable vector controls versus knock-down (KD) clones, including levels of lactic acid produced, glucose consumed, ATP and basic metabolic rates. RESULTS: The data show that lentivirus V-165 generated a knock-down clone most effective in reducing both gene and protein levels to less than 1% of vector controls. Stable KD showed absolutely no changes in cell viability, lactic acid production, ATP, glucose consumption or basic metabolic rate. Given the complete absence of impact on any observed parameter by LDH-A KD and this being somewhat contrary to findings in the literature, further analysis was required to determine why. Whole-transcriptome analytic profile on MDA-MB-231 for LDH subtypes using Agilent Human Genome 4x44k microarrays, where the data show the following component breakdown. Transcripts: 30.47 % LDHA, 69.36% LDHB, 0.12% LDHC and 0.05% LDHD. CONCLUSION: These findings underscore the importance of alternative isoforms of LDH in cancer cells to produce lactic acid, when LDHA is silenced or inhibited. LDHA silencing alone is not effective in hampering or inducing changes in survival, metabolism or lactic acid produced in a cell line with high concentrations of LDHB. Future research will be required to confirm effects of dual LDHA/B knockdown and further confirm that the sole source of lactic acid produced occurs through LDH (all isoforms) in breast cancer cells.
28314256	Hydrogen Peroxide Enhances TGFbeta-mediated Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition in Human Mammary Epithelial MCF-10A Cells.	AIM: This study investigated the effect of reactive oxygen species (ROS) on transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta-mediated epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in order to clarify the influence of ROS and TGFbeta on the induction of dysplasia and ultimately, tumorigenesis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Confluent MCF-10A human mammary epithelial cells were treated with H2O2 for 1 h, then reseeded at low density in the presence of TGFbeta and cultured until confluence. RESULTS: Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2, 250 muM) enhanced TGFbeta-mediated EMT, as evidenced by increased expression of EMT-associated transcription factors, which was accompanied by increased nuclear localization of phosphorylated SMAD family member 2 (SMAD2) and up-regulation of the TGFbeta signaling pathway components mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). Pharmacological inhibition of MEK/ERK signaling partly reversed the effects of H2O2 Conclusion: H2O2 enhances TGFbeta-mediated EMT via SMAD and MEK/ERK signaling.
28306620	Diagnostic performance of a novel dedicated breast PET scanner with C-shaped ring detectors.	BACKGROUND: A dedicated breast PET scanner with C-shaped detectors (C scanner) has been newly developed. The purpose of this study was to re-evaluate the diagnostic performance of high-resolution PET images with the new reconstruction conditions, obtained using this C scanner in breast cancer patients, and to compare the standardized uptake values (SUVs) of lesions obtained from the C scanner with those from whole-body PET/computed tomography (CT) (WB PET/CT). PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 159 female patients with known or suspected breast carcinomas (total 188 lesions: 172 invasive carcinomas; eight noninvasive ductal carcinomas in situ; eight benign lesions) were analysed. All patients underwent a WB PET/CT scan 1 h after the injection of fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose, followed by breast scanning using the C scanner. Attenuation-corrected and scatter-corrected images were reconstructed with new parameters. RESULTS: Using the C scanner, 146 of 180 malignant lesions including five ductal carcinomas in situ were detected, 11 lesions were not detected, and the remaining 23 lesions were outside the field of view. The lesion-based sensitivity of the C scanner was 81.1%, and this was increased to 93.0% after excluding lesions outside the field of view; the sensitivity of WB PET/CT was 90.4%. The average maximum SUV of lesions obtained using the C scanner was 9.8+/-7.0, which was approximately 1.6-fold larger than that obtained using WB PET/CT (6.1+/-4.2). CONCLUSION: There was no significant difference in breast cancer detectability in this population. The C scanner demonstrated approximately 1.6-fold larger maximum SUV than WB PET/CT.
28304416	Gynecologic Malignancies in Pregnancy: Balancing Fetal Risks With Oncologic Safety.	Importance: Cancer occurs in 0.05% to 0.1% of all pregnancies. Despite literature reporting good oncologic and fetal outcomes in women treated for cancer during pregnancy, as many as 44% of gynecologists would offer termination, and 37% would not administer chemotherapy or radiotherapy in pregnancy. Objectives: The aims of this study were to summarize current recommendations for the treatment of cervical and ovarian cancers in pregnancy and to review updates on existing knowledge regarding the safety of surgical and chemotherapeutic treatments in pregnancy, including both oncologic and fetal outcomes. Evidence Acquisition: A detailed literature review was performed on PubMed. Results: The treatment of gynecologic malignancies during pregnancy mirrors that outside pregnancy, with a balance between maternal versus fetal health. Fertility-sparing surgery can be offered to stage IA2 and low-risk IB1 cervical, stage I epithelial ovarian, germ cell ovarian, or sex-cord stromal ovarian tumors. Delayed treatment can be offered for stage IB1 cervical cancer. Neoadjuvant and/or adjuvant chemotherapy can be given for advanced gynecologic cancers with good disease-free survival without significant adverse neonatal outcomes. Conclusions: A multidisciplinary approach and improved education of providers regarding the surgical and chemotherapeutic treatments in pregnancy are needed in order to fully inform patients regarding treatment options. Further research in women who are pregnant is needed to determine the safety of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures used in the nonpregnant woman. Relevance: This article reviews and supports treatment of gynecologic cancer during pregnancy, calls for additional study and long-term follow-up, and justifies improved education of patients and providers regarding treatment options. Target Audience: Obstetricians and gynecologists, family physicians. Learning Objectives: After completing this activity, the learner should be better able to (1) review general principles in the management and treatment of gynecologic cancers in pregnancy, (2) review the diagnosis and treatment of cervical cancer in pregnancy, and (3) review the diagnosis and treatment of ovarian cancer in pregnancy.
28302157	Reliability of medical records in diagnosing inflammatory breast cancer in Egypt.	BACKGROUND: Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) is a rare, aggressive breast cancer diagnosed clinically by the presence of diffuse erythema, peau d'orange, and edema that arise quickly in the affected breast. This study evaluated the validity of medical records in Gharbiah, Egypt in identifying clinical signs/symptoms of IBC. For 34 IBC cases enrolled in a case-control study at the Gharbiah Cancer Society and Tanta Cancer Center, Egypt (2009-2010), we compared signs/symptoms of IBC noted in medical records to those recorded on a standardized form at the time of IBC diagnosis by clinicians participating in the case-control study. We calculated the sensitivity and specificity of medical records as compared to the case-control study for recording these signs/symptoms. We also performed McNemar's tests. RESULTS: In the case-control study, 32 (94.1%) IBC cases presented with peau d'orange, 30 (88.2%) with erythema, and 31 (91.2%) with edema. The sensitivities of the medical records as compared to the case-control study were 0.8, 0.5, and 0.2 for peau d'orange, erythema, and edema, respectively. Corresponding specificities were 1.0, 0.5, and 1.0. p values for McNemar's test were <0.05 for all signs. Medical records had data on the extent and duration of signs for at most 27% of cases for which this information was recorded in the case-control study. Twenty-three of the 34 cases (67.6%) had confirmed diagnosis of IBC in their medical records. CONCLUSION: Medical records lacked information on signs/symptoms of IBC, especially erythema and edema, when compared to the case-control study. Deficient medical records could have implications for diagnosis and treatment of IBC and proper documentation of cases in cancer registries.
28301261	A Radiolabeled Fully Human Antibody to Human Aspartyl (Asparaginyl) beta-Hydroxylase Is a Promising Agent for Imaging and Therapy of Metastatic Breast Cancer.	There is a need for novel effective and safe therapies for metastatic breast cancer based on targeting tumor-specific molecular markers of cancer. Human aspartyl (asparaginyl) beta-hydroxylase (HAAH) is a highly conserved enzyme that hydroxylates epidermal growth factor-like domains in transformation-associated proteins and is overexpressed in a variety of cancers, including breast cancer. A fully human monoclonal antibody (mAb) PAN-622 has been developed to HAAH. In this study, they describe the development of PAN-622 mAb as an agent for imaging and radioimmunotherapy of metastatic breast cancer. PAN-622 was conjugated to several ligands such as DOTA, CHXA'', and DTPA to enable subsequent radiolabeling and its immunoreactivity was evaluated by an HAAH-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and binding to the HAAH-positive cells. As a result, DTPA-PAN-622 was chosen to investigate biodistribution in healthy CD-1 female mice and 4T1 mammary tumor-bearing BALB/c mice. The 111In-DTPA-pan622 mAb concentrated in the primary tumors and to some degree in lung metastases as shown by SPECT/CT and Cherenkov imaging. A pilot therapy study with 213Bi-DTPA-PAN-622 demonstrated a significant effect on the primary tumor. The authors concluded that human mAb PAN-622 to HAAH is a promising reagent for development of imaging and possible therapeutic agents for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer.
28299955	Niraparib for the treatment of ovarian cancer.	INTRODUCTION: Poly(adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors are being developed in maintenance and recurrence treatment settings in ovarian cancer. They inhibit single-stranded DNA repair, inducing synthetic lethality in cells with underlying homologous recombination deficiency (HRD). Marked responses are seen in ovarian cancers with breast cancer gene 1 (BRCA1) or 2 (BRCA2) mutation, although up to 50% of high-grade serous ovarian cancers (HGSOC) have HRD may also benefit. Areas covered: This review focuses on niraparib (oral PARP I and II inhibitor), its clinical testing in ovarian cancer, including the Myriad MyChoice HRD test as a potential companion diagnostic. Future directions plus ongoing trials, including novel combinations are highlighted. Expert opinion: There is now level 1 evidence of efficacy from the first randomized placebo-controlled phase III trial using niraparib maintenance in women with platinum-sensitive recurrent HGSOC with complete or partial response post platinum-based chemotherapy. Niraparib improved progression free survival over placebo in all groups of women. The benefit was greatest in patients with germline BRCA1/2 mutation, followed by HRD positive tumors; however, absence of either does not exclude the possibility of benefit from niraparib maintenance. Additional studies are underway with niraparib in the first line maintenance, and 4th/5th line recurrence treatment settings.
28296398	Discovery of an Acrylic Acid Based Tetrahydroisoquinoline as an Orally Bioavailable Selective Estrogen Receptor Degrader for ERalpha+ Breast Cancer.	Tetrahydroisoquinoline 40 has been identified as a potent ERalpha antagonist and selective estrogen receptor degrader (SERD), exhibiting good oral bioavailability, antitumor efficacy, and SERD activity in vivo. We outline the discovery and chemical optimization of the THIQ scaffold leading to THIQ 40 and showcase the racemization of the scaffold, pharmacokinetic studies in preclinical species, and the in vivo efficacy of THIQ 40 in a MCF-7 human breast cancer xenograft model.
28293351	Breast lipoma with central fat necrosis: case report.	Fat necrosis of the breast is a benign non-suppurative inflammatory process of adipose tissue that most commonly occurs as the result of minor breast trauma. We present a case of a 40-years-old female with fat necrosis in a breast lipoma. She presented with an overlapping mass on the lateral quadrants. Mammography showed Well delineated radiolucent mass with peripheral "egg-shell" calcifications, that appeared an hypoechoic mass with posterior shadowing on ultrasonography. A history of accidental trauma raises the suspicion of fat necrosis. Pathology is necessary when radiological findings simulate malignancy.
28292162	[Primary large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma of the breast: a rare tumor in humans].	Primitive large cell neuroendocrine tumor of the breast is an extremely rare entity. Less than ten cases have been reported in the literature. We report a new case of a 61-year old male patient presenting with locally advanced tumor of the right breast, immediately metastasized to the lungs and pleura, staged cT4bN1M1. The patient received eight cycles of Docetaxel-based chemotherapy every 21 days, with a good clinical and radiological response (>50%), followed by adjuvant tamoxifen with disease stabilization for 18 months. Immunohistochemistry is still essential to determine the neuroendocrine nature of this tumor. Treatment is not well codified due to the rarity of this type of cancer.
28292106	[Survival rate for breast cancer in Rabat (Morocco) 2005-2008].	INTRODUCTION: Breast cancer is a public health problem in Morocco. This study aims to estimate the survival rate for patients with breast cancer living in Rabat. METHODS: We conducted a prognostic study of female patients with breast cancer diagnosed during 2005-2008, living in Rabat and whose data were recorded in the Rabat Cancer Registry. The date of inclusion in this study corresponded with the date on which cancer was histologically confirmed. Survival rate was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and the comparison between the different classes of a variable was made using the log rank test. The study of factors associated with survival was performed using the Cox model. RESULTS: During the study period 628 cases of breast cancer were collected. Mortality rate was 19.9%. Overall 1-year survival rate was 97.1%, 89.2% at 3 years and 80.6% at 5 years. In multivariate analysis, breast cancer survival was statistically lower in patients over 70 years of age (p <0.001) with large tumor size (p < 0.001), advanced-stage adenopathies (p = 0.007), metastases (p < 0.001) and not using hormone therapy (p = 0.002). CONCLUSION: Large tumor size and metastases are poor prognostic factors in breast cancer, hence the need to strengthen screening programs.
28292084	[Synchronous bilateral breast cancer: experiences in the Mohammed VI Cancer Treatment Center, CHU Ibn Rochd, Casablanca].	Synchronous bilateral breast cancers (SBBC) are characterized by extensive clinical and morphological heterogeneity, with an frequency between 1.5 and 3.2%. Women treated for unilateral breast cancer are at higher risk of developing contralateral breast cancer. Screening and advances in breast imaging have improved detection rates of SBBC. Our study aims to analyze the epidemiological, clinical, histological and therapeutic features of bilateral breast cancer. We conducted a cross-sectional study of patients with breast cancer treated at the Mohammed VI Center over a two year period. Statistical analysis of the results was performed using R. software. 31 patients had SBBC, representing 2.4% of breast cancer cases in our Center. The average age was 47.8 +/- 8.4 years, 22.6% of patients used oral contraceptives. A family history of breast cancer was observed in 22.6% of cases. The most common histological type was invasive ductal carcinoma (58.1%), SBR grade II and III were common (38.7%). Hormone receptors were positive for progesterone (38.7%) and for estrogen (41.9%). HER2 was overexpressed in 20.0% of cases. 29.0% of patients received hormonal therapy and 3.2% targeted therapies. Our study showed that bilateral breast cancer represents a small percentage of all breast cancers but have specific clinical features that help to differentiate it from unilateral breast cancer.
28292037	[Breast cancer in Morocco: phenotypic profile of tumors].	Breast cancer is most common in women and it is among the leading causes of cancer related deaths. The curability of this type of tumor is increasing thanks to screening programs and treatment advances which have certainly enhanced patient survival. But challenges remain, particularly in respect of phenotypic instability of cancer cells. The aim of this study was to analyse the phenotypic profile of breast cancer in patients treated at Mohammed VI Cancer Treatment Center over the years 2013-2014. We conducted a cross-sectional study over a two-year period, including the cases of breast cancer treated in our Center. Data were collected from patients medical records and analyzed using Epi Info software. 1277 patients were treated in our Center. 99.5% were females, mean age 50.20 +/- 11.34 years. The most common histological type was invasive ductal carcinoma (80.7% of cases). It was diagnosed at an early stage (56,9%). The most common molecular phenotype was luminal A (41.4% of cases). Luminal B, HER2 and triple negatives occurred in 10.4%, 6.3%, 11.2% of cases respectively. The study of tumor phenotype in patients with breast cancer helps clinician make treatment choice and policy makers implement programs against this disease.
28291344	First Bispecific Inhibitors of the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Kinase and the NF-kappaB Activity As Novel Anticancer Agents.	The activation of the NF-kappaB transcription factor is a major adaptive response induced upon treatment with EGFR kinase inhibitors, leading to the emergence of resistance in nonsmall cell lung cancer and other tumor types. To suppress this survival mechanism, we developed new thiourea quinazoline derivatives that are dual inhibitors of both EGFR kinase and the NF-kappaB activity. Optimization of the hit compound, identified in a NF-kappaB reporter gene assay, led to compound 9b, exhibiting a cellular IC50 for NF-kappaB inhibition of 0.3 muM while retaining a potent EGFR kinase inhibition (IC50 = 60 nM). The dual inhibitors showed a higher potency than gefitinib to inhibit cell growth of EGFR-overexpressing tumor cell lines in vitro and in a xenograft model in vivo, while no signs of toxicity were observed. An investigation of the molecular mechanism of NF-kappaB suppression revealed that the dual inhibitors depleted the transcriptional coactivator CREB-binding protein from the NF-kappaB complex in the nucleus.
28290601	ICT1 knockdown inhibits breast cancer cell growth via induction of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.	The protein encoded by immature colon carcinoma transcript 1 (ICT1) is a component of the human mitochondrial ribosome, and is reported to be implicated in cell proliferation, viability and apoptosis of HeLa cells. This study was conducted to investigate the role of ICT1 in human breast cancer. Oncomine database was used to investigate ICT1 expression in human breast cancer tissues compared to normal tissues. The results showed that ICT1 was highly overexpressed in various human breast cancer subtypes. Then short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated knockdown of ICT1 was performed in human breast cancer ZR-75-30 and T-47D cells. A series of functional analysis, including MTT, colony formation and flow cytometry assays were conducted after ICT1 knockdown. Our results demonstrated that knockdown of ICT1 significantly suppressed cell viability and proliferation through cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase and induced apoptosis in breast cancer cells. Furthermore, knockdown of ICT1 altered signaling pathways associated with cell growth and apoptosis, including phosphoBAD (Ser112), phospho-PRAS40 (Thr246) and induction of phosphoAMPKalpha (Thr172). Additionally, it was further confirmed by western blot analysis that ICT1 knockdown altered the expression of apoptosis- or cell cyclerelated proteins such as Bcl-2, caspase-3, CDK1, CDK2 and cyclin B. In conclusion, targeting ICT1 in breast cancer cells may provide a new strategy for breast cancer gene therapy.
28288595	Mindful Yoga for women with metastatic breast cancer: design of a randomized controlled trial.	BACKGROUND: Women with metastatic breast cancer (MBC) have average life expectancies of about 2 years, and report high levels of disease-related symptoms including pain, fatigue, sleep disturbance, psychological distress, and functional impairment. There is growing recognition of the limitations of medical approaches to managing such symptoms. Yoga is a mind-body discipline that has demonstrated a positive impact on psychological and functional health in early stage breast cancer patients and survivors, but has not been rigorously studied in advanced cancer samples. METHODS: This randomized controlled trial examines the feasibility and initial efficacy of a Mindful Yoga program, compared with a social support condition that controls for attention, on measures of disease-related symptoms such as pain and fatigue. The study will be completed by December 2017. Sixty-five women with MBC age >/= 18 are being identified and randomized with a 2:1 allocation to Mindful Yoga or a support group control intervention. The 120-min intervention sessions take place weekly for 8 weeks. The study is conducted at an urban tertiary care academic medical center located in Durham, North Carolina. The primary feasibility outcome is attendance at intervention sessions. Efficacy outcomes include pain, fatigue, sleep quality, psychological distress, mindfulness and functional capacity at post-intervention, 3-month follow-up, and 6-month follow-up. DISCUSSION: In this article, we present the challenges of designing a randomized controlled trial with long-term follow-up among women with MBC. These challenges include ensuring adequate recruitment including of minorities, limiting and controlling for selection bias, tailoring of the yoga intervention to address special needs, and maximizing adherence and retention. This project will provide important information regarding yoga as an intervention for women with advanced cancer, including preliminary data on the psychological and functional effects of yoga for MBC patients. This investigation will also establish rigorous methods for future research into yoga as an intervention for this population. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov identifer: NCT01927081 , registered August 16, 2013.
28287917	Does Reader Performance with Digital Breast Tomosynthesis Vary according to Experience with Two-dimensional Mammography?	Purpose To assess whether individual reader performance with digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) and two-dimensional (2D) mammography varies with number of years of experience or volume of 2D mammograms read. Materials and Methods After written informed consent was obtained, 8869 women (age range, 29-85 years; mean age, 56 years) were recruited into the TOMMY trial (A Comparison of Tomosynthesis with Digital Mammography in the UK National Health Service Breast Screening Program), an ethically approved, multicenter, multireader, retrospective reading study, between July 2011 and March 2013. Each case was read prospectively for clinical assessment and to establish ground truth. A retrospective reading data set of 7060 cases was created and randomly allocated for independent blinded review of (a) 2D mammograms, (b) DBT images and 2D mammograms, and (c) synthetic 2D mammograms and DBT images, without access to previous examinations. Readers (19 radiologists, three advanced practitioner radiographers, and two breast clinicians) who had 3-25 (median, 10) years of experience in the U.K. National Health Service Breast Screening Program and read 5000-13 000 (median, 8000) cases per annum were included in this study. Specificity was analyzed according to reader type and years and volume of experience, and then both specificity and sensitivity were analyzed by matched inference. The median duration of experience (10 years) was used as the cutoff point for comparison of reader performance. Results Specificity improved with the addition of DBT for all readers. This was significant for all staff groups (56% vs 68% and 49% vs 67% [P < .0001] for radiologists and advanced practitioner radiographers, respectively; 46% vs 55% [P = .02] for breast clinicians). Sensitivity was improved for 19 of 24 (79%) readers and was significantly higher for those with less than 10 years of experience (91% vs 86%; P = .03) and those with total mammographic experience of fewer than 80 000 cases (88% vs 86%; P = .03). Conclusion The addition of DBT to conventional 2D screening mammography improved specificity for all readers, but the gain in sensitivity was greater for readers with less than 10 years of experience.
28287808	Travel Burden and Clinical Profile of Cancer Patients Admitted to the Cancer Institute of Iran in 2012.	BACKGROUND: Burden of cancer is increasing in developing countries, where healthcare infrastructures and resources are limited. Evaluating the pattern of care would provide evidence for planning and improvement of the situation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We studied the pattern of residential place and clinical information of cancer patients who were admitted to the Cancer Institute of Iran from January 1, to May 31, 2012. RESULTS: We studied 1,705 consecutive cancer patients admitted to the Cancer Institute in the study period. The most common cancers were breast (29.2%), colorectal (9.0%), stomach (8.3%), head & neck (8.0%) and esophageal (3.8%) cancers. Radiotherapy was the main treatment (52.1%) followed by chemotherapy (43.8%) and surgery (29.1%). We found that 60% of the patients presented in the loco-regional or advanced stages. About 35% of patients travelled from other provinces mainly from Mazandaran (13.4%), Lorestan (10.6%), Zanjan (7.8%) and Ghazvin (6.6%). On average, the cancer patients travelled about 455 kilometers to receive care in the cancer institute. We found more than 38% patients who were referred from other provinces had an early stage tumor. CONCLUSION: Establishment of comprehensive cancer centers in different geographical regions and implementation of a proper referral system for advanced cancer patients is needed to improve the patient outcomes and mitigate the burden of travel of patients for cancer care.
28287429	d-Amino Acid Position Influences the Anticancer Activity of Galaxamide Analogs: An Apoptotic Mechanism Study.	Galaxamide, an extract from Galaxaura filamentosa, is a cyclic pentapeptide containing five l-leucines. Due to the particular cyclic structure and the excellent anticancer activity, synthesis of Galaxamide and its analogs and their subsequent bio-applications have attracted great attention. In the present work, we synthesized six Galaxamide analogs by replacing one of the l-leucines with phenylalanine and varying the d-amino acid position. The anticancer effect of the synthesized Galaxamide analogs was tested against four in vitro human cancer cell lines, human hepatocellular cells (HepG(2)), human breast cancer cell (MCF-7), human breast adenocarcinoma cells (MDA-MB-435) and a human cervical carcinoma cell line (Hela). Results showed that Galaxamide analogs with different d-amino acid positions displayed distinct anticancer potential. The Galaxamide analog containing d-amino acid at position 5 (Analog-6) presented the strongest anticancer activity. The mechanism study revealed that Analog-6 could cause the early apoptosis of HepG(2) cells by inhibiting their growth in the sub-G1 stage of the cell cycle and induce the chromatin condensation and fragmentation, which can be seen as 68% of HepG(2) cells inhibited in the sub-G1 stage. Moreover, a mitochondria-mediated pathway was found to be involved in the apoptotic process of Analog-6 on HepG(2) cells.
28286086	Hyper-methylation of the upstream CpG island shore is a likely mechanism of GPER1 silencing in breast cancer cells.	GPER1, also known as GPR30, is a novel seven-transmembrane G-protein coupled estrogen receptor that mediates both short-term (non-genomic) and long-term (genomic) effects of estrogen in target cells and tissues. A substantial body of work over the last two decades has highlighted its therapeutic or prognostic utility. However, the clinical data on the expression of GPER1 in breast tissue is ambiguous. Analysis of TCGA RNAseq data revealed significantly lower mean expression of GPER1 mRNA in primary breast tumors compared to that in normal breast tissues. This provides support to the tumor suppressor role for GPER1. However, the mechanisms underlying the reduced expression are not completely understood. We analyzed the expression levels of GPER1 mRNA variants in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells by RT-PCR, and the methylation status of two CpG islands in the GPER1 locus by modified COBRA assays and bisulfite sequencing. Our results show that MCF-7 cells express higher levels of GPER1 mRNA variants compared to MDA-MB-231 cells. Modified COBRA assays revealed differential methylation in the upstream CpG island (upCpGi) that overlaps with the first exon of two GPER1 variants (GPER1v2 and v3) but not in the downstream CpG island (dnCpGi) that overlaps with the coding region common to all variants. Bisulfite sequencing results showed that the core upCpGi was hypo-methylated in both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. However, eight CpGs in the 3' end of the upCpGi were hyper-methylated in MDA-MB-231 cells. 5-Azacytidine, a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, induced the expression levels of GPER1 mRNA variants in MDA-MB-231 cells. Expression-methylation correlation analysis of TCGA breast cancer data revealed that methylation of CpGs in the regions flanking the upCpGi significantly correlated negatively with GPER1 mRNA expression. Taken together, our results demonstrate the role of DNA methylation in GPER1 repression, implicate the flanking regions (shore) of the upCpGi, and suggest a potential mechanism of GPER1 silencing in breast tumors.
28285936	Enhancing the effect of 4MeV electron beam using gold nanoparticles in breast cancer cells.	Gold nanoparticles (GNPs) have been applied as radiosensitizer in radiotherapy. Limited reports have shown that GNPs may be effective as a dose enhancer agent for electron radiation therapy. Some Monte Carlo Simulation studies have shown that selecting suitable size of GNPs and electron energies are critical for effective dose enhancement. The aim of this study was to assess possible radiosensitization effect of GNPs on cancer cell treated with 4MeV electron beams. Approximately 10nm GNPs were synthesized and characterized by electron microscope and dynamic light scattering. MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells were used and their viability was measured by MTT assay. Radiosensitization effect of GNPs under 4MeV electron beams was measured by clonogenic assay. The result showed a concentration dependent uptake of GNPs without reducing cell viability at concentrations </=50mg/L. Incubation of cancer cells with GNPs caused a significant decrease in their viability following exposure to electron beams as well as a decrease in their survival fraction when compared to control. The sensitizer enhancement ratio (SER) by electron beams in MCF-7 cells was 1.43 and 1.40 in presence of 25 and 50mg/L GNPs, respectively. For MDA-MB-231 cells, it was 1.62 in presence of 25mg/L GNPs. Our data demonstrated the significant dose enhancement of the GNPs in combination with 4MeV electron beams that could be applicable for the treatment of superficial tumors and intra operative radiation therapy.
28285537	Milestone clinical trials of the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP).	The National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) has made significant contributions in reducing the extent of breast surgery and in improving outcomes of patients with early-stage breast cancer through the conduct of large randomized clinical trials evaluating local and systemic therapy. In 2014, the NSABP merged with two other US National Cancer Institute-funded cooperative groups, the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) and the Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG), to form NRG Oncology. The combined organization has 218 member institutions with more than 600 affiliate centers located throughout the United States, Canada, Puerto Rico, and other international sites. Over the past half century, the NSABP has entered more than 150,000 women into clinical trials of breast cancer treatment and breast cancer prevention. Many of these trials have been instrumental in establishing new standards of care for patients with breast cancer.
28285403	HER2 testing in gastric cancer: results of a German expert meeting.	Valid HER2 testing is essential for optimal therapy of patients with HER2-positive gastric cancer and the correct use of first-line chemotherapy. While testing for HER2 status in breast cancer is routinely performed, this is not the case for HER2 testing in gastric cancer and it is usually only performed on clinician request. An interdisciplinary German expert group (pathologists and clinicians) took the challenges of HER2 testing in gastric cancer as an opportunity to address essential aspects and questions for the practical use of HER2 testing in this indication. The recommendations made in this manuscript reflect the consensus of all participants and reflect their opinions and long-term experience in this field.
28284519	Breast conserving surgery and locoregional control after neoadjuvant chemotherapy.	The management of breast malignancy and the role of neoadjuvant systemic therapy has continued to evolve over the past 50 years. Survival equivalence with adjuvant systemic therapy is well accepted and demonstrated in several clinical trials. However, strong association with survival outcome and pathologic complete response emerged. Assessment of tumor response, as a surrogate for outcome, continues to be a driver for neoadjuvant therapy with increased applicability in the setting of sophisticated understanding and implications of breast tumor biology and molecular subtype. Furthermore, tumor response to neoadjuvant therapy can significantly impact local regional therapy decision-making by down-staging disease without compromising local regional control. This includes facilitation of breast conserving surgery and increased eligibility for limited axillary surgery in selected patients. Furthermore, the omission of surgery in the setting of exceptional response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, the ultimate breast conserving strategy, is being actively studied. With further refinement of systemic and targeted therapies, neoadjuvant systemic therapy continues to provide a robust mechanism for innovation in local regional management paradigms with increased attention to individualized breast oncologic care.
28284424	Soft coral Cespitularia stolonifera: New cytotoxic ceramides and gastroprotective activity.	In the present study, a new ceramide, namely 2S, 3R-4E, 8E-2-(heptadecanoylamino)-heptadeca-4, 8-diene-1, 3-diol (1), along with four known steroids, including 24-methylcholesta-5, 24(28)-diene-3beta-ol (2), 24-methylcholesta-5, 24(28)-diene-3beta-acetate (3), 4-methyl-24-methylcholesta-22-ene-3-ol (4), and cholesterol, was isolated and characterized from CH2Cl2/MeOH extract of Cespitularia stolonifera. A new acetate derivative of compound 1, termed 2S, 3R-4E, 8E-2-(heptadecanoylamino)-heptadeca-4, 8-diene-1, 3-diacetate (1a), was also prepared in the present study. All the structures were established on the basis of modern spectroscopic techniques, including FT-IR, 1D, 2D-NMR, HRESI-MS, and GC-MS, in addition of chemical methods. (-)-Alloaromadendren, ledane, (1)-alloaromadendren oxide, isoaromadendrene epoxide and (-)-caryophellen oxide were identified from the n-hexane fraction using GC-MS. The extract and the two ceramides (1) and (1a) exhibited significant cytotoxic activity against lung cancer A549 cells, while the extract and the two steroids (2) and (3) exhibited significant cytotoxic activity against breast cancer MCF-7 cells. The CH2Cl2/MeOH extract exhibited significant antiulcer activity in both ethanol and acetic acid induced ulcer models in rats, as evidenced by histopathological, histochemical, and biochemical examinations.
28281973	ABCB5-ZEB1 Axis Promotes Invasion and Metastasis in Breast Cancer Cells.	ABCB5 belongs to the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) superfamily, which is recognized for playing a role in the failure of chemotherapy. ABCB5 has also been found to be overexpressed at the transcriptional level in a number of cancer subtypes, including breast cancer. However, the exact mechanism ABCB5 uses on cancer cell metastasis is still unclear. In the present study, we demonstrate that ABCB5 expression was increased in metastatic tissues when compared with nonmetastatic tissues. ABCB5 can significantly enhance metastasis and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), while knockdown of ABCB5 inhibited these processes. Microarray analysis indicated that ZEB1 may function as a downstream factor of ABCB5. Furthermore, the expression of ZEB1 in tissues is positively relevant to ABCB5 in breast cancer. Knocking down ZEB1 inhibits ABCB5 ectopic expression-induced migration and invasion, as well as EMT. Taken together, these results helped to realize the oncogene functions of ABCB5 in breast cancer cells and provided a new direction in treating breast cancer.
28281966	RNA Interference of IQ Motif Containing GTPase-Activating Protein 3 (IQGAP3) Inhibits Cell Proliferation and Invasion in Breast Carcinoma Cells.	Breast cancer is a highly prevalent disease affecting women. The association of IQ motif containing GTPase-activating protein 3 (IQGAP3) and breast cancer is poorly defined. Here we reported that IQGAP3 is a key regulator of cell proliferation and metastasis during breast cancer progression. The expression of IQGAP3 was significantly increased in breast tissues compared to nontumor tissues at both protein and mRNA levels. Furthermore, IQGAP3 had a high expression level in ZR-75-30 and BT474 compared to other breast cancer cell lines. Depletion of IQGAP3 through RNA interference in ZR-75-30 and BT474 significantly inhibited cell proliferation. More importantly, IQGAP3 silencing in breast cancer cells notably repressed cell migration and invasion. Further analysis suggested that inhibition of cell proliferation and metastasis was associated with some proteins, including p53, MMP9, Snail, CDC42, p-ERK1/2, KIF2C, KIF4A, PCNA, and Twist. Since expression of IQGAP3 seems to be associated with the pathogenesis of breast cancer and suppression of it can inhibit cancer cell growth and metastasis, IQGAP3 may be a potential therapeutic target in human breast cancer.
28281363	The evidence base for HRT: what can we believe?	Prior to the unexpected early termination of the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) trial of continuous conjugated equine estrogens (CEE) and medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA), the prevailing view was that hormone replacement therapy (HRT) was a low-risk intervention with immediate value for symptom relief in recently menopausal women, and that it probably conferred long-term protection against the major chronic diseases that affect women after menopause. Rather than replicating prior studies, the WHI was designed to test whether the beneficial associations consistently seen in women starting HRT near menopause would be found in women well beyond menopause. Views of the benefits and risks of HRT changed dramatically in 2002 with the unexpected early termination of the CEE + MPA trial and the alarming initial WHI report. HRT use plummeted world-wide, driven by fear of breast cancer and skepticism about cardiovascular benefits. Stunningly, the contrasting findings of the WHI trial of CEE alone reported 2 years later - suggesting prevention of coronary heart disease in women who began HRT at age <60 years, and a reduction in breast cancer overall - were largely ignored. Key lessons from the WHI are that the effects of HRT on most organ systems vary by age and time since last physiologic exposure to hormones and that there are differences between regimens. In the years since the first WHI report, we have learned much about the characteristics of women who are likely to benefit from HRT. The range of HRT regimens has also increased. Not all women have indications for HRT, but for those who do and who initiate within 10 years of menopause, benefits are both short-term (vasomotor, dyspareunia), and long-term (bone health, coronary risk reduction). Critically, the 'facts' that most women and clinicians consider in making the decision to use, or not use, HRT are frequently wrong or incorrectly applied.
28280522	Triethylenetetramine Synergizes with Pharmacologic Ascorbic Acid in Hydrogen Peroxide Mediated Selective Toxicity to Breast Cancer Cell.	Breast cancer is characterized by overexpression of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and downregulation of catalase and more resistance to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) than normal cells. Thus, relatively high H2O2 promotes breast cancer cell growth and proliferation. However, excessive intracellular H2O2 leads to death of breast cancer cells. In cancer cells, high level ascorbic acid (Asc) is able to be autoxidized and thus provides an electron to oxygen to generate H2O2. In the present study, we demonstrated that triethylenetetramine (TETA) enhances Asc autoxidation and thus elevates H2O2 production in MCF-7 cells. Furthermore, Asc/TETA combination significantly impaired cancer cell viability, while having much milder effects on normal cells, indicating Asc/TETA could be a promising therapy for breast cancer. Moreover, SOD1 and N-acetyl-L-cysteine failed to improve MCF-7 cells viability in the presence of Asc/TETA, while catalase significantly inhibited the cytotoxicity of Asc/TETA to breast cancer cells, strongly suggesting that the selective cytotoxicity of Asc/TETA to cancer cells is H2O2-dependent. In addition, Asc/TETA induces RAS/ERK downregulation in breast cancer cells. Animal studies confirmed that Asc/TETA effectively suppressed tumor growth in vivo. In conclusion, TETA synergizes pharmacologic Asc autoxidation and H2O2 overproduction in breast cancer cells, which suppresses RAS/ERK pathway and results in apoptosis.
28279976	Regulation of hypoxia responses by flavin adenine dinucleotide-dependent modulation of HIF-1alpha protein stability.	Oxygen deprivation induces a range of cellular adaptive responses that enable to drive cancer progression. Here, we report that lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) upregulates hypoxia responses by demethylating RACK1 protein, a component of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) ubiquitination machinery, and consequently suppressing the oxygen-independent degradation of HIF-1alpha. This ability of LSD1 is attenuated during prolonged hypoxia, with a decrease in the cellular level of flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), a metabolic cofactor of LSD1, causing HIF-1alpha downregulation in later stages of hypoxia. Exogenously provided FAD restores HIF-1alpha stability, indicating a rate-limiting role for FAD in LSD1-mediated HIF-1alpha regulation. Transcriptomic analyses of patient tissues show that the HIF-1 signature is highly correlated with the expression of LSD1 target genes as well as the enzymes of FAD biosynthetic pathway in triple-negative breast cancers, reflecting the significance of FAD-dependent LSD1 activity in cancer progression. Together, our findings provide a new insight into HIF-mediated hypoxia response regulation by coupling the FAD dependence of LSD1 activity to the regulation of HIF-1alpha stability.
28277986	Bardoxolone-methyl inhibits migration and metabolism in MCF7 cells.	Bardoxolone-methyl (BAR) is reported to have anti-inflammatory, anti-proliferative and anti-fibrotic effects. BAR activates Nrf2 and may ameliorate oxidative stress through induction of antioxidant genes. However, off-target effects, probably concentration and NFkB-dependent, have limited the clinical use of BAR. Nrf2 regulates expression of antioxidant and mitochondrial genes and has been proposed as a target for both obesity and breast cancer. Therefore, we explored whether BAR can alter migration and proliferation in the MCF7 cell line and whether metabolic function is affected by BAR. Incubation with BAR caused a time-dependent migratory inhibition and an associated decrease in mitochondrial respiration. Both migratory and mitochondrial inhibition by BAR were further enhanced in the presence of fatty acids. In addition to the activation of Nrf2, BAR altered the expression of target mRNA GCLC and UCP1. After 24 h, BAR inhibited both glycolytic capacity, reserve (p < 0.05) and oxidative phosphorylation (p < 0.001) with an associated increase in mitochondrial ROS and loss of intracellular glutathione in MCF7 cells; however, impairment of mitochondrial activity was prevented by N-acetyl cysteine. The fatty acid, palmitate, increased mitochondrial ROS, impaired migration and oxidative phosphorylation but palmitate toxicity towards MCF7 could not be inhibited by N-acetyl cysteine suggesting that they exert effects through different pathways. BAR-activated AKT, induced DNA damage and inhibited cell proliferation. When the proteasome was inhibited, there was loss of BAR-mediated changes in p65 phosphorylation and SOD2 expression suggesting non-canonical NFkB signaling effects. These data suggest that BAR-induced ROS are important in inhibiting MCF7 migration and metabolism by negatively affecting glycolytic capacity and mitochondrial function.
28276738	"Why me?" - women's use of spiritual causal attributions in making sense of breast cancer.	OBJECTIVE: This study addressed the role of positive (event is due to God's Love or to God's Will) and negative (event is due to God's Anger) spiritual causal attributions in women's adjustment to breast cancer. DESIGN: Ninety-three women diagnosed with breast cancer were assessed at six times from pre-diagnosis through two years post-surgery. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Women completed positive and negative measures of spiritual causal attributions (e.g. God's Love), cognitive appraisals (e.g. threat), coping behaviour (e.g. avoidance) and well-being (e.g. distress). RESULTS: Positive spiritual attributions were consistently related to positive aspects of adjustment (e.g. positive appraisal, acceptance coping, and/or emotional well-being) while negative spiritual attribution was related to negative factors (e.g. appraisals of loss and uncontrollability, avoidance coping, and/or emotional distress). Path analyses revealed that the effects of positive and negative spiritual attributions on well-being were mediated by general cognitive appraisal and coping behaviour. Cross-lagged correlational analysis revealed a 'downward spiral' effect wherein the negative attribution of God's Anger at pre-diagnosis predicted greater distress at 1 week pre-surgery which in turn predicted an increase in the negative attribution and so on across time. CONCLUSION: Although positive spiritual attributions may help women maintain an attitude of hope and acceptance in the face of cancer, results indicate that the effects of negative spiritual attribution can play a significant role in undermining their well-being.
28274406	Assessing long-term complications in patients undergoing immediate postmastectomy breast reconstruction and adjuvant radiation.	PURPOSE: The purpose of this article is to report the long-term rate and timing of complications associated with postmastectomy radiation therapy (PMRT) following immediate breast reconstruction in a large patient population. METHODS AND MATERIALS: We identified and reviewed the charts of all patients with stages I through IIIC breast cancer who underwent mastectomy with immediate reconstruction followed by subsequent radiation therapy between November 1997 and May 2010. We aimed to assess the rate of major complications, defined as events requiring a separate and distinct procedure. Statistical analysis between variables was evaluated using Fisher exact test and Pearson chi2 Elder et al. (2005) test. RESULTS: In total, 134 patients met inclusion criteria for having adequate long-term follow-up and documentation. The median follow-up for all patients was 77.4 months (range, 6-185 months). The overall major complication rate was found to be 44%. Nine patients (6.7%) experienced complications for which a secondary procedure could not be performed to retain a reconstructed breast. The average time between initiation of PMRT and the first major complication was 13.5 months, with 68.3% of first major complications occurring within 1 year of PMRT initiation and 81.7% within 2 years. The difference in incidence of major complications for patients undergoing immediate tissue expander/implant reconstruction followed by PMRT was not statistically different when compared with that for patients with immediate autologous tissue reconstruction followed by PMRT (47.3% vs 30.4%, P = .168). CONCLUSIONS: The risk of first major complications and reconstruction loss in patients undergoing PMRT on immediately reconstructed breasts is greatest within 1 year of beginning radiation therapy and decreases significantly with time. Immediate autologous tissue reconstruction followed by PMRT can be performed with reasonable complication rates.
28274404	In vivo dosimetry with optically stimulated luminescent dosimeters for conformal and intensity-modulated radiation therapy: A 2-year multicenter cohort study.	PURPOSE: Optically stimulated luminescent dosimeters (OSLDs) are utilized for in vivo dosimetry (IVD) of modern radiation therapy techniques such as intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT). Dosimetric precision achieved with conventional techniques may not be attainable. In this work, we measured accuracy and precision for a large sample of clinical OSLD-based IVD measurements. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Weekly IVD measurements were collected from 4 linear accelerators for 2 years and were expressed as percent differences from planned doses. After outlier analysis, 10,224 measurements were grouped in the following way: overall, modality (photons, electrons), treatment technique (3-dimensional [3D] conformal, field-in-field intensity modulation, inverse-planned IMRT, and VMAT), placement location (gantry angle, cardinality, and central axis positioning), and anatomical site (prostate, breast, head and neck, pelvis, lung, rectum and anus, brain, abdomen, esophagus, and bladder). Distributions were modeled via a Gaussian function. Fitting was performed with least squares, and goodness-of-fit was assessed with the coefficient of determination. Model means (mu) and standard deviations (sigma) were calculated. Sample means and variances were compared for statistical significance by analysis of variance and the Levene tests (alpha = 0.05). RESULTS: Overall, mu +/- sigma was 0.3 +/- 10.3%. Precision for electron measurements (6.9%) was significantly better than for photons (10.5%). Precision varied significantly among treatment techniques (P < .0001) with field-in-field lowest (sigma = 7.2%) and IMRT and VMAT highest (sigma = 11.9% and 13.4%, respectively). Treatment site models with goodness-of-fit greater than 0.90 (6 of 10) yielded accuracy within +/-3%, except for head and neck (mu = -3.7%). Precision varied with treatment site (range, 7.3%-13.0%), with breast and head and neck yielding the best and worst precision, respectively. Placement on the central axis of cardinal gantry angles yielded more precise results (sigma = 8.5%) compared with other locations (range, 10.5%-11.4%). CONCLUSIONS: Accuracy of +/-3% was achievable. Precision ranged from 6.9% to 13.4% depending on modality, technique, and treatment site. Simple, standardized locations may improve IVD precision. These findings may aid development of patient-specific tolerances for OSLD-based IVD.
28274398	Lower mean heart dose with deep inspiration breath hold-whole breast irradiation compared with brachytherapy-based accelerated partial breast irradiation for women with left-sided tumors.	PURPOSE: For left-sided breast cancer, radiation to the heart is a concern. We present a comparison of mean heart and coronary artery biologically effective dose (BED) between accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) and whole breast irradiation with deep inspiration breath-hold technique (DIBH-WBI). METHODS AND MATERIALS: A total of 100 patients with left-sided, early-stage breast cancer were identified. Fifty underwent single-entry catheter-based APBI and 50 underwent DIBH-WBI. The heart, left anterior descending/interventricular branch, left main, and right coronary artery were delineated. BEDs were calculated from APBI treatment plans (34 Gy in 3.4 Gy twice daily fractions) and for 4 separate plans generated for each DIBH-WBI patient: 50 Gy in 25 fractions (50/25), 50/25 + 10/5 boost, 40/15, and 40/15 + 10/5 boost. RESULTS: BED to the heart and coronary vessels were statistically significantly higher with APBI than with any of the DIBH-WBI dose/fractionation schedules. CONCLUSIONS: For women with left-sided early-stage breast cancer, DIBH-WBI resulted in statistically significantly lower mean BED to the heart and coronary vessels compared with APBI. This is likely due to increased physical separation between the heart and tumor bed afforded by the DIBH-WBI technique. Long-term assessment of late effects in these tissues will be required to determine whether these differences are clinically significant.
28274383	Cancer research priorities and gaps in Iran: the influence of cancer burden on cancer research outputs between 1997 and 2014.	OBJECTIVES: As a developing country, Iran is experiencing the increasing burden of cancers, which are currently the third leading cause of mortality in Iran. This study aims to demonstrate that cancer research in Iran concentrates on the cancer research priorities based on the global burden of disease (GBD) reports. STUDY DESIGN: Descriptive evaluation of all cancers disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) was performed using GBD data. Also a comprehensive search was conducted using cancer-associated keywords to obtain all cancer-related publications from Iran, indexed in Web of Science. METHOD: Multiple regression analysis and correlation coefficients (R2) were used to evaluate the possible associations between cancer research publications and GBD. RESULTS: During 1996-2014, the majority of cancer-related publications in Iran focused on breast cancer, leukaemia and stomach cancer, respectively. This study found hypothetical correlations between cancer publications in Iran in line with the burden of cancer as reported by GBD. Particularly, correlations between years lived with disability (YLD) and cancer-related publications were more obvious. CONCLUSION: This study introduces a new outline in setting cancer research priorities in the region.
28273590	Upregulation of breast cancer resistance protein and major vault protein in drug resistant epilepsy.	PURPOSE: Identifying factors involved in the development of drug resistant epilepsy (DRE) remains a challenge. Candidate gene studies have shown modulation of resistance to drugs by various multidrug resistance proteins in DRE. However the resistance to drugs in DRE could be more complex and multifactorial involving molecules in different pharmacokinetic processes. In this study for the first time we have analyzed the relative expression of four molecules with different drug resistance mechanisms in two most common DRE pathologies, mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) and focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) with respect to each other and also with different non-epileptic controls. METHODS: Brain tissues resected from MTLE (n=16) and FCD type I and II (n=12) patients who had undergone surgery were analysed for mRNA levels of multidrug resistance-associated protein 1(MRP1), major vault protein (MVP), breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), and one drug metabolising enzyme (UGT1A4) as compared to non-epileptic controls which were tissues resected from tumor periphery (n=6) and autopsy tissues (n=4) by quantitative PCR. RESULTS: We found significant upregulation of MVP and BCRP whereas MRP1 and UGT1A4 were unaltered in both pathologies. While upregulation of BCRP was significantly higher in MTLE (9.34+/-0.45; p<0.05), upregulation of MVP was significantly higher in FCD (2.94+/-0.65; p<0.01). CONCLUSION: We propose that upregulation of BCRP and MVP is associated with MTLE and FCD and these molecules not only may have the potential to predict pathology specific phenotypes but may also have therapeutic potential as adjunct treatment in these pathologies.
28273504	Photocatalytic activity against azo dye and cytotoxicity on MCF-7 cell lines of zirconium oxide nanoparticle mediated using leaves of Lagerstroemia speciosa.	Metal oxide nanoparticles are gaining interest in recent years. The present paper explains about the green synthesis of zirconium oxide nanoparticles (ZrO NPs) mediated from the leaves of Lagerstroemia speciosa. The prepared ZrO NPs were characterized by UV-vis spectroscopy, FT-IR, X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Energy Dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) and Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA). The photocatalytic activity of ZrO NPs was studied for azo dye by exposing to sunlight. The azo dye was degraded up to 94.58%. Also the ZrO NPs were studied for in vitro cytotoxicity activity against breast cancer cell lines-MCF-7 and evaluated by MTT assay. The cell morphological changes were recorded by light microscope. The cells viability was seen at 500mug/mL when compared against control. Hence the research highlights, that the method was simple, eco-friendly towards environment by phytoremediation activity of the azo dye and cytotoxicity activity against MCF-7 cell lines. Hence the present paper may help to further explore the metal nanoparticle for its potential applications.
28273493	Influence of dynamic flow environment on nanoparticle-protein corona: From protein patterns to uptake in cancer cells.	The fast growing use of nanoparticles (NPs) in biotechnology and biomedicine raises concerns about human health and the environment. When introduced in physiological milieus, NPs adsorb biomolecules (especially proteins) forming the so-called protein corona (PC). As it is the PC that mostly interacts with biological systems, it represents a major element of the NPs' biological identity with impact on nanotoxicology, nanosafety and targeted delivery of nanomedicines. To date, NP-protein interactions have been largely investigated in vitro, but this condition is far from mimicking the dynamic nature of physiological environments. Here we investigate the effect of shear stress on PC by exposing lipid NPs with different surface chemistry (either unmodified and PEGylated) to circulating fetal bovine serum (FBS). PC formed upon in vitro incubation was used as a reference. We demonstrate that PC is significantly influenced by exposure to dynamic flow and that changes in PC composition are dependent on both exposure time and NP's surface chemistry. Notably, alterations induced by dynamic flow affected cellular uptake of lipid NPs in both human cervical cancer (HeLa) and human breast adenocarcinoma (MCF7) cell lines.
28272969	Prohibitin promotes androgen receptor activation in ER-positive breast cancer.	Prohibitin (PHB) is an evolutionarily conserved protein with multiple functions in both normal and cancer cells. Androgen receptor (AR) was reported to act as a different role in the ER-positive and ER-negative breast cancer. However, little is known about the role of PHB and whether PHB could regulate AR expression in the ER-positive breast cancer. Here, we determined the expression and clinical outcomes of PHB in breast cancer samples using 121 breast cancer tissues and published databases, and investigated the role of PHB in breast cancer cell growth, apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in the ER-positive breast cancer cells. We obtained the expression of PHB is significantly low in breast cancer samples, and low PHB expression positively correlated with poor prognosis of breast cancer. We detected that PHB could inhibit breast cancer cell proliferation, change cell cycle distribution and promote cell apoptosis in the ER-positive breast cancer cells. Moreover, we found PHB could significantly increase AR expression in both mRNA and protein levels in the ER-positive breast cancer cells. Additionally, a significant positive correlation between PHB and AR expression was identified in the 121 breast cancer tissues. PHB and AR expression are associated with prognosis in the ER-positive breast cancer patients. Our results indicate that PHB promotes AR activation in ER-positive breast cancer, making PHB and AR potential molecular targets for ER-positive breast cancer therapy.
28272917	Candidate Gene Analysis of Breast Cancer in the Jordanian Population of Arab Descent: A Case-Control Study.	This study aimed to investigate whether there are specific polymorphisms within six genes (BRCA1, BRCA2, TP53, DAPK1, MMP9 promoter, and TOX3) that are associated with breast cancer among the Jordanian population. Sequenom MassARRAY system was used to genotype 17 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within these genes in 230 Jordanian breast cancer patients and 225 healthy individuals. Three SNPs (MMP9 (rs6065912), TOX3 (rs1420546), and DAPK1 (rs11141901) were found to be significantly associated with an increased risk of breast cancer (p < .05). This study is the first to provide evidence that genetic variation in MMP9, TOX3, and DAPK1 genes contribute to the development of breast cancer in the Jordanian population.
28272911	Effect of Cruciferous Vegetable Intake on Oxidative Stress Biomarkers: Differences by Breast Cancer Status.	This post hoc analysis examined cruciferous vegetable intake on urinary oxidative metabolites in postmenopausal women. Intervention participants (n = 69) received cruciferous vegetables (>/=14 cups/week) during a 3-week period. First morning urine measured 8-isoprostane and 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine. Dietary intake was estimated using 24-h recalls. When stratified by history of breast cancer, those with breast cancer had significantly lower post-intervention urinary 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine values in the intervention arm versus. the control arm (1.1 ng/mL vs. 3.2 ng/mL, p = .01) after adjustment for baseline 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine. This was not observed in those without breast cancer. Further work is needed to understand the role of breast cancer in these relationships.
28272536	Prediction of years of life after diagnosis of breast cancer using omics and omic-by-treatment interactions.	Breast cancer (BC) is the second most common type of cancer and a major cause of death for women. Commonly, BC patients are assigned to risk groups based on the combination of prognostic and prediction factors (eg, patient age, tumor size, tumor grade, hormone receptor status, etc). Although this approach is able to identify risk groups with different prognosis, patients are highly heterogeneous in their response to treatments. To improve the prediction of BC patients, we extended clinical models (including prognostic and prediction factors with whole-omic data) to integrate omics profiles for gene expression and copy number variants (CNVs). We describe a modeling framework that is able to incorporate clinical risk factors, high-dimensional omics profiles, and interactions between omics and non-omic factors (eg, treatment). We used the proposed modeling framework and data from METABRIC (Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer Consortium) to assess the impact on the accuracy of BC patient survival predictions when omics and omic-by-treatment interactions are being considered. Our analysis shows that omics and omic-by-treatment interactions explain a sizable fraction of the variance on survival time that is not explained by commonly used clinical covariates. The sizable interaction effects observed, together with the increase in prediction accuracy, suggest that whole-omic profiles could be used to improve prognosis prediction among BC patients.
28271910	Early clinical development of epidermal growth factor receptor targeted therapy in breast cancer.	INTRODUCTION: Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) targeted treatment has been evaluated but has not shown a clear clinical benefit for breast cancer. This review article aims to consider the knowledge of the biological background of EGFR pathways in dissecting clinical studies of EGFR targeted treatment in breast cancer. Areas covered: This review focuses on the role of the EGFR pathway and the investigational drugs that target EGFR for breast cancer. Expert opinion: Recent studies have indicated that EGFR targeted therapy for breast cancer has some promising effects for patients with triple-negative breast cancer, basal-like breast cancer, and inflammatory breast cancer. However, predictive and prognostic biomarkers for EGFR targeted therapy have not been identified. The overexpression or amplification of EGFR itself may not be the true factor of induction of the canonical pathway as an oncogenic driver of breast cancer. Instead, downstream, non-canonical pathways related to EGFR may contribute to some aspects of the biological behavior of breast cancer; therefore, the blockade of the receptor could result in sufficient suppression of downstream pathways to inhibit the aggressive behavior of breast cancer. Mechanistic studies to investigate the dynamic interaction between the EGFR pathway and non-canonical pathways are warranted.
28267692	Diabetes Increases Morbidities of Colonic Diverticular Disease and Colonic Diverticular Hemorrhage: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.	Colonic diverticular disease (CDD) and colonic diverticular hemorrhage (CDH) are the most common disorders in hospital admissions and outpatient health clinic visits. However, risk factors of CDD and CDH are complicated and need to be discussed. Diabetes mellitus (DM) has been related with CDD and CDH, but the associations remain ambiguous. Therefore, we performed a literature search for studies involving the associations among DM, morbidity of CDD, and incidence of CDH. Relative risks or odds ratios with their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were combined and weighted to produce summary effect size. Sensitivity analysis and subgroup analysis were further performed. We selected 17 studies that involved a total of 8212 patients with diabetes, 381,579 controls without diabetes. We found that patients with DM had approximately 1.201 times higher CDD morbidity in prospective studies (95% CI, 1.135-1.270) with no significant heterogeneity (Q = 0.42, P = 0.519, I = 0%). DM was associated with a 52.8% increase in risk of CDH (95% CI, 14%-104%); we did not find significant heterogeneity among these studies (Q = 12.94, P = 0.114, I = 38.2%). This meta-analysis confirms that DM is an important risk factor for morbidities of CDD and CDH.
28267454	From Bench to Bed: New Gastrin-Releasing Peptide Receptor-Directed Radioligands and Their Use in Prostate Cancer.	Gastrin-releasing peptide receptors (GRPRs) are overexpressed in prostate and breast cancer, and are therefore attractive molecular targets for diagnosis and therapy with radiolabeled GRPR-directed peptide probes. The amphibian tetradecapeptide bombesin or the mammalian gastrin-releasing peptide and neuromedin C have been modified with a variety of chelators. As a result, labeling with radiometals attractive for SPECT or PET imaging and for radionuclide therapy has led to the development of peptide radioligands suitable for in vivo targeting of prostate cancer. A shift of paradigm from internalizing GRPR-agonists to antagonists has occurred owing to the higher biosafety and superior pharmacokinetics of radioantagonists.
28265850	A general description for Chinese medicine in treating premature ovarian failure.	Premature ovarian failure (POF) is a kind of gynecological disease that causes amenorrhea, infertility, menopause and urogenital symptoms. Currently hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is the most popular choice for women with POF to get rid of menopausal syndrome. However, as the popularization of Chinese herbs made Chinese medicine (CM) shine new lights, physicians are able to treat POF with both meno-herbs and integrated therapy. HRT has its own indications and contraindications. For example, unexplained vaginal bleeding, acute liver damage, liver dysfunction, vascular embolization, and breast cancer are all contraindications of HRT, and CM is taken by more physicians as an adjuvant therapy. This review, including a range of common Chinese herbs and formulations according to the existing literature, provides a general description of CM treating POF from the aspects of mechanisms and clinical application. It also highlights acupuncture as a unique physiotherapy for POF. Although the validity of CM has been supported by the evidence of many preclinical trials, clinical trials and meta-analysis, the adverse events with CM therapy still exist and no guarantee has been made for its safety. This review concludes the updated information for CM treating POF contributing to further studies.
28265649	Developing Recommendations for Evidence-Based Clinical Preventive Services for Diverse Populations: Methods of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force.	The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) summarizes the principles and considerations that guide development of its recommendations for diverse U.S. populations. It uses these principles through each step in the evidence-based guideline process: developing the research plan, conducting the evidence review, developing the recommendation, and communicating to guideline users. Three recent recommendations provide examples of how the USPSTF has used these principles: the 2015 recommendation on screening for abnormal blood glucose and type 2 diabetes; the 2016 recommendation on screening for breast cancer; and the recommendation on screening for prostate cancer, which is currently in progress. A more comprehensive list of recommendations that includes considerations for specific populations is also provided.
28264610	Corynebacterium species causing breast abscesses among patients attending a tertiary care hospital in Chennai, South India.	BACKGROUND: Corynebacterium species other than Corynebacterium diphtheriae were mostly considered contaminants in the past, but there are reports of their association with wide variety of human infections lately. In this study, we look into Corynebacterium species isolated from breast abscess patients and assess their antimicrobial susceptibility pattern and treatment outcomes. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Pus samples from suspected breast abscess cases were examined from October 2014 to September 2015. Growth of Gram-positive bacilli morphologically resembling Corynebacterium species were identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization- time of flight mass spectrometry identifications generated by the Vitek MS system (bioMerieux, France) (MALDI-TOF Vitek MS system) and antimicrobial susceptibility was done. RESULTS: Corynebacterium species were isolated from 10 female breast abscess patients with median age of 36 years (range 25-59 years). Out of the 10 isolates four isolates were identified as C. kroppenstedtii; one isolate as C. striatum and five isolates were identified as C. amycolatum/C.xerosis. Out of four isolates of C .kroppenstedtii, two isolates were resistant to cotrimoxazole and one C. striatum isolate was resistant to penicillin, ampicillin, cotrimoxazole and clindamycin. Of the five isolates identified as C amycolatum/C xerosis, all were sensitive to vancomycin and linezolid but resistant to clindamycin. All the patients were treated with incision, drainage and antibiotics based on the sensitivity pattern; eight were cured and two patients did not come for follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Corynebacterium species should be considered one of the causative agents of breast abscess and a varied susceptibility profile amongst the different species makes susceptibility testing important. Identification by MALDI-TOF Vitek MS system may not differentiate between C. amycolatum and C. xerosis.
28263720	Simvastatin down-regulates differential genetic profiles produced by organochlorine mixtures in primary breast cell (HMEC).	Women all over the world are exposed to an unavoidable contamination by organochlorine pesticides and other chemical pollutants. Many of them are considered as xenoestrogens and have been associated with the development and progression of breast cancer. We have demonstrated that the most prevalent pesticide mixtures found in healthy women and in women diagnosed with breast cancer modulates the gene expression in human epithelial mammary cells. Statins are well-known cholesterol-depleting agents acting as inhibitors of cholesterol synthesis. Since the early 1990s, it has been known that statins could be successfully used in cancer therapy, including breast cancer, but the exact mechanism behind anti-tumor activity of the statins remains unclear. In the present study we evaluated the effect of simvastatin in the gene expression pattern induced by realistic organochlorine mixtures found in breast cancer patients. The gene expression of 94 genes related with the cell signaling pathways were assessed. Our results indicate that simvastatin exerts a global down regulating effect on successfully determined genes (78.7%), thus attenuating the effects induced by organochlorine mixtures on the gene profile of human mammary epithelial cells. This effect was more evident on genes whose function is the ATP-binding process (that also were particularly up-regulated by pesticide mixtures). We also found that MERTK (a proto-oncogene which is overexpressed in several malignancies) and PDGFRB (a member of the platelet-derived growth factor family whose expression is high in breast-cancer cells that have become resistant to endocrine therapy) were among the genes with a higher differential regulation by simvastatin. Since resistance to treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors is closely related to MERKT, our findings would enhance the possible utility of statins in breast cancer treatment, i.e. improving therapeutic results combining statins with tyrosine Kinase inhibitors.
28263391	Overexpression of lipid metabolism genes and PBX1 in the contralateral breasts of women with estrogen receptor-negative breast cancer.	Risk biomarkers for estrogen receptor (ER)-negative breast cancer have clear value for breast cancer prevention. We previously reported a set of lipid metabolism (LiMe) genes with high expression in the contralateral unaffected breasts (CUBs) of ER-negative cancer cases. We now further examine LiMe gene expression in both tumor and CUB, and investigate the role of Pre-B-cell leukemia homeobox-1 (PBX1) as a candidate common transcription factor for LiMe gene expression. mRNA was extracted from laser-capture microdissected epithelium from tumor and CUB of 84 subjects (28 ER-positive cases, 28 ER-negative cases, 28 healthy controls). Gene expression was quantitated by qRT-PCR. Logistic regression models were generated to predict ER status of the contralateral cancer. Protein expression of HMGCS2 and PBX1 was measured using immunohistochemistry. The effect of PBX1 on LiMe gene expression was examined by overexpressing PBX1 in MCF10A cells with or without ER, and by suppressing PBX1 in MDA-MB-453 cells. The expression of DHRS2, HMGCS2, UGT2B7, UGT2B11, ALOX15B, HPGD, UGT2B28 and GLYATL1 was significantly higher in ER-negative versus ER-positive CUBs, and predicted ER status of the tumor in test and validation sets. In contrast, LiMe gene expression was significantly lower in ER-negative than ER-positive tumors. PBX1 overexpression in MCF10A cells up-regulated most LiMe genes, but not in MCF10A cells overexpressing ER. Suppressing PBX1 in MDA-MB-453 cells resulted in decrease of LiMe gene expression. Four binding sites of PBX1 and cofactor were identified in three lipid metabolism genes using ChIP-qPCR. These data suggest a novel role for PBX1 in the regulation of lipid metabolism genes in benign breast, which may contribute to ER-negative tumorigenesis.
28262122	Regio- and stereo-selective hydroxylations of ingenane diterpenoids by Mortierella ramanniana and Gibberella fujikuroi.	The regio- and stereo-selective hydroxylations of two ingenane diterpenoids, 20-deoxyingenol (1) and 13-oxyingenol dodecanoat (2), by the filamentous fungi Mortierella ramanniana and Gibberella fujikuroi were investigated in the present study. Four undescribed metabolites (3-6) of substrate 1 and two undescribed metabolites (7 and 8) of substrate 2 were isolated. All the metabolites were identified as hydroxylated ingenane derivatives by extensive NMR and HR-ESI-MS data analyses. All the biotransformed compounds and the substrates were evaluated for their cytotoxicities against three human cancer cell lines, including human colon cancer Caco-2, breast cancer MCF-7, and adriamycin (ADM)-resistant MCF-7/ADM cell lines. All ingenane alcohols (1, and 3-6) displayed no significant cytotoxic activities. The substrate 13-oxyingenol dodecanoat (2) showed moderate cytotoxicity with IC50 values being 35.59 +/- 5.37 mumol.L-1 (Caco-2), 24.04 +/- 4.70 mumol.L-1 (MCF-7), and 22.24 +/- 5.19 mumol.L-1 (MCF-7/ADM). However, metabolites 7 and 8 displayed no significant cytotoxicity. These results indicated that the hydroxylation at the C-13 aliphatic acid ester of substrate 2 can significantly reduce the cytotoxic activity.
28262114	MicroRNAs mediate therapeutic and preventive effects of natural agents in breast cancer.	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a set of non-coding small RNA molecules that play a critical role in regulation of protein coding genes in cells. MiRNAs have been extensively studied as novel biomarkers, therapeutic targets, and new drugs in various human diseases. Breast cancer is a one of the leading tumor types significantly affecting women health worldwide. Over the past decade, a number of natural agents, such as paclitaxel and curcumin, have been applied for treatment and prevention of breast cancer due to their relatively low toxicity. However, the mechanisms of action have not been completely understood. Investigation on miRNAs is able to potentially provide a novel insight into better understanding the anticancer activities of these natural products. Given that a single miRNA can target multiple genes, theoretically, those genes involved in a certain phenotype can be clustered with one or a few miRNAs. Therefore, pleiotropic activities of natural agents should be interpreted by interactions between selected miRNAs and their targets. In this review, we summarize the latest publications related to the alterations of miRNAs by two natural agents (paclitaxel and curcumin) that are currently used in intervention of breast cancer, and conclude that the mechanism involving the regulation of miRNA expression is one of the keys to understand pleiotropic activities of natural agents.
28260895	Biodegradable polymeric micelles coencapsulating paclitaxel and honokiol: a strategy for breast cancer therapy in vitro and in vivo.	The combination of chemotherapy drugs attracts more attention in clinical cancer trials. However, the poor water solubility of chemotherapeutic drugs restricts their anticancer application. In order to improve antitumor efficiency and reduce side effects of free drugs, we prepared paclitaxel (PTX) and honokiol (HK) combination methoxy poly(ethylene glycol)-poly(caprolactone) micelles (P-H/M) by solid dispersion method against breast cancer. The particle size of P-H/M was 28.7+/-2.5 nm, and transmission electron microscope image confirmed that P-H/M were spherical in shape with small particle size. After being encapsulated in micelles, the release of PTX or HK showed a sustained behavior in vitro. In addition, both the cytotoxicity and the cellular uptake of P-H/M were increased in 4T1 cells, and P-H/M induced more apoptosis than PTX-loaded micelles or HK-loaded micelles, as analyzed by flow cytometry assay and Western blot. Furthermore, the antitumor effect of P-H/M was significantly improved compared with PTX-loaded micelles or HK-loaded micelles in vivo. P-H/M were more effective in inhibiting tumor proliferation, inducing tumor apoptosis, and decreasing the density of microvasculature. Moreover, bioimaging analysis showed that drug-loaded polymeric micelles could accumulate more in tumor tissues compared with the free drug. Our results suggested that P-H/M may have potential applications in breast cancer therapy.
28260828	Differential Site-Based Expression of Pentose Phosphate Pathway-Related Proteins among Breast Cancer Metastases.	Purpose. We aimed to investigate the expression of pentose phosphate pathway- (PPP-) related proteins in metastatic breast cancer and its relationship with clinicopathologic factors. Methods. Tissue samples from 126 metastatic breast cancers were included in a tissue microarray. Expression of PPP-related proteins [glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH), 6-phosphogluconolactonase (6PGL), 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6PGDH), and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor (NRF2)] was determined by immunohistochemistry. Results. G6PDH (p = 0.011) and cytoplasmic NRF2 (p = 0.001) showed the highest expression in brain metastases. Human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER-2) positivity was associated with G6PDH (p < 0.001) and cytoplasmic NRF2 (p = 0.015) positivity. A high Ki-67 labeling index (LI) was correlated with nuclear NRF2 positivity (p = 0.037), and HER-2-positive luminal B type was associated with G6PDH positivity (p = 0.001). On multivariate Cox analysis, independent risk factors of short overall survival were 6PGL positivity in bone metastasis (HR 4.180, 95% CI 1.160-15.06, p = 0.029) and low Ki-67 LI in lung metastasis (HR 11.853, 95% CI 1.841-76.30, p = 0.009). Conclusion. Differential expression of PPP-related proteins correlated with different prognoses and metastatic sites, with the highest expression in brain metastases, and could be a potential therapeutic target.
28260101	Upregulation of p38 pathway accelerates proliferation and migration of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells.	Tumor cells capture the signaling pathways used by normal tissue to promote their own survival and dissemination and among them, the NF-kappaB and MAPK pathways (ERK, JNK and p38). MAPK activation has ambiguous effects on tumor cell fate depending on cell type, cancer stage and the engaged MAPK isoforms. A synthetic peptide named LyeTx II, derived from the venom of the Brazilian spider Lycosa erythrognatha, was capable of increasing MDA-MB-231 aggressive breast cancer cell proliferation as indicated by MTT and BrdU (5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine) incorporation assay and cell migration. A correlation has been established between the accelerated proliferation and migration observed in the presence of LyeTx II and the upregulation of p38 MAPK phosphorylation. The use of the selective inhibitor of p38alpha/beta (SB203580) abrogated the peptide effect in MDA-MB-231 cells. Besides, an augment of the canonical NF-kappaB pathway activation considered as crucial in cancer progression was noted after cell incubation with LyeTx II. Importantly, activation of p38 and NF-kappaB pathways was dependent on TAK1 activity. Together, these data suggest that TAK1-p38 pathway may represent an interesting target for treatment of aggressive breast cancers.
28260080	Dysregulation of TMPRSS3 and TNFRSF11B correlates with tumorigenesis and poor prognosis in patients with breast cancer.	The present study was carried out to investigate the clinical significance of TMPRSS3 and TNFRSF11B in breast cancer. Thus, the expression levels of TMPRSS3 and TNFRSF11B and the correlation with prognosis in patients with breast cancer were analyzed in silico using gene microarray and hierarchical clustering analysis. Then, the differential expression in breast cancer vs. normal breast tissue was explored in the Oncomine platform and verified in our independent samples using IHC technique. Our results indicated that TMPRSS3 was upregulated and TNFRSF11B was downregulated in breast cancer tissues compared with the levels in the human normal breast tissues. TMPRSS3 and TNFRSF11B were confirmed to be correlated with distant organ metastasis of breast cancer. Moreover, upregulation of TMPRSS3 accompanied by downregulation of TNFRSF11B was found to be associated with a shorter median overall survival and indicated a poor prognosis. In conclusion, TMPRSS3 and TNFRSF11B may have potential prognostic value to be used as tumor biomarkers in breast cancer patients.
28260023	Silencing BMI1 radiosensitizes human breast cancer cells by inducing DNA damage and autophagy.	Overexpression of BMI1 in human cancer cells, a member of the polycomb group of repressive complexes, correlates with advanced stage of disease, aggressive clinico-pathological behavior, poor prognosis, and resistance to radiation and chemotherapy. Studies have shown that experimental reduction of BMI1 protein level in tumor cells results in inhibition of cell proliferation, induction of apoptosis and/or senescence, and increased susceptibility to cytotoxic agents and radiation therapy. Although a role for BMI1 in cancer progression and its importance as a molecular target for cancer therapy has been established, information on the impact of silencing BMI1 in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and its consequence on radiotherapy have not been well studied. Therefore, in the present study we investigated the potential therapeutic benefit of radiation therapy in BMI1-silenced breast cancer cells and studied the mechanism(s) of radiosensitization. Human MDA-MB-231 and SUM159PT breast cancer cells that were either stably transfected with a lentiviral vector expressing BMI1 shRNA (shBMI1) or control shRNA (shControl) or transient transfection with a BMI1-specific siRNA were used. Silencing of BMI1 resulted in marked reduction in BMI1 both at the mRNA and protein level that was accompanied by a significant reduction in cell migration compared to control cells. Further, BMI1 knockdown produced a marked enhancement of DNA damage as evidenced by Comet Assay and gammaH2AX foci, resulting in a dose-dependent radiosensitization effect. Molecular studies revealed modulation of protein expression that is associated with the DNA damage response (DDR) and autophagy pathways. Our results demonstrate that BMI1 is an important therapeutic target in breast cancer and suppression of BMI1 produces radiation sensitivity. Further, combining BMI1-targeted therapeutics with radiation might benefit patients diagnosed with TNBC.
28259996	Combined treatment with vitamin C and methotrexate inhibits triple-negative breast cancer cell growth by increasing H2O2 accumulation and activating caspase-3 and p38 pathways.	Methotrexate (MTX) is widely used as both an anticancer and anti-rheumatoid arthritis drug. Although MTX has been used to inhibit the growth of many cancer cells, it cannot effectively inhibit growth of triple-negative breast cancer cells (TNBC cells). Vitamin C is an antioxidant that can prevent oxidative stress. In addition, vitamin C has been applied as adjunct treatment for growth inhibition of cancer cells. Recent studies indicated that combined treatment with vitamin C and MTX may inhibit MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell growth through G2/M elongation. However, the mechanisms remain unknown. The aim of the present study was to determine whether combined treatment with low-dose vitamin C and MTX inhibits TNBC cell growth and to investigate the mechanisms of vitamin C/MTX-induced cytotoxicity. Neither low-dose vitamin C alone nor MTX alone inhibited TNBC cell growth. However, combined low-dose vitamin C and MTX had synergistic anti-proliferative/cytotoxic effects on TNBC cells. In addition, co-treatment increased H2O2 levels and activated both caspase-3 and p38 cell death pathways.
28259959	Overexpression of TMPRSS4 promotes tumor proliferation and aggressiveness in breast cancer.	Transmembrane protease serine 4 (TMPRSS4) is a novel type II transmembrane serine protease that is overexpressed in various types of human cancers and has an important function in cancer progression. However, there is a paucity of data available regarding the biological effects of TMPRSS4 on breast cancer (BC) cells and the underlying mechanisms. In this study, expression of TMPRSS4 in BC tissues was detected by immunohistochemistry. The relationship between TMPRSS4 expression and clinicopathological characteristics as well as prognosis was evaluated. The effects of TMPRSS4 on cell proliferation, migration and invasion were investigated in BC cell lines in vitro. Additionally, RT-qPCR and western blot analysis were used to determine the expressions of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) biomarkers and TMPRSS4 in BC cell lines. We found that TMPRSS4 was overexpressed in BC tissues and its expression level was closely correlated with tumor size, histological grade, lymph node metastasis, clinical stage as well as poor survival (all P<0.05) and could be recognized as an independent prognostic factor for BC patients. Overexpression of TMPRSS4 promoted the proliferation, migration and invasion of BC cells in vitro. Moreover, TMPRSS4 knockdown significantly enhanced the expression of E-cadherin and claudin-1 and inhibited the expression of vimentin and Slug, indicating suppression of EMT. Our results suggest that TMPRSS4 plays a crucial role in the progression of BC. Moreover, TMPRSS4 overexpression promoted the proliferation, invasion and migration of BC cells by possibly inducing EMT. To conclude, TMPRSS4 may be a potential therapeutic target for cancer treatment.
28259909	Prostate apoptosis response 4 (PAR4) expression modulates WNT signaling pathways in MCF7 breast cancer cells: A possible mechanism underlying PAR4-mediated docetaxel chemosensitivity.	Docetaxel is an effective drug for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer. However, the exact mechanisms and/or markers associated with chemosensitivity or resistance to docetaxel remain unclear. We previously showed that the expression of prostate apoptosis response 4 (PAR4) inhibits the growth of MCF7 breast cancer cells and increases their sensitivity to docetaxel. Using cDNA microarray analysis, we evaluated transcriptome changes in MCF7 cells expressing increased levels of PAR4 and control cells before and after docetaxel treatment. Some of the top gene networks generated from the differentially expressed genes were related to the winglesstype MMTV integration 1 (WNT) canonical (WNT/beta-catenin) and noncanonical (betacateninindependent) pathways. The Human WNT signaling pathway RT2 profiler PCR array was used to validate the effects of PAR4 on the expression pattern of genes involved in the WNT pathway. CACNAD2A3, GDF5 and IL6 were upregulated and NANOG was downregulated in the MCF7 breast cancer cells expressing increased levels of PAR4 after treatment with docetaxel, likely indicating inactivation of the WNT/beta-catenin pathway. Upregulation of FGF7, LEF1 and TWIST1 indicated activation of the WNT/betacatenin pathway. Although preliminary, our findings could be of particular interest for understanding the action of PAR4 in chemosensitivity, particularly to increase the specificity and effectiveness of drug treatment and overcome resistance to chemotherapy. Further studies are needed to better understand the biological roles of PAR4 in the regulation of WNT pathways in breast cancer cells in response to docetaxel and other chemotherapeutic agents.
28259840	Quinazoline derivatives as selective CYP1B1 inhibitors.	CYP1B1 is implicated to have a role in the development of breast, ovarian, renal, skin and lung carcinomas. It has been suggested that identification of potent and specific CYP1B1 inhibitors can lead to a novel treatment of cancer. Flavonoids have a compact rigid skeleton which fit precisely within the binding cavity of CYP1B1. Systematic isosteric replacement of flavonoid 'O' atom with 'N' atom led to the prediction that a 'quinazoline' scaffold could be the basis for designing potential CYP1B1 inhibitors. A total of 20 quinazoline analogs were synthesized and screened for CYP1B1 and CYP1A1 inhibition in Sacchrosomes. IC50 determinations of six compounds with capability of inhibiting CYP1B1 identified quinazolines 5c and 5h as the best candidates for CYP1B1 inhibition, with IC50 values in the nM range. Further selectivity studies with homologous CYPs, belonging to the CYP1, CYP2 and CYP3 family of enzymes, showed that the compounds are likely to be free from critical drug-drug interaction liability. Molecular modelling studies were performed to rationalize the observed enzymatic inhibitions. Further biological studies in live yeast and human cells, harboring CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 enzymes, have illustrated the most potent compounds' cellular permeability and capability of potently inhibiting CYP1B1 enzyme expressed within live cells.
28259690	The herbal medicine Melissa officinalis extract effects on gene expression of p53, Bcl-2, Her2, VEGF-A and hTERT in human lung, breast and prostate cancer cell lines.	INTRODUCTION: Earlier, we verified that Melissa officinalis extract (MOE) elicits potent antiproliferative effects on different human cancer cells. To gain insights into the molecular mechanisms accounting for the cytotoxic effects of MOE, we assessed the expression patterns of several prominent molecules with therapeutic potential in cancer by Quantitative PCR (Q-PCR). METHODS: A549, MCF-7 and PC3 cancer cells were grown in complete RPMI 1640 and seeded in 24 well micro plates. After incubation for 72h, 100mug/ml of MOE was added and the cells were further incubated for 72h. Afterwards, the cells were subjected to RNA extraction for the means of Q-PCR. RESULTS: Our results indicated that in PC3 cancer cells, MOE resulted in a significant downregulation of VEGF-A (0.0004 fold), Bcl-2 (0.001 fold), Her2 (0.02 fold), and hTERT (0.023 fold) compared to the untreated control. In addition, VEGF-A and hTERT mRNA were significantly downregulated in MCF-7 and A549 cancer cells, as well. Notably, high anti-angiogenic activity was closely associated with a high anti-telomerase activity of MOE in studying cancer cells. The decrease in VEGF-A expression was significantly superior than that of hTERT downregulation, as PC3 cancer cells with the highest hTERT down regulation (0.023) presented the highest anti VEGF activity (0.0004 fold), whereas MCF-7 cells with the lowest hTERT inhibition (0.213) showed the lowest VEGF inhibition(0.0435) among the three studied cancer cells. We noticed that the modulation of VEGF-A and hTERT gene expression can be considered as a common target, accounting for the therapeutic potential of MOE on human breast, lung and prostate cancer cells. CONCLUSION: Altogether, it is suggested that the potent antiproliferative activity of the hydroalcoholic extract of Melissa officinalis is somehow explainable by its high potency to inhibit expression of the prominent oncogenes Bcl2, Her2, VEGF-A and hTERT in prostate cancer. In tumors with functional p53, including MCF-7 and A549 cancer cells, the role of p53, Bcl2 and Her2 is less significant. It appears that MOE exerts its antiproliferative effects in these cancer cells partly via concurrent downregulation of VEGF-A and hTERT. Additional studies are needed to clarify the role of other active molecules in cancer cells harboring functional p53.
28259297	Management of aromatase inhibitor induced musculoskeletal symptoms in postmenopausal early Breast cancer: A systematic review and meta-analysis.	Aromatase Inhibitors (AI) are widely used for the adjuvant treatment of hormone receptor positive breast cancers in the post-menopausal population. AI are often associated with significant joint and muscular symptoms; symptoms that are commonly referred to as aromatase inhibitor-associated musculoskeletal syndrome (AIMSS). AIMSS adversely impacts health-related quality of life of many patients, and reduces AI compliance. Although there are informal practice recommendations, the limited current level of evidence for management of AIMSS for breast cancer patients on aromatase inhibitors has made development of formal guidelines challenging, and remains an unmet need. This is the first systematic review to consider the evidence for all pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions in the treatment of AIMSS, including physical therapy, acupuncture and complementary therapies.
28259291	Epigenetic control of gene expression: Potential implications for cancer treatment.	Epigenetic changes are defined as inherited modifications that are not present in DNA sequence. Gene expression is regulated at various levels and not only in response to DNA modifications. Examples of epigenetic control are DNA methylation, histone deacetylation and mi-RNA expression. Methylation of several tumor suppressor gene promoters is responsible for their silencing and thus potentially sustain cancerogenesis. Similarly, histone deacetylation can lead to oncogene activation. mi-RNA are small (18-20 nucleotides) non-coding RNA fragments capable of inhibiting other m-RNA, ultimately altering the balance in oncogene and tumor suppressor gene expression. It has been shown that growth of several tumor types can be stimulated by epigenetic changes in various phases of cancerogenesis, and drugs able to interfere with these mechanisms can have a positive impact on tumor progression. As matter of fact, epigenetic changes are dynamic and can be reversed by epigenetic inhibitors. Recently, methyltransferase and histone deacetylase inhibitors have attracted the attention of researchers and clinicians as they potentially provide alternative therapeutic options in some cancers. Drugs that inhibit DNA methylation or histone deacetylation have been studied for the reactivation of tumor suppressor genes and repression of cancer cell growth. Epigenetic inhibitors work alone or in combination with other therapeutic agents. To date, a number of epigenetic inhibitors have been approved for cancer treatment. The main challenge in the field of epigenetic inhibitors is their lack of specificity. In this review article we describe their mechanisms of action and potential in cancer treatment.
28257835	Stratifying melanoma and breast cancer TCGA datasets on the basis of the CNV of transcription factor binding sites common to proliferation- and apoptosis-effector genes.	Transcription factors that activate both proliferation- and apoptosis-effector genes, along with a number of related observations, have led to a proposal for a feed forward mechanism of activating the two gene classes, whereby a certain concentration of a transcription factor activates the proliferation-effector genes and a higher concentration of the transcription factor activates the apoptosis-effector genes. We reasoned that this paradigm of regulation could lead to, in the cancer setting, a selection for relatively reduced copy numbers of apoptosis-effector gene, transcription factor binding sites (TFBS). Thus, the aim of this investigation was to examine the DNA sequencing read depths of TFBS for a set of proliferation- and apoptosis-effector genes, normalized to the read depths found in matching blood samples, as provided by the cancer genome atlas (TCGA); and thereby document copy number differences among these TFBS. We determined that the melanoma and breast cancer, TCGA datasets could be divided into three categories: (i) no detectable copy number variation for the proliferation- and apoptosis-effector, shared TFBS; (ii) a relative increase in the copy number of proliferation-effector gene TFBS, compared with the copy number of the apoptosis-effector gene TFBS; and (iii) a relative decrease in the number of proliferation-effector gene TFBS. Thus, we conclude that changes in the relative copies of the shared TFBS, for proliferation- and apoptosis-effector genes, have the potential of impacting tumor cell proliferative and apoptotic capacities.
28257101	Exosomes: From Garbage Bins to Promising Therapeutic Targets.	Intercellular communication via cell-released vesicles is a very important process for both normal and tumor cells. Cell communication may involve exosomes, small vesicles of endocytic origin that are released by all types of cells and are found in abundance in body fluids, including blood, saliva, urine, and breast milk. Exosomes have been shown to carry lipids, proteins, mRNAs, non-coding RNAs, and even DNA out of cells. They are more than simply molecular garbage bins, however, in that the molecules they carry can be taken up by other cells. Thus, exosomes transfer biological information to neighboring cells and through this cell-to-cell communication are involved not only in physiological functions such as cell-to-cell communication, but also in the pathogenesis of some diseases, including tumors and neurodegenerative conditions. Our increasing understanding of why cells release exosomes and their role in intercellular communication has revealed the very complex and sophisticated contribution of exosomes to health and disease. The aim of this review is to reveal the emerging roles of exosomes in normal and pathological conditions and describe the controversial biological role of exosomes, as it is now understood, in carcinogenesis. We also summarize what is known about exosome biogenesis, composition, functions, and pathways and discuss the potential clinical applications of exosomes, especially as biomarkers and novel therapeutic agents.
28257090	From General Aberrant Alternative Splicing in Cancers and Its Therapeutic Application to the Discovery of an Oncogenic DMTF1 Isoform.	Alternative pre-mRNA splicing is a crucial process that allows the generation of diversified RNA and protein products from a multi-exon gene. In tumor cells, this mechanism can facilitate cancer development and progression through both creating oncogenic isoforms and reducing the expression of normal or controllable protein species. We recently demonstrated that an alternative cyclin D-binding myb-like transcription factor 1 (DMTF1) pre-mRNA splicing isoform, DMTF1beta, is increasingly expressed in breast cancer and promotes mammary tumorigenesis in a transgenic mouse model. Aberrant pre-mRNA splicing is a typical event occurring for many cancer-related functional proteins. In this review, we introduce general aberrant pre-mRNA splicing in cancers and discuss its therapeutic application using our recent discovery of the oncogenic DMTF1 isoform as an example. We also summarize new insights in designing novel targeting strategies of cancer therapies based on the understanding of deregulated pre-mRNA splicing mechanisms.
28256905	Effect of Bone Reading CT software on radiologist performance in detecting bone metastases from breast cancer.	OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of CT software that generates rib unfolding images and automatically numbers ribs and thoracic spines on radiologist performance in detecting thoracic bone metastases from breast cancer. METHODS: A total of 126 patients with breast cancer who underwent chest CT and fludeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET)/CT and/or bone scans were retrospectively reviewed. One board-certified radiologist (R1) and one radiology resident (R2) independently assessed the original chest CT and rib unfolding images using a commercially available post-processing software (Bone Reading) application to evaluate metastasis in the ribs and thoracic spines. Results were compared with reference standard based on CT, FDG-PET/CT and/or bone scan with follow-up. RESULTS: Based on reference standard, 78 metastatic bone lesions in 26 patients were identified. On per-patient-based analysis, Bone Reading assessed by R1/R2 had a sensitivity of 84.6%/80.8% and a specificity of 94.0%/94.0% with an accuracy of 92.1%/91.3%. The original CT reading yielded a sensitivity of 73.1%/57.7% and a specificity of 95.0%/94.0% with an accuracy of 90.5%/86.5%. The sensitivity and accuracy of Bone Reading were significantly higher than those of CT reading, as assessed by R2 (both p = 0.031). On per-lesion-based analysis, Bone Reading assessed by R1/R2 yielded a sensitivity of 84.6%/82.1% and a specificity of 99.7%/99.6% with an accuracy of 99.4%/99.3%, while the original CT reading yielded a sensitivity of 71.8%/62.8% and a specificity of 99.6%/99.5% with an accuracy of 99.2%/98.9%. The sensitivity and accuracy with Bone Reading application were significantly higher than those with CT reading by both readers (R1, p = 0.006 and p = 0.036, respectively; R2, both p < 0.001). The mean reading time needed for Bone Reading application was significantly shorter than that for original chest CT reading (p < 0.001). Bone Reading application helped readers find small and sclerotic lesions missed in original CT reading. CONCLUSION: In patients with breast cancer, the use of Bone Reading application improved radiologist performance in bone metastasis detection compared with original chest CT reading with reduced reading time. This software will be more helpful to inexperienced radiologists for improving the reading performance. Advances in knowledge: Small and sclerotic lesions can be easily missed in original CT reading. Using Bone Reading CT software can enhance the performance of radiologists in detecting bone metastasis in breast cancer. False-negative rates can be significantly reduced in both inexperienced and experienced readers.
28256768	Topics in histopathology of sweat gland and sebaceous neoplasms.	This article reviews several topics regarding sweat gland and sebaceous neoplasms. First, the clinicopathological characteristics of poroid neoplasms are summarized. It was recently reported that one-fourth of poroid neoplasms are composite tumors and one-fourth are apocrine type lesions. Recent progress in the immunohistochemical diagnosis of sweat gland neoplasms is also reviewed. CD117 can help to distinguish sweat gland or sebaceous tumors from other non-Merkel cell epithelial tumors of the skin. For immunohistochemical differential diagnosis between sweat gland carcinoma (SGC) other than primary cutanesous apocrine carcinoma and skin metastasis of breast carcinoma (SMBC), a panel of antibodies may be useful, including p63 (SGC+ , SMBC- ), CK5/6 (SGC+ , SMBC- ), podoplanin (SGC+ , SMBC- ) and mammaglobin (SGC- , SMBC+ ). Comparison of antibodies used for immunohistochemical diagnosis of sebaceous carcinoma (SC) suggests that adipophilin has the highest sensitivity and specificity. Some authors have found that immunostaining for survivin, androgen receptor and ZEB2/SIP1 has prognostic value for ocular SC, but not extraocular SC. In situ SC is rare, especially extraocular SC, but there have been several recent reports that actinic keratosis and Bowen's disease are the source of invasive SC. Finally, based on recent reports, classification of sebaceous neoplasms into three categories is proposed, which are sebaceoma (a benign neoplasm with well-defined architecture and no atypia), borderline sebaceous neoplasm (low-grade SC; an intermediate tumor with well-defined architecture and nuclear atypia) and SC (a malignant tumor with invasive growth and evident nuclear atypia).
28255844	Nanosomal Docetaxel Lipid Suspension: A Guide to Its Use in Cancer.	Nanosomal docetaxel lipid suspension (NDLS) [DoceAqualip] is a novel formulation of docetaxel approved in India for the treatment of breast cancer, hormone-refractory prostate cancer, locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, non-small cell lung cancer and advanced gastric adenocarcinoma. The lipid-based delivery system of NDLS eliminates the need for polysorbate 80 and ethanol, which are contained in the conventional docetaxel formulation and are associated with hypersensitivity reactions and infusion-related toxicities. Because of the diminished potential for NDLS to cause hypersensitivity reactions compared with conventional docetaxel, corticosteroid premedication is not required with NDLS. In a randomized trial in patients with pretreated, locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer, the overall response rate was numerically higher with NDLS than with conventional docetaxel, and post-dose adverse events in the NDLS group were considered manageable and most resolved without sequelae, despite the lack of corticosteroid premedication.
28255193	The Impact of the Expression Level of Intratumoral Dihydropyrimidine Dehydrogenase on Chemotherapy Sensitivity and Survival of Patients in Gastric Cancer: A Meta-Analysis.	The potential impact that the intratumoral expression level of dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) has on chemotherapy sensitivity and long-term survival for gastric cancer (GC) patients remains controversial; therefore, this study seeks to clarify this issue. Our meta-analysis was performed using Review Manager (RevMan) 5.3 software. In vitro drug sensitivity tests, correlation coefficients between sensitivity to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), and expression levels of intratumoral DPD were used as effective indexes to analyse. Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were used as endpoints for patient outcome, and hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were noted as measures of effect. There were 15 eligible studies including 1805 patients for the final analysis. The analysis revealed a statistically significant difference between the expression level of intratumoral DPD activity, DPD mRNA levels, and sensitivity to 5-FU in GC patients, with high expression levels of intratumoral DPD resulting in low sensitivity to 5-FU. However, no matter what therapeutic regimens were used, there was no significant difference for patient outcomes between high and low DPD expression groups, either in OS or in PFS. In conclusion, high levels of intratumoral DPD expression have a negative impact on sensitivity to 5-FU in GC patients, but no prognostic value for long-term survival was uncovered.
28254569	Synthesis and characterization of core-shell bimetallic nanoparticles for synergistic antimicrobial effect studies in combination with doxycycline on burn specific pathogens.	Nano-medicine is a breakthrough discovery in the healthcare sector. Doxycycline is a new generation antibiotic which is proved to be a boon in the treatment of patients with complicated skin infections. We have tried to explore the benefits of synthesized bimetallic silver-gold nanoparticles in combination with new generation antibiotic for burn infections. The bimetallic nanoparticles synthesized by core-shell method were characterized using scanning electron microscopy equipped with an energy dispersive spectrometer, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and UV-Vis spectroscopy. The calculated average particle sizes of the Ag-Au NPs were found to be 27.5nm. The Ag-Au core-shell BNPs show a characteristic Plasmon peak at 525nm which is broad and red shifted. The synergistic antimicrobial activity of doxycycline conjugated bimetallic nanoparticles was investigated against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Micrococcus luteus. This combined therapeutic agent showed greater bactericidal activity. Synergy of antibiotic with bimetallic nanoparticles is quite promising for significant application in burn healing therapy. The mechanism of the antibacterial activity was studied through the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that was later suppressed with antioxidant to establish correlation with the Ag-Au NPs antimicrobial activity. Ag-Au NPs showed effective antiproliferative activity toward A549 human lung cancer (CCL-185) and MCF-7 human breast cancer (HTB-22) cell lines.
28254066	Towards localization of malignant sites of asymmetry across bilateral mammograms.	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The analysis of patterns of asymmetry between the left and right mammograms of a patient can provide meaningful insights into the presence of an underlying tumor in its early stage. However, the identification of breast cancer by investigating bilateral asymmetry is difficult to perform due to the indistinct and borderline nature of the asymmetric signs as they appear on mammograms. METHODS: In this study, to increase the positive-predictive value of asymmetry in mammographic screening, a novel computerized approach for the automatic localization of malignant sites of asymmetry in mammograms is proposed. The sites of anatomical correspondence between the right and left regions of each radiographic projection were extracted by means of two bilateral masking procedures, inspired by radiologists' criteria in interpreting mammograms and based on the use of detected landmarking structures. Relative variations of spatial patterns of intensity values and of orientations of directional components within each site were quantified by combining multidirectional Gabor filters and indices of structural similarity. The localization of the sites of malignant asymmetry was performed by coupling two quadratic discriminant analysis classifiers, one for each masking procedure, that assigned the likelihood of malignancy to each site of correspondence. RESULTS: The performance of the proposed method was assessed on 94 mammographic images from two publicly available databases and containing at least one asymmetric site. Sensitivity, specificity and balanced accuracy levels of 0.83 (0.09), 0.75 (0.06), and 0.79 (0.04), respectively were obtained in the classification of malignant asymmetric sites vs benign/normal sites using cross-validation. In addition, a further blind test on a dataset of Full Field Digital Mammograms achieved levels of sensitivity, specificity, and balanced accuracy of 0.86, 0.65, and 0.75, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The achieved performance indicates that the proposed system is effective in localizing sites of malignant asymmetry and it is expected to improve computer-aided diagnosis of breast cancer.
28253921	ALDH2 polymorphism and alcohol-related cancers in Asians: a public health perspective.	The occurrence of more than 200 diseases, including cancer, can be attributed to alcohol drinking. The global cancer deaths attributed to alcohol-consumption rose from 243,000 in 1990 to 337,400 in 2010. In 2010, cancer deaths due to alcohol consumption accounted for 4.2% of all cancer deaths. Strong epidemiological evidence has established the causal role of alcohol in the development of various cancers, including esophageal cancer, head and neck cancer, liver cancer, breast cancer, and colorectal cancer. The evidence for the association between alcohol and other cancers is inconclusive. Because of the high prevalence of ALDH2*2 allele among East Asian populations, East Asians may be more susceptible to the carcinogenic effect of alcohol, with most evidence coming from studies of esophageal cancer and head and neck cancer, while data for other cancers are more limited. The high prevalence of ALDH2*2 allele in East Asian populations may have important public health implications and may be utilized to reduce the occurrence of alcohol-related cancers among East Asians, including: 1) Identification of individuals at high risk of developing alcohol-related cancers by screening for ALDH2 polymorphism; 2) Incorporation of ALDH2 polymorphism screening into behavioral intervention program for promoting alcohol abstinence or reducing alcohol consumption; 3) Using ALDH2 polymorphism as a prognostic indicator for alcohol-related cancers; 4) Targeting ALDH2 for chemoprevention; and 5) Setting guidelines for alcohol consumption among ALDH2 deficient individuals. Future studies should evaluate whether these strategies are effective for preventing the occurrence of alcohol-related cancers.
28253881	An Lp (0 </= p </= 1)-norm regularized image reconstruction scheme for breast DOT with non-negative-constraint.	BACKGROUND: In diffuse optical tomography (DOT), the image reconstruction is often an ill-posed inverse problem, which is even more severe for breast DOT since there are considerably increasing unknowns to reconstruct with regard to the achievable number of measurements. One common way to address this ill-posedness is to introduce various regularization methods. There has been extensive research regarding constructing and optimizing objective functions. However, although these algorithms dramatically improved reconstruction images, few of them have designed an essentially differentiable objective function whose full gradient is easy to obtain to accelerate the optimization process. METHODS: This paper introduces a new kind of non-negative prior information, designing differentiable objective functions for cases of L1-norm, Lp (0 < p < 1)-norm and L0-norm. Incorporating this non-negative prior information, it is easy to obtain the gradient of these differentiable objective functions, which is useful to guide the optimization process. RESULTS: Performance analyses are conducted using both numerical and phantom experiments. In terms of spatial resolution, quantitativeness, gray resolution and execution time, the proposed methods perform better than the conventional regularization methods without this non-negative prior information. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed methods improves the reconstruction images using the introduced non-negative prior information. Furthermore, the non-negative constraint facilitates the gradient computation, accelerating the minimization of the objective functions.
28253244	Body mass index (BMI): association with clinicopathological factors and outcome of women with newly diagnosed breast cancer in New Zealand.	AIMS: To identify associations of obesity with breast cancer and its outcome in a New Zealand population, including those treated with adjuvant chemotherapy. METHODS: Data was collated from four regional Breast Cancer Registers, Auckland, Waikato, Wellington and Christchurch, for all women with newly diagnosed breast cancer, with weight and height recorded. Associations of body mass index (BMI) with patient and tumour characteristics, and all-cause mortality were determined. RESULTS: BMI was available for 5,458 new breast cancers, 27% of all registered. BMI was normal (18.5-24.9kg/m2) for 32.7%, overweight (25-29.9kg/m2) 31.1%, obese (>30kg/m2) 34.9% and 1.3% underweight (<18.5kg/m2). Median age was 55 years. Higher BMI was associated with non-European ethnicity, post-menopausal status, screen-detection, older age and tumours with higher grade, greater size and positive progesterone receptors. Mean survival for women younger than 56 years was 18.0 years for normal BMI and 14.8 years for BMI >35 (p=0.055, Log-rank). Women younger than 56 years treated with adjuvant chemotherapy had lower survival if obese compared with normal BMI (p=0.055, Log-rank). CONCLUSIONS: High BMI was associated with larger tumours, of higher grade, progesterone receptor positive and post-menopausal status. Obese pre-menopausal women treated with adjuvant chemotherapy had a trend to poorer outcome.
28253243	Individualised follow-up booklets improve recall and satisfaction for cancer patients.	AIMS: The New Zealand Provisional Standards of Service Provision for Cancer recommend providing patients with written information about their diagnosis, treatment and follow up. This project aimed to develop and evaluate a resource that could be used to provide essential information to patients who were nearing completion of the surgical treatment of their cancer. METHODS: The study compared patients with melanoma, colorectal and breast cancers who received standard discussion of their diagnosis, treatment and follow-up plan with cancer patients who received a discussion supported by an individualised follow-up booklet. Patients were interviewed using an over-the-phone questionnaire to assess their free recall and prompted recall of follow-up items, their perception of the level of information received and satisfaction with the communication of their follow-up plan. RESULTS: The group who received a booklet as part of discussion of their follow-up plan scored significantly higher on measures of free recall, prompted recall, satisfaction with the level of information provided and overall satisfaction than those who had a standard clinic discussion but did not receive a booklet. Free recall of two relevant items improved from 61% of patients to 91%. Prompted recall of at least one item improved from 77% of patients to 100%. The proportion of patients feeling they did not receive enough information fell from 25% to 5%. The proportion of patients scoring their satisfaction at >8/10 increased from 68% to 87%. All of these measures reached significance. CONCLUSION: Individualised cancer follow-up booklets are a simple, low-cost and low-risk initiative that used in a New Zealand setting, was associated with improved patient recall and satisfaction with the follow-up information they received. This supports the benefit of providing participants with personalised written information, as recommended in the New Zealand Provisional Standards of Service Provision for Cancer.
28253241	Missing data on body mass index in a breast cancer register: how is it associated with patient characteristics and clinical outcomes?	AIM: To assess the completeness of data on body mass index (BMI) in a regional breast cancer register, and its association with patient characteristics and clinical outcomes. METHODS: This analysis used the data from the Waikato Breast Cancer Register and involved all women who were diagnosed with primary breast cancer in the Waikato District Health Board Region between January 2000 and June 2014. Patients with recorded BMI were compared with those with missing data in terms of demographics, disease factors and treatment factors. Cox regression modelling was performed, and hazards of specific outcomes associated with missing data on BMI were assessed. RESULTS: Of the 3,536 patients included in this analysis, 27.4% had missing data on BMI. Missing data was more frequent in older patients, rural dwellers, patients with comorbidities, screen detected patients, patients with early stage or low grade cancer and hormone receptor positive patients, but was minimal in patients who received chemotherapy. Patients with missing data were less likely to experience loco-regional recurrence (although not significant), metastasis and breast cancer specific mortality, but more likely to experience death from other causes even after demographic, disease and treatment factors were adjusted. CONCLUSIONS: Height or weight or both were not recorded for more than one quarter of the patients. Missing data was differential by specific patient characteristics and clinical outcomes.
28253225	Cancer Screening Test Use - United States, 2015.	Healthy People 2020 (HP2020) includes objectives to increase screening for breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer (1) as recommended by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF).* Progress toward meeting these objectives is monitored by measuring cancer screening test use against national targets using data from the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) (1). Analysis of 2015 NHIS data indicated that screening test use remains substantially below HP2020 targets for selected cancer screening tests. Although colorectal cancer screening test use increased from 2000 to 2015, no improvements in test use were observed for breast and cervical cancer screening. Disparities exist in screening test use by race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and health care access indicators. Increased measures to implement evidence-based interventions and conduct targeted outreach are needed if the HP2020 targets for cancer screening are to be achieved and the disparities in screening test use are to be reduced.
28252435	[GENOMIC VARIABILITY IN PATIENTS WITH DUCTAL FORM OF BREAST CANCER AND THE POSSIBILITY OF CORRECTION THE PEPTIDE BIOREGULATOR AND METAL IONS].	Level of genome stability (structural aberrations, aneuploidy and fragile sites) was studied in cells of the lymphocyte culture of ductal breast cancer patients (DBC). Was studied the correctional influence of separate and combinative action of peptide bioregulator (Ala-Glu-Asp-Gly) and heavy metal - nickel. It is shown that DBC patients are characterized by high level of genome instability, which is the result of the chromatin changing state. The used tests makes it possible to conclude that in the case of this form of cancer subordinates to specific epigenetic variation as a hetero- also euchromatic regions of genome. The agents - peptide bioregulator (Ala-Glu-Asp-Gly) and nickel ions, used in cell culture of ductal breast cancer patients, revealed the protective effect what indicates the prospects to further study for their involving purpose in combined therapy of this form of cancer.
28252426	ADJUVANT (HORMONAL) THERAPY AS A CAUSE OF BONE LOSS IN PATIENTS WITH BREAST CANCER (REVIEW OF LITERATURE).	Adjuvant (hormonal) therapy is the main method of treatment after surgery in hormone (estrogen and/or progesterone) positive breast cancer patients. The goal of above mentioned treatment is to reduce or block the level of estrogen and progesterone. ultiple clinical trials have revealed that hormonal therapy in breast cancer patients affect bone mineral density (BMD). Authors have analyzed data obtained from several clinical trials conducted in several countries (including Georgia). The final conclusion is that selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) have negative effect on BMD in pre-menopausal women and aromatase inhibitors (anastrozole, letrozole, exemestane) are associated with significant bone loss in post-menopausal women. It is recommended to assess BMD during the adjuvant (hormonal) therapy using Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA). Because of significant negative impact of aromatase inhibitors on BMD, it is suggested to involve antiresorbtive treatment in parallel with hormonal therapy.
28252173	Inhibition of miR-660-5p expression suppresses tumor development and metastasis in human breast cancer.	Breast cancer, which derives from the epithelium of the mammary glands, is one of the most common cancers diagnosed in women globally. To date, the authors of many studies have reported that the deregulation of microRNAs (miRNAs) plays a crucial role in the occurrence, development, and metastasis of tumors. Here, we discovered that miR-660-5p was upregulated in the breast cancer cell lines MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 compared with that in the normal control cell line CCD-1095Sk. We then inhibited the expression of miR-660-5p to investigate its biological function in cancer development, progression, and metastasis. We determined the changes in the levels of expression of transcription factor CP2 (TFCP2) and CDKN1A to further clarify the specific mechanism involved. The results showed that downregulation of miR-660-5p significantly suppressed the proliferation, migration, and invasion of MCF7 breast cancer cell. Moreover, inhibition of miR-660-5p promoted cell cycle G1 arrest and reduced apoptosis in breast cancer cells. The specific mechanism studies confirmed that TFCP2 was a direct downstream target of miR-660-5p. Aberrant expression of miR-660-5p repressed TFCP2 expression, whereas inhibition of miR-660-5p decreased TFCP2 protein expression, which is a vital factor in the downstream signaling pathway. In conclusion, miR-660-5p can regulate the proliferation, migration, and invasion of human breast cancer cells, and is a novel potential therapeutic target for the clinical treatment of breast cancer.
28251642	The endometrial and breast safety of menopausal hormone therapy containing micronised progesterone: A short review.	For a significant minority of women, menopausal symptoms can be very unpleasant; however, many are worried about taking menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) for fear of causing breast cancer. Micronised progesterone (mP4) has been available in Europe since the 1990s and clinical trials have shown that 100 mg oral daily, 200 mg oral sequentially or 100 mg vaginal every second day effectively protect the endometrium from the stimulatory effects of oestrogen. MHT containing mP4 has a significantly lower breast cancer risk than those containing progestins. Micronised progesterone does not appear to attenuate the cardiovascular benefits of oestrogen. Pharmaceutical grade, body identical MHT is now available in Australia.
28250894	Alcoholic Extract of Eclipta alba Shows In Vitro Antioxidant and Anticancer Activity without Exhibiting Toxicological Effects.	As per WHO estimates, 80% of people around the world use medicinal plants for the cure and prevention of various diseases including cancer owing to their easy availability and cost effectiveness. Eclipta alba has long been used in Ayurveda to treat liver diseases, eye ailments, and hair related disorders. The promising medicinal value of E. alba prompted us to study the antioxidant, nontoxic, and anticancer potential of its alcoholic extract. In the current study, we evaluated the in vitro cytotoxic and antioxidant effect of the alcoholic extract of Eclipta alba (AEEA) in multiple cancer cell lines along with control. We have also evaluated its effect on different in vivo toxicity parameters. Here, we found that AEEA was found to be most active in most of the cancer cell lines but it significantly induced apoptosis in human breast cancer cell lines by disrupting mitochondrial membrane potential and DNA damage. Moreover, AEEA treatment inhibited migration in both MCF 7 and MDA-MB-231 cells in a dose dependent manner. Further, AEEA possesses robust in vitro antioxidant activity along with high total phenolic and flavonoid contents. In summary, our results indicate that Eclipta alba has enormous potential in complementary and alternative medicine for the treatment of cancer.
28250345	Design and Synthesis of Pyridazine Containing Compounds with Promising Anticancer Activity.	Certain pyridazine containing compounds 2a-f, 3a, b, 4a, b, 5a, b, 6a and b were synthesized and characterized by spectroscopic means and elemental analysis. All the synthesized compounds were screened for their cytotoxic activity in vitro on colon cancer cell line (HCT-116) and breast cancer cell line (MCF-7). In addition, the antitumor activity of the synthesized compounds was tested in vivo against Ehrlich's ascites carcinoma (EAC) solid tumor grown in mice. The in vitro vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) enzyme inhibition assay was carried out for the most active compounds at a single dose of 10 microM. The obtained results revealed that compound 5b, which showed potent cytotoxic activity against HCT-116 also, exhibited the highest inhibition in the VEGFR kinase assay (92.2%).
28249920	Additional Prognostic Value of Lymph Node Ratio (LNR) and Number of Negative Lymph Nodes (NLNs) in Chinese Patients with Triple Negative Breast Cancer.	OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the prognostic value of lymph node ratio (LNR), number of removed lymph nodes (RLNs), and number of negative lymph nodes (NLNs) in Chinese patients with triple negative breast cancer. METHODS: The study cohort comprised 394 breast cancer patients with the triple negative subtype. The log-rank test and Cox proportional hazards analysis was employed to identify prognostic clinicopathological factors. RESULTS: The median follow-up time was 61 months, and the five-year disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) were 63.75% and 64.97%, respectively. Univariate Cox survival analysis revealed that pN stage, LNR, and NLNs were significant prognostic factors for DFS and OS (all, p<0.05). Multivariate analysis including pN stage and LNR showed that LNR was an independent prognostic factor for DFS (p=0.047) and OS (p=0.0497). When combining pN stage, LNR, and NLNs together, only NLNs was an independent prognostic factor for DFS and OS (p=0.014). LNR is prognostically superior to pN stage in patients with triple negative breast cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Our study revealed that LNR and NLNs can provide additional prognostic value for DFS and OS. Moreover, LNR had a better prognostic value compared with pN stage.
28249200	Honokiol nanomicellar formulation produced increased oral bioavailability and anticancer effects in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC).	Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), owing to its aggressive behavior and toxicity associated with available chemotherapy; currently no suitable therapy is available. Honokiol (HNK) is a promising anticancer drug but has poor bioavailability. In the current study, we evaluated the anticancer effects of an oral Honokiol nanomicellar (NM) formulation (size range of 20-40nm) in vitro against various TNBC cells lines. Cytotoxicity, clonogenic and wound healing assays demonstrated the promising anticancer effects. In vitro Caco-2 permeability studies suggested increased absorption of Honokiol. Compared to HNK-FD, nanomicellar formulations resulted in significant increase in the oral bioavailability. Cmax (4.06 and 3.60-fold) and AUC (6.26 and 5.83-fold) were significantly increased in comparison to oral 40 and 80mg/kg free drug respectively. Further, anticancer effects of these formulations were studied in BALB/c nude mice transplanted with orthotopic MDA-MB-231 cell induced xenografts. After 4 weeks of daily administration of HNK-NM formulation, significant reduction in the tumor volumes and weights compared to free drug (p<0.001) treated groups was observed. Surprisingly, in some of the animals (25%), the treatment resulted in complete eradication of tumors. Increased apoptosis and antiangiogenic effect was observed in HNK-NM groups compared to free drug and untreated control animals. This is the first report demonstrating that HNK-FD possesses anticancer effects against TNBC.
28248879	A three-long noncoding RNA signature as a diagnostic biomarker for differentiating between triple-negative and non-triple-negative breast cancers.	BACKGROUND: Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive cancer with unfavorable outcome and it is useful to explore noninvasive biomarkers for its early diagnosis. Here, we identified differentially expressed long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in blood samples of patients with TNBC to assess their diagnostic value. METHODS: Differential expression of lncRNAs in plasma of patients with TNBC (n = 25) and non-TNBC (NTNBC; n = 35) and in healthy controls was compared by microarray analysis and validated by real-time PCR. lncRNA expression between plasma and BC tissues was compared using Pearson correlation test. Logit model was used to obtain a new lncRNA-based score. Receiver operating characteristic analysis was performed to assess the diagnostic value of the selected lncRNAs. RESULTS: Microarray data showed that 41 lncRNAs were aberrantly expressed. Among these, antisense noncoding RNA in the INK4 locus (ANRIL), hypoxia inducible factor 1alpha antisense RNA-2 (HIF1A-AS2), and urothelial carcinoma-associated 1 (UCA1) were markedly upregulated in plasma of patients with TNBC compared with patients with NTNBC (P < 0.01). HIF1A-AS2 expression was positively associated with its tissue levels (r = 0.670, P < 0.01). AUC (95% CI) of ANRIL, HIF1A-AS2, and UCA1 was 0.785 (0.660-0.881), 0.739 (0.610-0.844), and 0.817 (0.696-0.905), respectively. TNBCSigLnc-3, a new score obtained using the logit model, showed excellent diagnostic performance, with AUC of 0.934 (0.839-0.982), sensitivity of 76.0%, and specificity of 97.1%. CONCLUSION: ANRIL, HIF1A-AS2, and UCA1 expression was significantly increased in plasma of patients with TNBC, suggesting their use as TNBC-specific diagnostic biomarkers.
28246543	An Enhanced Grey Wolf Optimization Based Feature Selection Wrapped Kernel Extreme Learning Machine for Medical Diagnosis.	In this study, a new predictive framework is proposed by integrating an improved grey wolf optimization (IGWO) and kernel extreme learning machine (KELM), termed as IGWO-KELM, for medical diagnosis. The proposed IGWO feature selection approach is used for the purpose of finding the optimal feature subset for medical data. In the proposed approach, genetic algorithm (GA) was firstly adopted to generate the diversified initial positions, and then grey wolf optimization (GWO) was used to update the current positions of population in the discrete searching space, thus getting the optimal feature subset for the better classification purpose based on KELM. The proposed approach is compared against the original GA and GWO on the two common disease diagnosis problems in terms of a set of performance metrics, including classification accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, G-mean, F-measure, and the size of selected features. The simulation results have proven the superiority of the proposed method over the other two competitive counterparts.
28246088	Adiposity and cancer at major anatomical sites: umbrella review of the literature.	Objective To evaluate the strength and validity of the evidence for the association between adiposity and risk of developing or dying from cancer.Design Umbrella review of systematic reviews and meta-analyses.Data sources PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and manual screening of retrieved references.Eligibility criteria Systematic reviews or meta-analyses of observational studies that evaluated the association between indices of adiposity and risk of developing or dying from cancer.Data synthesis Primary analysis focused on cohort studies exploring associations for continuous measures of adiposity. The evidence was graded into strong, highly suggestive, suggestive, or weak after applying criteria that included the statistical significance of the random effects summary estimate and of the largest study in a meta-analysis, the number of cancer cases, heterogeneity between studies, 95% prediction intervals, small study effects, excess significance bias, and sensitivity analysis with credibility ceilings.Results 204 meta-analyses investigated associations between seven indices of adiposity and developing or dying from 36 primary cancers and their subtypes. Of the 95 meta-analyses that included cohort studies and used a continuous scale to measure adiposity, only 12 (13%) associations for nine cancers were supported by strong evidence. An increase in body mass index was associated with a higher risk of developing oesophageal adenocarcinoma; colon and rectal cancer in men; biliary tract system and pancreatic cancer; endometrial cancer in premenopausal women; kidney cancer; and multiple myeloma. Weight gain and waist to hip circumference ratio were associated with higher risks of postmenopausal breast cancer in women who have never used hormone replacement therapy and endometrial cancer, respectively. The increase in the risk of developing cancer for every 5 kg/m2 increase in body mass index ranged from 9% (relative risk 1.09, 95% confidence interval 1.06 to 1.13) for rectal cancer among men to 56% (1.56, 1.34 to 1.81) for biliary tract system cancer. The risk of postmenopausal breast cancer among women who have never used HRT increased by 11% for each 5 kg of weight gain in adulthood (1.11, 1.09 to 1.13), and the risk of endometrial cancer increased by 21% for each 0.1 increase in waist to hip ratio (1.21, 1.13 to 1.29). Five additional associations were supported by strong evidence when categorical measures of adiposity were included: weight gain with colorectal cancer; body mass index with gallbladder, gastric cardia, and ovarian cancer; and multiple myeloma mortality.Conclusions Although the association of adiposity with cancer risk has been extensively studied, associations for only 11 cancers (oesophageal adenocarcinoma, multiple myeloma, and cancers of the gastric cardia, colon, rectum, biliary tract system, pancreas, breast, endometrium, ovary, and kidney) were supported by strong evidence. Other associations could be genuine, but substantial uncertainty remains. Obesity is becoming one of the biggest problems in public health; evidence on the strength of the associated risks may allow finer selection of those at higher risk of cancer, who could be targeted for personalised prevention strategies.
28246041	Design, synthesis, biological evaluation, molecular docking and QSAR studies of 2,4-dimethylacridones as anticancer agents.	Drug resistance in cancer is an unmet medical challenge and a major drawback for the failure of many chemotherapeutic drugs. Search for targeted, effective drug with minimum toxicity is an urgent need. Acridone which is an alkaloid derivative has been attributed as molecule in reversing drug resistance in cancer cells for a long time now. In the present investigation, an attempt has been made to explore the chemosensitizing ability of 2,4-dimethylacridones with alkyl side chain containing terminally substituted tertiary amino groups. Considering the structural features required for the MDR reversal activity, acridone derivatives have been synthesized with propyl and butyl side chain containing morpholinyl, piperidinyl, N-methylpiperazinyl, N,N-diethylamino, N-diethanolamino, N-[(beta-hydroxylethyl)]piperazino at the terminus of the alkyl side chain. cLogP values for the synthesized compounds ranged from 2.96 to 4.72 for the propyl derivatives and 3.41 to 5.15 for the butyl derivatives. All the compounds were screened against breast cancer sensitive MCF7 and resistant MCF7/ADR cell lines. Compounds 12e and 12f have shown better cytotoxicity profiles with IC50 of 4 +/- 0.05 and 2 +/- 0.03 muM against MCF7 cells, 5.21 +/- 0.13 and 2.56 +/- 0.05 muM against MCF7/ADR cells. Photolabelling studies with [3H]-azidopine and molecular docking studies have identified that 2,4-dimethylacridones have potential to modulate the P-gp mediated multidrug resistance. Docking studies identified that compounds have shown favorable interactions with P-gp. QSAR equation was derived for cytotoxicity vs molecular descriptors of acridone derivatives. Best models with good predictive ability have been generated with very high square correlation coefficient (R2) values of 0.889, 0.964 and 0.983.
28245323	Temporal Trends in Treatment and Subsequent Neoplasm Risk Among 5-Year Survivors of Childhood Cancer, 1970-2015.	Importance: Cancer treatments are associated with subsequent neoplasms in survivors of childhood cancer. It is unknown whether temporal changes in therapy are associated with changes in subsequent neoplasm risk. Objective: To quantify the association between temporal changes in treatment dosing and subsequent neoplasm risk. Design, Setting, and Participants: Retrospective, multicenter cohort study of 5-year cancer survivors diagnosed before age 21 years from pediatric tertiary hospitals in the United States and Canada between 1970-1999, with follow-up through December 2015. Exposures: Radiation and chemotherapy dose changes over time. Main Outcomes and Measures: Subsequent neoplasm 15-year cumulative incidence, cumulative burden, and standardized incidence ratios for subsequent malignancies, compared by treatment decade. Multivariable models assessed relative rates (RRs) of subsequent neoplasms by 5-year increments, adjusting for demographic and clinical characteristics. Mediation analyses assessed whether changes in rates of subsequent neoplasms over time were mediated by treatment variable modifications. Results: Among 23603 survivors of childhood cancer (mean age at diagnosis, 7.7 years; 46% female) the most common initial diagnoses were acute lymphoblastic leukemia, Hodgkin lymphoma, and astrocytoma. During a mean follow-up of 20.5 years (374638 person-years at risk), 1639 survivors experienced 3115 subsequent neoplasms, including 1026 malignancies, 233 benign meningiomas, and 1856 nonmelanoma skin cancers. The most common subsequent malignancies were breast and thyroid cancers. Proportions of individuals receiving radiation decreased (77% for 1970s vs 33% for 1990s), as did median dose (30 Gy [interquartile range, 24-44] for 1970s vs 26 Gy [interquartile range, 18-45] for 1990s). Fifteen-year cumulative incidence of subsequent malignancies decreased by decade of diagnosis (2.1% [95% CI, 1.7%-2.4%] for 1970s, 1.7% [95% CI, 1.5%-2.0%] for 1980s, 1.3% [95% CI, 1.1%-1.5%] for 1990s). Reference absolute rates per 1000 person-years were 1.12 (95% CI, 0.84-1.57) for subsequent malignancies, 0.16 (95% CI, 0.06-0.41) for meningiomas, and 1.71 (95% CI, 0.88-3.33) for nonmelanoma skin cancers for survivors with reference characteristics (no chemotherapy, splenectomy, or radiation therapy; male; attained age 28 years). Standardized incidence ratios declined for subsequent malignancies over treatment decades, with advancing attained age. Relative rates declined with each 5-year increment for subsequent malignancies (RR, 0.87 [95% CI, 0.82-0.93]; P < .001), meningiomas (RR, 0.85 [95% CI, 0.75-0.97]; P = .03), and nonmelanoma skin cancers (RR, 0.75 [95% CI, 0.67-0.84]; P < .001). Radiation dose changes were associated with reduced risk for subsequent malignancies, meningiomas, and nonmelanoma skin cancers. Conclusions and Relevance: Among survivors of childhood cancer, the risk of subsequent malignancies at 15 years after initial cancer diagnosis remained increased for those diagnosed in the 1990s, although the risk was lower compared with those diagnosed in the 1970s. This lower risk was associated with reduction in therapeutic radiation dose.
28245116	Discovery of an Orally Selective Inhibitor of Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 Using Advanced Multiple Ligand Simultaneous Docking.	Targeting signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) is a potential anticancer strategy. However, STAT3 inhibitors with good selectivity and bioavailability are rare. The aim of this study was to discover selective direct STAT3 inhibitors with good druglikeness. By the advanced multiple ligand simultaneous docking (AMLSD) method, compound 9 was designed as an orally bioavailable STAT3 inhibitor that presented superior druggability and selectivity compared with other representative STAT3 inhibitors. 9 directly and selectively inhibited the pY705 site of STAT3 with an affinity (Ki) of 440 nM. The IC50 of 9 for MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells was 184-fold lower than its IC50 for MCF-10A normal breast epithelial cells. 9 in vivo induced significant antitumor responses (better than gefitinib), and its therapeutic index should be over 100, indicating good safety of 9.
28244487	Everolimus in heavily pretreated metastatic breast cancer: Is real world experience different?	BACKGROUND: Drugs targeting mammalian target of rapamycin signaling pathway have been recently approved for treatment of hormone receptor (HR) positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC). However, there is lack of real world data from India on the use of this therapeutic strategy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis of MBC patients who had recurrence or progression while receiving aromatase inhibitors (AI's) and further treated with everolimus and either tamoxifen/AI/fulvestrant between March 2012 and June 2014, was undertaken. RESULTS: There were 41 patients with median age 55 years, 73% with visceral metastasis, and 73% with >/=2 sites of metastases. Thirty (73%) patients had received 3 prior lines of therapy including AI (100%), tamoxifen (94%), fulvestrant (39%), and chemotherapy (100%) while the remaining had received <3 lines of prior therapy. The commonest Grade 3/4 adverse events were stomatitis (19%), hyperglycemia (new/worsening, 17%), fatigue (14.5%), nonneutropenic infections (14%), anemia (12%) and pneumonitis (7%). Everolimus dose reductions were required in 31% patients. There were 30% partial responses, 38% prolonged disease stabilizations and 32% disease progression as best responses to everolimus. The median progression-free survival was 22 weeks (5 months). CONCLUSIONS: Everolimus based treatment has meaningful activity in heavily pretreated patients with HR-positive MBC but is associated with considerable toxicity and requirement for dose adjustment.
28244486	Eribulin in heavily pretreated metastatic breast cancer: A tertiary care center experience from India.	INTRODUCTION: Heavily pretreated metastatic breast cancer (MBC) remains a major therapeutic challenge with limited treatment options this. Eribulin, an anti-microtubule agent, has been recently approved for this indication. There are sparse data from the Asian region for eribulin and merits exploration. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a single institution retrospective analysis of MBC patients treated with eribulin from 2013 to 2014. These patients had received at least 2 lines of prior therapy for metastatic disease. Patients received standard doses of eribulin and were monitored for toxicity and responses. RESULTS: Eighteen patients were included in this analysis. They had received a median of 6 lines of therapy previously (including adjuvant treatment) and had significant visceral involvement (median 3 organs). A median of 4 cycles of eribulin was delivered. There were no complete responses; partial responses were seen in 33% (6/18), stable disease status in 28% (5/18) patients, and progressive disease on eribulin in 39% (7/18) patients. The median progression-free survival was 15 weeks (3.5 months), and median overall survival was 27 weeks (6.2 months). Significant Grade 3/4 toxicities seen included peripheral neuropathy in 28% (5/18) and neutropenia in 28% (5/18) of patients while dose reductions were required in 22% (4/18) of patients. CONCLUSION: Eribulin offers a viable, well-tolerated regimen that provides meaningful clinical benefit in Indian patients with MBC.
28244460	Alteration in steroid hormone and Her-2/neu receptor status following neoadjuvant chemotherapy in locally advanced breast cancer: Experience at a tertiary care centre in India.	CONTEXT: Use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) in locally advanced breast cancer (LABC) enables tumor reduction and conservative surgery. It is proposed in some studies that there may be an alteration in the hormonal receptor (HR) status and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (Her-2)/neu immune-expression following NACT. AIMS: To study the status of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and Her-2/neu receptor before and after NACT in LABC. MATERIALS AND METHODS: HR and Her-2/neu status were evaluated by immunohistochemistry on 100 core needle biopsy of primary tumors and surgical specimens after receiving NACT (NACT group); fifty patients without NACT served as non-NACT group, and discordance was compared between the two groups. RESULTS: In the NACT group, discordance of 17%, 13%, and 11% was noted in ER, PR, and Her-2/neu status, while in non-NACT group, discordance seen in ER, PR, and Her-2/neu was 8%, 8%, and 4%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: There was a significant alteration in ER and Her-2/neu status from the core biopsy to the treated resected tumor in the study group. As these changes may impact treatment, HR and Her-2/neu expression reanalysis in final surgical specimens is recommended.
28244458	The pattern of invasive lobular carcinoma in the patients diagnosed with breast cancer from Balochistan.	INTRODUCTION: Invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) is the second most common type of breast cancer accounting for 5%-15% of all the breast cancer cases. The present study was performed on 171 breast cancer patients from Balochistan registered in CENAR (Center for Nuclear Medicine and Radiotherapy), Quetta. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Written consent was obtained from the patients. The history of the disease was taken from the patients, and the patients' enrollment files were retrieved. RESULTS: Of the 171 patients, 5 (2.96%) were diagnosed with ILC with tumor Grade II, and stage of the cancer reported was Grade III in all the 5 patients affected with ILC. CONCLUSION: ILC is the second most common type of breast cancer diagnosed with comparatively lower grade but almost reported infiltrating.
28244457	Incidence and pattern of bone metastases at presentation in Indian carcinoma breast patients.	BACKGROUND: Breast cancer (BC) is the most common female cancer and frequently metastases to the bones. Breast cancer among Indian women occurs a decade earlier and more aggressive than the western population. Screening guidelines are based on western studies. The aim of our study is to assess the role of Technitium99m bone scan (TBS) in screening Indian EBC patients at presentation. We also looked at the pattern of BM in all stages of BC. METHODS: Patients with BC who had TBS at presentation from January 2012 to September 2015 were included in the study. RESULTS: Bone metastases were seen in 23.42% (241/1029). Of these, 10.06% (31/308) EBC, 25.60% (169/660) locally advanced BC (LABC) and 63.93% (39/61) of metastatic BC (MBC) patients had BM. Most common sites of BM were spine and pelvis. In long bone and sternum, proximal part was commonly involved. CONCLUSION: The incidence of BM in Indian BC patients at presentation is higher than western population. The incidence of BM per stage is similar to west. So TBS should be done in LABC and symptomatic EBC. There is high incidence of BM to spine and pelvis. In pelvis, SI joints and ilium and in long bones and sternum, proximal parts were commonly involved.
28244455	Epidemiological and survival analysis of triple-negative breast cancer cases in a retrospective multicenter study.	INTRODUCTION: This is a retrospective study with data collected from breast cancer cases from five major Apollo Hospitals across India, as part of a biobanking process. One aspect of our study focused specifically on data from triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cases. The aim of this study was to analyze epidemiology, treatment options, and survival of the patients with TNBC. Our goal was to draw conclusions on the preponderance of the disease and also to understand the outcomes using the existing therapy options. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data were collected after due ethical clearances and were coded with regard to patient identifiers to protect patient privacy. Data were not only from the various departments of the respective hospitals and the treating physicians but also from the follow-up made by hospital staff and social workers. RESULTS: About 20% of all cases of breast cancer comprised TNBC. Although the disease is generally thought to be an early onset disease, there was no major difference in the median age of diagnosis of TNBC compared to other breast cancer cases. More than 85% of the TNBC cases were of early stage disease with <4% of the cases of metastatic cancer. Data on follow-up were somewhat sporadic as a good number of cases were lost to follow-up, but from the available data, recurrence rate was about 11%. Death, when it occurred, was mostly in the early periods of treatment with 35% of the events occurring before 3 years. The overall survival rates beyond 3 years were more than 86%. CONCLUSIONS: Data and sample collection are an ongoing process, so we expect this data set to be enriched with more cases and longer duration of follow-up in a year. Preliminary analysis sheds light on the potential of such a collection both for understanding the epidemiology of the disease and also for conducting future studies with an eye toward improving treatment outcomes.
28243091	Targeted delivery of paclitaxel and doxorubicin to cancer xenografts via the nanoparticle of nano-diamino-tetrac.	The tetraiodothyroacetic acid (tetrac) component of nano-diamino-tetrac (NDAT) is chemically bonded via a linker to a poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) nanoparticle that can encapsulate anticancer drugs. Tetrac targets the plasma membrane of cancer cells at a receptor on the extracellular domain of integrin alphavbeta3. In this study, we evaluate the efficiency of NDAT delivery of paclitaxel and doxorubicin to, respectively, pancreatic and breast cancer orthotopic nude mouse xenografts. Intra-tumoral drug concentrations were 5-fold (paclitaxel; P<0.001) and 2.3-fold (doxorubicin; P<0.01) higher than with conventional systemic drug administration. Tumor volume reductions reflected enhanced xenograft drug uptake. Cell viability was estimated by bioluminescent signaling in pancreatic tumors and confirmed an increased paclitaxel effect with drug delivery by NDAT. NDAT delivery of chemotherapy increases drug delivery to cancers and increases drug efficacy.
28243082	Rational design of multifunctional micelles against doxorubicin-sensitive and doxorubicin-resistant MCF-7 human breast cancer cells.	Even though a tremendous number of multifunctional nanocarriers have been developed to tackle heterogeneous cancer cells, little attention has been paid to elucidate how to rationally design a multifunctional nanocarrier. In this study, three individual functions (active targeting, stimuli-triggered release and endo-lysosomal escape) were evaluated in doxorubicin (DOX)-sensitive MCF-7 cells and DOX-resistant MCF-7/ADR cells by constructing four kinds of micelles with active-targeting (AT-M), passive targeting, pH-triggered release (pHT-M) and endo-lysosomal escape (endoE-M) function, respectively. AT-M demonstrated the strongest cytotoxicity against MCF-7 cells and the highest cellular uptake of DOX due to the folate-mediated endocytosis. However, AT-M failed to exhibit the best efficacy against MCF-7/ADR cells, while endoE-M exhibited the strongest cytotoxicity against MCF-7/ADR cells and the highest cellular uptake of DOX due to the lowest elimination of DOX from the cells. This was attributed to the carrier-facilitated endo-lysosomal escape of DOX, which avoided exocytosis by lysosome secretion, resulting in an effective accumulation of DOX in the cytoplasm. The enhanced elimination of DOX from the MCF-7/ADR cells also accounted for the remarkable decrease in cytotoxicity against the cells of AT-M. Three micelles were further evaluated with MCF-7 cells and MCF-7/ADR-resistant cells xenografted mice model. In accordance with the in vitro results, AT-M and endoE-M demonstrated the strongest inhibition on the MCF-7 and MCF-7/ADR xenografted tumor, respectively. Active targeting and active targeting in combination with endo-lysosomal escape have been demonstrated to be the primary function for a nanocarrier against doxorubicin-sensitive and doxorubicin-resistant MCF-7 cells, respectively. These results indicate that the rational design of multifunctional nanocarriers for cancer therapy needs to consider the heterogeneous cancer cells and the primary function needs to be integrated to achieve effective payload delivery.
28242865	Metronomic Capecitabine Effectively Blocks Leptomeningeal Carcinomatosis From Breast Cancer: A Case Report and Literature Review.	BACKGROUND Meningeal carcinomatosis is a rare complication in breast cancer patients. At present, there are no defined guidelines for its management. The efficacy of systemic treatment seems to depend on its ability to cross the blood-brain-barrier and its interaction with tumor vasculature. Metronomic chemotherapy is a known modality of drug administration able to inhibit tumor angiogenesis. CASE REPORT We present a case of symptomatic leptomeningeal carcinomatosis from breast cancer successfully treated with capecitabine. Based on the hypothesis that angiogenesis contributes to neoplastic meningitis, the patient was treated with a metronomic schedule that provided long-term clinical benefit with a very low toxicity profile. CONCLUSIONS To assess the real impact of metronomic chemotherapy in patients with meninges involvement, a phase II study will be starting soon in our institution. A review of the literature concerning the management of meningeal carcinomatosis is also presented.
28241424	Exome Sequencing in a Family with Luminal-Type Breast Cancer Underpinned by Variation in the Methylation Pathway.	Panel-based next generation sequencing (NGS) is currently preferred over whole exome sequencing (WES) for diagnosis of familial breast cancer, due to interpretation challenges caused by variants of uncertain clinical significance (VUS). There is also no consensus on the selection criteria for WES. In this study, a pathology-supported genetic testing (PSGT) approach was used to select two BRCA1/2 mutation-negative breast cancer patients from the same family for WES. Homozygosity for the MTHFR 677 C>T mutation detected during this PSGT pre-screen step was considered insufficient to cause bilateral breast cancer in the index case and her daughter diagnosed with early-onset breast cancer (<30 years). Extended genetic testing using WES identified the RAD50 R385C missense mutation in both cases. This rare variant with a minor allele frequency (MAF) of <0.001 was classified as a VUS after exclusion in an affected cousin and extended genotyping in 164 unrelated breast cancer patients and 160 controls. Detection of functional polymorphisms (MAF > 5%) in the folate pathway in all three affected family members is consistent with inheritance of the luminal-type breast cancer in the family. PSGT assisted with the decision to pursue extended genetic testing and facilitated clinical interpretation of WES aimed at reduction of recurrence risk.
28240966	Efficacy of Internet-Based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy in Improving Sexual Functioning of Breast Cancer Survivors: Results of a Randomized Controlled Trial.	Purpose We evaluated the effect of Internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) on sexual functioning and relationship intimacy (primary outcomes) and body image, menopausal symptoms, marital functioning, psychological distress, and health-related quality of life (secondary outcomes) in breast cancer survivors (BCSs) with a DSM-IV diagnosis of a sexual dysfunction. Patients and Methods We randomly assigned 169 BCSs to either Internet-based CBT or a waiting-list control group. The CBT consisted of weekly therapist-guided sessions, with a maximum duration of 24 weeks. Self-report questionnaires were completed by the intervention group at baseline (T0), midtherapy (T1), and post-therapy (T2) and at equivalent times by the control group. We used a mixed-effect modeling approach to compare the groups over time. Results Compared with the control group, the intervention group showed a significant improvement over time in overall sexual functioning (effect size for T2 [EST2] = .43; P = .031), which was reflected in an increase in sexual desire (EST1 = .48 and EST2 = .72; P < .001), sexual arousal (EST2 = .50; P = .008), and vaginal lubrication (EST2 = .46; P = .013). The intervention group reported more improvement over time in sexual pleasure (EST1 = .32 and EST2 = .62; P = .001), less discomfort during sex (EST1 = .49 and EST2 = .66; P = .001), and less sexual distress (EST2 = .59; P = .002) compared with the control group. The intervention group reported greater improvement in body image (EST2 = .45; P = .009) and fewer menopausal symptoms (EST1 = .39; P = .007) than the control group. No significant effects were observed for orgasmic function, sexual satisfaction, intercourse frequency, relationship intimacy, marital functioning, psychological distress, or health-related quality of life. Conclusion Internet-based CBT has salutary effects on sexual functioning, body image, and menopausal symptoms in BCSs with a sexual dysfunction.
28238520	Precision surgery and avoiding over-treatment.	Over-diagnosis and over-treatment are consequences of greater awareness about breast cancer, more intensive screening, and the resultant identification of more cases of breast cancer that are low or ultralow risk. This area represents an important opportunity to optimize the delivery of appropriate targeted therapy for breast cancer patients. Despite the evolution of breast cancer care over the last few decades and our ability to tailor treatment to biology, a one-size fits all approach is still prevalent in the local and regional management of and screening for breast cancer, failing to reflect the unique biology and tumor characteristics of each patient. In this review, we explore how we can use new tools to better define tumor biology and also how we can change current clinical practices based on already available data. Every surgeon should be knowledgeable about how to craft personalized breast cancer care in the areas of systemic therapy, adjuvant radiation therapy, management of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), precision surgery, and breast cancer screening.
28238418	FOXA1 is expressed in ovarian mucinous neoplasms.	FOXA1 is a transcription factor essential for the binding and action of other transcription factors on the chromatin. It is the major regulator of endoderm differentiation. It has important roles in breast, prostate and endometrial cancer. It has never been studied in ovarian tumours. The aim of this study was to investigate its expression in ovarian epithelial neoplasms. A total of 195 primary ovarian epithelial borderline or malignant tumours were immunohistochemically studied for the expression of FOXA1. Nineteen percent of the tumours strongly and diffusely expressed FOXA1. Of these, 75.7% belong to the mucinous category (p < 0.0001). Seventy-five per cent of mucinous borderline tumours and 46.7% of mucinous carcinomas overexpressed FOXA1. Brenner tumours also expressed FOXA1. FOXA1 was rarely expressed in serous (6/115) and endometrioid tumours (1/11). Clear cell tumours were completely negative (0/16). Of normal structures, ciliated tubal cells, Walthard nests and transitional metaplasias of the tubal-mesothelial junction, all strongly expressed FOXA1. In conclusion, FOXA1 is found in ovarian mucinous and Brenner tumours.
28238415	The outcome of papillary lesions of the breast diagnosed by standard core needle biopsy within a BreastScreen Australia service.	Papillary lesions of the breast are most commonly diagnosed via mammographic screening. The standard practice has been to excise these lesions, since a subset of papillary lesions are neoplastic. However, this approach leads to a high proportion of negative excisions. In order to identify papillary lesions which could be managed by surveillance alone, we assessed the outcome of 103 papillary lesions diagnosed on core needle biopsy in a public screening program. Subsequent excision biopsy led to an upgrade to malignancy in 30% of cases. Segregation via presence or absence of atypia stratified the outcome into 72% upgrade, compared with 7% upgrade, respectively. Further, in the latter group (i.e., no atypia on core needle biopsy with 7% upgrade to malignancy), the neoplasia found in the targeted excision area was low to intermediate grade ductal carcinoma in situ only, with no invasive neoplasia (4 cases). Of the lesions identified due to microcalcification, the microcalcification was present within an adjacent benign lesion in 35% of cases and hence the papillary lesion was detected incidentally. Overall therefore, we have identified a cohort of papillary lesions in which conservative management, rather than excision, could be considered, i.e., those without atypia, including those without atypia in which the papillary lesion was found incidental to microcalcification in an adjacent benign lesion.
28237944	Could kinesiology taping help mitigate pain, breathlessness and abdominal-related symptoms in cancer?	We present the case of a woman who was an amateur athlete diagnosed with primary breast cancer, and 10 years later with terminal metastatic cancer. This case report was prepared posthumously in co-operation with her next of kin (husband). The patient first presented to a sports physiotherapist (AR) for her pain-management and to help maintain physical fitness so that she could continue with sports and an active lifestyle. The patient continued with physiotherapy for several months to enable her to be active. However, when her health deteriorated significantly due to advancing cancer, the treatment was modified and aimed at improving the patient's general well-being. The physiotherapist applied kinesiology tape over the patient's lower rib cage, diaphragm and abdomen in an attempt to manage pain, breathlessness and abdominal bloating. The patient reported alleviation of pain, breathlessness, abdominal discomfort and nausea, accompanied by improvements in eating, drinking, energy levels and physical function.
28237842	Can an educational application increase risk perception accuracy amongst patients attending a high-risk breast cancer clinic?	OBJECTIVES: To design, develop and test the effect of an educational initiative to improve risk perception amongst patients attending a high-risk breast cancer clinic. This was achieved through three objectives - 1. identifying an optimal method of presenting risk data, 2. designing and building a risk application, and 3. testing the ability of the application to successfully modify patients perceived risk of cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A mobile application was developed for this project using best practice methods for displaying risk information. Patients (n = 84) were randomly allocated into two groups - 'Control' or 'Treatment'. Both groups underwent standard risk counseling while the application was employed in the 'Treatment' group. The patients were surveyed before their session, immediately after and six weeks later. RESULTS: Increases in accuracy were seen in both groups with larger increases demonstrated in the 'Treatment' group with 'Personal 10 Year Risk' statistically significant ('Control' group increase from 21% to 48% vs the 'Treatment' group increase from 33% to 71% - p = 0.003). CONCLUSION: This project demonstrated trends towards improved risk perception, however mixed logistic regression was unable to show a 30% difference between groups. Numerical literacy and understanding of risk were identified as issues amongst the general population. Overestimating risk remains high amongst attendees. Using mobile applications to convey risk information to patients is a new and evolving area with a corresponding paucity of data. We have demonstrated its potential and emphasised the importance of designing how this information is communicated to patients in order to make it understandable and meaningful.
28237610	Visceral and bone metastases of a WHO grade 2 meningioma: A case report and review of the literature.	Meningiomas represent the most common tumours of the central nervous system in adults. Risk factors include ionizing radiation, female hormones exposure, head trauma, cell phone use, breast cancer and family history of meningioma. Despite complete surgical resection, natural history of meningiomas often includes local recurrence but very few metastatic meningiomas have been reported. Here, we report the case of a metastatic meningioma. A 43-year-old woman was firstly treated for a symptomatic parietal meningioma WHO grade II by surgical resection followed by an irradiation of the surgical bed. After surgical resection and irradiation, the patient recovered incompletely. Two months after the end of the radiation treatment, the patient presented at the emergency unit for sciatic pain revealing bone metastases that has been histologically confirmed. Moreover, imaging led to the diagnosis of liver and lungs metastasis. Despite lack of guidelines for metastatic meningioma, few treatments have been used and published for recurrent and multiple meningioma management. In case studies, some partial responses have been seen with mifepristone and improved progression-free survival rates have been obtained with hydroxyurea and sunitinib. Metastasis in meningioma is very uncommon and no specific management has been described. Hydroxyurea, sunitinib and mifepristone could be options if no clinical trial data is available.
28236777	Multidetector CT improving surgical outcomes in breast cancer (MISO-BC): A randomised controlled trial.	BACKGROUND: Early diagnosis of malignant axillary nodes in breast cancer guides the extent of axillary surgery: patients with known axillary malignancy receive a more extensive single operation at the same time as surgery to their breast. A multicentre randomised controlled trial assessed whether a Computed Tomography (CT) scan of the axilla could more accurately diagnose malignant axillary lymph node involvement in patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer when compared to usual care. METHODS: Patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer (identified via screening and symptomatic pathways) at two NHS Trusts in the North East of England were recruited and randomised in equal numbers. Both groups received routine diagnostic and surgical care. In addition, one group received a CT scan of their axilla on the same side as the breast cancer. The primary endpoint was the need to undergo a second axillary surgical procedure. FINDINGS: The trial recruited 297 patients of whom 291 contributed to findings. The proportion of patients undergoing a second operation was similar (CT vs UC: 19.4% vs. 19.7%; CT-UC: -0.3%, 95%CI: = -9.5% to 8.9%, chi2 [1]: p = 1.00). Patients in the two groups were similar before treatment, had similar types and grade of cancer, experienced similar patterns of post-operative complications and reported similar experiences of care. INTERPRETATION: CT scan-guided care did not result in a change in the number of patients requiring a second operation; similar numbers of patients needed further axillary surgery in both groups. New diagnostic imaging technologies regularly enter NHS centres. It is important these are evaluated rigorously before becoming routine care.
28236776	Evolving landscape of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive breast cancer treatment and the future of biosimilars.	Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive (HER2+) breast cancer comprises approximately 15%-20% of all breast cancers and is associated with a poor prognosis. The introduction of anti-HER2 therapy has significantly improved clinical outcomes for patients with HER2+ breast cancer, and multiple HER2-directed agents (ie, trastuzumab, pertuzumab, lapatinib, and ado-trastuzumab emtansine [T-DM1]) are approved for clinical use in various settings. The treatment landscape for patients with HER2+ breast cancer is continuing to evolve. While novel agents and therapeutic strategies are emerging, biologic therapies, particularly trastuzumab, are likely to remain a mainstay of treatment. However, access issues create barriers to the use of biologics, and there is evidence for underuse of trastuzumab worldwide. A biosimilar is a biologic product that is highly similar to a licensed biologic in terms of product safety and effectiveness. Biosimilars of trastuzumab are in development and may soon become available. The introduction of biosimilars may improve access to anti-HER2 therapies by providing additional treatment options and lower-cost alternatives. Because HER2-targeted drugs may be administered for extended periods of time and in combination with other systemic therapies, biosimilars have the potential to result in significant savings for healthcare systems. Herein we review current and emerging treatment options for, and discuss the possible role of biosimilars in, treating patients with HER2+ breast cancer.
28235427	Efficient T3P(R) mediated synthesis, differential cytotoxicity and apoptosis induction by indolo-triazolo-thiadiazoles in human breast adenocarcinoma cells.	The limited efficacy of marketed anticancer agents demands the design of novel target-specific hybrid molecules incorporating multiple bioactive pharmacores to combat cancer. In the present study, a one-pot simple and efficient T3P(R) mediated procedure for the preparation of twelve new 3-(substituted- [1,2,4]triazolo[3,4-b] [1,3,4]thiadiazolo)-1H-indoles with short reaction times, easy workup procedure, good yields, and purity of products is described. Cytotoxicity assay (MTT), flow-cytometric univariate cell cycle analysis, Annexin V-FITC staining and DNA fragmentation for cell death mechanism suggested that compound 3d with chloro-substituted phenyl ring induced enhanced cytotoxicity by an apoptotic pathway with high differential toxicity to breast adenocarcinoma cells (MCF-7) when compared with normal human dermal fibroblast cells. Additionally, the interaction between the BH3 domain of anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL with the pharmacophore 3d was examined by molecular docking simulations to assess its potential to induce apoptosis. The docking solutions were proposed to explain the observed selectivity of 3d to Bcl-xL protein. From the present findings, the lead compound, 3d exhibited better anticancer activity when related to the other synthesized molecules with specific action on MCF-7 cells and hence can be considered as a plausible candidate chemo-therapeutic agent, although this warrants further experimentation.
28234626	The role of insulin receptor substrate (IRS) proteins in oncogenic transformation.	Insulin Receptor Substrate (IRS) proteins are the main cytoplasmic adaptor molecules involved in transducing extracellular signals from receptors to downstream proteins. This protein family have pivotal roles on maintenance, distribution and regulation of signaling networks. Since IRS1/2 interact with and transmits signals from the receptors of insulin, Insulin Like Growth Factor 1 (IGF1), prolactin, growth hormone (GH), leptin, Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF), TrkB, ALK and integrins this promoted scientist to think that IRS1 may have functions in cell proliferation, tumorigenesis and metastasis. Therefore, over the past decade, studies on IRS proteins and their functions in cancer has been increased and these studies provided valuable results claiming the involvement of IRS1/2 in cancer development. In this review, we discuss the function and contributions of IRS1 and IRS2 in development of breast cancer.
28234588	Innovative practice model to optimize resource utilization and improve access to care for high-risk and BRCA+ patients.	BACKGROUND: Bilateral prophylactic mastectomy (BPM) has demonstrated breast cancer risk reduction in high-risk/BRCA+ patients. However, priority of active cancers coupled with inefficient use of operating room (OR) resources presents challenges in offering BPM in a timely manner. To address these challenges, a rapid access prophylactic mastectomy and immediate reconstruction (RAPMIR) program was innovated. The purpose of this study was to evaluate RAPMIR with regards to access to care and efficiency. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the cases of all high-risk/BRCA+ patients having had BPM between September 2012 and August 2014. Patients were divided into 2 groups: those managed through the traditional model and those managed through the RAPMIR model. RAPMIR leverages 2 concurrently running ORs with surgical oncology and plastic surgery moving between rooms to complete 3 combined BPMs with immediate reconstruction in addition to 1-2 independent cases each operative day. RAPMIR eligibility criteria included high-risk/BRCA+ status; BPM with immediate, implant-based reconstruction; and day surgery candidacy. Wait times, case volumes and patient throughput were measured and compared. RESULTS: There were 16 traditional patients and 13 RAPMIR patients. Mean wait time (days from referral to surgery) for RAPMIR was significantly shorter than for the traditional model (165.4 v. 309.2 d, p = 0.027). Daily patient throughput (4.3 v. 2.8), plastic surgery case volume (3.7 v. 1.6) and surgical oncology case volume (3.0 v. 2.2) were significantly greater in the RAPMIR model than the traditional model (p = 0.003, p < 0.001 and p = 0.015, respectively). CONCLUSION: A multidisciplinary model with optimized scheduling has the potential to improve access to care and optimize resource utilization.
28234133	Periareolar or Peritumoral Injection of Isosulfan Blue and the Effect on the Number of Sentinel Lymph Nodes Examined.	The conduct of sentinel node biopsy (SLNBx) for breast cancer (BC) has evolved substantially since its original description. No national standards for the performance of SLNBx exist, therefore, we sought to determine the effect of isosulfan blue (ISB) injection technique on nodal harvesting and staging accuracy during SLNBx. Our main outcome measures included the number of SLNs examined and the number of positive axillae in patients undergoing SLNBx after injection of filtered sulfur colloid intradermally and either small volume ISB injected in the periareolar dermis (PA, approximately 0.75 cc) or large volume peritumoral (PT, 5 cc). Between January 1, 2009, and September 30, 2013, 1357 patients at an academic/community practice setting underwent SLNBx of which 966 (71.2%) were node negative. These patients ranged in age from 27 to 97 years (mean 60.1 years). The majority of patients (76%) underwent PT injection of ISB. There was no significant difference in the mean age of these two groups (61.2 PT vs 59.7 PA years). All were female. The majority of patients (72.7%) had T1 primaries. Nearly 73 per cent of patients were Luminal A/B, 10.8 per cent HER, and 16.4 per cent were triple negative. There was no significant difference in the distribution of T stage (P = 0.56) or breast cancer subtypes between the techniques (P = 0.59). The mean number of nodes examined was 3.1 (range, 1-18). PT patients had a mean of 3.5 (range, 1-18) nodes, whereas PA patients had a mean of 2.4 nodes (range, 1-10) (P < 0.001). The technical aspects of injecting ISB affect the number of nodes harvested during SLNBx but not staging accuracy.
28233008	Cardiac rehabilitation for women with breast cancer and treatment-related heart failure compared with coronary artery disease: A retrospective study.	OBJECTIVE: To examine clinical outcomes and completion rates of cardiac rehabilitation in women with breast cancer and treatment-related heart failure. METHODS: Data for women with breast cancer and treatment-related heart failure were compared with those for age-matched women with coronary artery disease. Retrospective data were obtained from the Toronto Rehabilitation Institute database for dates between 1998 and 2011, for cardiopulmonary exercise test results at baseline and 6 months, body composition measures, and cardiac rehabilitation completion rates. RESULTS: A total of 29 women with breast cancer and treatment-related heart failure (mean 57 years (standard deviation (SD) 9.4)) and 29 age-matched women with coronary artery disease were identified. There was no significant difference between the proportion of women with breast cancer and treatment-related heart failure and those with coronary artery disease who completed the programme. Peak aerobic power (VO2peak) increased in the breast cancer and treatment-related heart failure group (mean 16.2 ml-1.kg-1.min-1 (SD 3.4) to mean 18.5 ml-1.kg-1.min-1 (SD 4.5) ; p = 0.002) and in the coronary artery disease group (mean 18.9 ml-1.kg-1.min-1 (SD 4.5) to mean 20.8 ml-1.kg-1.min-1 (SD 4.9); p = 0.01). Body fat percentage increased in the breast cancer and treatment-related heart failure group (mean 34.8% (SD 8.5) to mean 36.3% (SD 6.9); p = 0.04). CONCLUSION: Women with breast cancer and treatment-related heart failure participating in cardiac rehabilitation demonstrate similar significant gains in VO2peak and similar completion rates to those of age-matched women with coronary artery disease. Further research is needed to determine interventions that improve body composition in women with breast cancer and treatment-related heart failure.
28232483	Ectodomain shedding of the cell adhesion molecule Nectin-4 in ovarian cancer is mediated by ADAM10 and ADAM17.	We previously showed that the cell adhesion molecule Nectin-4 is overexpressed in ovarian cancer tumors, and its cleaved extracellular domain can be detected in the serum of ovarian cancer patients. The ADAM (adisintegrin and metalloproteinase) proteases are involved in ectodomain cleavage of transmembrane proteins, and ADAM17 is known to cleave Nectin-4 in breast cancer. However, the mechanism of Nectin-4 cleavage in ovarian cancer has not yet been determined. Analysis of ovarian cancer gene microarray data showed that higher expression of Nectin-4, ADAM10, and ADAM17 is associated with significantly decreased progression-free survival. We quantified Nectin-4 shedding from the surface of ovarian cancer cells after stimulation with lysophosphatidic acid. We report that ADAM17 and ADAM10 cleave Nectin-4 and release soluble Nectin-4 (sN4). Small molecule inhibitors and siRNA knockdown of both ADAM proteases confirmed these results. In matched samples from 11 high-grade serous ovarian cancer patients, we detected 2-20-fold more sN4 in ascites fluid than serum. Co-incubation of ovarian cancer cells with ascites fluid significantly increased sN4 shedding, which could be blocked using a dual inhibitor of ADAM10 and ADAM17. Furthermore, we detected RNA for Nectin-4, ADAM10, and ADAM17 in primary ovarian carcinoma tumors, secondary omental metastases, and ascites cells isolated from serous ovarian cancer patients. In a signaling pathway screen, lysophosphatidic acid increased phosphorylation of AKT, EGF receptor, ERK1/2, JNK1/2/3, and c-Jun. Understanding the function of Nectin-4 shedding in ovarian cancer progression is critical to facilitate its development as both a serum biomarker and a therapeutic target for ovarian cancer.
28231738	Pedigree and BRCA gene analysis in breast cancer patients to identify hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome to prevent morbidity and mortality of disease in Indian population.	Global burden of breast cancer is expected to increase to >2 million new cases every year by 2030 and 10% of these are likely to have hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome. Identifying these individuals by pedigree and BRCA1/2 mutation analyses will enable us to offer targeted mutation testing and appropriate counseling. This study from a tertiary care hospital showed that of the 127 breast cancer patients on treatment during 2014-2015, 24 of them fulfilled the criteria of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome after detailed verbal autopsy and pedigree analysis, and BRCA1 and 2 next-generation sequencing done after pre-test counseling revealed mutations in 13 cases (54%), these included 9 BRCA1 mutations (69%) and 4 BRCA2 mutation (31%). Subsequent post-test counseling recommended targeted mutation analysis for 64 high-risk members in these 13 families with pathogenic mutations, which will help in surveillance for early detection, appropriate management, and prevention of the disease by decreasing the burden to both family and nation. Results from this preliminary study highlight the importance of genetic counseling, pedigree analysis, and genetic testing. It can be recommended that all oncology units should have a genetic counseling service for providing appropriate support to oncologists, patients, and families to prevent unnecessary testing; however, breast cancer screening program is incomplete without evaluating for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome.
28231725	Extracellular vesicles: An overview of biogenesis, function, and role in breast cancer.	Extracellular vesicles have emerged as important mediators of intercellular communication and play an active role in cancer, including breast cancer. Despite limited studies, initial observations suggest that these vesicles are important in breast physiology and pathophysiology. We here, in brief, describe their potential use as future biomarkers and therapeutic agents in breast cancer. Extracellular vesicles in blood and breast fluid may have a great potential to detect and predict the presence of breast cancer, and extracellular vesicles modulation may emerge as a therapeutic approach in cancer therapy.
28231533	Synthesis, characterization and DNA binding/cleavage, protein binding and cytotoxicity studies of Co(II), Ni(II), Cu(II) and Zn(II) complexes of aminonaphthoquinone.	The Co(II), Ni(II), Cu(II) and Zn(II) complexes of an aminonaphthoquinone ligand (L) have been prepared and characterized using analytical and spectral techniques. The structures of L and its Zn(II) complex are confirmed by single crystal X-ray diffraction study. The results indicate that Co(II), Ni(II) and Zn(II) complexes possess tetrahedral geometry while Cu(II) complex exhibits square planar structure. The interaction of L and its complexes with CT-DNA reveal that they could interact with CT-DNA through intercalation. The DNA cleavage studies of the L and its complexes indicate that the Cu(II) and Ni(II) complexes cleave the circular form of the DNA relatively to a greater extent than the other complexes. The results of the interaction of these compounds with bovine serum albumin (BSA) indicate that the complexes exhibit a strong binding to BSA over the L. The in vitro anticancer activities indicate that these compounds exhibit substantial activity against human breast (MCF7) and lung cancer (A549) cell lines. The characteristics of apoptosis in cell morphology have been observed using AO/EB and DAPI staining and the results suggest that an apoptotic mode of cell death with these compounds. The overall results and discussion indicate that coordination of metal ions with the ligand enhances the biological activity.
28231049	Original research paper. Hydrazinyldiene-chroman-2,4-diones in inducing growth arrest and apoptosis in breast cancer cells: Synergism with doxorubicin and correlation with physicochemical properties.	This study evaluates the effects of previously synthesized hydrazinyldiene-chroman-2,4-diones on cell proliferation and apoptosis, cell cycle distribution and migration capacity of MCF-7 breast cancer cells in synergy with doxorubicin. Physicochemical properties of the synthesized compounds were correlated with their structure and activity. Significant cell viability decrease in comparison with the effect of doxorubicin alone and the reference 4-hydroxycoumarin was observed when combination treatment comprising doxorubicin and the title compounds was applied. Synergistic effect with doxorubicin was also observed in down-regulation of phospho-Thr308Akt levels, confirming reduced proliferation and increased apoptosis. Combined treatment increased the percentage of cells arrested at the G2/M stage. Additive inhibition of cell migration was also observed, pointing to the possibility of reducing the risk of metastases. With their solubility profile and log D7.4, all the synthesized compounds follow Lipinski's rule of five for good permeability (absorption) potential.
28230825	Molecular markers of apoptosis in cancer patients exposed to ionizing radiation: the post-Chornobyl view.	During the past three decades, the deleterious consequences of Chornobyl accident including carcinogenic effects in the people who were accidentally exposed to radiation have been intensively studied. In particular, recent studies provided increased knowledge of the molecular pathogenesis of thyroid tumors in children exposed to Chornobyl fallout. The risk of several forms of leukemia including myelodysplastic syndromes is elevated in Chornobyl liquidators. Furthermore, the upward trends of increases in a variety of other tumors including breast cancer, cancers of central nervous system and renal cancer have been reported in the persons exposed to Chornobyl fallout. There is growing evidence that insufficient apoptosis allows irradiated cells to survive and thereby contributes to carcinogenesis. The purpose of the present survey is to summarize the recent findings related to apoptotic biomarkers among cancer patients from the different populations affected by the Chornobyl catastrophe. Among the particularly radiosensitive cancer sites, we focused on thyroid cancer and leukemia. Several genes and/or proteins controlling apoptosis directly or indirectly have been incorporated into the analysis. The data reviewed here provide a mechanistic link between the apoptosis alterations and development of radiation-related cancer in the 30-year post-Chornobyl period. We suggest that the type of mutations arising from misrepair of DNA double strand breaks (gene fusion and amplification) is the initial signature event in radiation-induced thyroid cancer. Much work has to be done over the next years to elucidate central questions related to the nature of human radiation carcinogenesis. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled "The Chornobyl Nuclear Accident: Thirty Years After".
28230773	Programmed Death Ligand 1 (PD-L1) Tumor Expression Is Associated with a Better Prognosis and Diabetic Disease in Triple Negative Breast Cancer Patients.	Triple Negative Breast Cancers (TNBC) subtype is an aggressive disease with poor clinical outcome. The only treatment available is surgery followed by chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) is a trans-membrane protein expressed on a wide variety of cells including immune cells, epithelial and vascular endothelial cells. Recently, PD-1/PD-L1 pathway signaling was described as an adaptive immune resistance mechanism enacted by the tumor cells to evade the immune response. Its presence on tumor cell membranes, acquired for this reason, through time, is an important prognostic value. However, data available in the literature about PD-L1 immunohistochemical expression in breast cancer are often discordant and not uniform, probably for the use of different antibodies clones and the high molecular heterogeneity of the different tumor types. The absence of target therapies, in particular for TNBC, has shifted the clinical attention mainly on the role of PD-L1 in this subtype of breast cancer. In this study, we evaluated tumor and TIL (tumor infiltrating lymphocytes) PDL-1 expression in a series of TNBC, included in Tissue Micro Arrays (TMAs), to define its real prognostic value, optimizing immunohistochemistry method with an "approved for diagnostic assay" antibody. PD-L1 expression directly correlated with proliferation index (Ki-67), glycemia, the presence of diabetes and indirectly with menopausal status, presence of lymph node metastasis and relapse. The analysis of Kaplan-Meier showed that an increased PD-L1 expression was strongly associated with better disease-free survival (DFS) but not correlated with overall survival (OS). Our data confirmed that PD-L1 could be an important marker for prognostic stratification and for planning immune checkpoint inhibitors therapies in patients with TNBC.
28230714	Assessment of skeletal tumour burden on 18F-NaF PET/CT using a new quantitative method.	PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to test a method of quantifying skeletal tumour burden with F-NaF PET/CT. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the charts of 117 patients who underwent F-NaF PET/CT for the detection of bone metastases, 68 women and 49 men, 16-82 years old (mean+/-SD: 62.9+/-10.7 years). Mean standardized uptake values (SUVmean) were measured in five anatomic sites to evaluate normal skeleton activity. The influence of sex and age was investigated. Skeletal tumour burden was calculated in 69 exams positive for bone metastases using volumetric data and SUVmean values. Intraobserver and interobserver reproducibility was tested. In 10 patients with breast cancer, skeletal tumour burden in pretreatment and post-treatment F-NaF PET/CT was compared with tumour marker and clinical evolution. RESULTS: The range of normal skeleton SUVmean for the 410 volume of interests analysed was 2.2-5.9 (mean+/-SD: 4.4+/-1.5). A threshold of 10 was chosen to exclude F-NaF normal skeleton uptake. An inverse relationship was found between normal skeleton SUVmean and age (r=-0.237; P=0.032). Our results show excellent intraobserver and interobserver reproducibility, with intraclass correlation values of 0.995 and 0.997, respectively. The percentage change in the skeletal tumour burden in response to therapy shows a moderate direct correlation with the percentage variation of the tumour marker (r=0.668; P=0.035). CONCLUSION: The methodology that we used to quantify skeletal tumour burden is easy to perform, highly reproducible and allows for the evaluation of bone tumour response to therapy in a subgroup of breast cancer patients. The possibility of skeletal tumour burden quantification is another advantage of F-NaF PET/CT over the visual and subjective interpretation of bone scintigraphy.
28230039	Cyclooxygenase-2 expression and association with skin cancer: A meta-analysis based on Chinese patients.	OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this meta-analysis was to evaluate the association between cyclooxygenase-2 (Cox-2) expression and skin cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We searched the databases of PubMed, CNKI, and WANFANG to find the case-control studies associated with Cox-2 expression and skin cancer. The association between Cox-2 expression and skin cancer was demonstrated by odds ratio (OR) and its 95% confidence interval (95% CI). The publication bias was evaluated by funnel plot and Egger's line regression test. All the statistical analyses were done by Stata10.0 software (Stata Corporation, College Station, TX, USA). RESULTS: Ten studies were included in this meta-analysis. Without significant statistical heterogeneity, the data were pooled by fixed-effect model. Ten case-control studies were included in this meta-analysis. The combined results showed a close correlation between Cox-2 expression and skin cancer (OR = 25.00, 95% CI: 13.40-46.64, P < 0.05) with fixed-effect model. Subgroup analysis also indicated that Cox-2 expression was significantly correlated with skin cancer with the pathology type of squamous cell carcinoma (OR = 31.95, 95% CI: 15.08-67.72, P < 0.05) and basal cell carcinoma (OR = 14.69, 95% CI: 4.80-44.94, P < 0.05). Funnel plot and Egger's line regression test indicated no publication bias. CONCLUSION: According to the present published data, Cox-2 expression was closely correlated to skin cancer.
28230006	Evaluation of the safety and efficacy of percutaneous radiofrequency ablation for treating multiple breast fibroadenoma.	BACKGROUND: This study was conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ultrasound (US)-guided percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for multiple breast fibroadenoma as an alternative to surgical resection. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixty-five patients with multiple breast fibroadenoma accepted general anesthesia and US-guided percutaneous RFA in our hospital from September 2014 to January 2016. Contrast-enhanced US (CEUS) was used immediately after operation to determine whether the tumor was ablated completely. The complete ablation rate (CAR) and the change of focal volume were evaluated by CEUS at the 1st month and the 3rd month after operation. RESULTS: All the patients were diagnosed by needle biopsy. Among all the patients, 256 nodules were found. Forty-six nodules (17.96%) were located <5 mm from epidermis; 26 nodules (10.15%) were located below areola. Complete ablation was achieved for 251 nodules (98.04%) after the 1st month of operation. The volume reduce rate was 39.06% and 75.99% at the 1st and the 3rd month after operation, respectively, of which 45 nodules were completely absorbed (17.58%). There was a statistically significant difference of the volume reduction rate (VRR) after operation (P < 0.01) compared with preoperative breast nodules volume. There were no complications such as skin burn, hemorrhage, and hematoma, nipple discharge in the process during and after RFA. CONCLUSION: Given advantages of high CAR, mild injury, rapid recovery, and cosmetic outcome desired by the patients, RFA has the potential to become the preferred method in the treatment of breast fibroadenoma.
28229982	Circulating-free DNA Mutation Associated with Response of Targeted Therapy in Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2-positive Metastatic Breast Cancer.	BACKGROUND: The addition of anti-human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-targeted drugs, such as trastuzumab, lapatinib, and trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1), to chemotherapy significantly improved prognosis of HER2-positive breast cancer patients. However, it was confused that metastatic patients vary in the response of targeted drug. Therefore, methods of accurately predicting drug response were really needed. To overcome the spatial and temporal limitations of biopsies, we aimed to develop a more sensitive and less invasive method of detecting mutations associated with anti-HER2 therapeutic response through circulating-free DNA (cfDNA). METHODS: From March 6, 2014 to December 10, 2014, 24 plasma samples from 20 patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer who received systemic therapy were eligible. We used a panel for detection of hot-spot mutations from 50 oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, and then used targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) to identify somatic mutation of these samples in those 50 genes. Samples taken before their first trastuzumab administration and subsequently proven with clinical benefit were grouped into sensitive group. The others were collected after disease progression of the trastuzumab-based therapy and were grouped into the resistant group. RESULTS: A total of 486 single-nucleotide variants from 46 genes were detected. Of these 46 genes, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase catalytic subunit alpha (PIK3CA), proto-oncogene c-Kit (KIT), and tumor protein p53 (TP53) were the most common mutated genes. Seven genes, including epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), G protein subunit alpha S (GNAS), HRas proto-oncogene (HRAS), mutL homolog 1 (MLH1), cadherin 1 (CDH1), neuroblastoma RAS viral oncogene homolog (NRAS), and NOTCH1, that only occurred m utations in the resistant group were associated with the resistance of targeted therapy. In addition, we detected a HER2 S855I mutation in two patients who had persistent benefits from anti-HER2 therapy. CONCLUSION: Targeted NGS of cfDNA has potential clinical utility to detect biomarkers from HER2-targeted therapies.
28223798	Transferrin receptor-targeted pH-sensitive micellar system for diminution of drug resistance and targetable delivery in multidrug-resistant breast cancer.	The emergence of drug resistance is partially associated with overproduction of transferrin receptor (TfR). To overcome multidrug resistance (MDR) and achieve tumor target delivery, we designed a novel biodegradable pH-sensitive micellar system modified with HAIYPRH, a TfR ligand (7pep). First, the polymers poly(l-histidine)-coupled polyethylene glycol-2000 (PHIS-PEG2000) and 7pep-modified 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-polyethylene glycol-2000 (7pep-DSPE-PEG2000) were synthesized, and the mixed micelles were prepared by blending of PHIS-PEG2000 and 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-polyethylene glycol-2000 (DSPE-PEG2000) or 7pep-DSPE-PEG2000 (7-pep HD micelles). The micelles exhibited good size uniformity, high encapsulation efficiency, and a low critical micelle concentration. By changing the polymer ratio in the micellar formulation, the pH response range was specially tailored to pH ~6.0. When loaded with antitumor drug doxorubicin (DOX), the micelle showed an acid pH-triggering drug release profile. The cellular uptake and cytotoxicity study demonstrated that 7-pep HD micelles could significantly enhance the intracellular level and antitumor efficacy of DOX in multidrug-resistant cells (MCF-7/Adr), which attributed to the synergistic effect of poly(l-histidine)-triggered endolysosom escape and TfR-mediated endocytosis. Most importantly, the in vivo imaging study confirmed the target-ability of 7-pep HD micelles to MDR tumor. These findings indicated that 7-pep HD micelles would be a promising drug delivery system in the treatment of drug-resistant tumors.
28223083	Characteristics and prognosis of Japanese female breast cancer patients: The BioBank Japan project.	BACKGROUND: Breast cancer is currently the most common type of cancer in Japanese females. Unlike most other types of cancer, breast cancer develops more frequently in middle-aged females than in elderly females. METHODS: Of all Japanese female breast cancer patients aged >/=20 years whom the BioBank Japan Project originally enrolled between 2003 and 2008, 2034 were registered within 90 days after their diagnosis. We described the lifestyle and clinical characteristics of these patients at study entry. Furthermore, we examined the effect of these characteristics on all-cause mortality. RESULTS: In the female patients registered within 90 days after diagnosis, the frequency of stage 0 or unclassified, stage I, II, III and IV were 11.4%, 47.9%, 37.0%, 2.9% and 0.8%, respectively. The proportion of histological types was 12.9% for non-invasive carcinoma (ductal carcinoma and lobular carcinoma), 81.0% for invasive carcinoma (papillotubular carcinoma, solid tubular carcinoma, scirrhous carcinoma and special types), 0.2% for Paget's diseases and 5.8% for others. Those positive for the estrogen and progesterone receptors accounted for 75.8% and 62.1% of all patients, respectively. Among 1860 female participants registered within 90 days, 218 participants died during 144,54 person-years of follow-up. More advanced stage, elevation of serum carcinoembryonic antigen and carbohydrate antigen 15-3 levels and absence of the estrogen receptor at study entry were crudely associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality after adjustment for age. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed the association of several clinical characteristics with all-cause mortality in female breast cancer patients.
28223032	[Primary breast sarcomas: About 30 cases treated at Salah-Azaiez institute in Tunisia].	PURPOSE: To identify retrospectively prognostic factors of primary breast sarcoma and review its treatment modalities. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a descriptive study on 30 cases of primary breast sarcoma. We carried out a univariate and multivariate analysis correlating clinical, pathological and therapeutic parameters with disease-free survival and overall survival. RESULTS: The mean age was 46.8 years. The mean tumour size was 10cm. The 30 cases were 18 phyllodes sarcomas, eight angiosarcomas, three liposarcomas and a case of granulocytic sarcoma. Sixteen patients had adjuvant radiotherapy and only seven patients received adjuvant chemotherapy. The median follow-up was 64 months. Overall survival rates at 3 and 5 years were 49.1% and 33.7%. Disease-free survival rates at 3 and 5 years were 22.8% and 15.2% respectively. The analytical study of the following parameters: tumour size and presence or absence of node or distant metastases, showed no correlation with overall survival nor with disease-free survival. Furthermore, adjuvant radiotherapy did not improve overall survival (P=0.298; hazard ratio [HR]=1 [0.982-1.04]) nor disease-free survival (P=0.61; HR=0.942 [0.862-1.029]). By univariate analyses, we identified a correlation between overall survival, surgical margins (>1cm) (P=0005; HR=3.4 [1.217-9.919]) and tumour necrosis (P=0.028; HR=0.099 [0.014-0.682]). We did not find any independent prognostic factor by multivariate analysis. CONCLUSION: The prognosis of primary breast sarcoma seems to depend essentially on optimal surgical excision (margin over 1cm). The only potential histological parameter correlated with the prognosis is the presence of tumour necrosis. The histological subtype should not be considered as a prognostic marker for overall or disease-free survival in patients with primary breast sarcoma.
28222768	Ki-67 as a controversial predictive and prognostic marker in breast cancer patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy.	BACKGROUND: Studies have partly demonstrated the clinical validity of Ki-67 as a predictive marker in the neoadjuvant setting, but the question of the best cut-off points as well as the importance of this marker as a prognostic factor in partial responder/non-responder groups remains uncertain. METHODS: One hundred twenty patients diagnosed with invasive breast cancer and treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) between 2002 and 2013 were retrospectively recruited to this study. The optimal cut-off value for Ki-67 labeling index (LI) to discriminate response to treatment was assessed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Kaplan-Meier curve estimation, log-rank test and cox regression analysis were carried out to reveal the association between Ki-67 categories and survival (DMFS = Distant metastases-free survival, OS = Overall survival). RESULTS: Twenty three out of 120 patients (19.2%) achieved pathologic complete remission (pCR), whereas partial remission (pPR) and no response (pNR) to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) was detected in 60.8% and 20.0%, respectively. The distribution of subtypes showed a significant difference in pathological response groups (p < 0.001). Most of the TNBC cases were represented in pCR group. The most relevant cut-off value for the Ki-67 distinguishing pCR from pNR cases was 20% (p = 0.002). No significant threshold for Ki-67 was found regarding DMFS (p = 0.208). Considering OS, the optimal cut-off point occurred at 15% Ki-67 (p = 0.006). The pPR group represented a significant Ki-67 threshold at 30% regarding OS (p = 0.001). Ki-67 and pPR subgroups were not significantly associated (p = 0.653). For prognosis prediction, Ki-67 at 30% cut-off value (p = 0.040) furthermore subtype (p = 0.037) as well as pathological response (p = 0.044) were suitable to separate patients into good and unfavorable prognosis cohorts regarding OS. However, in multivariate analyses, only Ki-67 at 30% threshold (p = 0.029), and subtype (p = 0.008) were independently linked to OS. CONCLUSIONS: NAC is more efficient in tumors with at least 20% Ki-67 LI. Both Ki-67 LI and subtype showed a significant association with pathological response. Ki-67 LI represented independent prognostic potential to OS in our neoadjuvant patient cohort, while pathological response did not. Additionally, our data also suggest that if a tumor is non-responder to NAC, increased Ki-67 is a poor prognostic marker.
28222672	Long leukocyte telomere length in prostate cancer patients at diagnosis is associated with poor metastasis-free and cancer-specific survival.	Previous studies have suggested that leukocyte telomere length is associated with risk of developing prostate cancer. Investigations of leukocyte telomere length as a prognostic factor in prostate cancer are, however, lacking. In this study, leukocyte telomere length was investigated both as a risk marker, comparing control subjects and patient risk groups (based on serum levels of prostate-specific antigen, tumor differentiation, and tumor stage), and as a prognostic marker for metastasis-free and cancer-specific survival. Relative telomere length was measured by a well-established quantitative polymerase chain reaction method in 415 consecutively sampled individuals. Statistical evaluation included 162 control subjects without cancer development during follow-up and 110 untreated patients with newly diagnosed localized prostate cancer at the time of blood draw. Leukocyte telomere length did not differ significantly between control subjects and patients, or between patient risk groups. Interestingly, however, and in line with our previous results in breast and kidney cancer patients, relative telomere length at diagnosis was an independent prognostic factor. Patients with long leukocyte telomeres (median) had a significantly worse prostate cancer-specific and metastasis-free survival compared to patients with short telomere length. In contrast, for patients who died of other causes than prostate cancer, long relative telomere length was not coupled to shorter survival time. To our knowledge, these results are novel and give further strength to our hypothesis that leukocyte telomere length might be used as a prognostic marker in malignancy.
28222671	Reversal of hypermethylation and reactivation of glutathione S-transferase pi 1 gene by curcumin in breast cancer cell line.	One of the mechanisms for epigenetic silencing of tumor suppressor genes is hypermethylation of cytosine residue at CpG islands at their promoter region that contributes to malignant progression of tumor. Therefore, activation of tumor suppressor genes that have been silenced by promoter methylation is considered to be very attractive molecular target for cancer therapy. Epigenetic silencing of glutathione S-transferase pi 1, a tumor suppressor gene, is involved in various types of cancers including breast cancer. Epigenetic silencing of tumor suppressor genes can be reversed by several molecules including natural compounds such as polyphenols that can act as a hypomethylating agent. Curcumin has been found to specifically target various tumor suppressor genes and alter their expression. To check the effect of curcumin on the methylation pattern of glutathione S-transferase pi 1 gene in MCF-7 breast cancer cell line in dose-dependent manner. To check the reversal of methylation pattern of hypermethylated glutathione S-transferase pi 1, MCF-7 breast cancer cell line was treated with different concentrations of curcumin for different time periods. DNA and proteins of treated and untreated cell lines were isolated, and methylation status of the promoter region of glutathione S-transferase pi 1 was analyzed using methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction assay, and expression of this gene was analyzed by immunoblotting using specific antibodies against glutathione S-transferase pi 1. A very low and a nontoxic concentration (10 microM) of curcumin treatment was able to reverse the hypermethylation and led to reactivation of glutathione S-transferase pi 1 protein expression in MCF-7 cells after 72 h of treatment, although the IC50 value of curcumin was found to be at 20 microM. However, curcumin less than 3 microM of curcumin could not alter the promoter methylation pattern of glutathione S-transferase pi 1. Treatment of breast cancer MCF-7 cells with curcumin causes complete reversal of glutathione S-transferase pi 1 promoter hypermethylation and leads to re-expression of glutathione S-transferase pi 1, suggesting it to be an excellent nontoxic hypomethylating agent.
28222665	MicroRNAs regulate the epithelial-mesenchymal transition and influence breast cancer invasion and metastasis.	MicroRNAs are small RNA molecules that play a major role in the post-transcriptional regulation of genes and influence the development, differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis of cells and the development and progression of tumors. The epithelial-mesenchymal transition is a process by which epithelial cells morphologically transform into cells with a mesenchymal phenotype. The epithelial-mesenchymal transition plays a highly important role in tumor invasion and metastasis. Increasing evidence indicates that microRNAs are tightly associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition regulation in tumor cells. In breast cancer, various microRNA molecules have been identified as epithelial-mesenchymal transition inducers or inhibitors, which, through different mechanisms and signaling pathways, participate in the regulation of breast cancer invasion and metastasis among various biological behaviors. The epithelial-mesenchymal transition-related microRNAs in breast cancer provide valuable molecules for researching cell invasion and metastasis, and they also provide candidate targets that may be significant for the targeted therapy of breast cancer.
28222663	miR-29a suppresses MCF-7 cell growth by downregulating tumor necrosis factor receptor 1.	Tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 is the main receptor mediating many tumor necrosis factor-alpha-induced cellular events. Some studies have shown that tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 promotes tumorigenesis by activating nuclear factor-kappa B signaling pathway, while other studies have confirmed that tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 plays an inhibitory role in tumors growth by inducing apoptosis in breast cancer. Therefore, the function of tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 in breast cancer requires clarification. In this study, we first found that tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 was significantly increased in human breast cancer tissues and cell lines, and knockdown of tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 by small interfering RNA inhibited cell proliferation by arresting the cell cycle and inducing apoptosis. In addition, miR-29a was predicted as a regulator of tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 by TargetScan and was shown to be inversely correlated with tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 expression in human breast cancer tissues and cell lines. Luciferase reporter assay further confirmed that miR-29a negatively regulated tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 expression by binding to the 3' untranslated region. In our functional study, miR-29a overexpression remarkably suppressed cell proliferation and colony formation, arrested the cell cycle, and induced apoptosis in MCF-7 cell. Furthermore, in combination with tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 transfection, miR-29a significantly reversed the oncogenic role caused by tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 in MCF-7 cell. In addition, we demonstrated that miR-29a suppressed MCF-7 cell growth by inactivating the nuclear factor-kappa B signaling pathway and by decreasing cyclinD1 and Bcl-2/Bax protein levels. Taken together, our results suggest that miR-29a is an important regulator of tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 expression in breast cancer and functions as a tumor suppressor by targeting tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 to influence the growth of MCF-7 cell.
28221097	Supplemental Breast MR Imaging Screening of Women with Average Risk of Breast Cancer.	Purpose To investigate the utility and accuracy of breast magnetic resonance (MR) imaging as a supplemental screening tool in women at average risk for breast cancer and to investigate the types of cancer detected with MR imaging screening. Materials and Methods This prospective observational study was conducted at two academic breast centers in women aged 40-70 years without breast cancer-associated risk factors (lifetime risk <15%). Between January 2005 and December 2013, women with at least minimal residual breast tissue (American College of Radiology categories A-D) and normal conventional imaging findings (screening mammography with or without screening ultrasonography [US]) were invited to undergo supplemental MR imaging screening. Outcome measures were supplemental cancer detection rates, interval cancer rates, and biologic profiles of MR imaging-detected additional cancers, as well as specificity and positive predictive value (PPV) of MR imaging screening. Tissue diagnoses or 2 years of follow-up were used to establish the reference standard. Results A total of 2120 women were recruited and underwent 3861 screening MR imaging studies, covering an observation period of 7007 women-years. Breast MR imaging depicted 60 additional breast cancers (ductal carcinoma in situ, n = 20; invasive carcinoma, n = 40) for an overall supplemental cancer detection rate of 15.5 per 1000 cases (95% confidence interval [CI]: 11.9, 20.0). Forty-eight additional cancers were detected with MR imaging at initial screening (supplemental cancer detection rate, 22.6 per 1000 cases). During the 1741 subsequent screening rounds, 12 of 13 incident cancers were found with MR imaging alone (supplemental cancer detection rate, 6.9 per 1000 cases). One cancer was diagnosed with all three methods (mammography, US, and MR imaging), and none were diagnosed with mammography only or US only. Cancers diagnosed with MR imaging were small (median, 8 mm), node negative in 93.4% of cases, and dedifferentiated (high-grade cancer) in 41.7% of cases at prevalence screening and 46.0% of cases at incidence screening. No interval cancers were observed. MR imaging screening offered high specificity (97.1%; 95% CI: 96.5, 97.6) and high PPV (35.7%; 95% CI: 28.9, 43.1). Conclusion In women at average risk for breast cancer, MR imaging screening improves early diagnosis of prognostically relevant breast cancer.

28219911	Triple-negative breast cancer with brain metastasis in a pregnant woman.	A woman aged 35 years was diagnosed with triple-negative breast cancer in October 2012. During the investigation, it was discovered that she was pregnant, the patient decided to have an abortion. She was submitted to a radical modified mastectomy and adjuvant chemotherapy followed by adjuvant breast radiotherapy of the left breast. 2 months after the adjuvant treatment, she began to have headaches and dizziness. The cranial MRI (head MRI) showed brain metastasis. She was then treated with whole brain radiotherapy, stereotactic radiosurgery and concomitant temozolomide which resulted in complete response. 1.5 year later, she was able to get pregnant and gave birth to a baby without complications. The previous imaging reassessment performed in September 2016 shows no evidence of recurrent breast cancer.
28218348	Radioguided surgery with radiolabeled somatostatin analogs: not only in GEP-NETs.	Radioguided surgery (RGS) is a surgical technique that, using intra-operative probes, enables the surgeon to identify tissues preoperatively "marked" by a radiopharmaceutical. Somatostatin receptors (SSTRs) are present in the majority of neuroendocrine cells and may be over-expressed not only by tumor cells, but also by endothelial cells of peritumoral vessels, inflammatory cells and cells of the immune system, such as activated lymphocytes, monocytes and epithelioid cells. This extra neoplastic uptake is the rationale for the use of radiolabeled somatostatin analogs (SSAs) either in some tumors not expressing SSTRs or in various non-oncological diseases. The crucial point of RGS technique lays in the establishment of a favorable tumor-to-background ratio (TBR). A wide range of probe systems are available with different detectors and many radiopharmaceuticals have been experimented and utilized, mainly using g-detection probes; in order to widen RGS application field, newer approaches with b- or b+ emitting radioisotopes have also been proposed. Together with the consolidated clinical use, a promising and effective employment of RGS may be found in neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) using 111In-pentetreotide (OCT). RGS with OCT has been demonstrated useful in the management of patients with gastroenteropancreatic (GEP) tumors, lung, brain and breast cancer. Preoperative scintigraphy or PET with DOTA-peptides combined with RGS increases the rate of successful surgery. Preliminary studies with b- probes using 90Y-SSA suggest the possible interest of this approach in patients undergoing peptide receptor radiotherapy.
28218347	Breast cancer: early diagnosis and effective treatment by drug delivery tracing.	Breast cancer is the most frequent cancer in women and it is the main reason of cancer-related deaths of women worldwide. Different types of breast cancer diagnostic examinations are also available, such as mammography, MRI, biopsy, ultrasound and molecular imaging. Radionuclide-based imaging methods including SPECT and PET are useful in early diagnosis and treatment of the cancer. The radiolabeling of chemo drugs with nanoparticles should be recommended from the standpoint of an early diagnosis and effective treatment of breast cancer.
28218039	Demethylation and alterations in the expression level of the cell cycle-related genes as possible mechanisms in arsenic trioxide-induced cell cycle arrest in human breast cancer cells.	Arsenic trioxide (As2O3) has been used clinically as an anti-tumor agent. Its mechanisms are mostly considered to be the induction of apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. However, the detailed molecular mechanisms of its anti-cancer action through cell cycle arrest are poorly known. Furthermore, As2O3 has been shown to be a potential DNA methylation inhibitor, inducing DNA hypomethylation. We hypothesize that As2O3 may affect the expression of cell cycle regulatory genes by interfering with DNA methylation patterns. To explore this, we examined promoter methylation status of 24 cell cycle genes in breast cancer cell lines and in a normal breast tissue sample by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction and/or restriction enzyme-based methods. Gene expression level and cell cycle distribution were quantified by real-time polymerase chain reaction and flow cytometric analyses, respectively. Our methylation analysis indicates that only promoters of RBL1 (p107), RASSF1A, and cyclin D2 were aberrantly methylated in studied breast cancer cell lines. As2O3 induced CpG island demethylation in promoter regions of these genes and restores their expression correlated with DNA methyltransferase inhibition. As2O3 also induced alterations in messenger RNA expression of several cell cycle-related genes independent of demethylation. Flow cytometric analysis revealed that the cell cycle arrest induced by As2O3 varied depending on cell lines, MCF-7 at G1 phase and both MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells at G2/M phase. These changes at transcriptional level of the cell cycle genes by the molecular mechanisms dependent and independent of demethylation are likely to represent the mechanisms of cell cycle redistribution in breast cancer cells, in response to As2O3 treatment.
28216608	Expression of Iron-Related Proteins Differentiate Non-Cancerous and Cancerous Breast Tumors.	We have previously reported hepcidin and ferritin increases in the plasma of breast cancer patients, but not in patients with benign breast disease. We hypothesized that these differences in systemic iron homeostasis may reflect alterations in different iron-related proteins also play a key biochemical and regulatory role in breast cancer. Thus, here we explored the expression of a bundle of molecules involved in both iron homeostasis and tumorigenesis in tissue samples. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or reverse-phase protein array (RPPA), were used to measure the expression of 20 proteins linked to iron processes in 24 non-cancerous, and 56 cancerous, breast tumors. We found that cancerous tissues had higher level of hepcidin than benign lesions (p = 0.012). The univariate analysis of RPPA data highlighted the following seven proteins differentially expressed between non-cancerous and cancerous breast tissue: signal transducer and transcriptional activator 5 (STAT5), signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), bone morphogenetic protein 6 (BMP6), cluster of differentiation 74 (CD74), transferrin receptor (TFRC), inhibin alpha (INHA), and STAT5_pY694. These findings were confirmed for STAT5, STAT3, BMP6, CD74 and INHA when adjusting for age. The multivariate statistical analysis indicated an iron-related 10-protein panel effective in separating non-cancerous from cancerous lesions including STAT5, STAT5_pY694, myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MYD88), CD74, iron exporter ferroportin (FPN), high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), STAT3_pS727, TFRC, ferritin heavy chain (FTH), and ferritin light chain (FTL). Our results showed an association between some iron-related proteins and the type of tumor tissue, which may provide insight in strategies for using iron chelators to treat breast cancer.
28216075	[Androgen receptors in breast cancer: Expression, value and therapeutic prospects].	Triple-negative (TN) breast cancer are characterized by lack of estrogen receptor (OR) and progesterone receptor (PR) expression, and the absence of overexpression of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). It is a heterogeneous group of tumors with a more pejorative prognosis than other subtypes of breast cancer. Androgen receptors (AR) are nuclear receptors whose expression varies from 80 to 85% of primary breast cancers and 60 to 75% of metastatic cancers. Among the TN breast cancers, the luminal androgen receptor (LAR) subtype expresses AR more frequently, up to 53% of the cases. AR are associated with lower tumor size, histological grade, Ki67, and lymph node involvement. The results of recent clinical trials evaluating anti-androgen therapies in locally advanced or metastatic TN breast cancer are promising. Many new therapies are tested, including enzalutamide or abiraterone acetate, and numerous therapeutic combinations including PI3K/AKT/mTOR inhibitors or CDK inhibitors. These therapies would allow an alternative treatment of patients with TN breast cancer for which there is often a therapeutic impasse.
28216037	ESR1 single nucleotide polymorphism rs1062577 (c.*3804T>A) alters the susceptibility of breast cancer risk in Iranian population.	OBJECTIVES: Albeit single nucleotide polymorphisms related to ESR1 gene have been studied, only a number of them have been reported to be associated with breast cancer risk. rs1062577 is one of the most recent microRNA-related ESR1 SNPs; however, no study has been conducted to investigate the significance this polymorphism in Iranian population. In this study, we aimed to investigate the frequency and also the association between rs1062577 and breast cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: rs1062577 position was genotyped by Tetra-primer ARMS-PCR in totally 182 blood specimens obtained from breast cancer patients (n=86), and healthy blood donors (n=96). The distribution of different genotypes was statistically analyzed in terms of the potential association between rs1062577 different alleles, breast cancer risk and clinicopathological criteria of breast cancer patients. RESULTS: The statistical analyses confidently indicated that rs1062577 A allele is associated with the increased breast cancer risk in both univariate and multivariate regression models (Odds Ratio=8.403 and 32.602 respectively). rs1062577 T allele was statistically associated with stage I of breast cancer patients (p-value=0.025). In silico studies implied that rs1062577 A allele can alter the binding capacity of ESR1 mRNA and miRNAs via either breakage or formation of hydrogen bonds. CONCLUSION: rs1062577 A allele is significantly and dramatically associated with the elevated risk and greater stages of breast cancer.
28215732	Targeted therapy in older women with breast cancer - What's the target?	In this review, the results of the FOCUS (Female breast cancer in the elderly: Optimizing Clinical guidelines USing clinico-pathological and molecular data) program are summarized. This study was originally designed with the aim to define guidelines for the treatment of older women with breast cancer. With data from several studies within FOCUS, a prediction model can be constructed. Such a model helps to define individualized treatment for older patients with breast cancer, taking into account tumour characteristics and patient-related factors. At a clinical level, this model can provide the physician and the patient with accurate prediction to assist on the decision making of treatment strategies: this results into individualized treatment, not based on one individual marker, but on different pillars related to the patient, the tumour and the most suitable, appropriate treatment.
28215644	From molecular insight to therapeutic strategy: The holistic approach for treating triple negative breast cancer.	Aim of the present study was to analyze the molecular pathogenesis of TNBC, therapeutic practice, challenges, and future goals in treatment strategies. Based on the alterations of distinct pathways, Lehmann's subgroups of TNBCs were further categorized. Those with defective DNA damage repair and replication pathways, viz. Basal Like 1 & 2 (BL1, BL2) were found susceptible to DNA intercalating drugs while those with upregulated cell signalling & motility (mesenchymal (M), mesemchymal stem like (MSL)), cell survival (BL2, M, MSL), angiogenesis (BL2, MSL), T cell signalling (Immunomodulatory/IM) pathways required targeted therapies. Our Meta-analysis categorized 12 randomized previous trial cases, solely under the following drug regimens: [1] DNA destabilizers, [2] PARP inhibitors, [3] Microtubule stabilizers, [4] Angiogenesis inhibitors, [5] Antimetabolite, [6] T cell targeted therapy; as single or combinational therapy. Best therapeutic efficacies of DNA destabilizers with angiogenesis inhibitors in combination than monotherapy with either (OR: 5.011-7.286; p value<0.001) indicated a significant prevalence of BL1 type TNBCs in populations. Statistical significance with antimetabolites as combination therapy (OR: 2.343; p value: 0.018) and not with microtubule stabilizer (OR: 0.377) were observed. Thus, for best ORR in TNBC, personalized medicine should be the therapeutic choice for the clinicians.
28215639	GATA3 expression and its relationship with clinicopathological parameters in invasive breast carcinomas.	GATA3, as a transcription factor, is associated with estrogen receptor (ER) expression and necessary for luminal cell differentiation in mammary glands. Association of GATA3 expression with clinicopathological parameters, molecular subtypes of tumors, disease free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) for breast carcinoma patients were evaluated in this study. We immunohistochemically stained GATA3, CK5/6, EGFR, CK14 and vimentin on tissue microarray blocks of 457 invasive breast carcinomas. Tumors are sub-classified as luminal A, luminal B, HER2 expressing, basal-like and null type according to their hormonal status with cerbB2, CK 5/6 and EGFR expressions. Follow-up data for 254 cases were obtained. 215/457 (47%) tumors were GATA3 positive. GATA3 expression was inversely correlated with mitotic count (p<0.0001), nuclear grade (p=0.001), histological grade (p=0.001), tumor necrosis (p=0.001), stromal lymphocytic response (p<0.01), nipple invasion (p=0.01), metastasis (p=0.03), vimentin (p=0.0003), EGFR (p=0.015) and CK14 (p=0.001) expressions; and directly associated with ER (p<0.0001) and progesterone receptor (PR) (p<0.0001) expressions. Luminal A carcinomas had the highest frequency for GATA-3 (140/245), however basal-like carcinomas had the lowest (1/42) (p<0.0001). None of the medullary and metaplastic carcinomas expressed GATA3. GATA3 was associated with good DFS and OS (p=0.001 and p=0.0009) and was an independent prognostic factor for OS. GATA3 expression, regardless of the subtype, may have a prognostic significance for breast carcinomas through its ability to promote the differentiation of luminal progenitor cells.
28215542	Hexachlorobenzene alters cell cycle by regulating p27-cyclin E-CDK2 and c-Src-p27 protein complexes.	Hexachlorobenzene (HCB) is an organochlorine pollutant widely distributed in the environment around the entire world. Previous reports from our group and others have demonstrated that this compound is as an endocrine disruptor. We have also reported that HCB presents a co-carcinogenic effect in N-Nitroso-N-methyl-urea-induced mammary tumours in rats. In this work, we studied the effects of HCB on cell cycle progression and cell cycle regulating protein expression in the estrogen-sensitive breast cancer cell line, MCF-7. Here, we show that HCB alters cell cycle in a concentration-dependent way. The lowest assessed concentration (0.005muM) promotes the cell cycle progression, enhances cyclin D1 expression, and reduces the nuclear localization of p27 accompanied by an increased interaction between p27 and c-Src kinase. On the other hand, 5muM HCB delays the cell cycle progression and promotes the formation of the cyclin E-CDK2-p27 protein complex. Our results show that HCB stimulates cell proliferation through cell cycle modulation and c-Src involvement in MCF-7 cells. Here, we report for the first time that differential mechanisms of action of HCB on mammary cell cycle progression are triggered at different concentrations of this pollutant.
28215104	Increased Eps15 homology domain 1 and RAB11FIP3 expression regulate breast cancer progression via promoting epithelial growth factor receptor recycling.	Recent research indicates that the C-terminal Eps15 homology domain 1 is associated with epithelial growth factor receptor-mediated endocytosis recycling in non-small-cell lung cancer. The aim of this study was to determine the clinical significance of Eps15 homology domain 1 gene expression in relation to phosphorylation of epithelial growth factor receptor expression in patients with breast cancer. Primary breast cancer samples from 306 patients were analyzed for Eps15 homology domain 1, RAB11FIP3, and phosphorylation of epithelial growth factor receptor expression via immunohistochemistry. The clinical significance was assessed via a multivariate Cox regression analysis, Kaplan-Meier curves, and the log-rank test. Eps15 homology domain 1 and phosphorylation of epithelial growth factor receptor were upregulated in 60.46% (185/306) and 53.92% (165/306) of tumor tissues, respectively, as assessed by immunohistochemistry. The statistical correlation analysis indicated that Eps15 homology domain 1 overexpression was positively correlated with the increases in phosphorylation of epithelial growth factor receptor ( r = 0.242, p < 0.001) and RAB11FIP3 ( r = 0.165, p = 0.005) expression. The multivariate Cox proportional hazard model analysis demonstrated that the expression of Eps15 homology domain 1 alone is a significant prognostic marker of breast cancer for the overall survival in the total, chemotherapy, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (-) groups. However, the use of combined expression of Eps15 homology domain 1 and phosphorylation of epithelial growth factor receptor markers is more effective for the disease-free survival in the overall population, chemotherapy, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (-) groups. Moreover, the combined markers are also significant prognostic markers of breast cancer in the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (+), estrogen receptor (+), and estrogen receptor (-) groups. Eps15 homology domain 1 has a tumor suppressor function, and the combined marker of Eps15 homology domain 1/phosphorylation of epithelial growth factor receptor expression was identified as a better prognostic marker in breast cancer diagnosis. Furthermore, RAB11FIP3 combines with Eps15 homology domain 1 to promote the endocytosis recycling of phosphorylation of epithelial growth factor receptor.
28214786	Cost-effectiveness of risk-reducing surgeries in preventing hereditary breast and ovarian cancer.	OBJECTIVES: Risk-reducing surgeries are a feasible option for mitigating the risk in individuals with inherited susceptibility to cancer, but are the procedures cost-effective in the current health-care system in Germany? This study compared the health-care costs for bilateral risk-reducing mastectomy (BRRM) and risk-reducing (bilateral) salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO) with cancer treatment costs that could potentially be prevented. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The analysis is based on interdisciplinary consultations with individuals with a high familial risk for breast and ovarian cancer at the University Breast Center for Franconia (Germany) between 2009 and 2013 (370 consultations; 44 patients with BRCA1 mutations and 26 with BRCA2 mutations). Health-care costs for risk-reducing surgeries in BRCA mutation carriers were calculated as reimbursements in the German diagnosis-related groups (DRG) hospital pricing system. These costs for the health-care system were compared with the potential cancer treatment costs that could possibly be prevented by risk-reducing surgeries. RESULTS: Long-term health-care costs can be reduced by risk-reducing surgeries after genetic testing in BRCA mutation carriers. The health-care system in Germany would have saved euro 136,295 if BRRM had been performed and euro 791,653 if RRSO had been performed before the development of cancer in only 50% of the 70 mutation carriers seen in our center. Moreover, in patients with combined RRSO and BRRM (without breast reconstruction), one further life-year for a 40-year-old BRCA mutation carrier would cost euro 2,183. CONCLUSION: Intensive care, including risk-reducing surgeries in BRCA mutation carriers, is cost-effective from the point of view of the health-care system in Germany.
28214785	Oncoplastic breast conservation surgery is oncologically safe when compared to wide local excision and mastectomy.	BACKGROUND: Support for the oncological safety of oncoplastic breast conservation surgery (OBCS) is mostly based on evidence comparing recurrence rates after OBCS to wide local excision (WLE). However, OBCS is often indicated for larger cancers and oncological results should also be compared to patients treated with mastectomy. In this study we compared recurrence and survival following OBCS, mastectomy and WLE. METHODS: Patients treated with OBCS between 2009 and 2012 were identified from a prospectively maintained database. For comparison, consecutive patients treated with WLE or mastectomy with or without immediate reconstruction (Ms +/- IR) over the same time period were identified. Histological variables of patients were compared using Fisher Exact or Chi squared tests, and recurrence and survival were compared using Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression survival analysis. RESULTS: 980 patients' data were analysed (OBCS: n = 104; WLE: n = 558; Ms +/- IR: n = 318). Tumour size, grade, nodal status, ER, and PR expression of patients treated with OBCS were all significantly more adverse compared with patients treated with WLE (p < 0.001). These histological variables were similar in patients treated with Ms +/- IR and OBCS. 5-year local recurrence rates were similar in all three groups (WLE: 3.4 per cent, OBCS: 2 per cent, Ms +/- IR: 2.6 per cent; log rank = 0.973), while distant recurrence rates were higher after Ms +/- IR and OBCS (Ms +/- IR:13.1 per cent, OBCS:7.5 per cent, WLE:3.3 per cent; log rank: p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: OBCS is oncologically safe in patients even when histological results are similar to patients treated with Ms +/- IR.
28214594	Association between light at night, melatonin secretion, sleep deprivation, and the internal clock: Health impacts and mechanisms of circadian disruption.	Exposure to Artificial Light At Night (ALAN) results in a disruption of the circadian system, which is deleterious to health. In industrialized countries, 75% of the total workforce is estimated to have been involved in shift work and night work. Epidemiologic studies, mainly of nurses, have revealed an association between sustained night work and a 50-100% higher incidence of breast cancer. The potential and multifactorial mechanisms of the effects include the suppression of melatonin secretion by ALAN, sleep deprivation, and circadian disruption. Shift and/or night work generally decreases the time spent sleeping, and it disrupts the circadian time structure. In the long run, this desynchronization is detrimental to health, as underscored by a large number of epidemiological studies that have uncovered elevated rates of several diseases, including cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular risks, obesity, mood disorders and age-related macular degeneration. It amounts to a public health issue in the light of the very substantial number of individuals involved. The IARC has classified shift work in group 2A of "probable carcinogens to humans" since "they involve a circadian disorganization". Countermeasures to the effects of ALAN, such as melatonin, bright light, or psychotropic drugs, have been proposed as a means to combat circadian clock disruption and improve adaptation to shift and night work. We review the evidence for the ALAN impacts on health. Furthermore, we highlight the importance of an in-depth mechanistic understanding to combat the detrimental properties of exposure to ALAN and develop strategies of prevention.
28214590	Green engineered biomolecule-capped silver and copper nanohybrids using Prosopis cineraria leaf extract: Enhanced antibacterial activity against microbial pathogens of public health relevance and cytotoxicity on human breast cancer cells (MCF-7).	This research focused on green engineering and characterization of silver (PcAgNPs) and copper nanoparticles (PcCuNPs) using Prosopis cineraria (Pc) leaf extract prepared by using microwave irradiation. We studied their enhanced antimicrobial activity on human pathogens as well as cytotoxicity on breast cancer cells (MCF-7). Biofabricated silver and copper nanoparticles exhibited UV-Visible absorbance peaks at 420 nm and 575 nm, confirming the bioreduction and stabilization of nanoparticles. Nanoparticles were characterized by FTIR, XRD, FESEM, and EDX analysis. FTIR results indicated the presence of alcohols, alkanes, aromatics, phenols, ethers, benzene, amines and amides that were possibly involved in the reduction and capping of silver and copper ions. XRD analysis was performed to confirm the crystalline nature of the silver and copper nanoparticles. FESEM analysis suggested that the nanoparticles were hexagonal or spherical in shape with size ranging from 20 to 44.49 nm and 18.9-32.09 nm for AgNPs and CuNPs, respectively. EDX analysis confirmed the presence of silver and copper elemental signals in the nanoparticles. The bioengineered silver and copper nanohybrids showed enhanced antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative MDR human pathogens. MTT assay results indicated that CuNPs show potential cytotoxic effect followed by AgNPs against MCF-7 cancer cell line. IC50 were 65.27 mug/ml, 37.02 mug/ml and 197.3 mug/ml for PcAgNPs, PcCuNPs and P. cineraria leaf extracts, respectively, treated MCF-7 cells. The present investigation highlighted an effective protocol for microwave-assisted synthesis of biomolecule-loaded silver and copper nanoparticles with enhanced antibacterial and anticancer activity. Results strongly suggested that bioengineered AgNPs and CuNPs could be used as potential tools against microbial pathogens and cancer cells.
28214331	POMC maintains tumor-initiating properties of tumor tissue-derived long-term-cultured breast cancer stem cells.	The identification and understanding of the molecular network of cancer stem cells (CSCs) have had a profound impact on our view of carcinogenesis and treatment strategy. Unfortunately, a major problem is that serial passages of CSCs from clinical solid tumor specimens currently are not available in any lab, and thus, reported data are difficult to confirm and intensively interrogated. Here, we have generated two tumor tissue-derived breast CSC (BCSC) lines that showed prolonged maintenance over 20 serial passages in vitro, while retaining their tumor-initiating biological properties. We then deciphered the intrinsic mechanism using analyses of mRNA expression array profiles. It has been determined that pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) is closely related with protein phosphorylation mediated by G-protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER) in BCSC. Following, knockdown of POMC inhibits properties of mammosphere formation, CD44+ CD24- population, CD44 expression, and clonogenicity ability in BCSC. We found that inhibition of POMC attenuates phosphorylation of AKT2 and GSK3beta in BCSC. Further in vivo investigations demonstrated that POMC interference regulates proliferation of BCSC-bearing tumors. Combination of the clinical results that POMC positive expression is frequently upregulated in human breast cancer and POMC positivity correlated with a poor prognosis, POMC is a potential therapeutic target for BCSC. In conclusion, we have successfully established two long-term-cultured BCSC from clinical specimens. We further indicated that POMC acts as a potential therapeutic target and prognostic marker for future treatment of BCSC.
28214007	[Impact of Her2 and BRCA1/2 status in high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cells transplantation in the treatment of breast cancer: The Institut Paoli Calmettes' experience].	INTRODUCTION: Studies evaluating chemotherapy high dose chemotherapy with autologous haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HDC-ACSH) in the treatment of metastatic (MBC), locally advanced (LABC) and inflammatory (IBC) breast cancer have in common lack of biomarker information, in particular the HER2 status. PATIENTS AND METHODS: All consecutive female patients treated for breast cancer with HDC and AHSCT at Institut Paoli Calmettes between 2003 and 2012 were included. Patients were categorized in three subtypes based on hormonal receptor (HR) and HER2 status of the primary tumor: luminal, (HR+/HER2-), HER2 (HER2+, any HR) and triple negative (TN) (HER2- and HR-). The main objective was the analysis of overall survival (OS) according to the IHC subtypes. RESULTS: Three hundred and seventy-seven patients were included. For MBC, the TN subtype appeared to have the worst prognosis with a median OS of 19.68 months (95 % CI 11.76-44.4) compared to 44.64 months (95 % CI 40.32-67.56) for the luminal subtype and a median OS not reached for the HER2 subtype (P<0.01). For IBC, HER2 subgroup appeared to have the best prognosis with a 5-year OS of 89 % (95 % CI 64-97) compared to 57 % (95 % CI 33-76) for the TN subgroup (HR 5.38, 95 % CI 1.14-25.44; P=0.034). For CSLA, luminal subgroup appeared to have the best prognosis with a 5-year OS of 92 % (95 % CI 71-98) against 75 % (95 % CI 46-90) for HER 2 subtype and 70 % (95 %CI 97-88) for TN subtype (P=0.301). CONCLUSION: The HDC-ACSH does not change the prognosis value of IHC subtype in breast cancer patients.
28214005	[Review of national and international guidelines for sentinel lymph node biopsy and complementary axillary dissection in breast cancer].	Management of breast cancer is based on national and international guidelines. These are defined on evidence-based medicine. The main purpose of this review is to compare the different guidelines for sentinel lymph node biopsy and completion axillary dissection after positive sentinel lymph node biopsy. This review of breast cancer guidelines led to identify consensus, but in some specific situations, they differ. The guidelines cannot be applied to all clinical cases, mandatoring multidisciplinary meetings are essential.
28211299	Comparison of biodistribution profile of monoclonal antibodies nanoparticles and aptamers in rats with breast cancer.	The use of monoclonal antibodies and aptamers is growing every single day, as the use of nanoparticle systems. Although most of the products are under investigation, there are a few commercialized products available at the market, for human consume. In this study, we have compared three formulations (aptamer anti-MUC1, monoclonal antibody - Trastuzumab and monoclonal antibodies nanoparticles - PLA/PVA/MMT trastuzumab) to identify their profile as also to understand their behavior into an alive biological system. In this direction the radiolabeling of the products were done and they were all tested in animals (in vivo) in two conditions: healthy rats and breast cancer induced animals. The results showed that the nanoparticle has the better biodistribution profile, followed by the aptamer. We conclude that more studies and a global effort to elucidate the biological behavior of drugs and especially nano-drugs are necessary.
28211058	A feasibility study of a hybrid breast-immobilization system for early breast cancer in proton beam therapy.	PURPOSE: We aimed to develop a new breast-immobilizing system for proton beam therapy (PBT) of early breast cancer (EBC) that would provide the optimum breast shape during the treatment as well as increased fixation reliability by reducing the influence of respiratory movement. METHODS: The breast-immobilizing system (HyBIS; hybrid breast-immobilizing system) consists of a whole body immobilization system (WBIS), position-converting device (to change patient position), photo-scanning system, breast cup (made using a three-dimensional printer), breast cup-fitting apparatus, breast cup-holding device (to ensure the breast remains lifted in the supine position), and dedicated stretcher fixed to the WBIS (to carry the patient). We conducted a phantom experiment to evaluate the effect of the HyBIS on breast immobilization during the respiratory cycle. Thirteen markers were embedded in the right breast of a female phantom that simulated respiratory thoracic movement at an amplitude of 15 mm, and their displacements on four-dimensional computed tomography were compared between conditions with and without immobilization by HyBIS. RESULTS: When immobilization was applied with the HyBIS, breast protrusion was maintained in the phantom in the supine treatment position. The mean values of the anteroposterior, superoinferior, lateral, and three-dimensional (3D) displacement of the markers were 2.7 +/- 1.7, 0.3 +/- 0.5, 0.9 +/- 0.8, and 3.1 +/- 1.6 mm with HyBIS, and 5.5 +/- 2.9, 0.6 +/- 0.8, 0.5 +/- 0.4, and 5.6 +/- 2.9 mm without HyBIS, respectively; thus, the anteroposterior (P = 0.014) and 3D (P = 0.007) displacements significantly improved with HyBIS. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that the HyBIS can help retain the protruded breast shape in the supine position during treatment and can reduce the influence of respiratory movement. Thus, the HyBIS can help to reliably and precisely perform PBT for EBC.
28210624	RNA Sequencing Analysis Reveals Interactions between Breast Cancer or Melanoma Cells and the Tissue Microenvironment during Brain Metastasis.	Metastasis is the main cause of treatment failure and death in cancer patients. Metastasis of tumor cells to the brain occurs frequently in individuals with breast cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, or melanoma. Despite recent advances in our understanding of the causes and in the treatment of primary tumors, the biological and molecular mechanisms underlying the metastasis of cancer cells to the brain have remained unclear. Metastasizing cancer cells interact with their microenvironment in the brain to establish metastases. We have now developed mouse models of brain metastasis based on intracardiac injection of human breast cancer or melanoma cell lines, and we have performed RNA sequencing analysis to identify genes in mouse brain tissue and the human cancer cells whose expression is associated specifically with metastasis. We found that the expressions of the mouse genes Tph2, Sspo, Ptprq, and Pole as well as those of the human genes CXCR4, PLLP, TNFSF4, VCAM1, SLC8A2, and SLC7A11 were upregulated in brain tissue harboring metastases. Further characterization of such genes that contribute to the establishment of brain metastases may provide a basis for the development of new therapeutic strategies and consequent improvement in the prognosis of cancer patients.
28209555	Detection of soluble ERBB2 in breast cancer cell lysates using a combined label-free/fluorescence platform based on Bloch surface waves.	We report on the use of one-dimensional photonic crystals to detect clinically relevant concentrations of ERBB2/neu/Her2 in cell lysates. ERBB2 is a pivotal breast cancer biomarker and targetable oncogenic driver associated with aggressive breast cancer subtypes. To quantitate soluble ERBB2, we developed an optical platform that combines label-free and fluorescence detection modes. Such platform makes use of a sandwich assay in which the one-dimensional photonic crystals sustaining Bloch surface waves are tailored with a monoclonal antibody for highly specific biological recognition (BSW biochip). In a second step, a second antibody to ERBB2 quantitatively detects the bound analyte. The strategy of the present approach takes advantage of the combination of label-free and fluorescence techniques, making bio-recognition more robust and sensitive. In the fluorescence operation mode, the platform can attain the limit of detection 0.3ng/mL (1.5pM) for ERBB2 in cell lysates. Such resolution meets the international guidelines and recommendations (15ng/mL) for diagnostic ERBB2 assays that in the future may help to more precisely assign therapies counteracting cancer cell proliferation and metastatic spread.
28209156	BreastDefend enhances effect of tamoxifen in estrogen receptor-positive human breast cancer in vitro and in vivo.	BACKGROUND: Tamoxifen (TAM) has been widely used for the treatment of estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer and its combination with other therapies is being actively investigated as a way to increase efficacy and decrease side effects. Here, we evaluate the therapeutic potential of co-treatment with TAM and BreastDefend (BD), a dietary supplement formula, in ER-positive human breast cancer. METHODS: Cell proliferation and apoptosis were determined in ER-positive human breast cancer cells MCF-7 by MTT assay, quantitation of cytoplasmic histone-associated DNA fragments and expression of cleaved PARP, respectively. The molecular mechanism was identified using RNA microarray analysis and western blotting. Tumor tissues from xenograft mouse model were analyzed by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Our data clearly demonstrate that a combination of 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT) with BD lead to profound inhibition of cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis in MCF-7 cells. This effect is consistent with the regulation of apoptotic and TAM resistant genes at the transcription and translation levels. Importantly, TAM and BD co-treatment significantly enhanced apoptosis, suppressed tumor growth and reduced tumor weight in a xenograft model of human ER-positive breast cancer. CONCLUSION: BD sensitized ER-positive human breast cancer cells to 4-OHT/TAM treatment in vitro and in vivo. BreastDefend can be used in an adjuvant therapy to increase the therapeutic effect of tamoxifen in patients with ER-positive breast cancer.
28208810	Shp2 Plays a Critical Role in IL-6-Induced EMT in Breast Cancer Cells.	Accumulative evidence demonstrates that the protein tyrosine phosphatase Shp2 functions as a powerful tumor promoter in many types of cancers. Abnormal expression of Shp2 has been implicated in many human malignancies. Overexpression of Shp2 in cancer tissues is correlated with cancer metastasis, resistance to targeted therapy, and poor prognosis. The well-known function of Shp2 is its positive role in regulating cellular signaling initiated by growth factors and cytokines, including interleukin-6 (IL-6). Several recent studies have shown that Shp2 is required for epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), triggered by growth factors. However, whether Shp2 is involved in IL-6-signaling-promoted breast cancer EMT and progression, remains undefined. In this study, we showed that exogenous and endogenous IL-6 can enhance breast cancer invasion and migration, through the promotion of EMT. IL-6 also induces the activation of Erk1/2 and the phosphorylation of Shp2. Knockdown of Shp2 attenuated the IL-6-induced downregulation of E-cadherin, as well as IL-6-promoted cell migration and invasion. Moreover, by using Shp2 phosphatase mutants, phosphor-tyrosine mimicking, and deficiency mutants, we provided evidence that the phosphatase activity of Shp2 and its tyrosine phosphorylation, are necessary for the IL-6-induced downregulation of E-cadherin and the phosphorylation of Erk1/2. Our findings uncover an important function that links Shp2 to IL-6-promoted breast cancer progression.
28208771	Detecting Blood-Based Biomarkers in Metastatic Breast Cancer: A Systematic Review of Their Current Status and Clinical Utility.	Reviews on circulating biomarkers in breast cancer usually focus on one single biomarker or a selective group of biomarkers. An overview summarizing the discovery and evaluation of all blood-based biomarkers in metastatic breast cancer is lacking. This systematic review aims to identify the available evidence of known blood-based biomarkers in metastatic breast cancer, regarding their clinical utility and state-of-the-art position in the validation process. The initial search yielded 1078 original studies, of which 420 were assessed for eligibility. A total of 320 studies were included in the final synthesis. A Development, Evaluation and Application Chart (DEAC) of all biomarkers was developed. Most studies focus on identifying new biomarkers and search for relations between these biomarkers and traditional molecular characteristics. Biomarkers are usually investigated in only one study (68.8%). Only 9.8% of all biomarkers was investigated in more than five studies. Circulating tumor cells, gene expression within tumor cells and the concentration of secreted proteins are the most frequently investigated biomarkers in liquid biopsies. However, there is a lack of studies focusing on identifying the clinical utility of these biomarkers, by which the additional value still seems to be limited according to the investigated evidence.
28208769	Localisation Microscopy of Breast Epithelial ErbB-2 Receptors and Gap Junctions: Trafficking after gamma-Irradiation, Neuregulin-1beta, and Trastuzumab Application.	In cancer, vulnerable breast epithelium malignance tendency correlates with number and activation of ErbB receptor tyrosine kinases. In the presented work, we observe ErbB receptors activated by irradiation-induced DNA injury or neuregulin- 1 beta application, or alternatively, attenuated by a therapeutic antibody using high resolution fluorescence localization microscopy. The gap junction turnover coinciding with ErbB receptor activation and co-transport is simultaneously recorded. DNA injury caused by 4 Gray of 6 MeV photon gamma -irradiation or alternatively neuregulin- 1 beta application mobilized ErbB receptors in a nucleograde fashion-a process attenuated by trastuzumab antibody application. This was accompanied by increased receptor density, indicating packing into transport units. Factors mobilizing ErbB receptors also mobilized plasma membrane resident gap junction channels. The time course of ErbB receptor activation and gap junction mobilization recapitulates the time course of non-homologous end-joining DNA repair. We explain our findings under terms of DNA injury-induced membrane receptor tyrosine kinase activation and retrograde trafficking. In addition, we interpret the phenomenon of retrograde co-trafficking of gap junction connexons stimulated by ErbB receptor activation.
28208642	Photoluminescent Gold Nanoclusters in Cancer Cells: Cellular Uptake, Toxicity, and Generation of Reactive Oxygen Species.	In recent years, photoluminescent gold nanoclusters have attracted considerable interest in both fundamental biomedical research and practical applications. Due to their ultrasmall size, unique molecule-like optical properties, and facile synthesis gold nanoclusters have been considered very promising photoluminescent agents for biosensing, bioimaging, and targeted therapy. Yet, interaction of such ultra-small nanoclusters with cells and other biological objects remains poorly understood. Therefore, the assessment of the biocompatibility and potential toxicity of gold nanoclusters is of major importance before their clinical application. In this study, the cellular uptake, cytotoxicity, and intracellular generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) of bovine serum albumin-encapsulated (BSA-Au NCs) and 2-(N-morpholino) ethanesulfonic acid (MES)capped photoluminescent gold nanoclusters (Au-MES NCs) were investigated. The results showed that BSA-Au NCs accumulate in cells in a similar manner as BSA alone, indicating an endocytotic uptake mechanism while ultrasmall Au-MES NCs were distributed homogeneously throughout the whole cell volume including cell nucleus. The cytotoxicity of BSA-Au NCs was negligible, demonstrating good biocompatibility of such BSA-protected Au NCs. In contrast, possibly due to ultrasmall size and thin coating layer, Au-MES NCs exhibited exposure time-dependent high cytotoxicity and higher reactivity which led to highly increased generation of reactive oxygen species. The results demonstrate the importance of the coating layer to biocompatibility and toxicity of ultrasmall photoluminescent gold nanoclusters.
28208082	Cognitive impairment in the first year after breast cancer diagnosis: A prospective cohort study.	OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to assess the relation between cancer treatments and incident cognitive impairment in breast cancer patients, taking into account the levels of anxiety before treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study with 418 newly diagnosed breast cancer patients with no cognitive impairment, defined as values at least 1.5 standard deviations below age- and education-adjusted cut-offs in the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), at baseline. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and MoCA were used for evaluations before treatment and at 1-year after diagnosis. We used Poisson regressions to compute adjusted relative risks (RR) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) to identify predictors of cognitive impairment. RESULTS: The median (Percentile 25, Percentile 75) MoCA score before treatment was 24 (21, 26). A total of 8.1% (95%CI: 5.8, 11.2) of the patients presented incident cognitive impairment during the follow-up. There was a statistically significant interaction between anxiety at baseline and the effect of chemotherapy on the incidence of cognitive impairment (P for interaction = 0.028). There was a significantly increased risk of incident cognitive impairment among patients with no anxiety prior to treatment with schemes including doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (adjusted RR = 4.22, 95%CI: 1.22, 14.65). CONCLUSION: There was a statistically significant association between chemotherapy and cognitive impairment, but only among women with no anxiety at baseline.
28207532	Synchronous papillary thyroid carcinoma and breast ductal carcinoma: A rare case report and literature review.	BACKGROUND: The incidences of both thyroid cancer and breast cancer have been rising in recent years; however, it is very rare to find a single person with both of these cancers. Only a few cases of synchronous thyroid and breast cancer have been published, and even fewer cases have been reported in older patients (>60 years). CASE SUMMARY: The current study presents a case of synchronous papillary thyroid carcinoma and breast ductal carcinoma in an elderly patient. The patient first underwent a mastectomy and axillary lymphadenectomy in our department, followed by a total thyroidectomy and lymphadenectomy of the left lateral region of the neck 1 month later. Postoperative pathological examination identified invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast and papillary carcinoma of the thyroid. Over almost half a year of follow-up, the patient has exhibited no evidence of recurrence or metastasis, as demonstrated by careful ultrasound examinations. Herein, we not only report this case but also present a systematic review of the causes, diagnosis, and treatment of synchronous breast and thyroid cancer. CONCLUSION: Although synchronous primary tumors of the thyroid and breast are very rare, they remain a possibility; therefore, more attention should be paid to these cases.
28207530	Can quality of recovery be enhanced by premedication with midazolam?: A prospective, randomized, double-blind study in females undergoing breast surgery.	BACKGROUND: Preoperative anxiety is known to be related with the postoperative outcomes, although it remains unclear whether pharmacologic anxiolysis preoperatively leads to better postanesthesia recovery. Hence, the purpose of this study was to assess whether midazolam premedication would result in improved Quality of Recovery-40 survey scores, as a postoperative recovery parameter, in female patients undergoing mastectomy. METHODS: This randomized double-blind study was performed at Severance Hospital, Yonsei University Health System, Seoul, Republic of Korea. Eighty-two females undergoing breast cancer surgery with propofol-remifentanil anesthesia were enrolled and randomized to receive midazolam 0.02 mg kg (group M) or saline (group C). Anesthesia was conducted with total intravenous anesthesia using propofol and remifentanil. On postoperative day 1, the Quality of Recovery-40 survey scores were surveyed. RESULTS: The global Quality of Recovery-40 survey scores on postoperative day 1 did not significantly differ between groups M and C (183 vs 181, P = 0.568). However, the induction time was significantly shorter in group M (3.2 vs 4.5 min, P < 0.001), as was the total intraoperative propofol consumption (705 vs 1004 mg; P = 0.022). CONCLUSION: Midazolam premedication does not seem to improve the postoperative quality of recovery, though group M showed faster induction and less propofol consumption.
28202066	Mitotic counts in breast cancer should be standardized with a uniform sample area.	BACKGROUND: Mitotic rate is routinely assessed in breast cancer cases and based on the assessment of 10 high power fields (HPF), a non-standard sample area, as per the College of American Pathologists cancer checklist. The effect of sample area variation has not been assessed. METHODS: A computer model making use of the binomial distribution was developed to calculate the misclassification rate in 1,000,000 simulated breast specimens using the extremes of field diameter (FD) and mitotic density cutoffs (3 and 8 mitoses/mm2), and for a sample area of 5 mm2. Mitotic counts were assumed to be a random sampling problem using a mitotic rate distribution derived from an experimental study (range 0-16.4 mitoses/mm2). The cellular density was 2500 cell/mm2. RESULTS: For the smallest microscopes (FD = 0.40 mm, area 1.26 mm2) 16% of cases were misclassified, compared to 9% of the largest (FD 0.69 mm, area 3.74 mm2), versus 8% for 5 mm2. An excess of 27% of score 2 cases were misclassified as 1 or 3 for the lower FD. CONCLUSION: Mitotic scores based on ten HPFs of a small field area microscope are less reliable measures of the mitotic density than in a bigger field area microscope; therefore, the sample area should be standardized. When mitotic counts are close to the cut-offs the score is less reproducible. These cases could benefit from using larger sample areas. A measure of mitotic density variation due to sampling may assist in the interpretation of the mitotic score.
28199152	Can Radiologists Predict the Presence of Ductal Carcinoma In Situ and Invasive Breast Cancer?	OBJECTIVE: We hypothesize that radiologists' estimated percentage likelihood assessments for the presence of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and invasive cancer may predict histologic outcomes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two hundred fifty cases categorized as BI-RADS category 4 or 5 at four University of California Medical Centers were retrospectively reviewed by 10 academic radiologists with a range of 1-39 years in practice. Readers assigned BI-RADS category (1, 2, 3, 4a, 4b, 4c, or 5), estimated percentage likelihood of DCIS or invasive cancer (0-100%), and confidence rating (1 = low, 5 = high) after reviewing screening and diagnostic mammograms and ultrasound images. ROC curves were generated. RESULTS: Sixty-two percent (156/250) of lesions were benign and 38% (94/250) were malignant. There were 26 (10%) DCIS, 20 (8%) invasive cancers, and 48 (19%) cases of DCIS and invasive cancer. AUC values were 0.830-0.907 for invasive cancer and 0.731-0.837 for DCIS alone. Sensitivity of 82% (56/68), specificity of 84% (153/182), positive predictive value (PPV) of 66% (56/85), negative predictive value (NPV) of 93% (153/165), and accuracy of 84% ([56 + 153]/250) were calculated using an estimated percentage likelihood of 20% or higher as the prediction threshold for invasive cancer for the radiologist with the highest AUC (0.907; 95% CI, 0.864-0.951). Every 20% increase in the estimated percentage likelihood of invasive cancer increased the odds of invasive cancer by approximately two times (odds ratio, 2.4). For DCIS, using a threshold of 40% or higher, sensitivity of 81% (21/26), specificity of 79% (178/224), PPV of 31% (21/67), NPV of 97% (178/183), and accuracy of 80% ([21 + 178]/250) were calculated. Similarly, these values were calculated at thresholds of 2% or higher (BI-RADS category 4) and 95% or higher (BI-RADS category 5) to predict the presence of malignancy. CONCLUSION: Using likelihood estimates, radiologists may predict the presence of invasive cancer with fairly high accuracy. Radiologist-assigned estimated percentage likelihood can predict the presence of DCIS, albeit with lower accuracy than that for invasive cancer.
28198519	Correlation of hypoxia inducible transcription factor in breast cancer and SUVmax of F-18 FDG PET/CT.	BACKGROUND: Tumor hypoxia induces the expression of several genes via the hypoxia-inducible transcription factor-1 alpha (HIF-1a). It is associated with the prognosis of several cancers. We studied the immunohistochemical expression of HIF-1a in patients with invasive ductal cancer (IDC) of the breast and the possible correlation with the maximum standardized uptake value of the primary tumor (pSUVmax) as well as other biological parameters. Prognostic significance of pSUVmax and expression of HIF-1a for the prediction of progression-free survival (PFS) was also assessed. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Two-hundred seven female patients with IDC who underwent pretreatment fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (F-18 FDG PET/CT) were enrolled. The pSUVmax was compared with clinicopathological parameters including estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), axillary lymph node (LN) metastasis, stage and HIF-1a expression. The prognostic value of pSUVmax for PFS was assessed using the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: pSUVmax was significantly higher in patients with HIF-1a expression >/= 2 compared to patients with HIF-1a expression < 2 (5.2 +/- 4.5 vs. 3.7 +/- 3.1, p = 0.008). pSUVmax was also significantly higher in higher stage (p < 0.000001), ER-negative tumors (p < 0.0001), PR-negative tumors (p = 0.0011) and positive LN metastasis (p = 0.0013). pSUVmax was significantly higher in patients with progression compared to patients who were disease-free (6.8 +/- 4.4 vs. 4.1 +/- 3.7, p = 0.0005). A receiver-operating characteristic curve demonstrated a pSUVmax of 6.51 to be the optimal cutoff for predicting PFS (sensitivity: 53.6%, specificity: 86.0%). Patients with high pSUVmax (> 6.5) had significantly shorter PFS compared to patients with low pSUVmax (p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: pSUVmax on pretreatment F-18 FDG PET/ CT reflect expression of HIF-1a and can be used as a good surrogate marker for the prediction of progression in patients with IDC. The amount of FDG uptake is determined by the presence of glucose metabolism and hypoxia in breast cancer cell.
28198505	Migration and invasion enhancer 1 (MIEN1) is overexpressed in breast cancer and is a potential new therapeutic molecular target.	Migration and invasion enhancer 1 (MIEN1) is a membrane-anchored protein that is highly expressed in various types of cancer, and is correlated with the PI3K/AKT pathway. The aim of this study was to investigate the expression of MIEN1 and its clinical pathological significance in breast cancer. We used immunohistochemical staining to examine the expression of MIEN1 in 40 samples of human breast cancer tissue and 10 samples taken from regions adjacent to normal breast tissue. The rate of detection of MIEN1 protein was 67.5%, which was significantly higher than that in adjacent non-cancerous breast tissue (0%, P < 0.05). The expression of MIEN1 correlated with age, World Health Organization grade, and lymph node metastasis, but not with tumor size or family history of cancer. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that patients with positive MIEN1 protein expression had a lower overall survival rate than patients who did not express MIEN1. Downregulation of MIEN1 suppressed the expression of matrix metallopeptidase 9 by downregulating the expression of protein kinase B (also known as AKT) in breast cancer cells. Our results indicate that MIEN1 overexpression may facilitate migration and invasion in breast cancer, and MIEN1 is a potential molecular target for cancer chemotherapy.
28197418	Expression of Cadherin-17 Promotes Metastasis in a Highly Bone Marrow Metastatic Murine Breast Cancer Model.	We previously established 4T1E/M3 highly bone marrow metastatic mouse breast cancer cells through in vivo selection of 4T1 cells. But while the incidence of bone marrow metastasis of 4T1E/M3 cells was high (~80%) when injected intravenously to mice, it was rather low (~20%) when injected subcutaneously. Therefore, using 4T1E/M3 cells, we carried out further in vitro and in vivo selection steps to establish FP10SC2 cells, which show a very high incidence of metastasis to lungs (100%) and spines (85%) after subcutaneous injection into mice. qRT-PCR and western bolt analysis revealed that cadherin-17 gene and protein expression were higher in FP10SC2 cells than in parental 4T1E/M3 cells. In addition, immunostaining revealed the presence of cadherin-17 at sites of bone marrow and lung metastasis after subcutaneous injection of FP10SC2 cells into mice. Suppressing cadherin-17 expression in FP10SC2 cells using RNAi dramatically decreased the cells' anchorage-independent growth and migration in vitro and their metastasis to lung and bone marrow in vivo. These findings suggest that cadherin-17 plays a crucial role in mediating breast cancer metastasis to bone marrow.
28196676	Dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) inhibitors affect ATP depletion, endogenous ROS and mediate S-phase arrest in breast cancer cells.	Dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) is the key enzyme in de novo biosynthesis of pyrimidine in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. The de novo pathway of pyrimidine biosynthesis is essential in cancer cells proliferation. Leflunomide is an approved DHODH inhibitor that has been widely used for the treatment of arthritis. Similarly, brequinar sodium is another DHODH inhibitor that showed anti-tumour effect in MC38 colon carcinoma cells when used in combination with fluorouracil. Despite the potential role of DHODH inhibitors in cancer therapy, their mechanisms of action remain obscure and await further elucidation. Here, we evaluated the effect of DHODH inhibitors on the production of ATP and ROS in sensitive and non-sensitive breast cancer cells. Subsequently, the effects of DHODH inhibitors on cell cycle as well as on signalling molecules such as p53, p65 and STAT6 were evaluated in sensitive T-47D and non-sensitive MDAMB-436 cells. The correlations between DHODH protein expression, proliferation speed and sensitivity to DHODH inhibitors were also investigated in a panel of cancer cell lines. DHODH inhibitors-sensitive T-47D and MDAMB-231 cells appeared to preserve ROS production closely to endogenous ROS level whereas the opposite was observed in non-sensitive MDAMB-436 and W3.006 cells. In addition, we observed approximately 90% of intracellular ATP depletion in highly sensitive T-47D and MDAMB-231 cells compared to non-sensitive MDAMB-436 cells. There was significant over-expression of p53, p65 and STAT6 signalling molecules in sensitive cells which may be involved in mediating the S-phase arrest in cell cycle progression. The current study suggests that DHODH inhibitors are most effective in cells that express high levels of DHODH enzyme. The inhibition of cell proliferation by these inhibitors appears to be accompanied by ROS production as well as ATP depletion. The increase in expression of signalling molecules observed may be due to pyrimidine depletion which subsequently leads to cell cycle arrest at S-phase.
28196351	Fabrication and functional attributes of lipidic nanoconstructs of lycopene: An innovative endeavour for enhanced cytotoxicity in MCF-7 breast cancer cells.	The present study investigates the anticancer efficacy of lycopene loaded lipidic nanostructured particles. With a homogenization-evaporation technique, lycopene loaded solid lipid nanoparticles (LYC-SLNs) were fabricated with different ratios of biocompatible viz. compritol ATO 888 and gelucire, and evaluated for their micromeretics properties, in vitro release, in vitro cytotoxicity, cellular uptake and apoptosis induced in MCF-7 cells. Effects of anticancer potential of LYC-SLNs on the efficacy of methotrexate (MTX), a well-established anticancer agent, was evaluated thereafter. Cell culture experiments revealed a considerably higher cellular uptake of LYC-SLNs in MCF-7 cells, as compared to the free LYC. The concentration and time dependent cell survival of MCF-7 cells was significantly reduced by LYC-SLNs, as compared to their free LYC counterparts. Additionally, the combined cytotoxicity of the LYC and its nanostructured formulation with MTX was evaluated. The results of cytotoxicity and apoptotic study revealed synergism at all-time points up to 48h. In a nutshell, the combination regimen could be promising approach to improve the therapeutic benefits of anticancer agents.
28196257	Association Between Use of a Scalp Cooling Device and Alopecia After Chemotherapy for Breast Cancer.	Importance: Chemotherapy-induced alopecia is a common and distressing adverse effect. In previous studies of scalp cooling to prevent chemotherapy-induced alopecia, conclusions have been limited. Objectives: To evaluate whether use of a scalp cooling system is associated with a lower amount of hair loss among women receiving specific chemotherapy regimens for early-stage breast cancer and to assess related changes in quality of life. Design, Setting, and Participants: A prospective cohort study conducted at 5 US medical centers of women with stage I or II breast cancer receiving adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimens excluding sequential or combination anthracycline and taxane (106 patients in the scalp cooling group and 16 in the control group; 14 matched by both age and chemotherapy regimen). The study was conducted between August 2013 and October 2014 with ongoing annual follow-up for 5 years. Exposures: Use of a scalp cooling system. Scalp cooling was initiated 30 minutes prior to each chemotherapy cycle, with scalp temperature maintained at 3 degrees C (37 degrees F) throughout chemotherapy and for 90 minutes to 120 minutes afterward. Main Outcomes and Measures: Self-estimated hair loss using the Dean scale was assessed 4 weeks after the last dose of chemotherapy by unblinded patient review of 5 photographs. A Dean scale score of 0 to 2 (</=50% hair loss) was defined as treatment success. A positive association between scalp cooling and reduced risk of hair loss would be demonstrated if 50% or more of patients in the scalp cooling group achieved treatment success, with the lower bound of the 95% CI greater than 40% of the success proportion. Quality of life was assessed at baseline, at the start of the last chemotherapy cycle, and 1 month later. Median follow-up was 29.5 months. Results: Among the 122 patients in the study, the mean age was 53 years (range, 28-77 years); 77.0% were white, 9.0% were black, and 10.7% were Asian; and the mean duration of chemotherapy was 2.3 months (median, 2.1 months). No participants in the scalp cooling group received anthracyclines. Hair loss of 50% or less (Dean score of 0-2) was seen in 67 of 101 patients (66.3%; 95% CI, 56.2%-75.4%) evaluable for alopecia in the scalp cooling group vs 0 of 16 patients (0%) in the control group (P < .001). Three of 5 quality-of-life measures were significantly better 1 month after the end of chemotherapy in the scalp cooling group. Of patients who underwent scalp cooling, 27.3% (95% CI, 18.0%-36.6%) reported feeling less physically attractive compared with 56.3% (95% CI, 31.9%-80.6%) of patients in the control group (P = .02). Of the 106 patients in the scalp cooling group, 4 (3.8%) experienced the adverse event of mild headache and 3 (2.8%) discontinued scalp cooling due to feeling cold. Conclusions and Relevance: Among women undergoing non-anthracycline-based adjuvant chemotherapy for early-stage breast cancer, the use of scalp cooling vs no scalp cooling was associated with less hair loss at 4 weeks after the last dose of chemotherapy. Further research is needed to assess outcomes after patients receive anthracycline regimens, longer-term measures of alopecia, and adverse effects. Trial Registration: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT01831024.
28196254	Effect of a Scalp Cooling Device on Alopecia in Women Undergoing Chemotherapy for Breast Cancer: The SCALP Randomized Clinical Trial.	Importance: Chemotherapy may induce alopecia. Although scalp cooling devices have been used to prevent this alopecia, efficacy has not been assessed in a randomized clinical trial. Objectives: To assess whether a scalp cooling device is effective at reducing chemotherapy-induced alopecia and to assess adverse treatment effects. Design, Setting, and Participants: Multicenter randomized clinical trial of women with breast cancer undergoing chemotherapy. Patients were enrolled from December 9, 2013, to September 30, 2016. One interim analysis was planned to allow the study to stop early for efficacy. Data reported are from the interim analysis. This study was conducted at 7 sites in the United States, and 182 women with breast cancer requiring chemotherapy were enrolled and randomized. Interventions: Participants were randomized to scalp cooling (n = 119) or control (n = 63). Scalp cooling was done using a scalp cooling device. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary efficacy end points were successful hair preservation assessed using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0 scale (grade 0 [no hair loss] or grade 1 [<50% hair loss not requiring a wig] were considered to have hair preservation) at the end of 4 cycles of chemotherapy by a clinician unaware of treatment assignment, and device safety. Secondary end points included wig use and scores on the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core 30, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and a summary scale of the Body Image Scale. Results: At the time of the interim analysis, 142 participants were evaluable. The mean (SD) age of the patients was 52.6 (10.1) years; 36% (n = 51) received anthracycline-based chemotherapy and 64% (n = 91) received taxane-based chemotherapy. Successful hair preservation was found in 48 of 95 women with cooling (50.5%; 95% CI, 40.7%-60.4%) compared with 0 of 47 women in the control group (0%; 95% CI, 0%-7.6%) (success rate difference, 50.5%; 95% CI, 40.5%-60.6%). Because the 1-tailed P value from the Fisher exact test was <.001, which crossed the superiority boundary (P = .0061), the data and safety monitoring board recommended study termination on September 26, 2016. There were no statistically significant differences in changes in any of the scales of quality of life from baseline to chemotherapy cycle 4 among the scalp cooling and control groups. Only adverse events related to device use were collected; 54 adverse events were reported in the cooling group, all grades 1 and 2. There were no serious adverse device events. Conclusions and Relevance: Among women with stage I to II breast cancer receiving chemotherapy with a taxane, anthracycline, or both, those who underwent scalp cooling were significantly more likely to have less than 50% hair loss after the fourth chemotherapy cycle compared with those who received no scalp cooling. Further research is needed to assess longer-term efficacy and adverse effects. Trial Registration: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT01986140.
28195673	Ultrasound-Enhanced siRNA Delivery Using Magnetic Nanoparticle-Loaded Chitosan-Deoxycholic Acid Nanodroplets.	Small interfering RNA (siRNA) has significant therapeutic potential but its clinical translation has been severely inhibited by a lack of effective delivery strategies. Previous work has demonstrated that perfluorocarbon nanodroplets loaded with magnetic nanoparticles can facilitate the intracellular delivery of a conventional chemotherapeutic drug. The aim of this study is to determine whether a similar agent can provide a means of delivering siRNA, enabling efficient transfection without degradation of the molecule. Chitosan-deoxycholic acid nanoparticles containing perfluoropentane and iron oxide (d 0 = 7.5 +/- 0.35 nm) with a mean hydrodynamic diameter of 257.6 +/- 10.9 nm are produced. siRNA (AllStars Hs cell death siRNA) is electrostatically bound to the particle surface and delivery to lung cancer cells and breast cancer cells is investigated with and without ultrasound exposure (500 kHz, 1 MPa peak-to-peak focal pressure, 40 cycles per burst, 1 kHz pulse repetition frequency, 10 s duration). The results show that siRNA functionality is not impaired by the treatment protocol and that the nanodroplets are able to successfully promote siRNA uptake, leading to significant apoptosis (52.4%) 72 h after ultrasound treatment.
28195109	Metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma presenting as an isolated breast mass: A diagnostic pitfall and a review of literature.	Metastases to breast are much rarer than primary breast tumors. We now present a case of 45-year-old female, who presented with an isolated breast mass. A positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) done revealed hypermetabolic right breast nodules, soft tissue deposits, and multiple nodal involvement. The biopsy from the breast and axillary lymph node showed dense lymphoid infiltrate and was interpreted initially as granulomatous inflammation. However, the lumps were hard and suspicious for primary breast cancer, so an immunohistochemistry for cytokeratin was performed which highlighted the epithelial cell clusters masked within the inflammatory infiltrate and the diagnosis of undifferentiated carcinoma, lymphoepithelioma-like was made. After the diagnosis was made, it was realized that the patient had been treated earlier for a nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). The in situ hybridization (ISH) test for Epstein-Barr virus-encoded RNA ISH was positive in the tumor cells, and hence, a diagnosis of metastatic NPC was finally made. The patient subsequently developed extensive nodal, skeletal, and soft tissue metastatic disease but was alive till September 2015. Although extremely rare, metastatic NPC can occur in the breast and the above case highlights that it mimics an inflammatory lesion. This case highlights the importance of the multidisciplinary approach for appropriate tumor diagnosis and patient management.
28195084	Calretinin expression as a reliable prognostic marker in different molecular subtypes of breast carcinoma.	BACKGROUND: Calretinin (CR), a known mesothelial marker, is expressed in both epithelial and mesenchymal malignancies including breast cancer. AIMS: We aimed to measure the frequency of CR expression in correlation with other clinicopathological parameters of different molecular subtypes of invasive breast carcinoma and to study its prognostic implications in this common cancer. STUDY DESIGN: Tissue microarrays were constructed from 225 tissue samples of breast carcinoma cases. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Immunostaining for CR in addition to estrogen receptors, progesterone receptors, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), epidermal growth factor receptor, CK5/6, and Ki-67 for molecular subtyping. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: Chi-square and Fisher's exact tests were done using SPSS 18.0 software (IBM Inc.). Survival data were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier test, Log-rank test, and Cox proportional hazard models. RESULTS: Cases of invasive breast carcinomas with different grades were classified into 84 luminal A, 45 luminal B, 27 HER2 positive, 40 basal-like, and 29 unclassified. High CR expression was associated with tumors of high grade (P < 0.0001), high locoregional recurrence (P = 0.005), hormonal receptors negative, and high Ki-67 indices. They frequently display a basal-like phenotype (70%, P < 0.0001), HER2 (59.3%), and luminal B (33.3%) tumors compared to luminal A (9.5%) and unclassified subtypes (17.2%). Moreover, it is associated with poor overall patient survival (P = 0.034), but it does not affect disease-free survival. CONCLUSIONS: Calretinin could be a reliable predictor marker of adverse prognosis in breast cancer.
28193572	Systematic review of early and long-term outcome of liver resection for metastatic breast cancer: Is there a survival benefit?	BACKGROUND: Isolated liver metastases occur rarely in patients with metastatic breast cancer. The success of liver resection (LR) for other metastatic disease has led centres to explore the option of LR for patients with isolated breast cancer liver metastases (BCLM). A number of small series have been published in the literature, however the evidence is conflicting. This study aimed to systematically review the literature to determine the perioperative outcome and survival of patients undergoing LR for BCLM. METHODS: An electronic search of Medline and Embase databases was performed to identify all published series. Patient demographics, management, peri-operative outcome and overall survival (OS) were obtained. RESULTS: A total of 1705 articles were identified of which 531 included patients with non-colorectal and non-neuroendocrine metastases. 43 articles including 1686 patients, met all the inclusion and exclusion criteria. R0 resection was achieved in 83% (683/825). Morbidity and 30-day mortality rates were 20% (174/852) and 0.7% (6/918), respectively. The median OS was 36 months (12-58 months). The median 1-, 3-and 5-year OS were 90%, 56% and 37%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: LR for BCLM can be carried out with acceptable peri-operative risks in selected patients with survival outcomes that appear to be superior to chemotherapy alone.
28193571	Outcomes and utilization of postmastectomy radiotherapy for T3N0 breast cancers.	BACKGROUND: The role of postmastectomy radiotherapy (PMRT) for women with pT3N0M0 breast cancer is controversial. We sought to determine the benefit of PMRT in this cohort using the National Cancer Database (NCDB). METHODS: We analyzed women with pT3N0M0 breast cancer who received mastectomy with or without PMRT between 2004 and 2012. We excluded men, women </=18 years, neoadjuvant or unknown radiation or chemotherapy status, unknown estrogen or progesterone receptor status, unknown surgical margin status, histology other than invasive ductal or lobular carcinoma, and if death occurred <3 months after diagnosis. A total of 4291 patients was included for analysis. Chi-squared analysis was used to compare patient characteristics. Univariate (UVA) and multivariate (MVA) Cox proportional hazards modeling was used to identify factors associated with survival. Propensity score matching was performed to address confounding variables. Survival analysis was performed using Kaplan-Meier and shared frailty models. RESULTS: Of the 4291 women analyzed, 2030 (47%) received PMRT. On MVA, PMRT (HR 0.72, p < 0.001), chemotherapy (HR 0.51, p < 0.001), and hormone therapy (HR 0.63, p < 0.001) were associated with improved overall survival (OS). After propensity score matching, a matched cohort of 2800 women was analyzed. At 5 years, OS was 83.7% and 79.8% with and without PMRT, respectively (p < 0.001). This difference in OS benefit increased with time. At 10 years, OS was 67.4% and 59.2% with and without PMRT, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: PMRT was associated with improved OS in women with pT3N0M0 breast cancer, which strongly suggests PMRT may provide a survival advantage and should be considered.
28192709	Tetrazolylmethyl quinolines: Design, docking studies, synthesis, anticancer and antifungal analyses.	A new series of 2,5 and 1,5-regioisomers of the tetrazolyl group viz., 3-[(5-benzyl/benzylthio-2H-tetrazol-2-yl) methyl]-2-chloro-6-substituted quinoline 6h-q and 3-[(5-benzyl/benzylthio-1H-tetrazol-1-yl) methyl]-2-chloro-6-substituted quinolines 7h-q were synthesized. Docking studies of all these compounds with DNA as target using PDB: 1AU5 and 453D revealed that the compounds 6h and 6i act as covalent cross linker on the DNA helix of the former and intercalate the latter both with higher C score values. Another set of docking studies in the active pocket of dihydrofolate reductase and N-myristoyl transferase as targets to assess antifungal activity revealed that compounds 6k, 6l, 6p and 7q (with bromo and fluro substituents) showcases different binding modes and hydrogen bonding. Further, the compounds were screened for anticancer activity (primary cytotoxicity) against NCI-60 Human tumor cell line at a single high dose (10-5 M) concentration assay. Among the tested compounds, 6h has shown 99.28% of GI against Melanoma (SK-MEL-5) and compound 6i has shown 97.56% of GI against Breast Cancer (T-47D). Further, in vitro antifungal assay against A. fumigatus and C. albicans for these compounds 6h-q and 7h-q revealed potential to moderate activities as compared to the standard.
28192624	MR-based synthetic CT generation using a deep convolutional neural network method.	PURPOSE: Interests have been rapidly growing in the field of radiotherapy to replace CT with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), due to superior soft tissue contrast offered by MRI and the desire to reduce unnecessary radiation dose. MR-only radiotherapy also simplifies clinical workflow and avoids uncertainties in aligning MR with CT. Methods, however, are needed to derive CT-equivalent representations, often known as synthetic CT (sCT), from patient MR images for dose calculation and DRR-based patient positioning. Synthetic CT estimation is also important for PET attenuation correction in hybrid PET-MR systems. We propose in this work a novel deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) method for sCT generation and evaluate its performance on a set of brain tumor patient images. METHODS: The proposed method builds upon recent developments of deep learning and convolutional neural networks in the computer vision literature. The proposed DCNN model has 27 convolutional layers interleaved with pooling and unpooling layers and 35 million free parameters, which can be trained to learn a direct end-to-end mapping from MR images to their corresponding CTs. Training such a large model on our limited data is made possible through the principle of transfer learning and by initializing model weights from a pretrained model. Eighteen brain tumor patients with both CT and T1-weighted MR images are used as experimental data and a sixfold cross-validation study is performed. Each sCT generated is compared against the real CT image of the same patient on a voxel-by-voxel basis. Comparison is also made with respect to an atlas-based approach that involves deformable atlas registration and patch-based atlas fusion. RESULTS: The proposed DCNN method produced a mean absolute error (MAE) below 85 HU for 13 of the 18 test subjects. The overall average MAE was 84.8 +/- 17.3 HU for all subjects, which was found to be significantly better than the average MAE of 94.5 +/- 17.8 HU for the atlas-based method. The DCNN method also provided significantly better accuracy when being evaluated using two other metrics: the mean squared error (188.6 +/- 33.7 versus 198.3 +/- 33.0) and the Pearson correlation coefficient(0.906 +/- 0.03 versus 0.896 +/- 0.03). Although training a DCNN model can be slow, training only need be done once. Applying a trained model to generate a complete sCT volume for each new patient MR image only took 9 s, which was much faster than the atlas-based approach. CONCLUSIONS: A DCNN model method was developed, and shown to be able to produce highly accurate sCT estimations from conventional, single-sequence MR images in near real time. Quantitative results also showed that the proposed method competed favorably with an atlas-based method, in terms of both accuracy and computation speed at test time. Further validation on dose computation accuracy and on a larger patient cohort is warranted. Extensions of the method are also possible to further improve accuracy or to handle multi-sequence MR images.
28191469	RNA-Binding Protein Dnd1 Promotes Breast Cancer Apoptosis by Stabilizing the Bim mRNA in a miR-221 Binding Site.	RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and miRNAs are capable of controlling processes in normal development and cancer. Both of them could determine RNA transcripts fate from synthesis to decay. One such RBP, Dead end (Dnd1), is essential for regulating germ-cell viability and suppresses the germ-cell tumors development, yet how it exerts its functions in breast cancer has remained unresolved. The level of Dnd1 was detected in 21 cancerous tissues paired with neighboring normal tissues by qRT-PCR. We further annotated TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) mRNA expression profiles and found that the expression of Dnd1 and Bim is positively correlated (p = 0.04). Patients with higher Dnd1 expression level had longer overall survival (p = 0.0014) by KM Plotter tool. Dnd1 knockdown in MCF-7 cells decreased Bim expression levels and inhibited apoptosis. While knockdown of Dnd1 promoted the decay of Bim mRNA 3'UTR, the stability of Bim-5'UTR was not affected. In addition, mutation of miR-221-binding site in Bim-3'UTR canceled the effect of Dnd1 on Bim mRNA. Knockdown of Dnd1 in MCF-7 cells confirmed that Dnd1 antagonized miR-221-inhibitory effects on Bim expression. Overall, our findings indicate that Dnd1 facilitates apoptosis by increasing the expression of Bim via its competitive combining with miR-221 in Bim-3'UTR. The new function of Dnd1 may contribute to a vital role in breast cancer development.
28191467	Effects of Tibolone on the Central Nervous System: Clinical and Experimental Approaches.	Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) increases the risk of endometrial and breast cancer. A strategy to reduce this incidence is the use of tibolone (TIB). The aim of this paper was to address the effects of TIB on the central nervous system (CNS). For the present review, MEDLINE (via PubMed), LILACS (via BIREME), Ovid Global Health, SCOPUS, Scielo, and PsycINFO (ProQuest Research Library) electronic databases were searched for the results of controlled clinical trials on peri- and postmenopausal women published from 1990 to September 2016. Also, this paper reviews experimental studies performed to analyze neuroprotective effects, cognitive deficits, neuroplasticity, oxidative stress, and stroke using TIB. Although there are few studies on the effect of this hormone in the CNS, it has been reported that TIB decreases lipid peroxidation levels and improves memory and learning. TIB has important neuroprotective effects that could prevent the risk of neurodegenerative diseases in postmenopausal women as well as the benefits of HRT in counteracting hot flashes, improving mood, and libido. Some reports have found that TIB delays cognitive impairment in various models of neuronal damage. It also modifies brain plasticity since it acts as an endocrine modulator regulating neurotransmitters, Tau phosphorylation, and decreasing neuronal death. Finally, its antioxidant effects have also been reported in different animal models.
28191463	Substrate Stiffness Influences Doxorubicin-Induced p53 Activation via ROCK2 Expression.	The physical properties of the extracellular matrix (ECM), such as stiffness, are involved in the determination of the characteristics of cancer cells, including chemotherapy sensitivity. Resistance to chemotherapy is often linked to dysfunction of tumor suppressor p53; however, it remains elusive whether the ECM microenvironment interferes with p53 activation in cancer cells. Here, we show that, in MCF-7 breast cancer cells, extracellular stiffness influences p53 activation induced by the antitumor drug doxorubicin. Cell growth inhibition by doxorubicin was increased in response to ECM rigidity in a p53-dependent manner. The expression of Rho-associated coiled coil-containing protein kinase (ROCK) 2, which induces the activation of myosin II, was significantly higher when cells were cultured on stiffer ECM substrates. Knockdown of ROCK2 expression or pharmacological inhibition of ROCK decreased doxorubicin-induced p53 activation. Our results suggest that a soft ECM causes downregulation of ROCK2 expression, which drives resistance to chemotherapy by repressing p53 activation.
28189791	Enhanced apoptotic and anticancer potential of paclitaxel loaded biodegradable nanoparticles based on chitosan.	Taxanes have established and proven effectivity against different types of cancers; in particular breast cancers. However, the high hemolytic toxicity and hydrophobic nature of paclitaxel and docetaxel have always posed challenges to achieve safe and effective delivery. Use of bio-degradable materials with an added advantage of nanotechnology could possibly improve the condition so as to achieve better and safe delivery. In the present study paclitaxel loaded chitosan nanoparticles were formulated and optimized using simple w/o nanoemulsion technique. The observed average size, pdi, zeta potential, entrapment efficiency and drug loading for the optimized paclitaxel loaded chitosan nanoparticle formulation (PTX-CS-NP-10) was 226.7+/-0.70nm, 0.345+/-0.039, 37.4+/-0.77mV, 79.24+/-2.95% and 11.57+/-0.81%; respectively. Nanoparticles were characterized further for size by Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). In vitro release studies exhibited sustained release pattern and more than 60% release was observed within 24h. Enhanced in vitro anticancer activity was observed as a result of MTT assay against triple negative MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell lines. The observed IC50 values obtained for PTX-CS-NP-10 was 9.36+/-1.13muM and was almost 1.6 folds (p<0.05) less than the pure drug. Similarly, PTX-CS-NP-10 were extremely biocompatible and safe as observed for haemolytic toxicity which was almost 4 folds less (p<0.05) than the naive drug. Anticancer activity was further evaluated using flow cytometry for apoptosis. Cell apoptosis study revealed that PTX-CS-NP-10 treatment resulted into enhanced (almost double) late cell apoptosis than naive paclitaxel. Hence the developed nanoparticulate formulation not only reduced the overall toxicity but also resulted into improved anticancer efficacy of paclitaxel. It can be concluded that a robust, stable and comparatively safe nanoformulation of paclitaxel was developed, characterized and evaluated.
28189100	The impact of exercise during adjuvant radiotherapy for breast cancer on fatigue and quality of life: A systematic review and meta-analysis.	PURPOSE: Adjuvant radiation therapy (RT) in breast cancer treatment has been proven to enhance outcome, improving recurrence and mortality rates. RT, however, gives rise to unfavourable side-effects, fatigue the most frequent. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of exercise (and different exercise prescription parameters) during adjuvant RT on fatigue among breast cancer patients. Quality of life was a secondary outcome. SEARCH METHODOLOGY AND SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials that investigated the effect of exercise during adjuvant RT on fatigue for breast cancer patients were searched using MEDLINE, EMBASE, Google Scholar, CINAHL, AMED and ClinicalTrials.gov. Reference lists of included studies and relevant reviews were also checked. RESULTS: Nine studies (802 participants) were included. A meta-analysis, including results for 738 participants, revealed that exercise was statistically more effective at reducing fatigue than the control intervention (SMD - 0.46, 95%CI -0.79 to -0.14). Statistically significant benefits of supervised, combined aerobicresistance exercise on fatigue were achieved. Further research is required to confirm this finding and determine the effect of alternative exercise modes. CONCLUSIONS: Exercise during adjuvant RT can be considered beneficial in breast cancer patients. Supervised, combined aerobic-resistance exercise shows promise in alleviating fatigue with further investigation into alternative exercise modes required.
28189086	Pterocarpan scaffold: A natural lead molecule with diverse pharmacological properties.	Phytoalexins are substances produced by plants that act as potent inhibitors of pathogens. Pterocarpans are biologically active isoflavonoids most commonly found in the family Fabaceae that have the ability to act as phytoalexins. It is made up of a tetracyclic ring system possessing benzofuran-benzopyran. A very great number of pterocarpans have been isolated from natural sources and they are proved to have significant biological activities such as anti-microbial, anti-cancerous, anti-inflammatory and anti-malarial activities. Recently, pterocarpans gained lot of attention because of the broad range of anti-cancer activities in various cancer cell lines such as breast, leukemia, cervical, lung, colon and melanoma. Interestingly, pterocarpans exhibited inhibitory potency against many enzymes such as PTP1B, Neuraminidase, and alpha-glycosidase. In addition, they were shown to have anti-estrogenic and anti-diabetic activities. This review is a comprehensive inventory of the structures and sources of pterocarpans and it emphasizes on the biological evaluations of pterocarpans from various plant sources and their scope as a lead molecule.
28188941	Association Between Breast Reconstruction Surgery and Quality of Life in Iranian Breast Cancer Patients.	Breast reconstruction (BR) surgery is not common for the treatment of breast cancer in low- and middle-income countries, including Iran. We evaluated the quality of life (QoL) in Iranian breast cancer patients who underwent BR at the Cancer Institute of Iran. We compared patients who had BR with breast cancer patients who had a radical mastectomy as the control group, matched for age, and time since surgery. We interviewed the cases and controls and collected data about QoL using EORTC-Q30 and EORTC-Q23 questionnaires. We also obtained personal and clinical data for the patients and controls. We compared 61 BR and 45 radical mastectomy patients. The BR patients had a higher level of education (73.8%) than the mastectomy patients (27.3%). In addition, the BR patients had a higher employment rate (58%) than the mastectomy patients (4.4%). QoL was significantly better among BR patients compared to the control group (P<0.05). In the multivariable analyses, the BR patients had significantly lower scores of pain, fatigue, and diarrhoea than the controls. Breast cancer patients who underwent BR surgery had a higher quality of life scores in some domains compared to the radical mastectomy. Socioeconomic factors and awareness of the patients about BR was crucial for choosing BR among Iranian patients.
28187885	Automated characterization and counting of Ki-67 protein for breast cancer prognosis: A quantitative immunohistochemistry approach.	Ki-67 protein expression plays an important role in predicting the proliferative status of tumour cells and deciding the future course of therapy in breast cancer. Immunohistochemical (IHC) determination of Ki-67 score or labelling index, by estimating the fraction of Ki67 positively stained tumour cells, is the most widely practiced method to assess tumour proliferation (Dowsett et al. 2011). Accurate manual counting of these cells (specifically nuclei) due to complex and dense distribution of cells, therefore, becomes critical and presents a major challenge to pathologists. In this paper, we suggest a hybrid clustering algorithm to quantify the proliferative index of breast cancer cells based on automated counting of Ki-67 nuclei. The proposed methodology initially pre-processes the IHC images of Ki-67 stained slides of breast cancer. The RGB images are converted to grey, L*a*b*, HSI, YCbCr, YIQ and XYZ colour space. All the stained cells are then characterized by two stage segmentation process. Fuzzy C-means quantifies all the stained cells as one cluster. The blue channel of the first stage output is given as input to k-means algorithm, which provides separate cluster for Ki-67 positive and negative cells. The count of positive and negative nuclei is used to calculate the F-measure for each colour space. A comparative study of our work with the expert opinion is studied to evaluate the error rate. The positive and negative nuclei detection results for all colour spaces are compared with the ground truth for validation and F-measure is calculated. The F-measure for L*a*b* colour space (0.8847) provides the best statistical result as compared to grey, HSI, YCbCr, YIQ and XYZ colour space. Further, a study is carried out to count nuclei manually and automatically from the proposed algorithm with an average error rate of 6.84% which is significant. The study provides an automated count of positive and negative nuclei using L*a*b*colour space and hybrid segmentation technique. Computerized evaluation of proliferation index can aid pathologist in assessing breast cancer severity. The proposed methodology, further, has the potential advantage of saving time and assisting in decision making over the present manual procedure and could evolve as an assistive pathological decision support system.
28187748	Characterization of ovarian clear cell carcinoma using target drug-based molecular biomarkers: implications for personalized cancer therapy.	BACKGROUND: It has long been appreciated that different subtypes (serous, clear cell, endometrioid and mucinous) of epithelial ovarian carcinoma (EOC) have distinct pathogenetic pathways. However, clinical management, especially chemotherapeutic regimens, for EOC patients is not subtype specific. Ovarian clear cell carcinoma (CCC) is a rare histological subtype of EOC, which exhibits high rates of recurrence and low chemosensitivity. We assessed potential therapeutic targets for ovarian CCC patients through analyzing the variation of drug-based molecular biomarkers expression between ovarian CCC and high-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC). METHODS: Seven candidate drug-based molecular biomarkers, human epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2), phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome ten (PTEN), aurora kinase A (AURKA), breast cancer susceptibility gene 1 (BRCA1), breast cancer susceptibility gene 2 (BRCA2) and programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) were measured in 96 ovarian CCC and 113 HGSC by immunohistochemistry in paraffin embedded tissues. The relationship between these biomarkers and clinicopathological factors were explored. RESULTS: The expression level of four of the seven drug-based molecular biomarkers was markedly different between HGSC and CCC. High expression levels of HER2 and PD-L1 were more commonly observed in CCC patients (12.6% vs 2.7%, 21.1% vs 11.6%, P = 0.006, 0.064, respectively), while loss of BRCA1 and BRCA2 expression were more frequently occurred in HGSC patients (72.6% vs 54.3%, 89.4% vs 79.8%, P = 0.007, 0.054, respectively). Survival analysis showed that five of seven biomarkers had prognostic values but varied between subtypes. Furthermore, EGFR expressed frequently in CCC patients with endometriosis than in HGSC patients (44.4% vs 8.3%, P = 0.049). AURKA and PD-L1 correlated with the resistance to platinum-based chemotherapy in CCC patients (P = 0.043, 0.028, respectively) while no similar results were observed in HGSC patients. CONCLUSION: Ovarian CCC showed a markedly different expression map of drug-based molecular biomarkers from HGSC, which suggested a new personalized target therapy in this rare subtype.
28187373	Impact of selective use of breast MRI on surgical decision-making in women with newly diagnosed operable breast cancer.	BACKGROUND: This study evaluated the impact of breast MRI on surgical planning in selected cases of breast malignancy (invasive cancer or DCIS). MRI was used when there was ambiguity on clinical and/or conventional imaging assessment. METHODS: Consecutive women with breast malignancy undergoing breast MRI were included. Clinical, mammogram and ultrasound findings and surgical plan before and after MRI were recorded. MRI findings and histopathology results were documented and the impact of MRI on treatment planning was evaluated. RESULTS: MRI was performed in 181/1416 (12.8%) cases (invasive cancer 155/1219 (12.7%), DCIS 26/197 (13.2%)). Indications for MRI were: clinically dense breast tissue difficult to assess (n = 66; 36.5%), discordant clinical/conventional imaging assessment (n = 61; 33.7%), invasive lobular carcinoma in clinically dense breast tissue (n = 22; 12.2%), palpable/mass-forming DCIS (n = 11; 6.1%); other (n = 19; 10.5%). The recall rate for assessment of additional lesions was 35% (63/181). Additional biopsy-proven malignancy was found in 11/29 (37.9%) ipsilateral breast recalls and 8/34 (23.5%) contralateral breast recalls. MRI detected contralateral malignancy (unsuspected on conventional imaging) in 5/179 (2.8%). The additional information from MRI changed management in 69/181 (38.1%), with more unilateral surgery (wider excision or mastectomy) in 53/181 (29.3%), change to bilateral surgery in 12/181 (6.6%), less surgery in 4/181 (2.2%). Clinical examination estimated histological size within 20 mm in 57%, conventional imaging in 55% and MRI in 71%. CONCLUSION: MRI was most likely to show concordance with histopathology in the 'discordant assessment' and 'invasive lobular' groups and less likely for 'challenging clinically dense breast tissue.' MRI changed management in 69/181 (38.1%).
28186846	In Vitro Mouse and Human Serum Stability of a Heterobivalent Dual-Target Probe That Has Strong Affinity to Gastrin-Releasing Peptide and Neuropeptide Y1 Receptors on Tumor Cells.	Receptor-targeting radiolabeled molecular probes with high affinity and specificity are useful in studying and monitoring biological processes and responses. Dual- or multiple-targeting probes, using radiolabeled metal chelates conjugated to peptides, have potential advantages over single-targeting probes as they can recognize multiple targets leading to better sensitivity for imaging and radiotherapy when target heterogeneity is present. Two natural hormone peptide receptors, gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) and Y1, are specifically interesting as their expression is upregulated in most breast and prostate cancers. One of our goals has been to develop a dual-target probe that can bind both GRP and Y1 receptors. Consequently, a heterobivalent dual-target probe, t-BBN/BVD15-DO3A (where a GRP targeting ligand J-G-Abz4-QWAVGHLM-NH2 and Y1 targeting ligand INP-K [varepsilon-J-(alpha-DO3A-varepsilon-DGa)-K] YRLRY-NH2 were coupled), that recognizes both GRP and Y1 receptors was synthesized, purified, and characterized in the past. Competitive displacement cell binding assay studies with the probe demonstrated strong affinity (IC50 values given in parentheses) for GRP receptors in T-47D cells (18 +/- 0.7 nM) and for Y1 receptors in MCF7 cells (80 +/- 11 nM). As a further evaluation of the heterobivalent dual-target probe t-BBN/BVD15-DO3A, the objective of this study was to determine its mouse and human serum stability at 37 degrees C. The in vitro metabolic degradation of the dual-target probe in mouse and human serum was studied by using a 153Gd-labeled t-BBN/BVD15-DO3A and a high-performance liquid chromatography/radioisotope detector analytical method. The half-life (t1/2) of degradation of the dual-target probe in mouse serum was calculated as 7 hours and only approximately 20% degradation was seen after 6 hours incubation in human serum. The slow in vitro metabolic degradation of the dual-target probe can be compared with the degradation t1/2 of the corresponding monomeric probes, BVD15-DO3A and AMBA: 15, and approximately 40 minutes for BVD15-DO3A and 3.1 and 38.8 hours for AMBA in mouse and human serum, respectively. A possible pathway for in vitro metabolic degradation of the t-BBN/BVD15-DO3A in mouse serum is proposed based on the chromatographic retention times of the intact probe and its degradants.
28185268	Interventions for raising breast cancer awareness in women.	BACKGROUND: Breast cancer continues to be the most commonly diagnosed cancer in women globally. Early detection, diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer are key to better outcomes. Since many women will discover a breast cancer symptom themselves, it is important that they are breast cancer aware i.e. have the knowledge, skills and confidence to detect breast changes and present promptly to a healthcare professional. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness of interventions for raising breast cancer awareness in women. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Breast Cancer Group's Specialised Register (searched 25 January 2016), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2015, Issue 12) in the Cochrane Library (searched 27 January 2016), MEDLINE OvidSP (2008 to 27 January 2016), Embase (Embase.com, 2008 to 27 January 2016), the World Health Organization's International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) search portal and ClinicalTrials.gov (searched 27 Feburary 2016). We also searched the reference lists of identified articles and reviews and the grey literature for conference proceedings and published abstracts. No language restriction was applied. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) focusing on interventions for raising women's breast cancer awareness i.e. knowledge of potential breast cancer symptoms/changes and the confidence to look at and feel their breasts, using any means of delivery, i.e. one-to-one/group/mass media campaign(s). DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors selected studies, independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We reported the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for dichotomous outcomes and mean difference (MD) and standard deviation (SD) for continuous outcomes. Since it was not possible to combine data from included studies due to their heterogeneity, we present a narrative synthesis. We assessed the quality of evidence using GRADE methods. MAIN RESULTS: We included two RCTs involving 997 women: one RCT (867 women) randomised women to receive either a written booklet and usual care (intervention group 1), a written booklet and usual care plus a verbal interaction with a radiographer or research psychologist (intervention group 2) or usual care (control group); and the second RCT (130 women) randomised women to either an educational programme (three sessions of 60 to 90 minutes) or no intervention (control group). Knowledge of breast cancer symptomsIn the first study, knowledge of non-lump symptoms increased in intervention group 1 compared to the control group at two years postintervention, but not significantly (OR 1.1, 95% CI 0.7 to 1.6; P = 0.66; 449 women; moderate-quality evidence). Similarly, at two years postintervention, knowledge of symptoms increased in the intervention group 2 compared to the control group but not significantly (OR 1.4, 95% CI 0.9 to 2.1; P = 0.11; 434 women; moderate-quality evidence). In the second study, women's awareness of breast cancer symptoms had increased one month post intervention in the educational group (MD 3.45, SD 5.11; 65 women; low-quality evidence) compared to the control group (MD -0.68, SD 5.93; 65 women; P < 0.001), where there was a decrease in awareness. Knowledge of age-related riskIn the first study, women's knowledge of age-related risk of breast cancer increased, but not significantly, in intervention group 1 compared to control at two years postintervention (OR 1.8; 95% CI 0.9 to 3.5; P < 0.08; 447 women; moderate-quality evidence). Women's knowledge of risk increased significantly in intervention group 2 compared to control at two years postintervention (OR 4.8, 95% CI 2.6 to 9.0; P < 0.001; 431 women; moderate-quality evidence). In the second study, women's perceived susceptibility (how at risk they considered themselves) to breast cancer had increased significantly one month post intervention in the educational group (MD 1.31, SD 3.57; 65 women; low-quality evidence) compared to the control group (MD -0.55, SD 3.31; 65 women; P = 0.005), where a decrease in perceived susceptibility was noted. Frequency of Breast CheckingIn the first study, no significant change was noted for intervention group 1 compared to control at two years postintervention (OR 1.1, 95% CI 0.8 to 1.6; P = 0.54; 457 women; moderate-quality evidence). Monthly breast checking increased, but not significantly, in intervention group 2 compared to control at two years postintervention (OR 1.3, 95% CI 0.9 to 1.9; P = 0.14; 445 women; moderate-quality evidence). In the second study, women's breast cancer preventive behaviours increased significantly one month post intervention in the educational group (MD 1.21, SD 2.54; 65 women; low-quality evidence) compared to the control group (MD 0.15, SD 2.94; 65 women; P < 0.045). Breast Cancer AwarenessWomen's overall breast cancer awareness did not change in intervention group 1 compared to control at two years postintervention (OR 1.8, 95% CI 0.6 to 5.30; P = 0.32; 435 women; moderate-quality evidence) while overall awareness increased in the intervention group 2 compared to control at two years postintervention (OR 8.1, 95% CI 2.7 to 25.0; P < 0.001; 420 women; moderate-quality evidence). In the second study, there was a significant increase in scores on the Health Belief Model (that included the constructs of awareness and perceived susceptibility) at one month postintervention in the educational group (mean 1.21, SD 2.54; 65 women) compared to the control group (mean 0.15, SD 2.94; 65 women; P = 0.045).Neither study reported outcomes relating to motivation to check their breasts, confidence to seek help, time from breast symptom discovery to presentation to a healthcare professional, intentions to seek help, quality of life, adverse effects of the interventions, stages of breast cancer, survival estimates or breast cancer mortality rates. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Based on the results of two RCTs, a brief intervention has the potential to increase women's breast cancer awareness. However, findings of this review should be interpreted with caution, as GRADE assessment identified moderate-quality evidence in only one of the two studies reviewed. In addition, the included trials were heterogeneous in terms of the interventions, population studied and outcomes measured. Therefore, current evidence cannot be generalised to the wider context. Further studies including larger samples, validated outcome measures and longitudinal approaches are warranted.
28185165	Oncolytic viruses: emerging options for the treatment of breast cancer.	Breast cancer (BC) is the most common type of cancer among women and is the second most common cause of cancer-related deaths, following lung cancer. Severe toxicity associated with a long-term use of BC chemo- and radiotherapy makes it essential to look for newer therapeutics. Additionally, molecular heterogeneity at both intratumoral and intertumoral levels among BC subtypes is known to result in a differential response to standard therapeutics. Oncolytic viruses (OVs) have emerged as one of the most promising treatment options for BC. Many preclinical and clinical studies have shown that OVs are effective in treating BC, both as a single therapeutic agent and as a part of combination therapies. Combination therapies involving multimodal therapeutics including OVs are becoming popular as they allow to achieve the synergistic therapeutic effects, while minimizing the associated toxicities. Here, we review the OVs for BC therapy in preclinical studies and in clinical trials, both as a monotherapy and as part of a combination therapy. We also briefly discuss the potential therapeutic targets for BC, as these are likely to be critical for the development of new OVs.
28185053	Glutaminase expression is a poor prognostic factor in node-positive triple-negative breast cancer patients with a high level of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes.	Glutamine metabolism is emerging as one aspect of dysregulated metabolism of tumors. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells are glutamine dependent, whereas luminal-type cells tend to be glutamine independent. Therefore, TNBC patients might benefit from therapies targeting glutamine metabolism. To investigate the clinical significance of glutamine metabolism, we examined expression and prognostic significance of glutaminase in tumor cells and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in TNBC. We retrieved 658 surgically resected TNBCs and analyzed glutaminase expression in tumor cells and TILs by immunohistochemical staining. Glutaminase expression was observed in 237 cases (36.0%) in tumor cells and 104 cases (15.5%) in TILs. Although glutaminase expression in tumor cells was significantly associated with a low level of TILs (p = 0.018), glutaminase expression in TILs was significantly higher in cases with a high level of TILs (p = 0.031). Glutaminase expression in tumor cells was significantly associated with poor disease-free survival in patients with lymph node metastasis and high levels of TILs (p = 0.020). In addition, it was an independent poor prognostic factor (hazard ratio = 10.643, 95% confidence interval = 1.999-56.668; p = 0.006). Glutaminase expression in tumor cells was observed in a subset of TNBC patients. It was significantly associated with a low level of TILs and poor disease-free survival in TNBCs presenting with lymph node metastasis and high levels of TILs.
28184945	First description of a double heterozygosity for BRCA1 and BRCA2 pathogenic variants in a French metastatic breast cancer patient: A case report.	Hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome is an autosomal dominant disease caused primarily by germline mutations in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene. Rare cases of double heterozygosity for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations have been reported quite exceptionally in non-Ashkenazi individuals. We describe the case of a woman who developed a bilateral breast cancer, discovered concomitantly, at 46 years old. Biopsies confirmed the presence of two breast cancers with distinct histology. BRCA analysis was tested due to a positive family history of breast cancer, and two pathogenic monoallelic mutations were detected, one in the BRCA1 gene and one in the BRCA2 gene. There is no known Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry. We report the first description of a never described double heterozygosity for BRCA1 and BRCA2 pathogenic variants in a French metastatic breast cancer patient, with two distinct histology, and two distinct mutations.
28184943	Analysis of chromosomal radiosensitivity of healthy BRCA2 mutation carriers and non-carriers in BRCA families with the G2 micronucleus assay.	Breast cancer risk drastically increases in individuals with a heterozygous germline BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation, while it is estimated to equal the population risk for relatives without the familial mutation (non-carriers). The aim of the present study was to use a G2 phase-specific micronucleus assay to investigate whether lymphocytes of healthy BRCA2 mutation carriers are characterized by increased radiosensitivity compared to controls without a family history of breast/ovarian cancer and how this relates to healthy non-carrier relatives. BRCA2 is active in homologous recombination, a DNA damage repair pathway, specifically active in the late S/G2 phase of the cell cycle. We found a significantly increased radiosensitivity in a cohort of healthy BRCA2 mutation carriers compared to individuals without a familial history of breast cancer (P=0.046; Mann-Whitney U test). At the individual level, 50% of healthy BRCA2 mutation carriers showed a radiosensitive phenotype (radiosensitivity score of 1 or 2), whereas 83% of the controls showed no radiosensitivity (P=0.038; one-tailed Fisher's exact test). An odds ratio of 5 (95% CI, 1.07-23.47) indicated an association between the BRCA2 mutation and radiosensitivity in healthy mutation carriers. These results indicate the need for the gentle use of ionizing radiation for either diagnostic or therapeutic use in BRCA2 mutation carriers. We detected no increased radiosensitivity in the non-carrier relatives.
28184941	Combined effects of furanodiene and doxorubicin on the migration and invasion of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells in vitro.	Furanodiene is one of the major bioactive components isolated from the natural product of the plant, Curcuma wenyujin Y.H. Chen et C. Ling. Furanodiene has been found to exert anticancer effects in various types of cancer cell lines, as well as exhibit antimetastatic activities. However, the antimetastatic capacity of furanodiene in combination with the common chemotherapy drug doxorubicin has not been investigated. We found that doxorubicin at a non-toxic concentration induced cell migration and cell invasion in highly metastatic breast cancer cells. Combinational treatments with furanodiene and doxorubicin blocked the invasion and migration of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells in vitro. We also clarified the effects of the combination on the signaling pathways involved in migration, invasion, and cytoskeletal organization. When combined with doxorubicin, furanodiene downregulated the expression of integrin alphaV and beta-catenin and inhibited the phosphorylation of paxillin, Src, focal adhesion kinase (FAK), p85, and Akt. Moreover, combinational treatments also resulted in a decrease in matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9). Further study demonstrated that the co-treatments with furanodiene did not significantly alter the effects of doxorubicin on the tubulin cytoskeleton, represented by no influence on the expression levels of RhoA, Cdc42, N-WASP, and alpha/beta tubulin. These observations indicate that furanodiene is a potential agent that may be utilized to improve the anticancer efficacy of doxorubicin and overcome the risk of chemotherapy in highly metastatic breast cancer.
28184936	Inhibition of RAB1A suppresses epithelial-mesenchymal transition and proliferation of triple-negative breast cancer cells.	RAB1A acts as an oncogene in various cancers, and emerging evidence has verified that RAB1A is an mTORC1 activator in hepatocellular and colorectal cancer, but the role of RAB1A in breast cancer remains unclear. In this investigation, RAB1A siRNA was successfully transfected in MDA-MB-231 and BT-549 human triple-negative breast cancer cells, and verified by realtime quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blotting. Then, MTT cell proliferation, colony formation, cell invasion and wound healing assays were performed to characterize the function of RAB1A in the breast cancer cell lines. Downregulation of RAB1A inhibited cellular growth, cell migration, cell invasion and cell epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Furthermore, compared with NC siRNA transfected cells, RAB1A siRNA transfected breast cancer cells inhibited the phosphorylation of S6K1, the effector molecular of mTORC1. Collectively, our data suggested that RAB1A acts as an oncogene by regulating cellular proliferation, growth, invasion and metastasis via activation of mTORC1 pathway in triple-negative breast cancer.
28182277	Improving computer-aided detection assistance in breast cancer screening by removal of obviously false-positive findings.	PURPOSE: Computer-aided detection (CADe) systems for mammography screening still mark many false positives. This can cause radiologists to lose confidence in CADe, especially when many false positives are obviously not suspicious to them. In this study, we focus on obvious false positives generated by microcalcification detection algorithms. METHODS: We aim at reducing the number of obvious false-positive findings by adding an additional step in the detection method. In this step, a multiclass machine learning method is implemented in which dedicated classifiers learn to recognize the patterns of obvious false-positive subtypes that occur most frequently. The method is compared to a conventional two-class approach, where all false-positive subtypes are grouped together in one class, and to the baseline CADe system without the new false-positive removal step. The methods are evaluated on an independent dataset containing 1,542 screening examinations of which 80 examinations contain malignant microcalcifications. RESULTS: Analysis showed that the multiclass approach yielded a significantly higher sensitivity compared to the other two methods (P < 0.0002). At one obvious false positive per 100 images, the baseline CADe system detected 61% of the malignant examinations, while the systems with the two-class and multiclass false-positive reduction step detected 73% and 83%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed that by adding the proposed method to a CADe system, the number of obvious false positives can decrease significantly (P < 0.0002).
28181826	A new method for the prevention of skin laceration during vacuum-assisted breast biopsy.	OBJECTIVE: To describe a new technique to prevent skin laceration during ultrasound-guided vacuum-assisted breast biopsy with the insertion of a spinal needle between the mass and the skin. METHODS: The study includes 118 patients with 118 breast imaging-reporting and data system Category 3 masses located very close to the skin or areola, which were excised using the mammotome system with a spinal needle inserted just above the site of insertion of the probe. RESULTS: The mean distance between the most superficial portion of the mass to the under surface of the overlying skin was 1.3 +/- 0.4 mm. The average procedure time was 13.5 +/- 4.2 min. A complete excision was achieved in 100% of the cases, and the procedure was well tolerated by all the patients. No patient experienced serious adverse events such as a skin laceration. CONCLUSION: This is the first study to prevent skin laceration during vacuum assisted breast biopsy. Advances in knowledge: The method described in this study is simple, safe and well tolerated by patients.
28179350	Could Patients Older than 75 Years Benefit from a Systematic Breast Cancer Screening Program?	BACKGROUND/AIM: To assess prognosis of women aged 75 and older according to breast cancer (BC) diagnosis circumstances. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted in the Amiens, France, regional oncologic referral center between 2005 and 2015. Two groups were formed depending on whether the patients followed clinical manifestations (CM) or a prescribed systematic mammography (SM). RESULTS: Three hundred and ninenty-three patients were selected. CM and SM represented 72% and 14.5% of BC diagnosis circumstances, respectively. In the SM group statistically significant differences included: earlier stage cancer diagnosis (tumor stages 0 and 1 accounted for 6.3% and 61.4% of cases, respectively), less lymph node invasions (35.7% and 8.8%) and metastases (19.1% and 0%), more frequent possibility of conservative surgery (25.6% and 74.5%), improved global and disease-free survival rates (by 14.2 and 18.4 months). CONCLUSION: Screening seems to improve prognosis of older BC patients; this constitutes a strong argument for reconsidering age limits of national BC screening programs.
28179347	Dose Sparing Potential of Deep Inspiration Breath-hold Technique for Left Breast Cancer Radiotherapy Organs-at-risk.	BACKGROUND/AIM: To assess if deep inspiration breath-hold (DIBH) technique achieved dose sparing for organs-at-risk in left breast radiotherapy patients in order to reduce long-term complications. PATIENTS AND METHODS: DIBH and Free-breathing (FB) as a control, CT planning scans obtained for 28 left breast/chest wall (+/- supraclavicular field) patients treated January 2008-December 2013 were retrospectively re-contoured and re-planned. Organs-at-risk examined: lungs, left lung, heart and left anterior descending coronary artery (LADCA). Quantitative statistical analysis of plan dose differences was performed. RESULTS: Lung dose was not affected by DIBH. Heart Dmax reduced by 34.5% (FB=41.81Gy, SD=3.963Gy vs. DIBH=27.39Gy, SD=12.393Gy, p<0.000004). Heart Dmean reduced by 32.6% (FB=1.817Gy, SD=0.627Gy vs. DIBH=1.224Gy, SD=0.344Gy, p=0.00000083067. LADCA Dmax reduced by 47.8% (DIBH mean=15.56Gy, SD=10.62Gy vs. FB mean=29.82Gy, SD=10.05Gy, p=0.000031, and LADCA Dmean by 52% (DIBH mean=5.23Gy, SD=1.94Gy vs. FB mean=10.88Gy, SD=3.95Gy p=0.000000036027. Amplitude depths were not correlated with dose reductions. CONCLUSION: DIBH significantly reduces heart and LADCA dose. Further research is required to evaluate potential long-term implications for patients treated DIBH.
28179343	Role of 18F-FDG-PET/CT in Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma After Neoadjuvant Chemoradiotherapy.	AIM: The aim of this study was to assess the role of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron-emission tomography/computed tomography (FDG-PET/CT) in predicting pathological response and survival in patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty patients with advanced ESCC received nCRT followed by surgery, and underwent FDG-PET/CT twice before and after nCRT. We compared the results of FDG-PET/CT with the pathological results and prognosis. RESULTS: Pathological response was found to correlate with the maximum standardised uptake value (SUVmax) after nCRT and the rate of decrease of SUVmax Using univariate analysis, pN, SUVmax after nCRT and the rate of decrease of SUVmax were found to be prognostic factors. Multivariate analysis revealed that only pN was an independent prognostic factor. CONCLUSION: The prediction of pathological response and prognosis using FDG-PET/CT is not as reliable as pathological detection of lymph node metastasis, but could be a useful method contributing to treatment decisions.
28179336	Beck Depression Inventory as a Predictor of Long-term Outcome Among Patients Admitted to the Breast Cancer Diagnosis Unit: A 25-year Cohort Study in Finland.	AIM: The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) is one of the most widely used instruments for measuring the severity of depression. However, there has been no prospective study to investigate the long-term outcome in patients admitted to Breast Cancer Diagnosis Units. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In the Kuopio Breast Cancer Study, women with breast symptoms were evaluated for total BDI score before any diagnostic procedures were carried out. The relapse-free survival (RFS) was calculated from the time of diagnosis to the time of first relapse including local relapse, contralateral breast cancer (BC) or metastatic disease. The overall survival (OS) was assessed as the time from the date of diagnosis to the date of last follow-up or death of the patient. The effect of the BDI on the RFS and on the OS were calculated by the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and the difference between the groups was assessed by the log-rank test. The RFS and OS was estimated for the study groups with a low BDI score (<8) versus those with a high BDI score (>/=8). The end-point of our study was to determine differences in long-term outcome and in BDI score in individuals with BC, benign breast disease (BBD) and in healthy study subjects (HSS). RESULTS: In the Cox proportional hazard model, the total BDI score significantly predicted the 25-year RFS and OS in the HSS, BBD and BC groups combined (Hazard Ratio=1.87, p=0.039; Hazard Ratio=1.98, p=0.048, respectively), and in the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis with the log-rank test, the total BDI score predicted the 25-year RFS and OS in the HSS, BBD and BC groups combined (p=0.043; p=0.036, respectively). CONCLUSION: The BDI is a significant predictor of long-term outcome among patients admitted to the Breast Cancer Diagnosis Unit in Finland.
28179319	Adipose Triglyceride Lipase (ATGL) Expression Is Associated with Adiposity and Tumor Stromal Proliferation in Patients with Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma.	BACKGROUND: Obesity is an established risk factor for the development of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). However, the pathophysiology of how increased adiposity increases the risk for PDAC has not been fully elucidated. Adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) is a lipase that catabolizes triglyceride hydrolysis and has been implicated in the development of breast cancer. We hypothesized that overweight patients with PDAC would demonstrate higher tumor ATGL expression compared to non-overweight patients with PDAC. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Immunohistochemical analysis for ATGL expression was performed on PDAC tissues from 44 patients after Whipple procedure or distal pancreatectomy. Correlation of ATGL expression with clinicopathological features was evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 23/44 (52.2%) PDACs showed low level ATGL immunoreactivity, while 21/44 (47.8%) showed a high level, with moderate to strong positive ATGL immunoreactivity in more than 50% of the tumor cells. Chi-squared testing revealed a statistically significant association between high ATGL expression and both BMI >25 kg/m2 (chi2=5.74, p=0.017) and increased tumor stroma (chi2=19.14, p<0.001). Chi-squared testing failed to reveal a statistically significant association when comparing ATGL expression by lymph node metastasis, histological grade, tumor size, patient age, patient sex and presence of fat invasion. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that increased ATGL expression is associated with increased adiposity and stromal proliferation in patients with PDAC, making it a possible key protein in how obesity increases the risk of PDAC.
28179314	DNA Methylation in Breast Tumor from High-risk Women in the Breast Cancer Family Registry.	To examine DNA methylation profiles in breast tumors of women with a strong breast cancer family history, we measured methylation by bisulfite sequencing in 40 genes in 40 breast tumor tissues from women in the Breast Cancer Family Registry. We selected candidate genes from analysis of the Cancer Genome Atlas project (TCGA) breast data. Compared to TCGA breast cancer, BCFR cases are younger and more likely to be ER-negative. Overall, we found that many of the methylation differences between BCFR tumor and normal adjacent tissues were smaller than that in TCGA samples. We found only 32% of tested genes were hypermethylated in BCFR; the largest difference was 36.1% for SEPW1, and the smallest difference was 10% for RYR2. These data suggest the importance of examining breast cancer cases including familial cases enriched with early-onset cancers to identify methylation markers that can be examined in blood as biomarkers for early detection.
28179302	CD24 Modulates Chemosensitivity of MCF-7 Breast Cancer Cells.	The role of cluster of differentiation (CD) 24 in breast cancer remains unclear; previously, we showed that CD24 suppresses malignant phenotypes by inactivating Hedgehog signaling through signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 1 inhibition. In this study, we examined how CD24 affects chemosensitivity in breast cancer cells. The CD44+CD24+ breast cancer cell line MCF-7 was transfected with CD24 with/without STAT1 siRNA, and chemosensitivity to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and cis-diamminedichloroplatinum (CDDP) was measured. CD24 inhibition reduced chemosensitivity to 5-FU, while STAT1 inhibition did not affect chemosensitivity to 5-FU in CD24 siRNA-transfected cells. Conversely, CD24 inhibition did not affect chemosensitivity to CDDP, while STAT1 inhibition reduced chemosensitivity to CDDP in CD24 siRNA-transfected cells. STAT1 inhibition, but not CD24 inhibition, reduced expression of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter genes, ABCB1 and ABCG2. In conclusion, CD24 inhibition may modulate chemosensitivity according to drug type, but ABC transporter expression appears not to contribute to this mechanism. This study contributes to determining the role of CD24 in breast cancer.
28178952	Study of phytochemical, anti-microbial, anti-oxidant, and anti-cancer properties of Allium wallichii.	BACKGROUND: There is growing interest in the use of plants for the treatment and prevention of cancer. Medicinal plants are currently being evaluated as source of promising anticancer agents. In this paper, we have investigated the anticancer potential of plant Allium wallichii, a plant native to Nepal and growing at elevations of 2300-4800 m. This is the first study of its kind for the plant mentioned. METHODS: The dried plant was extracted in aqueous ethanol. Phytochemical screening, anti-microbial assay, anti-oxidant assay, cytotoxicity assay and the flow-cytometric analysis were done for analyzing different phytochemicals present, anti-microbial activity, anti-oxidant activity and anti-cancer properties of Allium wallichii. RESULTS: We observed the presence of steroids, terpenoids, flavonoids, reducing sugars and glycosides in the plant extract and the plant showed moderate anti-microbial and anti-oxidant activity. The IC50 values of Allium wallichii in different cancer cell lines are 69.69 mug/ml for Prostate cancer (PC3) cell line, 55.29 mug/ml for Breast Cancer (MCF-7) cell line and 46.51 mug/ml for cervical cancer (HeLa) cell line as compared to Doxorubicin (0.85 mug/ml). The cell viability assay using FACS showed that the IC50value of Allium wallichii for Burkitt's lymphoma (B-Lymphoma) cell line was 3.817 +/- 1.99 mg/ml. CONCLUSIONS: Allium wallichii can be an important candidate to be used as an anticancer agent. Separation of pure compounds with bioassay guided extraction, spectrometric analysis and subsequent cytotoxicity assay of the pure bioactive compounds from Allium wallichii is highly recommended as the crude extract itself showed promising cytotoxicity.
28178722	Differential Gene Expression in Ductal Carcinoma In Situ of the Breast Based on ERBB2 Status.	BACKGROUND: The molecular signature of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) in the breast is not well understood. Erb-b2 receptor tyrosine kinase 2 (ERBB2 [formerly known as HER2/neu]) positivity in DCIS is predictive of coexistent early invasive breast carcinoma. The aim of this study is to identify the gene-expression signature profiles of estrogen receptor (ER)/progesterone receptor (PR)-positive, ERBB2, and triple-negative subtypes of DCIS. METHODS: Based on ER, PR, and ERBB2 status, a total of 18 high nuclear grade DCIS cases with no evidence of invasive breast carcinoma were selected along with 6 non-neoplastic controls. The 3 study groups were defined as ER/PR-positive, ERBB2, and triple-negative subtypes. RESULTS: A total of 49 genes were differentially expressed in the ERBB2 subtype compared with the ER/PR-positive and triple-negative groups. PROM1 was overexpressed in the ERBB2 subtype compared with ER/PR-positive and triple-negative subtypes. Other genes differentially expressed included TAOK1, AREG, AGR3, PEG10, and MMP9. CONCLUSIONS: Our study identified unique gene signatures in ERBB2-positive DCIS, which may be associated with the development of invasive breast carcinoma. The results may enhance our understanding of the progression of breast cancer and become the basis for developing new predictive biomarkers and therapeutic targets for DCIS.
28178714	Liver-Directed Embolization for the Long-Term Control of Hypercalcemia of Malignancy in Metastatic Breast Cancer.	Hypercalcemia of malignancy is a common complication of certain types of cancers. No standard therapies exist for the treatment of hypercalcemia secondary to paraneoplastic syndromes that result in the long-term control of serum calcium levels. We report a case of metastatic breast cancer with parathyroid hormone-related protein associated with hypercalcemia of malignancy that was treated with transarterial embolization of the hepatic metastatic lesions.
28178709	Neoplastic Meningitis Due to Lung, Breast, and Melanoma Metastases.	BACKGROUND: Neoplastic meningitis, a central nervous system (CNS) complication of cancer metastatic to the meninges and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), is relevant to oncologists due to the impact of the disease on patient quality of life and survival rates. METHODS: A review of the literature of articles published in English was conducted with regard to neoplastic meningitis. RESULTS: The incidence of neoplastic meningitis is increasing because patients with cancer are surviving longer in part because of the use of novel therapies with poor CNS penetration. Up to 5% of patients with solid tumors develop neoplastic meningitis during the disease course (breast cancer, lung cancer, and melanoma being the predominantly causative cancers). The rate of median survival in patients with untreated neoplastic meningitis is 1 to 2 months, although it can be as long as 5 months in some cases. Therapeutic options for the treatment of neoplastic meningitis include systemic therapy (cancer-specific, CNS-penetrating chemotherapy or targeted therapies), intra-CSF administration of chemotherapy (methotrexate, cytarabine, thiotepa) and CNS site-specific radiotherapy. Determining whom to treat with neoplastic meningitis remains challenging and, in part, relates to the extent of systemic disease, the neurological burden of disease, the available systemic therapies, and estimated rates of survival. CONCLUSIONS: The prognosis of neoplastic meningitis remains poor. The increasing use of novel, targeted therapies and immunotherapy in solid tumors and its impact on neoplastic meningitis remains to be determined and is an area of active research. Thus, well conducted trials are needed.
28178621	Changes of serum miR34a expression during neoadjuvant chemotherapy predict the treatment response and prognosis in stage II/III breast cancer.	OBJECTIVE: To investigate the predictive value of serum miR34a (ser-miR34a) expression for the neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) response and prognosis in breast cancer patients. METHODS: This study included 86 diagnosed stage II/III breast cancer patients and 20 healthy volunteers. Peripheral blood from every participant was collected before the start, at the end of the second cycle, and at the end of NACT. The expression of ser-miR34a was examined by qRT-PCR and its association with the chemotherapy response and prognosis was analyzed. RESULTS: The expression of ser-miR34a in breast cancer patients before NACT was significant higher than that of healthy volunteers. During the NACT, the changes in ser-miR34a expression were significantly associated with treatment response and disease-free survival (DFS). In responding patients, ser-miR34a levels at the end of the second cycle and at the end of NACT were significantly lower than before NACT (P=0.016 and P=0.002, respectively), and in non-responding patients, the changes were insignificant. Survival analyses showed that the patients with decreased ser-miR34a expression from the end of the second cycle and the end of NACT to before NACT had improved DFS compared with that of the patients with increasing ser-miR34a expression (P<0.001 for both). Cox regression analyses showed that the changes of ser-miR34a expression were independent prognostic indicators. CONCLUSIONS: Ser-miR34a is a novel, noninvasive predictive marker for NACT response and prognosis in breast cancer patients.
28178620	miR-944 acts as a prognostic marker and promotes the tumor progression in endometrial cancer.	microRNA-944 (miR-944) has been reported to be deregulation and play either tumor suppressive or oncogenic function in human malignancies. Previous studies have reported that miR-944 is overexpressed in gynecological malignancies including cervical cancer and breast cancer. While, the clinical significance of miR-944 and its function in human endometrial carcinoma (EC) keep unknown. The levels of miR-944 were analyzed in 68 EC tissues and 20 normal endometrial tissues. Results showed that miR-944 was significantly overexpressed in EC tissues compared to normal endometrial tissues. In addition, increased levels of miR-944 also observed in EC cell lines. Clinicopathological analysis verified that miR-944 expression was associated with international federation of gynecology and obstetrics (FIGO) stages and pathology classification of EC. Moreover, Kaplan-Meier analysis found that miR-944 highly expressing EC patients showed a notable shorter survival. Further experiments revealed that miR-944 knockdown significantly inhibited growth and cell cycle progression while facilitated apoptosis in Ishikawa cells. In turn, miR-944 overexpression prominently promoted proliferation and cell cycle progression, and suppressed apoptosis in KLE cells. In vivo experiments further confirmed that miR-944 silencing notably restrained the tumor growth of EC in nude mice. Mechanically, cell adhesion molecule 2 (CADM2) was recognized as a direct downstream target of miR-944 in EC cells. An inverse correlation between miR-944 and CADM2 expression was observed in EC tissues. Interestingly, CADM2 overexpression showed similar effects to miR-944 knockdown in Ishikawa cells with decreased growth, cell cycle arrest at G1 phase and increased apoptosis. Taken together, this work support the first evidence that miR-944 can be potentially used as a promising biomarker and novel therapeutic target for human EC.
28178607	Family history of cancer other than breast or ovarian cancer in first-degree relatives is associated with poor breast cancer prognosis.	OBJECTIVE: Whether a first-degree family history of others cancers (FHOC) than breast or ovarian cancer (BOC) is associated with breast cancer prognosis remains unknown. Thus, the aim of the present study was to clarify this issue. METHODS: Women who were diagnosed with invasive breast cancer at the Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University from 2010 to 2013 were included in the study. The demographic and clinicopathological characteristics of these patients were extracted. FHOC was considered positive for any patient who had a relative who had been diagnosed with cancer other than BOC. Disease-free survival (DFS) was calculated based on the date of diagnosis. DFS was analyzed using the Cox proportional hazards model. RESULTS: A total of 434 breast cancer patients were included in this study. Among these patients, 61 (14.06%) had a positive FHOC in first-degree relatives. Patients with a positive FHOC tended to have HER2-positive breast cancer (p = 0.03). In the survival analysis, FHOC was associated with poor DFS in both univariate (HR = 2.21 (1.28-3.83), 95% CI: 1.28-3.83, p < 0.01) and multivariate (HR = 2.50, 95% CI: 1.24-5.04, p = 0.01) analyses, especially in patients with luminal A subtypes. CONCLUSION: The results demonstrated an increased risk of recurrence in breast cancer patients with FHOC, especially in patients with luminal A subtype.
28178606	Breast reconstruction post mastectomy- Let's Google it. Accessibility, readability and quality of online information.	INTRODUCTION: This study evaluated the readability, accessibility and quality of information pertaining to breast reconstruction post mastectomy on the Internet in the English language. METHODS: Using the Google(c) search engine the keywords "Breast reconstruction post mastectomy" were searched for. We analyzed the top 75 sites. The Flesch Reading Ease Score and Gunning Fog Index were calculated to assess readability. Web site quality was assessed objectively using the University of Michigan Consumer Health Web site Evaluation Checklist. Accessibility was determined using an automated accessibility tool. In addition, the country of origin, type of organisation producing the site and presence of Health on the Net (HoN) Certification status was recorded. RESULTS: The Web sites were difficult to read and comprehend. The mean Flesch Reading Ease scores were 55.5. The mean Gunning Fog Index scores was 8.6. The mean Michigan score was 34.8 indicating weak quality of websites. Websites with HoN certification ranked higher in the search results (p = 0.007). Website quality was influenced by organisation type (p < 0.0001) with academic/healthcare, not for profit and government sites having higher Michigan scores. 20% of sites met the minimum accessibility criteria. CONCLUSIONS: Internet information on breast reconstruction post mastectomy and procedures is poorly written and we suggest that Webpages providing information must be made more readable and accessible. We suggest that health professionals should recommend Web sites that are easy to read and contain high-quality surgical information. Medical information on the Internet should be readable, accessible, reliable and of a consistent quality.
28178123	Spectrum of pediatric tumors diagnosed by fine-needle aspiration cytology.	Pediatric tumors differ markedly from adult tumors in their nature, distribution, and prognosis. In this 10-year retrospective study, we present our experience with fine-needle aspiration (FNA) in pediatric patients 18 years of age and younger and correlate relationship between gender with organ, diagnosis, malignancy, and age. In our study, FNA material of pediatric tumors or masses with 18 years aged and younger were analyzed retrospectively.All FNAs in pediatric patients during this time period were identified and analyzed for age, gender, cytologic diagnosis, and site of aspiration. A total 1000 FNAs were performed from January 2007 to October 2015 in 499 children. Regardless the gender, the most frequently aspirated organ was lymph node, comprising 129 of the 499 cases followed by thyroid (112), neck cyst (79), and parotid (35) cases. The majority of the cases were diagnosed as benign lesions (436 of 499 cases). Other 63 cases comprising 40 female and 23 male cases had malignant lesions. There was significant age difference between people with or without malignancy. In malignant cases, there was a significant difference between the age on males and females. In regard to gender and diagnosis, cytologic diagnosis was stratified into 9 broad diagnostic categories: lymphadenitis, benign and malignant thyroid, cyst contents, benign breast, benign and malignant salivary, and negative for malignancy.In conclusion, our study supports the use of FNA cytology (FNAC) in lesions of various anatomic sites in the children less than 18 years old. As a simple, minimally invasive, and rapid procedure, cytopathologists can reliably utilize FNAC in children. The mean age of children receiving a malignant diagnosis was significantly higher than that of benign lesions. The mean age of malignancy in boys is significantly lower than that of girls with malignancy.
28176940	Targeted multidrug delivery system to overcome chemoresistance in breast cancer.	Chemotherapy has been widely used in breast cancer patients to reduce tumor size. However, most anticancer agents cannot differentiate between cancerous and normal cells, resulting in severe systemic toxicity. In addition, acquired drug resistance during the chemotherapy treatment further decreases treatment efficacy. With the proper treatment strategy, nanodrug carriers, such as liposomes/immunoliposomes, may be able to reduce undesired side effects of chemotherapy, to overcome the acquired multidrug resistance, and to further improve the treatment efficacy. In this study, a novel combinational targeted drug delivery system was developed by encapsulating antiangiogenesis drug bevacizumab into liposomes and encapsulating chemotherapy drug doxorubicin (DOX) into immunoliposomes where the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) antibody was used as a targeting ligand. This novel combinational system was tested in vitro using a HER2 positive and multidrug resistant breast cancer cell line (BT-474/MDR), and in vivo using a xenograft mouse tumor model. In vitro cell culture experiments show that immunoliposome delivery led to a high cell nucleus accumulation of DOX, whereas free DOX was observed mostly near the cell membrane and in cytoplasm due to the action of P-gp. Combining liposomal bevacizumab with immunoliposomal DOX achieved the best tumor growth inhibition and the lowest toxicity. Tumor size decreased steadily within a 60-day observation period indicating a potential synergistic effect between DOX and bevacizumab through the targeted delivery. Our findings clearly indicate that tumor growth was significantly delayed in the combinational liposomal drug delivery group. This novel combinational therapy has great potential for the treatment of patients with HER2/MDR double positive breast cancer.
28176430	Managing uncertainty in the clinical prediction of risk of harm: Bringing a Bayesian approach to forensic mental health.	Predicting the likelihood of harm posed by mentally disordered offenders remains controversial. It is proposed that a Bayesian approach may help quantify the uncertainty surrounding such prediction. An example of this approach quantifying the risk of breast cancer in the event of a positive mammogram is provided. Copyright (c) 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
28176303	Association between age and access to immediate breast reconstruction in women undergoing mastectomy for breast cancer.	BACKGROUND: National guidelines state that patients with breast cancer undergoing mastectomy in England should be offered immediate breast reconstruction (IR), unless precluded by their fitness for surgery or the need for adjuvant therapies. METHODS: A national study investigated factors that influenced clinicians' decision to offer IR, and collected data on case mix, operative procedures and reconstructive decision-making among women with breast cancer having a mastectomy with or without IR in the English National Health Service between 1 January 2008 and 31 March 2009. Multivariable logistic regression was used to examine the relationship between whether or not women were offered IR and their characteristics (tumour burden, functional status, planned radiotherapy, planned chemotherapy, perioperative fitness, obesity, smoking status and age). RESULTS: Of 13 225 women, 6458 (48.8 per cent) were offered IR. Among factors the guidelines highlighted as relevant to decision-making, the three most strongly associated with the likelihood of an offer were tumour burden, planned radiotherapy and performance status. Depending on the combination of their values, the probability of an IR offer ranged from 7.4 to 85.1 per cent. A regression model that included all available factors discriminated well between whether or not women were offered IR (c-statistic 0.773), but revealed that increasing age was associated with a fall in the probability of an IR offer beyond that expected from older patients' tumour and co-morbidity characteristics. CONCLUSION: Clinicians are broadly following guidance on the offer of IR, except with respect to patients' age.
28176242	Roles of FoxM1 in cell regulation and breast cancer targeting therapy.	Forkhead box M1 (FoxM1) is an oncogenic transcription factor involved in a wide variety of cellular processes, such as cell cycle progression, proliferation, differentiation, migration, metabolism and DNA damage response. It is overexpressed in many human cancers, especially in breast cancers. Posttranslational modifications are known to play an important role in regulating the expression and transcriptional activity of FoxM1. In this review, we characterize the posttranslational modifications of FoxM1, summarize modifications of FoxM1 by different kinases, explore the relationship between the different sites of modifications and comprehensively describe how posttranslational modifications to regulate the function of FoxM1 by changing protein stability, nucleus localization and transcriptional activity. Additionally, we systematically summarize the roles of FoxM1 in breast cancer occurrence, therapy and drug resistance. The purpose of this paper tries to give a better understanding of the regulatory mechanisms of FoxM1 in cell regulation and highlights potential of a new method for breast cancer therapy by targeting FoxM1.
28174378	[Considerations in Caring for Young Persons Living with Cancer].	Young adults with cancer have unique psychosocial needs. Healthcare providers must be aware of their life-stage specific individual needs to provide them with comprehensive care. In this paper, I tried to describe the best possible support system and individual care based on the actual circumstances surrounding young adults with cancer in Japan.
28174375	[Characteristics of Adolescent and Young Adult Cancer].	In adolescent and young adult(AYA)population, cancer is the leading cause of death due to illness with the lowest mortality rate as well as children, and national measures for cancer was left behind. Leukemia, lymphomas, brain tumors, thyroid cancer, ovarian cancer, cervical cancer, breast cancer, testicular cancer and bone and soft tissue sarcomas account for majority of the cancers in this age group. There has been no significant improvement in AYA patients in contrast to other age groups. AYA patients with cancer are under growing independency, starting in life to the community, and reproductive age. As they have physical change to adults and unique psychosocial issues that are distinct from those of pediatric and older adult patients, it is important to establish appropriate disease treatment and psychosocial supportive care with due respect to established themselves. It is urgent issue to develop cancer treatments and the system of medical and supportive care for patients and survivors with cancer in this age group.
28174186	Avoiding misdiagnosis: cystic calcified brain metastases of uterine cervical cancer mimicking neurocysticercosis.	The radiological finding of multiple calcified brain lesions is atypical for brain metastases and in absence of a clear evidence of disseminated neoplastic disease the differential diagnosis may be difficult. Calcified brain metastases (CBM) are rarely encountered in clinical practice and they mostly arise from lung, breast and gastrointestinal primitive tumours. Only one case of uterine cervical carcinoma (UCC) with CBM has been reported so far. We describe the case of a 41-year-old Caucasian woman with a history of hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy for UCC 3 years prior to observation and no evidence of neoplastic recurrence that developed cystic CBM. Owing to their peculiar radiological appearance, lesions were initially misidentified as neurocysticercosis, the most common parasitic infection of the central nervous system. We offer the reader some important teaching points for the differential diagnosis and discuss the rarity of our case.
28174088	CasuL: A new lectin isolated from Calliandra surinamensis leaf pinnulae with cytotoxicity to cancer cells, antimicrobial activity and antibiofilm effect.	This work describes the isolation of a lectin (CasuL) from the leaf pinnulae of Calliandra surinamensis and the evaluation of its cytotoxic, antimicrobial and antibiofilm properties. Proteins from pinnulae extract were precipitated with ammonium sulphate (60% saturation) and submitted to Sephadex G-75 chromatography, which yielded isolated CasuL (purification factor: 113). Native CasuL is an acidic protein (pI 5.82) with a relative molecular mass of 48kDa. This lectin is also an oligomeric protein composed of three subunits and mass spectrometry revealed similarities with a Sorghum bicolor protein. CasuL did not undergo unfolding when heated but changes in conformation and hemagglutinating activity were detected at basic pH. CasuL did not reduce the viability of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells but was toxic to leukemic K562 cells (IC50 67.04+/-5.78mug/mL) and breast cancer T47D cells (IC50: 58.75+/-2.5mug/mL). CasuL (6.25-800mug/mL) only showed bacteriostatic effect but was able to reduce biofilm formation by Staphylococcus saprophyticcus and Staphylococcus aureus (non-resistant and oxacillin-resistant isolates). CasuL showed antifungal activity against Candida krusei causing alterations in cell morphology and damage to cell wall. In conclusion, the pinnulae of C. surinamensis leaves contain a thermo-stable lectin with biotechnological potential as cytotoxic, antibiofilm, and antifungal agent.
28173790	DCIS and axillary nodal evaluation: compliance with national guidelines.	BACKGROUND: The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) and the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) provide guidelines regarding axillary nodal evaluation in ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), but data regarding national compliance with these guidelines remains incomplete. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of the National Cancer Data Base (NCDB) analyzing all surgical approaches to axillary evaluation in patients with DCIS. Logistic regression analysis was used to assess the multivariate relationship between patient demographics, clinical characteristics, and probability of axillary evaluation. RESULTS: We identified 88,083 patients diagnosed with DCIS between 1998 and 2011; 31,912 (37%) underwent total mastectomy (TM) and 55,349 (63%) had breast conserving therapy (BCT). Axillary evaluation increased from 44.4% in 1998 to 63.3% in 2011. In TM patients, axillary evaluation increased from 74.3% in 1998 to 93.4% in 2011. This correlated with an increase in sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) from 24.3 to 77.1%, while ALND decreased from 50.0 to 16.3% (p <0.01). In BCT patients, evaluation increased from 20.1 to 43.9%; SLNB increased from 7.2 to 39.4% and ALND decreased from 12.9 to 4.5%. Factors associated with axillary nodal evaluation in BCT patients included practice type and facility location. Among TM patients, use of axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) for axillary staging was associated with earlier year of diagnosis, black race, and older age, as well as community practice setting and practice location in the Southern US. CONCLUSIONS: Compliance with national guidelines regarding axillary evaluation in DCIS remains varied. Practice type and location-based differences suggest opportunities for education regarding the appropriate use of axillary nodal evaluation in patients with DCIS.
28171795	Multifunctional silver nanocluster-hybrid oligonucleotide vehicle for cell imaging and microRNA-targeted gene silencing.	Novel therapeutics is urgently needed to prevent cancer-related deaths. MicroRNAs that act as tumor suppressors have been recognized as a next-generation tumor therapy, and the restoration of tumor-suppressive microRNAs using microRNA replacements or mimics may be a less toxic, more effective strategy due to fewer off-target effects. Here, we designed the novel multifunctional oligonucleotide nanocarrier complex composed of a tumor-targeting aptamer sequence specific to mucin 1 (MUC1), poly-cytosine region for fluorescent silver nanocluster (AgNC) synthesis, and complimentary sequence for microRNA miR-34a loading. MiR-34a was employed because of its therapeutic effect of inhibiting oncogene expression and inducing apoptosis in carcinomas. By monitoring the intrinsic fluorescence of AgNC, it was clearly shown that the constructed complex (MUC1-AgNCm-miR-34a) enters MCF-7 cells. To evaluate the efficacy of this nanocarrier for microRNA delivery, we investigated the gene and protein expression levels of downstream miR-34a targets (BCL-2, CDK6, and CCND1) by quantitative PCR and western blotting, respectively, and the results indicated their effective inhibition by miR-34a. This novel multifunctional AgNC-based nanocarrier can aid in improving the efficacy of breast cancer theranostics.
28169866	Low-Grade Neuroendocrine Carcinoma of the Skin (Primary Cutaneous Carcinoid Tumor) as a Distinctive Entity of Cutaneous Neuroendocrine Tumors: A Clinicopathologic Study of 3 Cases With Literature Review.	There is scarcity of information on primary cutaneous low-grade neoplasms commonly known as carcinoid tumors, owing to their rarity. The authors present 3 cases that were named "low-grade neuroendocrine carcinoma of the skin" (LGNECS). These occurred in the dermis and subcutis of the anterior chest or the inguinal region in the elderly. Histologically, the tumors showed infiltrating proliferation of nests of various sizes, with low-grade neuroendocrine cytologic features but without mucin production. All cases exhibited varying degrees of intraductal tumor components. On immunohistochemical examination, these tumors expressed estrogen receptor alpha, progesterone receptor, androgen receptor, gross cystic disease fluid protein 15, mammaglobin, and GATA3 as well as neuroendocrine markers. Although a literature review revealed 8 additional possible cases with no evidence of other diseases, it was difficult to determine if these were true cases of LGNECS, because of the limited information available. Based on its characteristic histologic features and immunoprofile, it can be proposed designating LGNECS as a distinct entity among cutaneous neuroendocrine tumors. Otherwise, such tumors could be misdiagnosed as mammary carcinomas (particularly when involving the skin of the breast) or as metastatic visceral neuroendocrine tumors of the skin.
28169235	Prediction of heterogeneity in breast cancer immunophenotype at ductal carcinoma in situ stage?	INTRODUCTION: Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is considered a heterogeneous lesion at the molecular level. However, there is a paucity of literature about the existence of molecular subtypes in DCIS which can predict their biological behavior at the preinvasive stage. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Precise prevalence of molecular subtypes of pure DCIS and DCIS component of infiltrating duct carcinoma (IDC) was evaluated using immunohistochemistry and correlated with known prognostic factors. RESULTS: DCIS cases were classified as luminal A (46.6% in each group), luminal B (pure DCIS 20% and DCIS component of IDC 13.3%), HER2 overexpressing, basal and nonbasal (pure DCIS 3.3% and 26.6% and DCIS component of IDC 3.3% and 33.3%, respectively), and triple negative, nonbasal (pure DCIS and DCIS component of IDC 3.3% each). The molecular phenotype of DCIS correlated well with that of the coexisting IDC. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated molecular heterogeneity in DCIS; however, similar molecular phenotypes were seen in the coexisting IDC suggesting that DCIS is a precursor lesion and can predict phenotype of the invasive component. This also suggests that the invasiveness of DCIS is not dependent solely on the molecular character of the tumor epithelial cells, but factors such as tumor microenvironment may play a role.
28169231	Palbociclib: A new hope in the treatment of breast cancer.	Breast cancer being one of the common cancers has high morbidity and mortality. Despite the conventional treatment, the burden of the disease increases year after year. There is a need for newer drugs that target the different mechanisms in the pathogenesis. The interaction of cyclins with cyclin dependent kinases (CDKs) plays a major role in the abnormal cell cycle in cancer and it is considered to be an important target. Palbociclib is a CDK inhibitor currently approved for the treatment of breast cancer. The preclinical studies with breast cancer lines were sensitive to palbociclib and the clinical trials phase I, phase II (PALOMA 1), and phase III (PALOMA 2, 3, PENTELOPE, PEARL) showed that the drug was efficacious when combined other conventional drugs for breast cancer. Palbociclib was also been tested in various other germ cell tumors, melanoma, multiple myeloma, glioblastoma multiforme etc., The major adverse effect of the drug includes hematological toxicity mainly neutropenia, gastrointestinal adverse effects.
28167697	PRC2 is dispensable for HOTAIR-mediated transcriptional repression.	Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play diverse roles in physiological and pathological processes. Several lncRNAs have been suggested to modulate gene expression by guiding chromatin-modifying complexes to specific sites in the genome. However, besides the example of Xist, clear-cut evidence demonstrating this novel mode of regulation remains sparse. Here, we focus on HOTAIR, a lncRNA that is overexpressed in several tumor types and previously proposed to play a key role in gene silencing through direct recruitment of Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) to defined genomic loci. Using genetic tools and a novel RNA-tethering system, we investigated the interplay between HOTAIR and PRC2 in gene silencing. Surprisingly, we observed that forced overexpression of HOTAIR in breast cancer cells leads to subtle transcriptomic changes that appear to be independent of PRC2. Mechanistically, we found that artificial tethering of HOTAIR to chromatin causes transcriptional repression, but that this effect does not require PRC2. Instead, PRC2 recruitment appears to be a consequence of gene silencing. We propose that PRC2 binding to RNA might serve functions other than chromatin targeting.
28167527	Characterization of H type 1 and type 1 N-acetyllactosamine glycan epitopes on ovarian cancer specifically recognized by the anti-glycan monoclonal antibody mAb-A4.	Cancer-specific glycans of ovarian cancer are promising epitopes for targeting with monoclonal antibodies (mAb). Despite their potential, structural characterization of these glycan epitopes remains a significant challenge in mAb preclinical development. Our group generated the monoclonal antibody mAb-A4 against human embryonic stem cells (hESC), which also bound specifically to N-glycans present on 11 of 19 ovarian cancer (OC) and 8 of 14 breast cancer cell lines tested. Normal cell lines and tissue were unstained by mAb-A4. To characterize the N-linked glycan epitopes on OC cell lines targeted by mAb-A4, we used glycosidases, glycan microarray, siRNA, and advanced high sensitivity matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS). The mAb-A4 epitopes were found to be Fucalpha1-2Galbeta1-3GlcNAcbeta (H type 1) and Galbeta1-3GlcNAcbeta (type 1 LacNAc). These structures were found to be present on multiple proteins from hESC and OC. Importantly, endo-beta-galactosidase coupled with MALDI-MS allowed these two epitopes, for the first time, to be directly identified on the polylactosamines of N-glycans of SKOV3, IGROV1, OV90, and OVCA433. Furthermore, siRNA knockdown of B3GALT5 expression in SKOV3 demonstrated that mAb-A4 binding was dependent on B3GALT5, providing orthogonal evidence of the epitopes' structures. The recognition of oncofetal H type 1 and type 1 LacNAc on OC by mAb-A4 is a novel and promising way to target OC and supports the theory that cancer can acquire stem-like phenotypes. We propose that the orthogonal framework used in this work could be the basis for advancing anti-glycan mAb characterization.
28166075	Clinico-histopathological Survey of Head and Neck Cancer at Tertiary Health Care Centre -Dhulikhel Hospital.	Background Head and neck is one of the most prevalent site for cancers along with lungs, cervix, breast and stomach. Hospital based cancer registries required for effective evaluation of diagnosis and management of cancer is inadequate in Nepal. Cancer registry system established by WHO is acquired by seven major hospitals in our country. However, data from tertiary health care centres like ours remain undocumented. Objective The objective of this study is to perform retrospective analysis of clinicohistopathological types of head and neck lesions which were eventually diagnosed as cancer in Dhulikel Hospital, a tertiary health care centre of Central East Nepal. Method Data regarding head and neck lesions diagnosed as cancer (January 2001- December 2014) were extracted from the archives of Department of General Pathology. These cases were categorised according to demographic profile, site of cancer and histological diagnosis. Result A total of 240 cases matched the inclusion criteria and were selected for this study. Male: Female ratio of 1.3:1 with a mean age of 52 years (52.82+/-1.8) was found. Two hundred and two (84.16%) patients were diagnosed with carcinoma, 31 (15%) with lymphoma, 3 (1.25%) with melanoma, 2(0.83%) with small round cell tumor and 2 (0.83%) with sarcoma. The most common histological types of carcinoma seen were Squamous cell carcinoma (138 cases; 57.5%) followed by papillary carcinoma (26 cases; 10.8%). Among the lymphomas Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (21 cases; 8.75%) was the most predominant type. The most common site of presentation was oral cavity (60 cases; 25%) followed by skin (36 cases; 15%), thyroid (32 cases; 13.33%) and oesophagus (27 cases; 11.25%). Metastasis to cervical lymph node was found in 39 cases (16.25%). Conclusion Based on these finding, it was observed that Squamous cell carcinoma was the most common type followed by different epithelial and mesenchymal malignancies in head and neck region. The results revealed by this study will provide useful information for planning the health care policies about cancer in Nepal and will be more effective and helpful to the patients of remote areas.
28165374	Evaluation of EphA2 and EphB4 as Targets for Image-Guided Colorectal Cancer Surgery.	Targeted image-guided oncologic surgery (IGOS) relies on the recognition of cell surface-associated proteins, which should be abundantly present on tumor cells but preferably absent on cells in surrounding healthy tissue. The transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase EphA2, a member of the A class of the Eph receptor family, has been reported to be highly overexpressed in several tumor types including breast, lung, brain, prostate, and colon cancer and is considered amongst the most promising cell membrane-associated tumor antigens by the NIH. Another member of the Eph receptor family belonging to the B class, EphB4, has also been found to be upregulated in multiple cancer types. In this study, EphA2 and EphB4 are evaluated as targets for IGOS of colorectal cancer by immunohistochemistry (IHC) using a tissue microarray (TMA) consisting of 168 pairs of tumor and normal tissue. The IHC sections were scored for staining intensity and percentage of cells stained. The results show a significantly enhanced staining intensity and more widespread distribution in tumor tissue compared with adjacent normal tissue for EphA2 as well as EphB4. Based on its more consistently higher score in colorectal tumor tissue compared to normal tissue, EphB4 appears to be a promising candidate for IGOS of colorectal cancer. In vitro experiments using antibodies on human colon cancer cells confirmed the possibility of EphB4 as target for imaging.
28163094	miR-130b-3p inhibits cell invasion and migration by targeting the Notch ligand Delta-like 1 in breast carcinoma.	Breast carcinoma is the most common malignancy in women, and the incidence rate has increased dramatically in recent years. Metastasis is responsible for most advanced breast cancer mortality, but the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood despite extensive research. Recently, short non-coding RNA molecules, including miRNAs, which mediate changes in signalling pathways, have emerged as metastatic regulators of the breast carcinoma. Previous reports have suggested that miR-130b-3p has both oncogenic and tumour suppressor functions in a cancer type-dependent manner. However, the roles and underlying molecular mechanisms of miR-130b-3p in the development of metastasis in breast carcinoma remain unclear. Here, we reported for the first time that miR-130b-3p was differentially expressed in early-stage non-invasive MCF-7 human breast carcinoma cells and aggressive late-stage MDA-MB-231 cells. In gain-of-function and loss-of-function studies, we demonstrated that miR-130b-3p could inhibit breast carcinoma cell invasion and migration by directly targeting the Notch ligand Delta-like 1 (DLL1). Our data also indicated that MMP-9, MMP-13, and VEGF were regulated by miR-130b-3p and may be involved in the inhibition of cell invasion and migration in breast carcinoma. Collectively, our findings reveal a new regulatory mechanism of miR-130b-3p and suggest that miR-130b-3p may be a potential target against human breast cancer metastasis.
28161993	Eribulin in non-small cell lung cancer: challenges and potential strategies.	INTRODUCTION: Eribulin is a non-taxane, macrocyclic, synthetic, ketone analog of halichondrin B with a microtubule inhibitory action specific toward plus ends. It is approved by United States Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic liposarcoma who have received a prior anthracycline-containing regimen. It is also approved as a third line therapy for patients with metastatic breast cancer who have received a prior treatment with anthracycline and taxane in either adjuvant or metastatic setting. It has also undergone investigation in various cancers including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Areas covered: This review covers eribulin in detail with regards to pharmacodynamics, mechanism of action, pharmacokinetics, published phase I studies along with special focus on phase II and III studies of eribulin in NSCLC. Expert opinion: Eribulin is a potent chemotherapeutic agent with acceptable and easily manageable toxicity profile. It has shown activity in NSCLC. However, the management of NSCLC is undergoing rapid evolution with introduction of newer immune mediated and targeted agents. The way to move forward is to combine eribulin with novel immune checkpoint inhibitors, targeted agents and chemotherapies in appropriate line of therapy.
28161134	Anti-inflammatory lignanamides and monoindoles from Alocasia macrorrhiza.	Five new lignanamides (1-5), and one new monoindole alkaloid (6), along with eight known compounds (7-14) were isolated and identified from the rhizomes of Alocasia macrorrhiza (giant taro). All purified compounds were evaluated for their inhibitory effects on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced nitric oxide (NO) production in RAW 264.7 cells, and the antiproliferative activities against human nasopharyngeal carcinoma epithelial (CNE-1), human gastric carcinoma (MGC-803), and human breast cancer (MCF-7) cell lines by MTT method. Compounds 2, 4, 7 and 8 exhibited significant inhibitory effects on NO production with the IC50 values of 2.35+/-0.38, 9.20+/-0.94, 3.45+/-0.39 and 7.96+/-0.56muM, respectively. The results suggested the lignanamides and monoindoles might be responsible for the anti-inflammatory activity of giant taro and might be potential anti-inflammatory candidates.
28160860	Novel effect and the mechanistic insights of fruiting body extract of medicinal fungus Antrodia cinnamomea against T47D breast cancer.	INTRODUCTION: Tamoxifen, an anti-oestrogenic drug for estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer, was observed to stimulate tumor growth or drug resistance in patients. Antrodia cinnamomea (AC), a precious medicinal fungus has been traditionally used as a folk remedy for cancers in Asian countries. The objective of this study was to investigate the bioefficacy and the underlying molecular mechanisms of the AC fruiting bodies extracts (AC-3E) against human ER+ T47D breast cancer cells, and compare the effect with that of tamoxifen. METHODS: Cell proliferation, migration, TUNEL assay, western blotting, time-lapse confocal microscopy analyses, chorioallantoic membrane assay, and a xenograft BALB/c nude mouse system were used in this study. Chemical fingerprinting of AC-3E was established using LC-MS. RESULTS: AC-3E attenuated T47D breast cancer cell activity by deregulating the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway and key cell-cycle mediators, and inducing apoptosis. AC-3E also effectively inhibited tube-like structures of endothelial cells, blood vessel branching and microvessel formation ex vivo and in vivo. Significant preventive and therapeutic effects against T47D mammary tumor growth of AC-3E was observed comparable or superior to tamoxifen treatment in xenograft BALB/c nude mice. Dehydroeburicoic acid (2) was characterized as the main chemical constituent in AC-3E against breast cancer. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that AC-3E extracts can be employed as a double-barreled approach to treat human ER+ breast cancer by attacking both cancer cells and tumor-associated blood vessel cells.
28160858	Erythro-austrobailignan-6 down-regulates HER2/EGFR/integrinbeta3 expression via p38 activation in breast cancer.	BACKGROUND: Despite the benefits from different options of therapy for breast cancer, resistance of the disease to these therapies is rising and a novel agent is needed. Erythro-austrobailignan-6 (EA6) exhibits anti-cancer activity. However, the detailed anti-tumor mechanisms by which EA6 inhibits 4T-1 and MCF-7 cell growth have not been well studied. PURPOSE: In this study, we investigated the anti-proliferative and anti-tumor properties of EA6 on breast carcinoma and its accompanying mechanisms. METHODS: The cytotoxic and apoptotic effect of EA6 were measured in breast cancer cell lines of 4T-1 and MCF-7. The role of EA6 on cell proliferation and migration was examined by immunoblotting. The anti-tumor activity of EA6 was assessed in mice inoculated with 4T-1 breast cancer cells. RESULTS: EA6 increased the number of Annexin V-positive apoptotic bodies and cleaved form of caspase-3 in a dose-dependent manner and phosphorylated JNK and p38 in both cells. Moreover, EA6 down-regulated cell cycle dependent proteins of CDK-4 and cyclin D1, and increased G0/G1 population in both cells. EA6-induced apoptosis is mediated by p38 MAPK and caspase-3 activation in both cells. EA6 significantly reduced HER2/EGFR/integrin beta3 expression and Src phosphorylation, which was dependent on p38 MAPK activation in 4T-1 and MCF-7 cells. Furthermore, we confirmed the down-regulation of topoisomerases by EA6 treatment, but the overall effects of EA6 on topoisomerase isotype were cell type specific. Finally, EA6 (20mg/kg/day) significantly reduced mammary tumor volume in 4T-1 bearing mice by down-regulating HER2/EGFR/integrin beta3 expression in tumor tissues. CONCLUSIONS: Our results offer a novel insight into the mechanism of EA6-induced apoptosis in breast cancer cells. We propose that EA6 treatment resulted in the activation of p38 MAPK and caspase-3, which eventually participated in regulating apoptosis in 4T-1 and MCF-7 cells.
28160857	Eulophia macrobulbon - an orchid with significant anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effect and anticancerogenic potential exerted by its root extract.	BACKGROUND: The Orchidaceae family is one of the largest families of flowering plants. Orchids are widely used for the traditional herbal medicine, acting as aphrodisiac, antisepic, antimicrobial, anti-cancer agent, etc. PURPOSE: This study was designed to elucidate the anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and cytotoxic potential of a 50% ethanolic extract of Eulophia macrobulbon roots (EME) in vitro, an orchid growing in Southern Asia. Furthermore, the main active compounds were isolated, and the bioactivity of the single constituents was determined. METHODS: The anti-inflammatory activity of EME and its compounds was evaluated by the secretion of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines and by the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated macrophage model, as determined by an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and Western blot. Antioxidant activity was assessed using a DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picryl-hydrazyl-hydrate) photometric assay. Cytotoxic effects were determined using a colorimetric 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT)-assay. RESULTS: EME and its compounds significantly reduced the production of the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin 6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), the expression of iNOS and subsequently increased the production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin 10 (IL-10) in LPS-stimulated macrophages. Additionally it could be demonstrated that EME is rich in radical scavengers. Furthermore, EME and its components showed notable cytotoxic effects on the human cervical adenocarcinoma cell line HeLa, the human colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line CaCo-2 and the human breast adenocarcinoma cell line MCF-7. The most active constituents were identified as 4-methoxy-9,10-dihydro-2,7-phenanthrenediol (8), 4-methoxy-2,7-phenanthrenediol (9), 1,5-dimethoxy-2,7-phenanthrenediol (10), 1,5,7-trimethoxy-2,6-phenanthrenediol (11), 1-(4-hydroxybenzyl)-4,8-dimethoxy-2,7-phenanthrenediol (15). CONCLUSION: Based on this data, EME provides various beneficial anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and cytotoxic attributes and may be used as herbal remedy in the pharmaceutical or food industries.
28160848	Traditional preparations of kava (Piper methysticum) inhibit the growth of human colon cancer cells in vitro.	BACKGROUND: Epidemiological studies indicate there is low incidence of colon cancer in the South Pacific islands, including Fiji, West Samoa, and Vanuatu. Cancer incidence has been shown to be inversely associated with kava (Piper methysticum G. Forst.) ingestion. Hypothesis/Purpose: Kava prepared traditionally will inhibit the growth of human cancer cells. This investigation entails preparation and analysis of kava extracts and study of the growth inhibitory activity of the extracts, alone and combined with hibiscus. STUDY DESIGN: We will prepare kava as in Micronesia - as a water extract, high in particulate content, alone or combined with sea hibiscus (Hibiscus tiliaceus L.) - and examine the components and growth inhibitory activity. METHODS: We obtained ground kava prepared in the traditional way from lateral roots and sea hibiscus mucilage and sap from different sources in Micronesia, and prepared water extracts (unfiltered, as well as filtered, since in traditional use the kava beverage contains a high particulate content) and partitions. We used the MTT assay to determine the growth inhibitory activity of the preparations on colon and breast cancer cells and nonmalignant intestinal epithelial cells. LC-MS analysis was used to examine the components of the kava and sea hibiscus extracts and partitions. RESULTS: Traditional preparations of kava inhibit the growth of breast and colon cancer cells. Among the kava preparations, the order of decreasing activity was Fiji(2), Fiji(1), Hawaii; the unfiltered preparations from Fiji were more active than the filtered. Phytochemical analysis indicated that filtering reduced most kavalactone and chalcone content. For example, for Fiji(2), the ratio of dihydromethysticin in filtered/unfiltered kava was 0.01. Thus, for the extracts from Fiji, growth inhibitory activity correlates with the content of these compounds. Unfiltered and filtered kava from Fiji(1) were more active on malignant than nonmalignant intestinal epithelial cells. Since kava is prepared in Micronesia by squeezing the extract through sea hibiscus bark, we assayed the growth inhibitory activity of combinations of kava and sea hibiscus sap and found that sea hibiscus enhanced the growth inhibitory effect of kava. CONCLUSION: Our results show that traditional kava, alone or combined with sea hibiscus, displays activity against human cancer cells and indicate it will be worthwhile to develop and further analyze these preparations to prevent and treat colon and other cancers. Our findings suggest it is important to examine the activity of plants in the form that people consume them.
28160754	The role of IL17B-IL17RB signaling pathway in breast cancer.	Breast cancer is the most important cause of death in women globally. Though, improved survival is due to the developments in the screening techniques, initial diagnosis, and advances in treatments. Numerous factors contributed in the progression of breast cancer, such as inflammation. The most significant factor involved in the inflammatory process, is T helper 17 (Th17) cells. Th17 cells have an exceptional role in many of inflammatory diseases like psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, and breast cancer through production of proinflammatory cytokine (IL17). As the collected indication recommends a possible relevance between chronic inflammation and cancer tumorigenesis, it appears that this cytokine can stimulate the tumorigenesis of breast tumor cells. The IL17 family consist of 6 protein members, among them IL17B and its receptor, and IL17RB signaling pathway plays a key role in development and progression of breast cancer, and targeting this signaling pathway or its specific downstream mediators by a chemotherapy drug and small interfering RNA interference is a potentially novel therapeutic pathway for inhibition of this disease. This comprehensive review details the recognition of activity, signaling, and the roles of IL17B-IL17RB in breast cancer have caused to determination of new therapeutic mechanisms with the purpose of introduction this system and the regulation of its signaling pathway.
28157583	Identification of high independent prognostic value of nanotechnology based circulating tumor cell enumeration in first-line chemotherapy for metastatic breast cancer patients.	Enumeration of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) is a promising tool in the management of metastatic breast cancer (MBC). This study investigated the capturing efficiency and prognostic value of our previously reported peptide-based nanomagnetic CTC isolation system (Pep@MNPs). We counted CTCs in blood samples taken at baseline (n = 102) and later at patients' first clinical evaluation after starting firstline chemotherapy (n = 72) in a cohort of women treated for MBC. Their median follow-up was 16.3 months (range: 9.0-31.0 months). The CTC detection rate was 69.6 % for the baseline samples. Patients with </=2 CTC/2 ml at baseline had longer median progression-free survival (PFS) than did those with >2 CTC/2 ml (17.0 months vs. 8.0 months; P = 0.002). Patients with </=2 CTC/2 ml both at baseline and first clinical evaluation had longest PFS (18.2 months) among all patient groups (P = 0.004). Particularly, among patients with stable disease (SD; per imaging evaluation) our assay could identify those with longer PFS (P < 0.001). Patients with >2 CTC/2 ml at baseline were also significantly more likely to suffer liver metastasis (P = 0.010). This study confirmed the prognostic value of Pep@MNPs assays for MBC patients who undergo firstline chemotherapy, and offered extra stratification regarding PFS for patients with SD, and a possible indicator for patients at risk for liver metastasis.
28154712	[Phyllodes tumor in a 12-year old teenage girl: about a case and review of the literature].	Phyllodes tumors of the breast are very rare and are exceptional in children and adolescents; their treatment is based on surgery and radiotherapy, with a good prognosis. We report the case of a 12-year old teenage girl presenting with a mass in the left breast. The diagnosis of a phyllodes tumor was confirmed on the basis of clinical, imaging and histological examinations. Treatment consisted of a large tumorectomy without adjuvant therapy, with good evolution during a 2-year follow-up.
28154709	Sexuality after breast cancer: cultural specificities of Tunisian population.	INTRODUCTION: Women's sexuality may be particularly affected after breast cancer. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the changes in sexual life after treatment of breast cancer in Tunisian women and to identify the influence of demographic and clinical factors on sexuality. METHODS: We recruited 50 patients who were in remission for at least 3 months after initial treatment of breast cancer. Sexuality and body image were evaluated using the Arabic version of the specific scale of breast cancer QLQ-BR23. Screening for emotional disorders has been done with the Arabic version of HAD scale (Hospital anxiety and depression scale). RESULTS: Patients had poor sexual functioning and sexual satisfaction and the mean scores were respectively 45.3% and 43.9%. Only menopausal status and sexual difficulties in the partner was significantly related to poorer sexual satisfaction (p respectively 0.018 and 0.014). According to the HAD scale, 42% of patients had anxiety and 44% had depression. The sexual satisfaction was statistically associated with the presence of anxiety symptoms (p=0.0003). CONCLUSION: Results suggest that the psychological side and the sexual difficulties in partner are the most important factors that appear to be involved in sexual satisfaction of Tunisian women after breast cancer. So, those factors need to be taken into account in therapeutic process and psychological counseling to maintain and enhance patient's psychological well-being.
28154696	[Issues involving breast cancer management in Senegal: a cross-sectional study].	At a time when innovative therapies in breast cancer multiply, poorer countries such as Senegal are still lag far behind in the overall management of this type of cancer. In Senegal, although the treatment of advanced breast cancer is now well codified, survival and morbidity outcomes are still mediocre in view of diagnostic delays and of sometimes expensive and poorly tolerated mutilating treatments become necessary. With respect to advanced cancers, the challenges will lie in building of palliative care centres and in developing multidisciplinary approaches to improve quality of life and to support patients. On the other hand, with respect to preclinical or potentially curable cancers, the challenges are immense given the importance of early detection, localisation and diagnosis (stereotactic or ultrasound guided biopsy) but also of precision surgery and of complete resection (indexing - excision ensuring a margin of healthy tissue and specimen radiograph) while minimizing complications such as those of classic dissection (sentinel lymph node biopsy). Our health structures are not always prepared to achieve these goals. This is a situational analysis of the contextual obstacles that still exist and add a burden on the overall management of breast cancer in Senegal.
28154679	First line chemotherapy plus trastuzumab in metastatic breast cancer HER2 positive - Observational institutional study.	Breast cancer is the most common malignant disease and among the most frequent causes of cancer mortality in females worldwide. Metastatic breast cancer (MBC) is conventionally considered to be incurable. In first-line treatment of HER-2 positive MBC, randomized trials have demonstrated that trastuzumab when combined with chemotherapy significantly improves progression free survival and overall survival. To evaluate survival and toxicity of chemotherapy with Trastuzumab as first line therapy of human epithermal growth factor receptor 2 positive metastatic breast cancer, in Moroccan population. It is a phase IV observational institutional monocentric study. Including patients with metastatic breast cancer HER2 positive, as first-line chemotherapy combined with Trastuzumab from March 2009 until March 2010. Primary end point: progression free survival, secondary end point response rate and overall survival. A total of 20 patients were enrolled between March 2009 and March 2010. The lung was the first metastatic site in 60% of the cases, followed by bone, liver, nodes, skin and brain. All patients received chemotherapy with Trastuzumab: 9 of them with Docetaxel, 8 with vinorelbine, and 3 with capecitabine. The progression free survival was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method, from the date of first cycle to the date of progression or at the last consultation, and the median was 12.8 months. Trastuzumab based chemotherapy was generally well tolerated; 5 patients (25%) presented cardiotoxicity. The results of this study join the literature and show the benefit of Trastuzumab to chemotherapy in first line metastatic breast cancer HER-2 positive.
28154678	Utilization of Cancer Information System for Breast Cancer Control in Lagos, Nigeria.	INTRODUCTION: There is a substantial increase in the incidence of breast cancer in Nigeria usually with the late stage presentations and subsequent poor rates of survival attributed mainly to a low level of cancer awareness and ignorance amongst patients. Cancer information system (CIS) is now assuming an emerging role in this respect. METHODS: This was a descriptive study carried out over a one year period using a health communications program comprising of 3 breast help lines. An initial period of public awareness was carried out over a 3 months period after which members of the public were encouraged to call the help lines. Breast cancer information was provided and the socio-demographic characteristics and other relevant data of the callers were recorded by the information specialists. RESULTS: A total of 294 people were reached during the study period. Majority of the callers (82%) sought information for themselves while the remaining 18% called on behalf of a loved one or friend. Majority [248 (84.3%)] of callers had no breast abnormality, 38 (13%) called to report breast abnormalities and required information on what to do and 8 (2.7%) were breast cancer patients who required information on how to live and cope as breast cancer survivors. CONCLUSION: The rapid growth of mobile phone use in the Nigeria has presented a unique opportunity and promise to improve cancer care. There is evidence to suggest that mHealth can be used to deliver increased health care services to the increasing population of cancer patients in Nigeria.
28154673	[Breast tumor revealed by a gastric metastasis discovered incidentally].	The gastric metastasis of breast cancer are rare, and their discovery is difficult, because the symptoms is often unspecific or even absent. We report an original case of ductal carcinoma of the breast revealed by a gastric metastasis discovered incidentally.
28152498	Extended adjuvant endocrine therapy - A standard to all or some?	Patients with estrogen receptor-positive (ER +) early breast cancer (EBC) are at a continuous risk for distant relapse despite 5 years of standard endocrine therapy, even after 10-15 years after primary diagnosis. Hence, large randomized clinical trials were conducted to evaluate the role of extended endocrine treatment (ET) with the primary goal to prevent or at least delay distant relapse. Two very large trials of extended tamoxifen (TAM), the ATLAS and the aTTom trial, proved the efficacy of prolonged TAM particularly important after 10 years due to the carry-over effect of the five initial years. Additionally, the extended use of AIs after 5 years of tamoxifen, also proved to be efficacious in preventing late distant relapses. For letrozole (LET) it was shown in the MA.17 trial that it also improves overall survival (OS) in node-positive BC patients. There are many options and still unanswered questions related to extended ET, which are discussed in this review. The most important issue in deciding prolonged duration of ET is undoubtfully how to identify ER+ patients who benefit most from this approach. With this purpose, not only classical pathological factors have been studied, but also molecular profiles of individual tumors, which might help us in the near future to better tailor ET. Not only efficacy, but also toxicity of such prolonged treatment is essential for optimal use, particularly maintained compliance in a routine clinical practice. These issues are discussed in this review.
28152473	Combination of arabinogalactan and curcumin induces apoptosis in breast cancer cells in vitro and inhibits tumor growth via overexpression of p53 level in vivo.	PURPOSE: Increased mortality associated with breast cancer in women has spurred the studies to develop new drugs. Arabinogalactan (AG) and curcumin (Cur) are two natural products broadly explored in cancer therapy. Our major goal in the current study was to assess anticancer properties of combination these reagents in vitro on human breast cancer cells and in vivo utilizing animal model of breast cancer. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We evaluated cell proliferation, apoptosis, cell cycle, and protein expression in vitro on MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells. For in vivo studies, murine breast cancer cells were implanted into BALB/c mice. Thereafter, volume of the developing tumor was calculated and expression of Ki67 and p53 proteins was evaluated to analyze cell proliferation and apoptosis. RESULTS: Combination of AG and Cur significantly decreased cell growth in human breast cancer cells without any significant effect on normal cell growth. This combination could increase cell population in sub-G1 phase, which was indicative of apoptosis. Western blotting showed that the combination of AG and Cur significantly increased Bax/Bcl2 ratio as well as cleaved-caspase3 level in MDA-MB-231 cells. Combination of AG and Cur promoted apoptosis by increasing ROS level, changing mitochondrial membrane and reduction of glutathione. In addition, in vivo studies in mouse showed that this combination could inhibit the progression of breast tumors through over-expression of p53 and reduction of Ki67 levels. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that the combination of AG and Cur is of great potential to induce apoptosis in breast cancer cells in vitro and in vivo.
28152429	Synthesis and biological evaluation of fluorinated N-benzoyl and N-phenylacetoyl derivatives of 3-(4-aminophenyl)-coumarin-7-O-sulfamate as steroid sulfatase inhibitors.	In the present work, we report convenient methods for the synthesis of 3-(4-aminophenyl)-coumarin-7-O-sulfamate derivatives N-acylated with fluorinated analogues of benzoic or phenylacetic acid as steroid sulfatase (STS) inhibitors. The design of these potential STS inhibitors was supported by molecular modeling techniques. Additionally, computational docking methods were used to determine the binding modes of the synthesized inhibitors and to identify potential interactions between inhibitors and amino acid residues located in the active site of STS. The inhibitory effects of the synthesized compounds were tested on STS isolated from human placenta and against estrogen receptor-(ER)-positive MCF-7 and T47D cells, as well as ER-negative MDA-MB-231 and SkBr3 cancer cell lines. In the course of our investigation, compounds 6c and 6j demonstrated the highest inhibitory effect in enzymatic STS assays, both with IC50 values of 0.18 muM (the IC50 value of coumarin-7-O-sulfamate is 1.38 muM, used as a reference). Compound 6j exhibited the highest potency against the MCF-7 and T47D cell lines (15.9 muM and 8.7 muM, respectively). The GI50 values of tamoxifen (used as a reference) were 6.8; 10.6; 15.1; 12.5 muM against MCF-7, T47D, MDA-MB-231 and SkBr3 cancer cell lines, respectively. Despite the slightly lower activity of compounds 1 and 2 (both in enzymatic and cell-based experiments) compared to 6g and 6j, analogues 1 and 2 proved to selectively inhibit the growth of ER- and PR-positive cell lines.
28151876	Late onset radiation-induced constrictive pericarditis and cardiomyopathy after radiotherapy: A case report.	INTRODUCTION: Radiation-induced heart disease (RIHD) is a serious side effect of cancer treatment, including coronary artery disease, valvular cardiac dysfunction, cardiomyopathy, aortopathy, and chronic constrictive pericarditis. Herein, this case we present was diagnosed as radiation-induced constrictive pericarditis and cardiomyopathy by means of cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) and transthoracic echocardiogram, finally confirmed by pathology after performing heart transplant operation. CONCLUSIONS: This case supports a notion that RIHD often causes multiple heart impairment and CMR is helpful to diagnose cardiomyopathy after radiation.
28147366	What Should Be Done in Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients with Prior Malignancy?	BACKGROUND: Treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in patients with prior malignancy is challenging because therapeutic immunosuppression required for controlling IBD activity may increase the risk of cancer recurrence. Key Messages: Contrary to the observations in the post-transplant population, retrospective observational studies of IBD patients with prior malignancy have not demonstrated that immunosuppressive drugs increased significantly the risk of new or recurrent cancer. However, these studies are highly biased and do not permit the use of these drugs. Factors like the time since treatment completion, severity, and subtype of prior cancer should be weighed along with the current IBD activity before choosing the best therapeutic strategy. In practice, most cases of prior cancer require a delay of at least 2 years before starting or resuming immunosuppressants, including anti-TNF agents. This delay should be extended to 5 years in cancer with a high risk of recurrence including cancer of the urinary tract, gastrointestinal cancer, leukemias, and multiple myeloma. A special attention should be paid to cancers with a high risk of late metastasis (breast, melanoma, renal cell carcinoma). Enteral nutrition, Budesonide, mesalamine, and limited intestinal resection should be considered following the completion of cancer treatment and prior to the safe initiation of immunosuppressive treatment for IBD. Thiopurines should be avoided in case of prior Epstein-Barr virus-related lymphoma, HPV-related carcinomas, and cancer of the urinary tract. Methotrexate and anti-TNF agents seem to be safe except for the risk of recurrent melanoma for the latter. CONCLUSION: IBD patients with prior malignancy should benefit from individual decisions made on a case-by-case basis.
28147234	Antimicrobial and anticancer activities of porous chitosan-alginate biosynthesized silver nanoparticles.	The main aim of this study was to obtain porous antimicrobial composites consisting of chitosan, alginate, and biosynthesized silver nanoparticles (AgNPs). Chitosan and alginate were used owing to their pore-forming capacity, while AgNPs were used for their antimicrobial property. The developed porous composites of chitosan-alginate-AgNPs were characterized using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The FT-IR results revealed the presence of a strong chemical interaction between chitosan and alginate due to polyelectrolyte complex; whereas, the XRD results confirmed the presence of AgNPs in the composites. The dispersion of AgNPs in the porous membrane was uniform with a pore size of 50-500mum. Antimicrobial activity of the composites was checked with Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. The developed composites resulted in the formation of a zone of inhibition of 11+/-1mm for the Escherichia coli, and 10+/-1mm for Staphylococcus aureus. The bacterial filtration efficiency of chitosan-alginate-AgNPs was 1.5-times higher than that of the chitosan-alginate composite. The breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 was used to test the anticancer activity of the composites. The IC50 value of chitosan-alginate-AgNPs on MDA-MB-231 was 4.6mg. The developed chitosan-alginate-AgNPs composite showed a huge potential for its applications in antimicrobial filtration and cancer treatment.
28144687	[Trial sequential analysis : Sample size calculation for reliable meta-analyses].	BACKGROUND: Meta-analyses have a great impact on medical decision-making. Random errors are, however, often the reason for misinterpretation of interventional effects in meta-analyses. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this article is to introduce authors and readers of meta-analyses to the problem of random errors. The article presents trial sequential analysis (TSA) as a suitable and user-friendly method that adjusts for the risk of random errors in meta-analyses. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The practical application of TSA is illustrated and exemplified using regional anesthesiology procedures versus conventional pain therapy with respect to the prevention of persistent postoperative pain after breast cancer surgery or thoracotomy. The results were compared with those from conventional meta-analytical methods. RESULTS: Conventional meta-analytical methods showed a significant advantage for patients after breast cancer surgery as well as after thoracotomy for regional anesthesia procedures with respect to the reduction of persistent postoperative pain. By means of TSA it could be concluded for thoracotomy that the evidence of this meta-analysis was sufficient. In contrast, the TSA for breast cancer surgery showed that based on the current data set and on the basis of relevant assumptions, it is potentially a false indication of an effect. There is currently no evidence that regional anesthesia leads to a significant reduction of persistent postoperative pain. CONCLUSION: The TSA is a suitable tool to minimize the risk of random errors and for a more reliable assessment of the evidence for the results of a meta-analysis.
28144143	Conductive polymer-based nanoparticles for laser-mediated photothermal ablation of cancer: synthesis, characterization, and in vitro evaluation.	Laser-mediated photothermal ablation of cancer cells aided by photothermal agents is a promising strategy for localized, externally controlled cancer treatment. We report the synthesis, characterization, and in vitro evaluation of conductive polymeric nanoparticles (CPNPs) of poly(diethyl-4,4'-{[2,5-bis(2,3-dihydrothieno[3,4-b][1,4]dioxin-5-yl)-1,4-phenyle ne] bis(oxy)}dibutanoate) (P1) and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) stabilized with 4-dodecylbenzenesulfonic acid and poly(4-styrenesulfonic acid-co-maleic acid) as photothermal ablation agents. The nanoparticles were prepared by oxidative-emulsion polymerization, yielding stable aqueous suspensions of spherical particles of <100 nm diameter as determined by dynamic light scattering and electron microscopy. Both types of nanoparticles show strong absorption of light in the near infrared region, with absorption peaks at 780 nm for P1 and 750 nm for PEDOT, as well as high photothermal conversion efficiencies (~50%), that is higher than commercially available gold-based photothermal ablation agents. The nanoparticles show significant photostability as determined by their ability to achieve consistent temperatures and to maintain their morphology upon repeated cycles of laser irradiation. In vitro studies in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells demonstrate the cytocompatibility of the CPNPs and their ability to mediate complete cancer cell ablation upon irradiation with an 808-nm laser, thereby establishing the potential of these systems as agents for laser-induced photothermal therapy.
28144135	Liposomes derivatized with multimeric copies of KCCYSL peptide as targeting agents for HER-2-overexpressing tumor cells.	Mixed liposomes, obtained by coaggregation of 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine and of the synthetic monomer containing a gadolinium complex ([C18]2DTPA[Gd]) have been prepared. Liposomes externally decorated with KCCYSL (P6.1 peptide) sequence in its monomeric, dimeric, and tetrameric forms are studied as target-selective delivery systems toward cancer cells overexpressing human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER-2) receptors. Derivatization of liposomal surface with targeting peptides is achieved using the postmodification method: the alkyne-peptide derivative Pra-KCCYSL reacts, through click chemistry procedures, with a synthetic surfactant modified with 1, 2, or 4 azido moieties previously inserted in liposome formulation. Preliminary in vitro data on MDA-MB-231 and BT-474 cells indicated that liposomes functionalized with P6.1 peptide in its tetrameric form had better binding to and uptake into BT-474 cells compared to liposomes decorated with monomeric or dimeric versions of the P6.1 peptide. BT-474 cells treated with liposomes functionalized with the tetrameric form of P6.1 showed high degree of liposome uptake, which was comparable with the uptake of anti-HER-2 antibodies such as Herceptin. Moreover, magnetic MRI experiments have demonstrated the potential of liposomes to act as MRI contrast agents.
28143986	Expression of Biomarkers CXCR4, IL11-RA, TFF1, MLF1P in Advanced Breast Cancer Patients with Bone Metastatic: a Diagnostic Study.	AIM: to analyze expression of biomarkers CXCR4, IL11-RA, TFF1 and MLF1P, and clinicopathology in advanced breast cancer patients with bone metastatic. METHODS: this is a cross-sectional study. Analysis was done against a total of 92 breast cancer patients, including 46 bone metastatic patients and 46 non-bone metastatic patients. Immunohistochemistry and microarray analysis was performed in 81 formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) samples from 81 patients were used. Data were collected through medical records, immunohistochemistry (IHC), and microarray with nanoString nCounterTM. RESULTS: this article is part one of a two stage reporting research results. In part one we got the results of the IHC analysis, IL11-RA with cut-off >/=103.5 showed OR 3.803 (95 % confidence interval [CI], 1.375-10.581), p=0.010, MLF1P with cut-off >/=83.0 OR 2.784 (95% CI, 1.009-7.681), p=0.048, and ER+ OR 7.640 (95 % CI, 2.599-22.459), p<0.000, were associated with bone metastastic incidences in advanced breast cancer, and were statistically significantly different. A combination of IL-11RA, MLF1P and ER+, showed an accuracy of approaching 80% to discriminate between bone metastatic and non bone metastatic in advanced breast cancer patients. CONCLUSION: IL11-RA, MLF1P, and ER+ were the determinants that were associated with increasing bone metastasis incidence.
28142179	Breast MRI at Very Short TE (minTE): Image Analysis of minTE Sequences on Non-Fat-Saturated, Subtracted T1-Weighted Images.	Purpose The aim was to evaluate a minimum echo time (minTE) protocol for breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in patients with breast lesions compared to a standard TE (nTE) time protocol. Methods Breasts of 144 women were examined with a 1.5 Tesla MRI scanner. Additionally to the standard gradient-echo sequence with nTE (4.8 ms), a variant with minimum TE (1.2 ms) was used in an interleaved fashion which leads to a better temporal resolution and should reduce the scan time by approximately 50 %. Lesion sizes were measured and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) as well as the contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) were calculated. Subjective confidence was evaluated using a 3-point scale before looking at the nTE sequences (1 = very sure that I can identify a lesion and classify it, 2 = quite sure that I can identify a lesion and classify it, 3 = definitely want to see nTE for final assessment) and the subjective image quality of all examinations was evaluated using a four-grade scale (1 = sharp, 2 = slight blur, 3 = moderate blur and 4 = severe blur/not evaluable) for lesion and skin sharpness. Lesion morphology and contrast enhancement were also evaluated. Results With minTE sequences, no lesion was rated with "definitely want to see nTE sequences for final assessment". The difference of the longitudinal and transverse diameter did not differ significantly (p > 0.05). With minTE, lesions and skin were rated to be significantly more blurry (p < 0.01 for lesions and p < 0.05 for skin). There was no difference between both sequences with respect to SNR, CNR, lesion morphology, contrast enhancement and detection of multifocal disease. Conclusion Dynamic breast MRI with a minTE protocol is feasible without a major loss of information (SNR, CNR, lesion morphology, contrast enhancement and lesion sizes) and the temporal resolution can be increased by a factor of 2 using minTE sequences. Key points . Increase of temporal resolution for a better in-flow curve.. . Dynamic breast MRI with a shorter TE time is possible without relevant loss of information.. . Possible decrease of the overall scan time.. Citation Format . Wenkel E, Janka R, Geppert C et al.

28142043	Initiators and promoters for the occurrence of screen-detected breast cancer and the progression to clinically-detected interval breast cancer.	BACKGROUND: The risk factors responsible for breast cancer have been well documented, but the roles of risk factors as initiators, causing the occurrence of screen-detected breast cancer, or promoters, responsible for the progression of the screen-detected to the clinically-detected breast cancer, have been scarcely evaluated. METHODS: We used data from women in a cohort in Kopparberg (Dalarna), Sweden between 1977 and 2010. Conventional risk factors, breast density, and tumor-specific biomarkers are superimposed to the temporal course of the natural history of the disease. RESULTS: The results show that older age at first full-term pregnancy, dense breast, and a family history of breast cancer increased the risk of entering the preclinical screen-detectable phase of breast cancer by 23%, 41%, and 89%, respectively. Overweight/obesity (body mass index >/=25 kg/m2) was a significant initiator (adjusted relative risk [aRR] 1.15; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.99-1.33), but was inversely associated with the role of promoter (aRR 0.65; 95% CI, 0.51-0.82). Dense breast (aRR 1.46; 95% CI, 1.12-1.91), triple-negative (aRR 2.07; 95% CI, 1.37-3.15), and Ki-67 positivity (aRR 1.66; 95% CI, 1.19-2.30) were statistically significant promoters. When the molecular biomarkers were considered collectively as one classification, the basal-like subtype was the most influential subtype on promoters (aRR 4.24; 95% CI, 2.56-7.02) compared with the Luminal A subtype. DISCUSSION: We ascertained state-dependent covariates of initiators and promoters to classify the risk of the two-step progression of breast cancer. The results of the current study are useful for individually-tailored screening and personalized clinical surveillance of patients with breast cancer that was detected at an early stage.
28142040	BMI, reproductive factors, and breast cancer molecular subtypes: A case-control study and meta-analysis.	BACKGROUND: The effects of body mass index (BMI) and reproductive factors may vary among breast cancer molecular subtypes, evidence of which is lacking in East Asia. METHODS: From 2002 to 2010, 1256 breast cancer patients and 1416 healthy women were recruited. Anthropometric and reproductive factors were collected from medical charts. Breast cancer subtype was defined by ER, PR, and HER2 status. Polytomous logistic regression was used to evaluate associations between risk factors and breast cancer subtypes, with subgroup analysis by menopausal status. A meta-analysis of relevant published studies in East Asia was also performed. RESULTS: In our case-control study, late menarche was negatively associated with luminal tumor risk (Ptrend = 0.03). Higher BMI was associated with risk of both luminal and triple-negative tumors (Ptrend<0.001). Late age at first live birth was associated with a 1.41- to 2.08-fold increased risk of all subtypes, while late menopause increased risk by 2.62-5.56 times. Heterogeneity of these associations was not detected for different menopausal statuses. The meta-analysis revealed a positive dose-response relationship between BMI and risk of both luminal and ER-PR- subtypes (Ptrend<0.05). Early menarche and nulliparity increased luminal tumor risk by 1.39 and 1.26 times, respectively. Non-breastfeeding also increased the risk of all subtypes. CONCLUSIONS: For East Asian women, overweight, late menopause, and lack of breastfeeding appear to increase risk of both luminal and ER-PR- tumors. Early menarche and nulliparity mainly impacted luminal tumor risk. These associations were not impacted by menopausal status.
28140614	Preoperative MRI Evaluation of Axillary Lymph Nodes in Invasive Ductal Carcinoma: Comparison of Luminal A Versus Luminal B Subtypes in a Paradigm Using Ki-67 and Receptor Status.	OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to assess whether luminal A versus luminal B molecular subtypes of breast cancer affect the diagnostic utility of preoperative MRI evaluation of the axilla. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study identified 125 patients who underwent preoperative breast MRI evaluation of tumors classifiable as luminal A or luminal B molecular subtypes between January 2012 and August 2014. The subtypes were classified on the basis of immunohistochemical staining surrogates combining receptor status and the Ki-67 proliferation index. Statistical analysis was performed using chi-square analysis and one-way ANOVA. When a statistically significant difference was found, follow-up analysis involving pairwise comparison using the Bonferroni correction was performed. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was also used to determine whether the molecular subtype was independently predictive of lymph node involvement. RESULTS: A total of 80 patients had tumors classifiable as the luminal A molecular subtype, whereas 45 patients had tumors classifiable as the luminal B subtype. Pathologically proven axillary lymph node (ALN) disease occurred statistically significantly more frequently in luminal B tumors (18/45 [40.0%]) than in luminal A tumors (11/80 [13.8%]; p < 0.01). In addition, pathologically proven ALN disease was 4.3 times more likely to occur in luminal B tumors after controlling for patient age, tumor size, and tumor grade (p < 0.01). We found no difference in the negative predictive value of the MRI assessment of the axilla when luminal A tumors were compared with luminal B tumors. The positive predictive value of MRI evaluation of ALNs is statistically significantly higher for luminal B tumors than for luminal A tumors (76.2% vs 28.0%, respectively; p = 0.004). CONCLUSION: With the use of molecular subtype classification including the Ki-67 proliferation index, suspicious nodes detected in luminal B tumors by MRI are likely to have positive findings and warrant preoperative tissue sampling. Conversely, in view of the high false-positive rate of suspicious nodes detected in luminal A tumors by MRI, proceeding straight to sentinel lymph node biopsy for all cases, except for those with highly suspicious findings, is suggested. These results should, however, be validated in a larger prospective study.
28140609	Imaging-Concordant Benign MRI-Guided Vacuum-Assisted Breast Biopsy May Not Warrant MRI Follow-Up.	OBJECTIVE: The follow-up of breast lesions with imaging-concordant benign histopathology results on MRI-guided vacuum-assisted biopsy (VAB) is not currently standardized. We determined the false omission rate of breast MRI-guided VAB with benign histopathology (negative results) to assess whether breast MRI follow-up is needed. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The medical records of patients who underwent 9-gauge breast MRI-guided VAB during 2007-2012 were reviewed retrospectively. Lesions with imaging-concordant benign histopathology results from MRI-guided VAB and surgery or 2 years or more of imaging follow-up were included. The false omission rate (1 - negative predictive value; [number of false-negative results / number of negative results]) of MRI-guided VAB was calculated. RESULTS: One hundred sixty-nine lesions were included, and 135 had only imaging follow-up (mammography follow-up: range, 17-107 months [median, 52 months]; MRI follow-up: range, 5-95 months [median, 35 months]). Of the 135 lesions with only imaging follow-up, 48 had mammography only (range, 26-86 months; median, 52 months), and 87 had mammography (range, 17-107 months; median, 52 months) and MRI (range, 5-95 months; median, 35 months). Thirty-four lesions had surgical correlation, and there were no cases of imaging-surgical discordance. Four malignancies were later diagnosed in the same breast in which MRI-guided VAB had been performed. One (0.6%) malignancy was invasive ductal carcinoma at 1 cm from the MRI-guided VAB site; it was mammographically detected 24 months after MRI-guided VAB. The other three malignancies developed 4 cm or more from the site of MRI-guided VAB: one ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) detected on mammography 12 months after MRI-guided VAB, one DCIS detected on MRI 24 months after MRI-guided VAB, and one Paget disease lesion detected at physical examination 32 months after MRI-guided VAB. CONCLUSION: Breast MRI-guided VAB has a low false omission rate. MRI follow-up of lesions with concordant benign MRI-guided VAB histopathology results may not be warranted.
28139896	Cytopathologic analysis of pericardial effusions in 116 cases: Implications for poor prognosis in lung cancer patients with positive interpretations.	BACKGROUND: Few studies have evaluated the cytology of pericardial effusions. The aim of this study is to investigate the etiologies of pericardial effusions and to establish the relationship between cytopathologic interpretations and outcome patterns among patients with pericardial effusions. METHODS: We identified 116 patients with pericardial effusions at a single institution over a 4-year period and carefully analyzed all available clinical documents, including clinical diagnoses, cytopathologic findings, and outcome patterns. RESULTS: The cohort was made up of 74 patients with malignancies, 39 with non-malignancy diseases, and 3 without available clinical diagnosis. Lung cancer was the most common malignancy (58 cases), followed by breast cancer (4 cases) and lymphoma/leukemia (4 cases). Among the 116 fluid samples, 43 cases were diagnosed as malignant, 66 were diagnosed as benign, and seven were diagnosed as ambiguous. The nature of the hemorrhage was an important feature of cytopathology-positive effusions. Patients with detectable malignant cells in pericardial effusions have a significantly poorer prognosis than those without malignant cells. CONCLUSIONS: Lung cancer is the most common cause of large quantities of pericardial effusions. The present findings suggest that cytopathologic evaluation is valuable to predict the prognosis of cancer patients with pericardial effusions. Diagn. Cytopathol. 2017;45:287-293.

28139362	Eight-year follow up result of the OTOASOR trial: The Optimal Treatment Of the Axilla - Surgery Or Radiotherapy after positive sentinel lymph node biopsy in early-stage breast cancer: A randomized, single centre, phase III, non-inferiority trial.	INTRODUCTION: The National Institute of Oncology, Budapest conducted a single centre randomized clinical study. The OTOASOR (Optimal Treatment Of the Axilla - Surgery Or Radiotherapy) trial compares completion of axillary lymph node dissection (cALND) to regional nodal irradiation (RNI) in patients with sentinel lymph node metastasis (pN1sn) in stage I-II breast cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with primary invasive breast cancer (cN0 and cT </= 3 cm) were randomized before surgery for cALND (standard treatment) or RNI (investigational treatment). Sentinel lymph nodes (SN) were investigated with serial sectioning at 0.5 mm levels by hematoxylin-eosin staining. Investigational treatment arm patients received 50 Gy RNI instead of cALND. Adjuvant treatment and follow up were performed according to the actual guidelines. Between August 2002 and June 2009, 1054 patients were randomized for cALND and 1052 patients for RNI. SN was evaluated in 2073 patients and was positive in 526 patients (25.4%). 474 cases were evaluable (244 in the cALND and 230 in the RNI arm), and in the cALND group 94 of 244 patients (38.5%) who underwent completion axillary surgery has additional positive nodes. The two arms were well balanced according to the majority of main prognostic factors. Primary endpoint was axillary recurrence and secondary endpoints were overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS). RESULTS: Mean follow-up was 97 months (Q1-Q3: 80-120). Axillary recurrence was 2.0% in cALND arm vs. 1.7% in RNI arm (p = 1.00). OS at 8 years was 77.9% vs. 84.8% (p = 0.060), and DFS was 72.1% in cALND arm and 77.4% after RNI (p = 0.51). The results show that RNI is statistically not inferior to cALND treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The long term follow-up results of this prospective-randomized trial suggest that RNI without cALND does not increase the risk of axillary failure in selected patients with early-stage invasive breast cancer (cT </= 3 cm, cN0) and pN1(sn). Axillary radiotherapy should be an alternative treatment for selected patients with sentinel lymph node metastases.
28139203	MRI and FDG-PET/CT based assessment of axillary lymph node metastasis in early breast cancer: a meta-analysis.	AIM: To evaluate the accuracy of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and combined 2-[18F]-fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose (FDG) positron-emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) for N staging of breast cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A search for relevant diagnostic studies published between January 2008 and October 2015 was conducted in the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases. The quality of the studies was assessed using Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS) criteria. Sensitivity and specificity were analysed using the random-effect model and fixed effect model for MRI and PET/CT, respectively. RESULTS: A total of 21 eligible studies were evaluated for the efficacy of MRI or PET/CT for diagnosing axillary lymph node status in breast cancer patients. The pooled specificities of MRI and PET/CT were similar at 0.93 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.92-0.94) and 0.93 (95% CI: 0.90-0.95), respectively; however, the pooled sensitivity of MRI was (0.82; 95% CI: 0.78-0.85) significantly greater than PET/CT (0.64; 95% CI: 0.59-0.69)]. Further analysis revealed that MRI had a significantly higher diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) value of 51.28 (95% CI: 22.44-117.17) compared to PET/CT at 18.84 (95% CI: 11.71-31.76). CONCLUSION: The present meta-analysis suggests that MRI not only has the higher sensitivity for lymph node metastasis diagnosis compared to PET/CT, but also has high potential for being used as a non-invasive imaging diagnostic technique. Furthermore, the ultra-small super paramagnetic iron oxide (USPIO)-enhanced MRI showed high diagnostic accuracy for identifying axillary lymph node metastases in early-stage breast cancer patients.
28138868	Combination treatment using DDX3 and PARP inhibitors induces synthetic lethality in BRCA1-proficient breast cancer.	Triple-negative breast cancers have unfavorable outcomes due to their inherent aggressive behavior and lack of targeted therapies. Breast cancers occurring in BRCA1 mutation carriers are mostly triple-negative and harbor homologous recombination deficiency, sensitizing them to inhibition of a second DNA damage repair pathway by, e.g., PARP inhibitors. Unfortunately, resistance against PARP inhibitors in BRCA1-deficient cancers is common and sensitivity is limited in BRCA1-proficient breast cancers. RK-33, an inhibitor of the RNA helicase DDX3, was previously demonstrated to impede non-homologous end-joining repair of DNA breaks. Consequently, we evaluated DDX3 as a therapeutic target in BRCA pro- and deficient breast cancers and assessed whether DDX3 inhibition could sensitize cells to PARP inhibition. High DDX3 expression was identified by immunohistochemistry in breast cancer samples of 24% of BRCA1 (p = 0.337) and 21% of BRCA2 mutation carriers (p = 0.624), as compared to 30% of sporadic breast cancer samples. The sensitivity to the DDX3 inhibitor RK-33 was similar in BRCA1 pro- and deficient breast cancer cell lines, with IC50 values in the low micromolar range (2.8-6.6 muM). A synergistic interaction was observed for combination treatment with RK-33 and the PARP inhibitor olaparib in BRCA1-proficient breast cancer, with the mean combination index ranging from 0.59 to 0.62. Overall, we conclude that BRCA pro- and deficient breast cancers have a similar dependency upon DDX3. DDX3 inhibition by RK-33 synergizes with PARP inhibitor treatment, especially in breast cancers with a BRCA1-proficient background.
28135863	Evaluation of Tc-99m-3PRGD2 Integrin Receptor Imaging in the Differential Diagnosis of Breast Lesions and Comparison With Mammography.	PURPOSE: The aims of this study were to evaluate and compare efficacies of Tc-99m-3PRGD2 integrin receptor imaging under variety of conditions for the diagnosis of breast lesions, in addition to comparison with mammography. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seventy-two female patients with established breast lesions were recruited. All patients were examined by Tc-99m-3PRGD2 integrin receptor imaging and mammography. Whole-body scan and SPECT/CT were acquired at dual time points of 2 and 4 h after injection using standard protocol. The processed images were evaluated by visual and semi-quantitative analysis. Mammography was performed using up and down and internal and external oblique views. The gold standard of diagnosis was based on histopathological findings. RESULTS: Sensitivity greater than 85.0% and accuracy greater than 80.0% were observed under any technical method. For dense mammary gland, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of Tc-99m-3PRGD2 SPECT/CT 4-h imaging and mammography were 95.2, 75.0, and 90.7%, and 71.4, 58.3, and 68.5% respectively. Combined two methods' sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for detection of breast cancer can reach 98.3, 86.7, and 96.0%. CONCLUSIONS: Tc-99m-3PRGD2-based molecular imaging is a sensitive method for the differential diagnosis of breast lesions. Particularly, Tc-99m-3PRGD2-SPECT/CT has better diagnostic value in dense mammary gland as compared with mammography. Combining two methods can significantly improve the diagnostic efficiency.
28135658	An exploration of Australian psychologists' role in assessing women considering risk-reducing or contralateral prophylactic mastectomy.	OBJECTIVES: Given increasing rates of risk-reducing mastectomies (RRM) and contralateral prophylactic mastectomies (CPM), and the potentially significant psychological sequelae of this irreversible procedure, health professionals (HPs) regularly refer patients to psychologists for pre-operative assessment and support. This is the first study to provide qualitative insights from HPs into the role of psychologists who are working with women considering RRM or CPM. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 24 HPs (psychologists, surgeons, breast care nurses and genetic counsellors) experienced in treating patients before or after RRM/CPM completed semi-structured interviews (n = 15) or participated in a focus group (n = 10). Interviews were qualitatively analysed using Framework methods. RESULTS: Qualitative analysis revealed four interconnected themes: (1) perceived patient motivation to undergo RRM/CPM; (2) HP reasons for psychologist referral; (3) role of the psychologist; and (4) value of psychologist involvement. The reported psychologist role included: mental health assessment, checking understanding of information, ensuring informed decision-making, preparation for the procedure, and management of post-surgical challenges. CONCLUSION: Psychologists are perceived by HPs to have a key role in the multi-disciplinary care of patients considering RRM or CPM.
28134831	SpidermiR: An R/Bioconductor Package for Integrative Analysis with miRNA Data.	Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs) control many biological systems, but how such network coordination is shaped is still unknown. GRNs can be subdivided into basic connections that describe how the network members interact e.g., co-expression, physical interaction, co-localization, genetic influence, pathways, and shared protein domains. The important regulatory mechanisms of these networks involve miRNAs. We developed an R/Bioconductor package, namely SpidermiR, which offers an easy access to both GRNs and miRNAs to the end user, and integrates this information with differentially expressed genes obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas. Specifically, SpidermiR allows the users to: (i) query and download GRNs and miRNAs from validated and predicted repositories; (ii) integrate miRNAs with GRNs in order to obtain miRNA-gene-gene and miRNA-protein-protein interactions, and to analyze miRNA GRNs in order to identify miRNA-gene communities; and (iii) graphically visualize the results of the analyses. These analyses can be performed through a single interface and without the need for any downloads. The full data sets are then rapidly integrated and processed locally.
28134830	Radiation-Induced Organizing Pneumonia: A Characteristic Disease that Requires Symptom-Oriented Management.	Radiation-induced organizing pneumonia (RIOP) is an inflammatory lung disease that is occasionally observed after irradiation to the breast. It is a type of secondary organizing pneumonia that is characterized by infiltrates outside the irradiated volume that are sometimes migratory. Corticosteroids work acutely, but relapse of pneumonia is often experienced. Management of RIOP should simply be symptom-oriented, and the use of corticosteroids should be limited to severe symptoms from the perspective not only of cost-effectiveness but also of cancer treatment. Once steroid therapy is started, it takes a long time to stop it due to frequent relapses. We review RIOP from the perspective of its diagnosis, epidemiology, molecular pathogenesis, and patient management.
28134770	Review: Receptor Targeted Nuclear Imaging of Breast Cancer.	Receptor targeted nuclear imaging directed against molecular markers overexpressed on breast cancer (BC) cells offers a sensitive and specific method for BC imaging. Currently, a few targets such as estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), somatostatin receptor (SSTR), and the gastrin releasing peptide receptor (GRPR) are being investigated for this purpose. Expression of these targets is BC subtype dependent and information that can be gained from lesion visualization is dependent on the target; ER-targeting radiotracers, e.g., can be used to monitor response to anti-estrogen treatment. Here we give an overview of the studies currently under investigation for receptor targeted nuclear imaging of BC. Main findings of imaging studies are summarized and (potential) purposes of lesion visualization by targeting these molecular markers are discussed. Since BC is a very heterogeneous disease and molecular target expression can vary per subtype, but also during disease progression or under influence of treatment, radiotracers for selected imaging purposes should be chosen carefully.
28134654	Does expecting more pain make it more intense? Factors associated with the first week pain trajectories after breast cancer surgery.	The aim of this study was to identify clinical risk factors for unfavorable pain trajectories after breast cancer surgery, to better understand the association between pain expectation, psychological distress, and acute postoperative pain. This prospective study included 563 women treated for breast cancer. Psychological data included questionnaires for depressive symptoms and anxiety. Experimental pain tests for heat and cold were performed before surgery. The amount of oxycodone needed for satisfactory pain relief after surgery was recorded. Pain intensity in the area of operation before surgery and during the first postoperative week and expected intensity of postoperative pain were recorded using the Numerical Rating Scale (NRS 0-10). Pain trajectories were formed to describe both initial intensity (the intercept) and the direction of the pain path (the slope). Factors associated with higher initial pain intensity (the intercept) were the amount of oxycodone needed for adequate analgesia, psychological distress, type of axillary surgery, preoperative pain in the area of the operation, and expectation of postoperative pain. The higher the pain initially was, the faster it resolved over the week. Expectation of severe postoperative pain was associated with higher scores of both experimental and clinical pain intensity and psychological factors. The results confirm that acute pain after breast cancer surgery is a multidimensional phenomenon. Psychological distress, pain expectation, and the patients' report of preoperative pain in the area to be operated should be recognized before surgery. Patients having axillary clearance need more efficient analgesic approaches.
28134567	Blurred digital mammography images: an analysis of technical recall and observer detection performance.	OBJECTIVE: Blurred images in full-field digital mammography are a problem in the UK Breast Screening Programme. Technical recalls may be due to blurring not being seen on lower resolution monitors used for review. This study assesses the visual detection of blurring on a 2.3-MP monitor and a 5-MP report grade monitor and proposes an observer standard for the visual detection of blurring on a 5-MP reporting grade monitor. METHODS: 28 observers assessed 120 images for blurring; 20 images had no blurring present, whereas 100 images had blurring imposed through mathematical simulation at 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8 and 1.0 mm levels of motion. Technical recall rate for both monitors and angular size at each level of motion were calculated. chi2 tests were used to test whether significant differences in blurring detection existed between 2.3- and 5-MP monitors. RESULTS: The technical recall rate for 2.3- and 5-MP monitors are 20.3% and 9.1%, respectively. The angular size for 0.2- to 1-mm motion varied from 55 to 275 arc s. The minimum amount of motion for visual detection of blurring in this study is 0.4 mm. For 0.2-mm simulated motion, there was no significant difference [chi2 (1, N = 1095) = 1.61, p = 0.20] in blurring detection between the 2.3- and 5-MP monitors. CONCLUSION: According to this study, monitors </=2.3 MP are not suitable for technical review of full-field digital mammography images for the detection of blur. Advances in knowledge: This research proposes the first observer standard for the visual detection of blurring.
28133745	Technical Note: Development of a combined molecular breast imaging/ultrasound system for diagnostic evaluation of MBI-detected lesions.	PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to perform a pilot evaluation of an integrated molecular breast imaging/ultrasound (MBI/US) system designed to enable, in real-time, the registration of US to MBI and diagnostic evaluation of breast lesions detected on MBI. METHODS: The MBI/US system was constructed by modifying an existing dual-head cadmium zinc telluride (CZT)-based MBI gamma camera. The upper MBI detector head was replaced with a mesh panel, which allowed an ultrasound probe to access the breast. An optical tracking system was used to monitor the location of the ultrasound transducer, referenced to the MBI detector. The lesion depth at which ultrasound was targeted was estimated from analysis of previously acquired dual-head MBI datasets. A software tool was developed to project the US field of view onto the current MBI image. Correlation of lesion location between both modalities with real-time MBI/US scanning was confirmed in a breast phantom model and assessed in 12 patients with a breast lesion detected on MBI. RESULTS: Combined MBI/US scanning allowed for registration of lesions detected on US and MBI as validated in phantom experiments. In patient studies, successful registration was achieved in 8 of 12 (67%) patients, with complete registration achieved in seven and partial registration achieved in one patient. In 4 of 12 (37%) patients, lesion registration was not achieved, partially attributed to uncertainty in lesion depth estimates from MBI. CONCLUSION: The MBI/US system enabled successful registration of US to MBI in over half of patients studied in this pilot evaluation. Future studies are needed to determine if real-time, registered US imaging of MBI-detected lesions may obviate the need to proceed to more expensive procedures such as contrast-enhanced breast MRI for diagnostic workup or biopsy of MBI findings.
28133604	Interaction of MRE11 and Clinicopathologic Characteristics in Recurrence of Breast Cancer: Individual and Cumulated Receiver Operating Characteristic Analyses.	The interaction between the meiotic recombination 11 homolog A (MRE11) oncoprotein and breast cancer recurrence status remains unclear. The aim of this study was to assess the interaction between MRE11 and clinicopathologic variables in breast cancer. A dataset for 254 subjects with breast cancer (220 nonrecurrent and 34 recurrent) was used in individual and cumulated receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses of MRE11 and 12 clinicopathologic variables for predicting breast cancer recurrence. In individual ROC analysis, the area under curve (AUC) for each predictor of breast cancer recurrence was smaller than 0.7. In cumulated ROC analysis, however, the AUC value for each predictor improved. Ten relevant variables in breast cancer recurrence were used to find the optimal prognostic indicators. The presence of any six of the following ten variables had a high (79%) sensitivity and a high (70%) specificity for predicting breast cancer recurrence: tumor size >/= 2.4 cm, tumor stage II/III, therapy other than hormone therapy, age >/= 52 years, MRE11 positive cells > 50%, body mass index >/= 24, lymph node metastasis, positivity for progesterone receptor, positivity for epidermal growth factor receptor, and negativity for estrogen receptor. In conclusion, this study revealed that these 10 clinicopathologic variables are the minimum discriminators needed for optimal discriminant effectiveness in predicting breast cancer recurrence.
28132583	The evolving role of oral hormonal therapies and review of conjugated estrogens/bazedoxifene for the management of menopausal symptoms.	This review describes the evolving role of oral hormone therapy (HT) for treating menopausal symptoms and preventing osteoporosis, focusing on conjugated estrogens/bazedoxifene (CE/BZA). Estrogens alleviate hot flushes and prevent bone loss associated with menopause. In nonhysterectomized women, a progestin should be added to estrogens to reduce the risk of endometrial cancer. Use of HT declined since the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) studies showed that HT does not prevent coronary heart disease (CHD) and that conjugated estrogens/medroxyprogesterone acetate increased the risk of invasive breast cancer after nearly 5 years of use. However, re-analyses of the WHI data suggest that some risks (eg, CHD, all-cause mortality) may be reduced when HT is initiated in women <60 years of age and <10 years since menopause, compared with later. CE/BZA is the first menopausal HT without a progestogen for nonhysterectomized women. Instead, BZA, a selective estrogen receptor modulator, in combination with CE, protects against estrogenic effects on uterine and breast tissue. Data from 5 large, randomized clinical trials show that CE/BZA reduces hot flush frequency/severity, prevents bone loss, reduces bone turnover, improves the vaginal maturation index and ease of lubrication, and improves some measures of sleep and menopause-specific quality of life. In studies of up to 2 years, there was no increase in endometrial hyperplasia, vaginal bleeding, breast density, or breast pain/tenderness compared with placebo. Venous thromboembolism and stroke are risks of all estrogen-based therapies. The choice of HT should be individualized, with consideration of the risk/benefit profile and tolerability of therapy, as well as patient preferences.
28129886	Diverse tritepenoids from the fruits of Walsura robusta and their reversal of multidrug resistance phenotype in human breast cancer cells.	Four 18 (13 --> 14)-abeo limonoids, five cedrelone limonoids, and five walsurin limonoids were isolated from the fruits of Walsura robusta together with 21 known compounds. Their structures were determined by extensive studies of their one- and two-dimensional NMR spectra and mass spectroscopy results. Among all the isolated compounds, the absolute configurations of 11-oxo-dihydrocedrelone, walsuronoid B, dysoxylumosin G, and walsunoid H were confirmed by single crystal X-ray diffraction. Selected compounds were evaluated for their reversal of multidrug resistance (MDR) phenotype in human breast cancer cells in vitro. Walsurin A showed significant effect in sensitization of these resistant cancer cells at non-toxic concentration to doxorubicin with the modulation factor of 62.76.
28129628	Seroma indicates increased risk of lymphedema following breast cancer treatment: A retrospective cohort study.	INTRODUCTION: Lymphedema is one of the most serious complications following breast cancer treatment. While many risk factors are well described the role of seroma formation has recently produced mixed results. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate if seroma is a risk factor for development of lymphedema in one of the largest retrospective cohort studies. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We included all patients with unilateral breast cancer treated in the period of 2008-2014. Data regarding treatment and breast cancer characteristics were retrieved from the national breast cancer registry. Data regarding lymphedema treatment and seroma aspirations were retrieved from local treatment codes. RESULTS: In total 1822 patients were included of which 291 developed lymphedema. Multivariate cox regression analysis showed that seroma was an independent risk factor (HR 1.92 CI 1.30-2.85, p= 0.001). Other independent risk factors were lymphadenectomy, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, BMI above 30, total lymph nodes removed above 15 and higher number of metastatic lymph nodes. CONCLUSIONS: Postoperative seroma doubles the risk of developing lymphedema. Future studies should examine if seroma reducing measures will lead to lower risk of lymphedema.
28127549	A Systematic Framework for Drug Repositioning from Integrated Omics and Drug Phenotype Profiles Using Pathway-Drug Network.	Drug repositioning offers new clinical indications for old drugs. Recently, many computational approaches have been developed to repurpose marketed drugs in human diseases by mining various of biological data including disease expression profiles, pathways, drug phenotype expression profiles, and chemical structure data. However, despite encouraging results, a comprehensive and efficient computational drug repositioning approach is needed that includes the high-level integration of available resources. In this study, we propose a systematic framework employing experimental genomic knowledge and pharmaceutical knowledge to reposition drugs for a specific disease. Specifically, we first obtain experimental genomic knowledge from disease gene expression profiles and pharmaceutical knowledge from drug phenotype expression profiles and construct a pathway-drug network representing a priori known associations between drugs and pathways. To discover promising candidates for drug repositioning, we initialize node labels for the pathway-drug network using identified disease pathways and known drugs associated with the phenotype of interest and perform network propagation in a semisupervised manner. To evaluate our method, we conducted some experiments to reposition 1309 drugs based on four different breast cancer datasets and verified the results of promising candidate drugs for breast cancer by a two-step validation procedure. Consequently, our experimental results showed that the proposed framework is quite useful approach to discover promising candidates for breast cancer treatment.
28127383	A Fusion-Based Approach for Breast Ultrasound Image Classification Using Multiple-ROI Texture and Morphological Analyses.	Ultrasound imaging is commonly used for breast cancer diagnosis, but accurate interpretation of breast ultrasound (BUS) images is often challenging and operator-dependent. Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems can be employed to provide the radiologists with a second opinion to improve the diagnosis accuracy. In this study, a new CAD system is developed to enable accurate BUS image classification. In particular, an improved texture analysis is introduced, in which the tumor is divided into a set of nonoverlapping regions of interest (ROIs). Each ROI is analyzed using gray-level cooccurrence matrix features and a support vector machine classifier to estimate its tumor class indicator. The tumor class indicators of all ROIs are combined using a voting mechanism to estimate the tumor class. In addition, morphological analysis is employed to classify the tumor. A probabilistic approach is used to fuse the classification results of the multiple-ROI texture analysis and morphological analysis. The proposed approach is applied to classify 110 BUS images that include 64 benign and 46 malignant tumors. The accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity obtained using the proposed approach are 98.2%, 98.4%, and 97.8%, respectively. These results demonstrate that the proposed approach can effectively be used to differentiate benign and malignant tumors.
28127114	CACNA1B (Cav2.2) Overexpression and Its Association with Clinicopathologic Characteristics and Unfavorable Prognosis in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.	CACNA1B (Cav2.2) encodes an N-type voltage-gated calcium channel (VGCC) ubiquitously expressed in brain and peripheral nervous system that is important for regulating neuropathic pain. Because intracellular calcium concentration is a key player in cell proliferation and apoptosis, VGCCs are implicated in tumorigenesis. Recent studies have identified CACNA1B (Cav2.2) being overexpressed in prostate and breast cancer tissues when compared to adjacent normal tissues; however, its role in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has not been investigated. In this study, we determined the mRNA and protein expression of CACNA1B (Cav2.2) in NSCLC tumorous and adjacent nontumorous tissues by quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) and tissue microarray immunohistochemistry analysis (TMA-IHC), respectively. CACNA1B (Cav2.2) protein expressions in tumorous tissues were correlated with NSCLC patients' clinical characteristics and overall survival. CACNA1B (Cav2.2) mRNA and protein expression levels were higher in NSCLC tumorous tissues than in nontumorous tissues. High CACNA1B (Cav2.2) protein expression was associated with higher TNM stages, and CACNA1B (Cav2.2) protein expression is an independent prognostic marker in NSCLC. Based on our results, we conclude that CACNA1B (Cav2.2) plays a role in NSCLC development and progression. Elucidating the underlying mechanism may help design novel treatment by specifically targeting the calcium regulation pathway for NSCLC, a devastating disease with increasing incidence and mortality in China.
28126676	MiR-199a-3p enhances breast cancer cell sensitivity to cisplatin by downregulating TFAM (TFAM).	Chemotherapy resistance is the major obstacle to the effective therapy of cancer. While the mechanism of chemotherapy resistance is still not fully understood. Increasing evidences demonstrated that microRNAs (miRNAs) may have a crucial function in chemotherapy resistance through modulating intracellular pathways. MiR-199a has been shown to be involved in multiple malignancy-related processes, although the precise mechanism is unclear at present. In this study, we found that the expression level of miR-199a-3p was lower in cisplatin (DDP) resistant breast cancer MDA-MB-231/DDP cells compared with parental DDP-sensitive cells. Inhibition of miR-199a-3p in MDA-MB-231 cells significantly attenuated DDP-induced apoptosis and anti-proliferative effects, while overexpression of miR-199a-3p in MDA-MB-231/DDP cells increased the sensitivity to DDP. Moreover, expression levels of mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM) were modulated by miR-199a-3p. The luciferase reporter assay indicated that TFAM may be the target gene of miR-199a. Knocking down of TFAM could partially reverse DDP resistance in MDA-MB-231 cells induced by miR-199a-3p inhibition, while TFAM overexpression could partially restore miR-199a-3p-induced chemo-sensitivity of MDA-MB-231/DDP cells to DDP. These results show that miR-199a-3p is able to attenuate cisplatin resistance in breast cancer cells through inhibiting TFAM expression.
28126188	[Cell cycle inhibitors in endocrine receptor positive breast cancer].	Dysregulation of cellular cycle is a key component of carcinogenesis and its targeting represents an interesting approach. Recently, the development of selective inhibitors of the cycle targeting the cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK) 4 and 6 revived interest in this therapeutic class after the failure of pan-inhibitors. Palbociclib, ribociclib, and abemaciclib are the 3 drugs with the most advanced development. They demonstrated preclinical activity in luminal breast cancer models and are under clinical evaluation. The first available studies demonstrate the value of these compounds with an improved prognosis of metastatic patients in combination with endocrine therapy (palbociclib, ribociclib) or in monotherapy (abemaciclib). The results of ongoing studies will clarify the role of these agents in our new strategies and the individualisation of biomarkers will help to define patients who benefit most from this approach.
28124996	Expression of Lipid Metabolism-Related Proteins Differs between Invasive Lobular Carcinoma and Invasive Ductal Carcinoma.	We comparatively investigated the expression and clinical implications of lipid metabolism-related proteins in invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) and invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) of the breast. A total of 584 breast cancers (108 ILC and 476 IDC) were subjected to tissue microarray and immunohistochemical analysis for lipid metabolism-related proteins including hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL), perilipin A, fatty acid binding protein (FABP)4, carnitine palmitoyltransferase (CPT)-1, acyl-CoA oxidase 1, and fatty acid synthetase (FASN). HSL, perilipin A, and FABP4 expression (all p < 0.001) differed significantly: HSL and FABP4 were more frequently present in ILC, whereas perilipin A was more frequently detected in IDC. Among all invasive cancers, HSL and FABP4 were highly expressed in luminal A-type ILC (p < 0.001) and perilipin A in luminal A-type IDC (p = 0.007). Among luminal B-type cancers, HSL and FABP4 were more highly expressed in ILC (p < 0.001). Univariate analysis found associations of shorter disease-free survival with CPT-1 positivity (p = 0.004) and acyl-CoA oxidase 1 positivity (p = 0.032) and of shorter overall survival with acyl-CoA oxidase 1 positivity (p = 0.027). In conclusion, ILC and IDC exhibited different immunohistochemical lipid metabolism-related protein expression profiles. Notably, ILC exhibited high HSL and FABP4 and low perilipin A expression.
28124093	Neoadjuvant radiotherapy followed by mastectomy and immediate breast reconstruction : An alternative treatment option for locally advanced breast cancer.	BACKGROUND: The optimal sequence of mastectomy with immediate breast reconstruction (IBR) and radiotherapy (RT) for the treatment of locally advanced breast cancer (LABC) is still under debate. Increased rates of postoperative complications are described following postmastectomy RT. Neoadjuvant RT aims to improve the aesthetic results and simplify the reconstructive pathway. PATIENTS: A total of 22 patients diagnosed with LABC and treated with neoadjuvant RT followed by mastectomy and IBR between 04/2012 and 03/2015 were retrospectively analyzed. RT consisted of external beam RT to the breast and the regional lymphatics, if indicated. Both implant-based and autologous tissue-transfer reconstruction techniques were used. RESULTS: At the time of RT, 10 patients had no prior surgery and 12 patients had previously undergone breast-conserving surgery (BCS) with positive resection margins without the possibility to perform a second BCS. Additional neoadjuvant chemotherapy was administered in 18 patients prior to RT. A complete pathological response was achieved in 55.0% of patients. The 2year overall survival rate was 89.3%, the 2year disease-free-survival 79.8% and the local-recurrence-free survival was 95.2%. The cosmetic result was excellent or good in 66% of the patients treated with upfront mastectomy and 37% of the patients who had previously undergone BCS. Among patients who received implant-based IBR, 4 patients developed serious wound-healing problems with implant loss. The most satisfactory results were achieved with autologous tissue reconstruction. CONCLUSION: A sequential neoadjuvant chemo-/radiotherapy to allow IBR following mastectomy in selected cases of LABC seems feasible and can be safely attempted. Careful patient selection, close monitoring, and continuous patient support is mandatory to ensure compliance in this treatment strategy.
28122891	Are hospital cancer caseloads related to the validity of staging data reported? A lesson from National Cancer Registry in Taiwan.	OBJECTIVE: Data from the National Taiwan Cancer Registry have been widely used since 2002 to assess quality of health, but its quality of coding in cancer staging data has not been discussed. This study assessed the agreement rate for staging by site visit at medical institutes. METHODS: In this retrospective chart review study, 392 cancer patients in year 2013 were randomly selected from 14 hospitals; the senior cancer registrar reviewers had compared each original chart with data from the Taiwan Cancer Registry to assess agreement rate for staging. The hospitals were classified into two groups on the basis of the number of cancer patients. The kappa (kappa) statistic method and multiple regression analysis were used to compare among the medical institutes and qualified cancer registrars. RESULTS: The agreement rate was high in pharynx, esophageal, rectal, breast and prostate cancers, and low in ovarian and other cancers for clinical and pathological staging. After adjustment for the experience of the qualified cancer registrar, low-caseload hospitals had a significantly lower clinical staging agreement rate than that of high-caseload hospitals. After controlling the hospital cancer caseloads the cancer registrar background becomes one of significant factor. That is long duration between a basic license to an advanced license exceeded 5 years, having lower agreement rate. CONCLUSIONS: The reliability of staging data in the Taiwan Cancer Registry is affected not only by the cancer type but also by the number of patients treated in hospital. Moreover, the experience of cancer registrar strongly influences agreement rate, especially in clinical staging.
28122890	Efficacy of reduced dose of pegfilgrastim in Japanese breast cancer patients receiving dose-dense doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide therapy.	BACKGROUND: This retrospective study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of a 3.6-mg dose of pegfilgrastim for primary prophylaxis in Japanese breast cancer patients receiving dose-dense chemotherapy. METHODS: Patients treated with adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy for early-stage breast cancer at the Tokyo-West Tokushukai Hospital were included in this analysis. Because 6 mg pegfilgrastim has not yet been approved for use in Japan, we compared the outcomes of a dose-dense doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide regimen plus 3.6 mg pegfilgrastim support with a conventional dose epirubicin and cyclophosphamide regimen. The incidence of febrile neutropenia, relative dose intensity, dose delay, dose reduction, regimen change and hospitalization because of neutropenia were assessed. RESULTS: From November 2013 to March 2016, 97 patients with stage I-III invasive breast cancer were analyzed (dose-dense doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide plus 3.6-mg pegfilgrastim group, n = 41; epirubicin and cyclophosphamide group, n = 56; median ages, 49.0 and 48.5 years, respectively). Febrile neutropenia occurred during the first chemotherapy cycle in 7 of 56 patients (12.5%) in the epirubicin and cyclophosphamide group and 0 of 41 patients in the dose-dense doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide group (P = 0.02). The average relative dose intensities were 97.9% and 96.8%, respectively (P = 0.28), with corresponding dose delay rates of 4.9% (2/41) and 16.1% (9/56), respectively (P = 0.11) and dose reduction rates of 0% (0/41) and 7.1% (4/56), respectively (P = 0.16). CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate the efficacy of a 3.6-mg pegfilgrastim dose for the primary prevention of febrile neutropenia in dose-dense doxorubicin- and cyclophosphamide-treated Japanese breast cancer patients.
28122307	HCRP1 downregulation promotes hepatocellular carcinoma cell migration and invasion through the induction of EGFR activation and epithelial-mesenchymal transition.	Hepatocellular carcinoma related protein 1 (HCRP1), which is essential for internalization and degradation of ubiquitinated membrane receptors, is downregulated in several tumors and strongly affects the outcomes of cancer patients. It is reported the expression of HCRP1 is inversely related to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in breast cancer and lead to resistance to cetuximab in ovarian cancer. However, its exact mechanism in the progression of Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unknown. Herein, HCRP1 expression and its clinical significance were examined in 101 HCC patients using immunohistochemistry. Cell proliferation, migration and invasion assays were conducted in HCC cell lines. EGFR activation and degradation were then observed after EGF inducing in HCRP1 knockdown HepG2 cells. In addition, we also detected whether epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) was involved in the malignancy promoted by HCRP1. The results showed that 59 of the 101 HCC cases exhibited downregulation of HCRP1 expression (P<0.01) as compared to 30 benign liver lesions and 20 normal liver tissues, all of which showed a high level of HCRP1. HCRP1 expression was significantly related to age (P=0.017), pathological grade (P=0.003), tumor encapsulation (P=0.037), recurrence (P=0.039) and death (P=0.015), but unrelated to cirrhosis (P=0.216), tumor size (P=0.273), and distant metastasis (P=0.554). Lower HCRP1 expression was correlated with shorter RFS and OS (P<0.001), and decreased HCRP1 level is an independent prognostic marker in HCC patients (P<0.05). Overexpression of HCRP1 decreased and knockdown increased HCC cell proliferation, migration and invasion. HCRP1 depletion increased EGFR activation and inhibited EGFR degradation. EMT phenotype was promoted after HCRP1 downregulation via increase of Snail and Twist1 and activation of Akt phosphorylation in HepG2 cells. Conversely, upregulation of HCRP1 in SMMC-7721 cells led to the opposite effect. In conclusion, our study indicated that downregulation of HCRP1 is a valuable prognostic factor involved in EGFR regulation and acquisition of the mesenchymal phenotype of HCC cells.
28121956	Better survival in PMRT of female breast cancer patients with >5 negative lymph nodes: A population-based study.	Many studies have confirmed the role of postmastectomy radiotherapy (PMRT) for breast cancer patients with at least 4 lymph nodes invasion in the postoperative therapy. Recently, the number of negative lymph nodes (NLNs) has been increasingly paid attention to and recognized as a prognostic indicator in different kinds of caners. Therefore, it is very necessary to study the association between the number of NLNs and the prognosis of PMRT in breast cancer patients. In our study, we used Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) population-based data and identified 16,686 breast cancer patients to explore their correlation. The ROC curve and the log-rank chi test were applied to determine the appropriate cutoff point of the number of NLNs and 5 was selected as the cutoff point. Furthermore, the cutoff point 5 was validated as an independent prognostic factor affecting cancer-specific survival (CSS) and overall survival (OS) in breast cancer patients, as confirmed by both univariate and multivariate analysis (P < 0.001). In addition, subgroup analysis showed that the number of NLNs >5 can be a prognostic indicator in patients with PMRT according to different clinical variables (all, P < 0.001). Importantly, our results showed that PMRT obviously improved CSS and OS in patients regardless of the number of NLNs (P < 0.001). In conclusion, our study showed the number of NLNs is an independent prognostic factor for breast cancer patients with PMRT, and those who have higher number of NLNs have an increased CSS and OS.
28121948	Bioimpedance spectroscopy can precisely discriminate human breast carcinoma from benign tumors.	Intraoperative frozen pathology is critical when a breast tumor is not diagnosed before surgery. However, frozen tumor tissues always present various microscopic morphologies, leading to a high misdiagnose rate from frozen section examination. Thus, we aimed to identify breast tumors using bioimpedance spectroscopy (BIS), a technology that measures the tissues' impedance. We collected and measured 976 specimens from breast patients during surgery, including 581 breast cancers, 190 benign tumors, and 205 normal mammary gland tissues. After measurement, Cole-Cole curves were generated by a bioimpedance analyzer and parameters R0/Rinfinity, fc, and alpha were calculated from the curve. The Cole-Cole curves showed a trend to differentiate mammary gland, benign tumors, and cancer. However, there were some curves overlapped with other groups, showing that it is not an ideal model. Subsequent univariate analysis of R0/Rinfinity, fc, and alpha showed significant differences between benign tumor and cancer. However, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis indicated the diagnostic value of fc and R0/Rinfinity were not superior to frozen sections (area under curve [AUC] = 0.836 and 0.849, respectively), and alpha was useless in diagnosis (AUC = 0.596). After further research, we found a scatter diagram that showed a synergistic effect of the R0/Rinfinity and fc, in discriminating cancer from benign tumors. Thus, we used multivariate analysis, which revealed that these two parameters were independent predictors, to combine them. A simplified equation, RF = 0.2fc + 3.6R0/Rinfinity, based on multivariate analysis was developed. The ROC curve for RF' showed an AUC = 0.939, and the sensitivity and specificity were 82.62% and 95.79%, respectively. To match a clinical setting, the diagnostic criteria were set at 6.91 and 12.9 for negative and positive diagnosis, respectively. In conclusion, RF' derived from BIS can discriminate benign tumor and cancers, and integrated criteria were developed for diagnosis.
28121208	FGFR-targeted therapeutics for the treatment of breast cancer.	INTRODUCTION: Breast cancer is a complex disease and several molecular drivers regulate its progression. Fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) signaling is frequently deregulated in many cancers, including breast cancer. Due the involvement of the FGFR/FGF axis in the pathogenesis and progression of tumors, FGFR-targeted agents might represent a potential therapeutic option for breast cancer patients. Areas covered: This review offers an overview of targeted agents against FGFRs and their clinical development in breast cancer. The most relevant literature and the latest studies in the Clinicaltrial.com database have been discussed. Expert opinion: FGFR inhibition has been recently considered as a promising therapeutic option for different tumor types. However, preliminary results of clinical trials of FGFR inhibitors in breast cancer have been quite disappointing. In order to increase the clinical benefit of FGFR therapies in breast cancer, future studies should focus on: understanding the role of the various FGFR aberrations in cancer progression; identifying potential biomarkers to select patients that could benefit of FGFR inhibitors and developing therapeutic strategies that improve the efficacy of these agents and minimize toxicities.
28121002	Immune enhancement effects and extraction optimization of polysaccharides from Citrus aurantium L. var. amara Engl.	The crude polysaccharides of Citrus aurantium L. var. amara Engl (CAVAPs) were extracted and their bioactivities including DPPH radical scavenging activity, cytotoxicity to human breast cancer cells, MCF-7, as well as lung cancer cells, HCC827, and their immune-enhancement activity were evaluated. Results showed that CAVAPs exhibited better immunoenhancement activity compared to the DPPH radical scavenging and anticancer activities. Subsequently, the immune enhancement activity of CAVAPs on RAW264.7 cells was further observed and the results displayed that CAVAPs could significantly stimulate the production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in RAW264.7 cells, and promote the mRNA expression levels of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), TNF-alpha, interleukin-1 beta (IL-1beta), and IL-6. Furthermore, western blot analysis demonstrated that the phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), phosphorylated c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), phosphorylated p38 and phosphorylated p65 were all remarkably increased in CAVAP-treated RAW264.7 cells. All these results indicated that CAVAPs might activate macrophages through the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) signaling pathway. Additionally, a three-level-three-factor Box-Behnken design (BBD) was performed to optimize the extraction process of CAVAPs for the purpose of application and further research. The maximum extraction yield reached 4.49 +/- 0.25%.
28118455	Trends and Patterns of Disparities in Cancer Mortality Among US Counties, 1980-2014.	Introduction: Cancer is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States and results in a high economic burden. Objective: To estimate age-standardized mortality rates by US county from 29 cancers. Design and Setting: Deidentified death records from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) and population counts from the Census Bureau, the NCHS, and the Human Mortality Database from 1980 to 2014 were used. Validated small area estimation models were used to estimate county-level mortality rates from 29 cancers: lip and oral cavity; nasopharynx; other pharynx; esophageal; stomach; colon and rectum; liver; gallbladder and biliary; pancreatic; larynx; tracheal, bronchus, and lung; malignant skin melanoma; nonmelanoma skin cancer; breast; cervical; uterine; ovarian; prostate; testicular; kidney; bladder; brain and nervous system; thyroid; mesothelioma; Hodgkin lymphoma; non-Hodgkin lymphoma; multiple myeloma; leukemia; and all other cancers combined. Exposure: County of residence. Main Outcomes and Measures: Age-standardized cancer mortality rates by county, year, sex, and cancer type. Results: A total of 19511910 cancer deaths were recorded in the United States between 1980 and 2014, including 5656423 due to tracheal, bronchus, and lung cancer; 2484476 due to colon and rectum cancer; 1573593 due to breast cancer; 1077030 due to prostate cancer; 1157878 due to pancreatic cancer; 209314 due to uterine cancer; 421628 due to kidney cancer; 487518 due to liver cancer; 13927 due to testicular cancer; and 829396 due to non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Cancer mortality decreased by 20.1% (95% uncertainty interval [UI], 18.2%-21.4%) between 1980 and 2014, from 240.2 (95% UI, 235.8-244.1) to 192.0 (95% UI, 188.6-197.7) deaths per 100000 population. There were large differences in the mortality rate among counties throughout the period: in 1980, cancer mortality ranged from 130.6 (95% UI, 114.7-146.0) per 100000 population in Summit County, Colorado, to 386.9 (95% UI, 330.5-450.7) in North Slope Borough, Alaska, and in 2014 from 70.7 (95% UI, 63.2-79.0) in Summit County, Colorado, to 503.1 (95% UI, 464.9-545.4) in Union County, Florida. For many cancers, there were distinct clusters of counties with especially high mortality. The location of these clusters varied by type of cancer and were spread in different regions of the United States. Clusters of breast cancer were present in the southern belt and along the Mississippi River, while liver cancer was high along the Texas-Mexico border, and clusters of kidney cancer were observed in North and South Dakota and counties in West Virginia, Ohio, Indiana, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Texas, Alaska, and Illinois. Conclusions and Relevance: Cancer mortality declined overall in the United States between 1980 and 2014. Over this same period, there were important changes in trends, patterns, and differences in cancer mortality among US counties. These patterns may inform further research into improving prevention and treatment.
28118214	Pectoral Nerve and Transverse Abdominis Plane Block in a Patient Undergoing Mastectomy With Transverse Rectus Abdominis Muscle Flap: A Case Report.	Postoperative nausea, vomiting, and pain present considerable concerns after reconstructive breast surgery. We present a case report of a 65-year-old woman with a history of severe postoperative nausea and vomiting, presenting for unilateral mastectomy with transverse rectus abdominis muscle flap. We performed unilateral pectoral nerve block and transverse abdominis plane block, which provided 24 hours of pain control and mitigated nausea and vomiting during the postoperative period.
28118074	GPER Promoter Methylation Controls GPER Expression in Breast Cancer Patients.	Recently, we found that G-protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER) protein expression decreased during breast carcinogenesis, and that GPER promoter is methylated. Here we analyzed GPER promoter methylation in 260 primary breast cancer specimens by methylation-specific polymerized chain reaction. The results demonstrated that GPER protein down-regulation significantly correlated with GPER promoter hypermethylation (p < .001). Comparison of 108 tumors and matched normal breast tissues indicated a significant GPER down-regulation in cancer tissues correlating with GPER promoter hypermethylation (p < .001). The latter was an unfavorable factor for overall survival of patients with triple-negative breast cancer (p = .025). Thus GPER promoter hypermethylation might be used as a prognostic factor.
28118035	Is the outcome at surgery different when flat epithelial atypia and lobular neoplasia are found in association at biopsy?	OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact on the final outcome at surgery of flat epithelial atypia (FEA) when found concomitantly with lobular neoplasia (LN) in biopsy specimens compared with pure biopsy-proven FEA. METHODS: The approval from the institutional review board of the CHUM (Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Montreal) was obtained. A retrospective review of our database between 2009 and 2013 identified 81 females (mean age 54 years, range 38-90 years) with 81 FEA biopsy-proven lesions. These were pure or associated with LN only in 59/81 (73%) and 22/81 (27%) cases, respectively. Overall, 57/81 (70%) patients underwent surgery and 24/81 (30%) patients underwent mammographic surveillance with a mean follow-up of 36 months. RESULTS: FEA presented more often as microcalcifications in 68/81 (84%) patients and were mostly amorphous in 49/68 (72%). After excluding radio pathologically discordant cases, pure FEA proved to be malignant at surgery in 1/41 (2%; 95% confidence interval 0.06-12.9). There was no statistically significant difference in the upgrade to malignancy whether FEA lesions were pure or associated to LN at biopsy (p = 0.4245); however, when paired in biopsy specimens, these lesions were more frequently associated with atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH) at surgery than with pure FEA (p = 0.012). CONCLUSION: Our results show a 2% upgrade rate to malignancy of pure FEA lesions. When FEA is found in association with LN at biopsy, surgical excision yields more frequently ADH than pure FEA thus warranting close surveillance or even surgical excision. Advances in knowledge: The association of LN with FEA at biopsy was more frequently associated with ADH at surgery than with pure FEA. If a biopsy-proven FEA lesion is deemed concordant with the imaging finding, when paired with LN at biopsy, careful surveillance or even surgical excision is suggested.
28117679	The Potential of Targeting Ribosome Biogenesis in High-Grade Serous Ovarian Cancer.	Overall survival for patients with ovarian cancer (OC) has shown little improvement for decades meaning new therapeutic options are critical. OC comprises multiple histological subtypes, of which the most common and aggressive subtype is high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC). HGSOC is characterized by genomic structural variations with relatively few recurrent somatic mutations or dominantly acting oncogenes that can be targeted for the development of novel therapies. However, deregulation of pathways controlling homologous recombination (HR) and ribosome biogenesis has been observed in a high proportion of HGSOC, raising the possibility that targeting these basic cellular processes may provide improved patient outcomes. The poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor olaparib has been approved to treat women with defects in HR due to germline BRCA mutations. Recent evidence demonstrated the efficacy of targeting ribosome biogenesis with the specific inhibitor of ribosomal RNA synthesis, CX-5461 in v-myc avian myelocytomatosis viral oncogene homolog (MYC)-driven haematological and prostate cancers. CX-5461 has now progressed to a phase I clinical trial in patients with haematological malignancies and phase I/II trial in breast cancer. Here we review the currently available targeted therapies for HGSOC and discuss the potential of targeting ribosome biogenesis as a novel therapeutic approach against HGSOC.
28116522	Molecular characterization of CD44+/CD24-/Ck+/CD45- cells in benign and malignant breast lesions.	Breast cancer epithelial cells with the CD44+/CD24-/low phenotype possess tumor-initiating cells and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) capacity. Massive parallel sequencing can be an interesting approach to deepen the molecular characterization of these cells. We characterized CD44+/CD24-/cytokeratin(Ck)+/CD45- cells isolated through flow cytometry from 43 biopsy and 6 mastectomy samples harboring different benign and malignant breast lesions. The Ion Torrent Ampliseq Cancer Hotspot panel v2 (CHPv2) was used for the identification of somatic mutations in the DNA extracted from isolated CD44+/CD24-/Ck+/CD45- cells. E-Cadherin and vimentin immunohistochemistry was performed on sections from the corresponding formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) blocks. The percentage of CD44+/CD24-/Ck+/CD45- cells increased significantly from non-malignant to malignant lesions and in association with a significant increase in the expression of vimentin. Non-malignant lesions harbored only a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). Mutations in the tumor suppressor p53 (TP53), NOTCH homolog 1 (NOTCH1), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), and v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog 1 (AKT1) genes were found in isolated CD44+/CD24-/Ck+/CD45- cells from ductal carcinomas in situ (DCIS). Additional mutations in the colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R), ret proto-oncogene (RET), and TP53 genes were also identified in invasive ductal carcinomas (IDCs). The use of massive parallel sequencing technology for this type of application revealed to be extremely effective even when using small amounts of DNA extracted from a low number of cells. Additional studies are now required using larger cohorts to design an appropriate mutational profile for this phenotype.
28115844	Simultaneous delivery of anti-miR21 with doxorubicin prodrug by mimetic lipoprotein nanoparticles for synergistic effect against drug resistance in cancer cells.	The development of drug resistance in cancer cells is one of the major obstacles to achieving effective chemotherapy. We hypothesized that the combination of a doxorubicin (Dox) prodrug and microRNA (miR)21 inhibitor might show synergistic antitumor effects on drug-resistant breast cancer cells. In this study, we aimed to develop new high-density lipoprotein-mimicking nanoparticles (HMNs) for coencapsulation and codelivery of this potential combination. Dox was coupled with a nuclear localization signal (NLS) peptide to construct a prodrug (NLS-Dox), thereby electrostatically condensing miR21 inhibitor (anti-miR21) to form cationic complexes. The HMNs were formulated by shielding these complexes with anionic lipids and Apo AI proteins. We have characterized that the coloaded HMNs had uniformly dispersed distribution, favorable negatively charged surface, and high coencapsulation efficiency. The HMN formulation effectively codelivered NLS-Dox and anti-miR21 into Dox-resistant breast cancer MCF7/ADR cells and wild-type MCF7 cells via a high-density-lipoprotein receptor-mediated pathway, which facilitated the escape of Pgp drug efflux. The coloaded HMNs consisting of NLS-Dox/anti-miR21 demonstrated greater cytotoxicity with enhanced intracellular accumulation in resistant MCF7/ADR cells compared with free Dox solution. The reversal of drug resistance by coloaded HMNs might be attributed to the suppression of miR21 expression and the related antiapoptosis network. Furthermore, the codelivery of anti-miR21 and NLS-Dox by HMNs showed synergistic antiproliferative effects in MCF7/ADR-bearing nude mice, and was more effective in tumor inhibition than other drug formulations. These data suggested that codelivery of anti-miR21 and chemotherapeutic agents by HMNs might be a promising strategy for antitumor therapy, and could restore the drug sensitivity of cancer cells, alter intracellular drug distribution, and ultimately enhance chemotherapeutic effects.
28115461	Assessing family history of chronic disease in primary care: Prevalence, documentation, and appropriate screening.	OBJECTIVE: To assess the proportion of primary care patients who report a family history (FH) of type 2 diabetes, coronary artery disease, breast cancer, or colorectal cancer (CRC); assess concordance of FH information derived from the electronic medical record (EMR) compared with patient-completed health questionnaires; and assess whether appropriate screening was informed by risk based solely on FH. DESIGN: Data from the BETTER (Building on Existing Tools to Improve Chronic Disease Prevention and Screening in Primary Care) trial were used. Patients were mailed questionnaires. Baseline FH and screening data were obtained for enrolled patients from the EMR and health questionnaires. SETTING: Ontario and Alberta. PARTICIPANTS: Randomly selected patients from 8 family practices. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Agreement on FH between the EMR and questionnaire was determined; logistic regression was used to assess significant predictors of screening. RESULTS: In total, 775 of 789 (98%) patients completed the health questionnaire. The mean age of participants was 52.5 years and 72% were female. A minimum of 12% of patients (range 12% to 36%) had a reported FH of 1 of 4 chronic diseases. Among patients with positive FH, the following proportions of patients had that FH recorded in the EMR compared with the questionnaire: diabetes, 24% in the EMR versus 36% on the questionnaire, kappa = 0.466; coronary artery disease, 35% in the EMR versus 22% on the questionnaire, kappa = 0.225; breast cancer, 21% in the EMR versus 22% on the questionnaire, kappa = 0.241; and CRC, 12% in the EMR versus 14% on the questionnaire, kappa = 0.510. There was moderate agreement for diabetes and CRC. The presence of FH was a significant predictor of CRC screening (odds ratio 1.9, 95% CI 1.1 to 3.1). CONCLUSION: A moderate prevalence of FH was found for 4 conditions for which screening recommendations vary with risk based on FH. Having patients self-complete an FH was thought to be feasible; however, questions about FH accuracy and completeness from both self-report and EMR remain. Work is needed to determine how to facilitate the adoption of FH tools into practice as well as strategies linking familial risk to appropriate screening.Trial registration number ISRCTN07170460 (ISRCTN Registry).
28115262	Biological therapeutics of Pongamia pinnata coated zinc oxide nanoparticles against clinically important pathogenic bacteria, fungi and MCF-7 breast cancer cells.	The overuse of antimicrobics and drugs has led to the development of resistance in a number of pathogens and parasites, which leads to great concerns for human health and the environment. Furthermore, breast cancer is the second most common cause of cancer death in women. MCF-7 is a widely used epithelial cancer cell line, derived from breast adenocarcinoma for in vitro breast cancer studies, since the cell line has retained several ideal characteristics particular to the mammary epithelium. In this scenario, the development of novel and eco-friendly drugs are of timely importance. Green synthesis of nanoparticles is cost effective, environmental friendly and does not involve the use of toxic chemicals or elevate energy inputs. This research focused on the anticancer activity of Pongamia pinnata seed extract-fabricated zinc oxide nanoparticles (Pp-ZnO NPs) on human MCF-7 breast cancer cells, antibiofilm activity against bacteria and fungi was also investigated. Nanoparticles were characterized by UV-Vis spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). Pp-ZnO NPs effectively inhibited the growth of Gram positive Bacillus licheniformis (zone of inhibition: 17.3 mm) at 25 mug ml-1 followed by Gram negative Pseudomonas aeruginosa (14.2 mm) and Vibrio parahaemolyticus (12.2 mm). Pp-ZnO NPs also effectively inhibited the biofilm formation of C. albicans at 50 mug ml-1. Cytotoxicity studies revealed that a single treatment with Pp-ZnO NPs significantly reduced the cell viability of breast cancer MCF-7 cells at doses higher than 50 mug ml-1. Morphological changes in the Pp-ZnO NPs treated MCF-7 breast cancer cells were observed using phase contrast microscopy. This study concludes that the green synthesized Pp-ZnO NPs may be used as an effective antimicrobial and antibreast cancer agents.
28114946	Permeability across a novel microfluidic blood-tumor barrier model.	BACKGROUND: The lack of translatable in vitro blood-tumor barrier (BTB) models creates challenges in the development of drugs to treat tumors of the CNS and our understanding of how the vascular changes at the BBB in the presence of a tumor. METHODS: In this study, we characterize a novel microfluidic model of the BTB (and BBB model as a reference) that incorporates flow and induces shear stress on endothelial cells. Cell lines utilized include human umbilical vein endothelial cells co-cultured with CTX-TNA2 rat astrocytes (BBB) or Met-1 metastatic murine breast cancer cells (BTB). Cells were capable of communicating across microfluidic compartments via a porous interface. We characterized the device by comparing permeability of three passive permeability markers and one marker subject to efflux. RESULTS: The permeability of Sulforhodamine 101 was significantly (p < 0.05) higher in the BTB model (13.1 +/- 1.3 x 10-3, n = 4) than the BBB model (2.5 +/- 0.3 x 10-3, n = 6). Similar permeability increases were observed in the BTB model for molecules ranging from 600 Da to 60 kDa. The function of P-gp was intact in both models and consistent with recent published in vivo data. Specifically, the rate of permeability of Rhodamine 123 across the BBB model (0.6 +/- 0.1 x 10-3, n = 4), increased 14-fold in the presence of the P-gp inhibitor verapamil (14.7 +/- 7.5 x 10-3, n = 3) and eightfold with the addition of Cyclosporine A (8.8 +/- 1.8 x 10-3, n = 3). Similar values were noted in the BTB model. CONCLUSIONS: The dynamic microfluidic in vitro BTB model is a novel commercially available model that incorporates shear stress, and has permeability and efflux properties that are similar to in vivo data.
28114552	Association Between Diabetes and Cause-Specific Mortality in Rural and Urban Areas of China.	Importance: In China, diabetes prevalence has increased substantially in recent decades, but there are no reliable estimates of the excess mortality currently associated with diabetes. Objectives: To assess the proportional excess mortality associated with diabetes and estimate the diabetes-related absolute excess mortality in rural and urban areas of China. Design, Setting, and Participants: A 7-year nationwide prospective study of 512869 adults aged 30 to 79 years from 10 (5 rural and 5 urban) regions in China, who were recruited between June 2004 and July 2008 and were followed up until January 2014. Exposures: Diabetes (previously diagnosed or detected by screening) recorded at baseline. Main Outcomes and Measures: All-cause and cause-specific mortality, collected through established death registries. Cox regression was used to estimate adjusted mortality rate ratio (RR) comparing individuals with diabetes vs those without diabetes at baseline. Results: Among the 512869 participants, the mean (SD) age was 51.5 (10.7) years, 59% (n = 302618) were women, and 5.9% (n = 30280) had diabetes (4.1% in rural areas, 8.1% in urban areas, 5.8% of men, 6.1% of women, 3.1% had been previously diagnosed, and 2.8% were detected by screening). During 3.64 million person-years of follow-up, there were 24909 deaths, including 3384 among individuals with diabetes. Compared with adults without diabetes, individuals with diabetes had a significantly increased risk of all-cause mortality (1373 vs 646 deaths per 100000; adjusted RR, 2.00 [95% CI, 1.93-2.08]), which was higher in rural areas than in urban areas (rural RR, 2.17 [95% CI, 2.07-2.29]; urban RR, 1.83 [95% CI, 1.73-1.94]). Presence of diabetes was associated with increased mortality from ischemic heart disease (3287 deaths; RR, 2.40 [95% CI, 2.19-2.63]), stroke (4444 deaths; RR, 1.98 [95% CI, 1.81-2.17]), chronic liver disease (481 deaths; RR, 2.32 [95% CI, 1.76-3.06]), infections (425 deaths; RR, 2.29 [95% CI, 1.76-2.99]), and cancer of the liver (1325 deaths; RR, 1.54 [95% CI, 1.28-1.86]), pancreas (357 deaths; RR, 1.84 [95% CI, 1.35-2.51]), female breast (217 deaths; RR, 1.84 [95% CI, 1.24-2.74]), and female reproductive system (210 deaths; RR, 1.81 [95% CI, 1.20-2.74]). For chronic kidney disease (365 deaths), the RR was higher in rural areas (18.69 [95% CI, 14.22-24.57]) than in urban areas (6.83 [95% CI, 4.73-9.88]). Among those with diabetes, 10% of all deaths (16% rural; 4% urban) were due to definite or probable diabetic ketoacidosis or coma (408 deaths). Conclusions and Relevance: Among adults in China, diabetes was associated with increased mortality from a range of cardiovascular and noncardiovascular diseases. Although diabetes was more common in urban areas, it was associated with greater excess mortality in rural areas.
28112408	Mammographic evidence of microenvironment changes in tumorous breasts.	PURPOSE: The microenvironment of breast tumors plays a critical role in tumorigenesis. As long as the structural integrity of the microenvironment is upheld, the tumor is suppressed. If tissue structure is lost through disruptions in the normal cell cycle, the microenvironment may act as a tumor promoter. Therefore, the properties that distinguish between healthy and tumorous tissues may not be solely in the tumor characteristics but rather in surrounding non-tumor tissue. The goal of this paper was to show preliminary evidence that tissue disruption and loss of homeostasis in breast tissue microenvironment and breast bilateral asymmetry can be quantitatively and objectively assessed from mammography via a localized, wavelet-based analysis of the whole breast. METHODS: A wavelet-based multifractal formalism called the 2D Wavelet Transform Modulus Maxima (WTMM) method was used to quantitate density fluctuations from mammographic breast tissue via the Hurst exponent (H). Each entire mammogram was cut in hundreds of 360 x 360 pixel subregions in a gridding scheme of overlapping sliding windows, with each window boundary separated by 32 pixels. The 2D WTMM method was applied to each subregion individually. A data mining approach was set up to determine which metrics best discriminated between normal vs. cancer cases. These same metrics were then used, without modification, to discriminate between normal vs. benign and benign vs. cancer cases. RESULTS: The density fluctuations in healthy mammographic breast tissue are either monofractal anti-correlated (H < 1/2) for fatty tissue or monofractal long-range correlated (H>1/2) for dense tissue. However, tissue regions with H~1/2, as well as left vs. right breast asymetries, were found preferably in tumorous (benign or cancer) breasts vs. normal breasts, as quantified via a combination metric yielding a P-value ~ 0.0006. No metric considered showed significant differences between cancer vs. benign breasts. CONCLUSIONS: Since mammographic tissue regions associated with uncorrelated (H~1/2) density fluctuations were predominantly in tumorous breasts, and since the underlying physical processes associated with a H~1/2 signature are those of randomness, lack of spatial correlation, and free diffusion, it is hypothesized that this signature is also associated with tissue disruption and loss of tissue homeostasis.
28112399	Estimating organ doses from tube current modulated CT examinations using a generalized linear model.	PURPOSE: Currently, available Computed Tomography dose metrics are mostly based on fixed tube current Monte Carlo (MC) simulations and/or physical measurements such as the size specific dose estimate (SSDE). In addition to not being able to account for Tube Current Modulation (TCM), these dose metrics do not represent actual patient dose. The purpose of this study was to generate and evaluate a dose estimation model based on the Generalized Linear Model (GLM), which extends the ability to estimate organ dose from tube current modulated examinations by incorporating regional descriptors of patient size, scanner output, and other scan-specific variables as needed. METHODS: The collection of a total of 332 patient CT scans at four different institutions was approved by each institution's IRB and used to generate and test organ dose estimation models. The patient population consisted of pediatric and adult patients and included thoracic and abdomen/pelvis scans. The scans were performed on three different CT scanner systems. Manual segmentation of organs, depending on the examined anatomy, was performed on each patient's image series. In addition to the collected images, detailed TCM data were collected for all patients scanned on Siemens CT scanners, while for all GE and Toshiba patients, data representing z-axis-only TCM, extracted from the DICOM header of the images, were used for TCM simulations. A validated MC dosimetry package was used to perform detailed simulation of CT examinations on all 332 patient models to estimate dose to each segmented organ (lungs, breasts, liver, spleen, and kidneys), denoted as reference organ dose values. Approximately 60% of the data were used to train a dose estimation model, while the remaining 40% was used to evaluate performance. Two different methodologies were explored using GLM to generate a dose estimation model: (a) using the conventional exponential relationship between normalized organ dose and size with regional water equivalent diameter (WED) and regional CTDIvol as variables and (b) using the same exponential relationship with the addition of categorical variables such as scanner model and organ to provide a more complete estimate of factors that may affect organ dose. Finally, estimates from generated models were compared to those obtained from SSDE and ImPACT. RESULTS: The Generalized Linear Model yielded organ dose estimates that were significantly closer to the MC reference organ dose values than were organ doses estimated via SSDE or ImPACT. Moreover, the GLM estimates were better than those of SSDE or ImPACT irrespective of whether or not categorical variables were used in the model. While the improvement associated with a categorical variable was substantial in estimating breast dose, the improvement was minor for other organs. CONCLUSIONS: The GLM approach extends the current CT dose estimation methods by allowing the use of additional variables to more accurately estimate organ dose from TCM scans. Thus, this approach may be able to overcome the limitations of current CT dose metrics to provide more accurate estimates of patient dose, in particular, dose to organs with considerable variability across the population.
28112380	miR520c blocks EMT progression of human breast cancer cells by repressing STAT3.	Breast cancer is one of the most malignant diseases world-wide and it ranks the first among female cancers. Masses of intrinsic and extrinsic factors, especially the inflammatory factors can lead to breast cancer. Aberrant activation and accumulation of key molecules can lead to inflammation associated carcinogenesis. The signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (STAT3) is one of them. Therefore, to evaluate the novel molecular mechanisms, STAT3 has become our focus for breast cancer targeted therapy. At present, many tumor suppressing microRNAs have been validated, and are the highlights in research on microRNAs. Thus, we predicted microRNAs which could putatively regulate STAT3 through databases and selected six to screen with Dual-luciferase assay. The result hinted that miR520c could bind with STAT3 3'UTR. We mutated the seed sequence of miR520c on STAT3 3'UTR, which illustrated a reverse effect compared with wild-type of STAT3 3'UTR. Subsequently, STAT3, p-STAT3 and miR520c were assessed in three different grades of breast cancer cells, with the degree of malignancy, we found an escalating trend of STAT3 and p-STAT3, on the contrary, a downward trend of miR520c. We observed STAT3 was deactivated by miR520c. Epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a fatal transfer of cancer progression. To find out whether the downregulation of STAT3 can repress breast cancer motility and invasion ability, we detected EMT markers. The result implied a suppression effect on EMT. We overexpressed STAT3 to conduct rescue experiments, the result showed a recovery of STAT3 and EMT characteristics. Cell motility and invasion property were regained as well. In the study, we elucidated miR520c could inhibit breast cancer EMT by targeting STAT3. It can enrich the mechanism of breast cancer and may lay the foundation for breast cancer targeted treatment.
28112278	Cobimetinib: inhibiting MEK1/2 in BRAF V600-mutant melanoma.	Historically, metastatic melanoma has had extremely poor survival outcomes. The outlook, however, is rapidly changing as new molecularly targeted therapies have vastly improved patient outcomes. One such therapy is the potent mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) 1/2 inhibitor cobimetinib. Recently, cobimetinib was approved for the treatment of metastatic or unresectable melanoma with serine/threonine-protein kinase B-raf (BRAF) V600E or V600K mutations when used in combination with the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib. Currently, multiple clinical trials are investigating this drug combination for the treatment of various cancer types (e.g., breast, melanoma, colorectal). In the phase III coBRIM trial, this combination therapy showed improved melanoma response rates and patient progression-free survival when compared to vemurafenib alone. Additionally, toxicities were generally found to be manageable with dose modification or interruption. However, tumor response to BRAF/MEK inhibition, though rapid, is often short-lived as tumors develop resistance to this combination therapy. Therefore, new trials are beginning to investigate the addition of a third targeted agent or immunotherapy in order to increase the durability of treatment response. These trials are already showing promising preliminary results.
28111258	Mutations and interactions in human ERalpha and bZIP proteins: An in silico approach for cell signaling in breast oncology.	I. BACKGROUND: Metastasis of breast cancer serves the most aggravating cause for transience in breast cancer patients. Accumulating evidences suggest that signal transduction in human breast cancers commences in estrogen-reliant pattern via signaling of the estrogen-receptor alpha-subunit (ERalpha) and XBP-1 (bZIP-domain) proteins. Furthermore, earlier investigations from SAGE and GST pull-down assay, also state that a point mutation in ERalpha leads to a risky factor by resulting into hyper-responsiveness towards estrogen and increased proliferation of breast cancer cells. So, a molecular-level exploration into the signaling mechanism is a prime requisite for future clinical and therapeutic progress. II. METHODS AND RESULTS: Present study explores primarily the residual participation of the two essential proteins from humans to boost the signaling mechanism in malignant breast tumors. So, 3D structures of the respective monomer proteins were demonstrated and mutated protein was homology modeled after the satisfaction of the stereo-chemical features. The functionality was observed to be conserved after mutation. Abrupt increment in protein-protein interactions was studied for the individual optimized and Molecular Dynamics simulated protein complexes. Revelation from supportive statistical significances for several energy calculations, solvent accessibility areas, electrostatic surface potentials and interaction studies led to confer that after mutation, the complex and the individual protein were the most stable and the best interactive one. For metastasis in breast cancer cells, polar charged residues hold a significant contribution. III. CONCLUSION: Therefore, this investigation provides a cogent framework for the interactive studies associated with breast cancer and an exposure towards the lethal impact on mutation.
28111076	Impact of Oncotype DX breast Recurrence Score testing on adjuvant chemotherapy use in early breast cancer: Real world experience in Greater Manchester, UK.	BACKGROUND: The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) recommended the Oncotype DX(R) Breast Recurrence Score(R) (RS) assay as an option for informing adjuvant chemotherapy decisions in node-negative, oestrogen receptor (ER)+, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative early breast cancer assessed to be at intermediate risk of recurrence based on clinicopathological factors. We evaluated the impact of RS testing on adjuvant chemotherapy decision-making in routine clinical practice in a UK Cancer Network. METHODS: RS testing was performed in 201 females with newly diagnosed, ER+, HER2-negative, invasive breast cancer who underwent breast surgery with curative intent, were calculated to have a >3% overall survival benefit at 10 years from adjuvant chemotherapy based on PREDICT, and were considered for adjuvant chemotherapy. The impact of RS testing on adjuvant treatment decisions/associated cost was assessed. RESULTS: In all patients, the multi-disciplinary team recommended chemotherapy but the RS result allowed 127/201 patients (63.2%) to avoid unnecessary adjuvant chemotherapy. Amongst ER+, HER2-negative, node-negative patients (eligible for Oncotype DX testing in UK guidelines), 60.3% were spared chemotherapy. In node-positive patients, the assay reduced the use of chemotherapy by 69.2%. The use of RS testing to guide treatment in these 201 patients was associated with significant cost saving (when considering the cost of RS testing for all patients plus chemotherapy and its associated cost for 74 patients). CONCLUSIONS: Incorporating RS testing into routine clinical practice for selected node-negative and node-positive breast cancer patients significantly reduces the use of chemotherapy (p < 0.001) with its associated morbidity and costs.
28110280	HER2 Gene Protein Assay Is Useful to Determine HER2 Status and Evaluate HER2 Heterogeneity in HER2 Equivocal Breast Cancer.	Objectives: Approximately 15% of breast cancers show equivocal human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) results on HER2 immunohistochemistry (IHC) and are reflexed for fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). However, some cases remain equivocal. In this study, we evaluated these double-equivocal cases by using a novel gene protein assay (GPA), which can simultaneously assess HER2 gene copy number and protein on a single slide using bright-field microscopy. Methods: GPA was performed on 42 HER2 IHC and FISH double-equivocal cases. Results: GPA was negative for amplification in 28 cases, equivocal in three cases, and positive in 11 cases. The GPA results showed excellent concordance with either repeat FISH using a chromosome 17 centromere probe or FISH using an alternative probe. Furthermore, HER2 heterogeneity was identified in three of 11 GPA-positive cases. Conclusions: HER2 GPA performs accurately and is very useful to determine HER2 status in HER2 IHC and FISH double-equivocal breast cancer cases and identify HER2 heterogeneity.
28110253	Synthesis of silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) for anticancer activities (MCF 7 breast and A549 lung cell lines) of the crude extract of Syzygium aromaticum.	In the present report, silver nanoparticles were synthesized using Piper nigrum extract for in vitro cytotoxicity efficacy against MCF-7 and HEP-2 cells. The silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) were formed within 20min and after preliminarily confirmation by UV-Visible spectroscopy (strong peak observed at ~441nm), they were characterized by using FT-IR and HR-TEM. The TEM images show spherical shape of biosynthesized AgNPs with particle size in the range 5-40nm while as compositional analysis were observed by EDAX. MTT assays were carried out for cytotoxicity of various concentrations of biosynthesized silver nanoparticles and Piper nigrum extract ranging from 10 to 100mug. The biosynthesized silver nanoparticles showed a significant anticancer activity against both MCF-7 and Hep-2 cells compared to Piper nigrum extract which was dose dependent. Our study thus revealed an excellent application of greenly synthesized silver nanoparticles using Piper nigrum. The study further suggested the potential therapeutic use of these nanoparticles in cancer study.
28110015	Rapid assessment of estrogenic compounds by CXCL-test illustrated by the screening of the UV-filter derivative benzophenones.	CXCL-test is a method that uses the estrogen-dependent secretion of the natural endogenous chemokine CXCL12 to evaluate the estrogenic activity of molecules. CXCL12 chemokine is involved in the estrogen dependent proliferation of breast cancer cells. Its measure is an indicator of cell proliferation and is used as an alternative test to classical proliferation test. Here we aimed to optimize this test, first to increase the number of tested molecules in a single assay and then to decrease the number of intermediate steps. The optimized CXCL-test was finally used for the evaluation of the estrogenic potency of emerging chemical pollutants: the UV filter benzophenones (BPs). The effect of BPs on CXCL12 secretion was also validated by real time quantitative RT-PCR. The optimized CXCL-test allowed a fast and direct assessment of estrogenic potency of molecules. The estrogenic activities of benzophenones were characterized and divided in two groups. The first one contains weak estrogenic compounds (BP, BP1, BP2, BP3, 234BP and 2344'BP). The second one contains medium estrogenic compounds (4BP, 44'BP, BP8, THB).
28109853	Variants of estrogen receptor alpha and beta genes modify the severity of sporadic breast cancer.	INTRODUCTION: Reproductive factors pose a risk for sporadic breast cancer (BC) development owing to the lifetime exposure to estrogen, a hormone responsible for cell proliferation in the breast. Because variants of the estrogen receptor (ER) alpha and beta genes have been associated with BC risk in numerous populations, the objective of the study was to determine whether the risk and severity of sporadic BC was associated with the rs2228480 (ESR1) and rs4986938 (ESR2) variants in a Brazilian population. METHODS: A total of 253 DNA samples from sporadic BC patients and 257 DNA samples from healthy controls were studied. The samples were genotyped by PCR-RFLP. Epidemiological, clinical, and reproductive factors were analyzed. Statistical tests conducted included the chi2 test, Fisher's exact test, and Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis tests or their parametric equivalents. RESULTS: There was a high frequency of the rs2228480*GG genotype among the ER-positive tumors (OR=2.13; 95% CI=1.189-3.816) and it showed minor association with clinical stage 0 (OR=0.324; 95% CI=0.116-0.904). The rs2228480*GA genotype was associated with minor ER expression, whereas rs2228480*GG was associated with high expression of the progesterone receptor (PR). The frequency of rs4986938*GA was high among women who breastfed (OR=2.11; 95% CI=1.203-3.702), and it showed high association with clinical stage 0 (OR=4.383; 95% CI=1.606-11.96) whereas it had minor association with systemic arterial hypertension (OR=0.53; 95% CI=0.319-0.880). The rs2228480*GG/rs4986938*GG haplotype occurred at a low frequency among women who breastfed (OR=0.525; 95% CI=0.298-0.924) but it was associated with a high expression of PR. CONCLUSION: The rs2228480 and rs4986938 variants did not alter sporadic BC risk, but they did modulate the BC severity.
28109407	Treatment of the axilla in patients with primary breast cancer and low burden axillary disease: Limitations of the evidence from randomised controlled trials.	Invasive breast cancer is the second most common cancer worldwide. It is known to metastasise to the regional axillary lymph nodes but there has been debate over what is the best way to stage and treat the axilla in patients presenting with primary breast cancer. Multiple trials over the last two decades have led to a change in practice from routine axillary lymph node dissection to sentinel lymph node biopsy in patients who are clinically lymph node negative preoperatively. This has resulted in new questions regarding subsequent treatment of some patients. This review will critically appraise the evidence on axillary treatment in patients with low burden axillary disease and highlight limitations of relevant randomised controlled trials.
28109406	Salivary biomarkers in the diagnosis of breast cancer: A review.	Salivary biomarkers could be helpful to characterize breast cancer. Therefore, this review was performed to evaluate the capability of salivary biological markers in the diagnosis and monitoring of breast cancer. Studies were eligible for inclusion if they assessed the potential diagnostic value or other discriminatory properties of biological markers in saliva of patients with breast cancer. The search was performed in six electronic databases (Cochrane, LILACS, PubMed, Science Direct, Scopus, Web of Science). In addition the biomarkers were classified according to their potential clinical application. We identified 567 pertinent studies, of which 13 met the inclusion criteria. Combined biomarker approaches demonstrated better ability to predict breast cancer patients than individual biomarkers. As single biomarker, namely proline, reported great capacity in both early and late stage breast cancer diagnosis. Taurine showed interesting capability to identify early breast cancer individuals. Furthermore, valine also demonstrated excellent diagnostic test accuracy for advanced stages of breast cancer. Only seven studies reported sensitivity and specificity (Zhang et al., 2010; Streckfus et al., 2000a; Brooks et al., 2008; Cheng et al., 2015; Bigler et al., 2002; Zhong et al., 2016; Streckfus, 2009), which varied considerably from 50% to 100%, and from 51% to 97%, respectively. In general, salivary biomarkers identified advanced stages of breast cancer better than early stages. There is currently limited evidence to confirm the putative implementation of salivary biomarkers as diagnostic tools for breast cancer. However, current review provides new research directions.
28109404	How could breast cancer molecular features contribute to locoregional treatment decision making?	Systemic treatments are tailored to breast cancer (BC) heterogeneity, which is not yet taken into account for radiotherapy (RT) personalization. The primary objective of this review is to summarize existing data suggesting BC subtypes and genetic assays are prognostic and predictive biomarkers useful for RT decision-making and to provide implications for their incorporation into future translational and clinical research. The evidence suggesting that BC subtypes also exhibit distinct "locoregional recurrence (LRR)" patterns is retrospective but consistent and validated in over fifteen studies. The HER-2 positive and triple negative subtypes are the most susceptible to locoregional failure. The high risk of the HER-2 positive subtype can be reversed with trastuzumab administration. Very little is known on the subtypes' intrinsic radiosensitivity properties. Genetic assays have assessed retrospectively signatures' prognostic and predictive value in patients' cohorts (several coming from prospective studies) for LRR risk and radiotherapy (RT) benefit. Further confirmation is needed before their introduction into clinical routine. Evidence on the use of molecular biomarkers for adjuvant RT tailoring is emerging but needs validation and introduction into prospective studies. The plethora of modern RT options (partial breast irradiation, hypofractionation), as well as recent evidence pointing towards more extensive radiotherapy, demand introduction of biological features into clinical trials to improve therapeutic decisions. Open questions, such as tailoring of irradiation after neo-adjuvant chemotherapy in complete responders and the understanding of the interplay between local control, systemic recurrence and survival given modern systemic treatments, need to be addressed under the prism of biology within this heterogeneous disease. Intrinsic radiobiological properties within this heterogeneity need to be highlighted in order to further improve outcomes.
28108072	Treatment of metastatic breast cancer in EU: Analysis of market research data from 4Q2013 till 3Q2014.	OBJECTIVE: Despite the scientific evidence undoubtedly influencing current guidelines on the management of metastatic Breast cancer (mBC), marketing research data suggests this may not be reflected in EU prescribing behavior. Specifically we would like to understand the use of combination chemotherapy vs monotherapy in mBC patients. METHODOLOGY: This study is based on IMS Oncology Analyzer, a web-based physician panel survey set-up by IMS Health, a global company which specializes in health care information including market research data. Analysis was carried out on prescribing behavior reflected in marketing research data from IMS source (from MAT Q42013 till MAT Q32014) and comparing the data with the current guidelines recommendation in mBC (ESO-ESMO 2nd international consensus guidelines). RESULTS: In 1st line mBC around 17% of patients are treated with combination chemotherapy drugs. The combination chemotherapy are essentially anthracycline based than taxane based. In 2nd+ line mBC a higher proportion of monotherapy (chemotherapy+/-biologics) is being used. CONCLUSION: Despite the recommendation provided by current ESMO guidelines on mBC treatments, indicating the sequential use of single cytotoxic agents is a considerable alternative to standard multidrug chemotherapy regimens, marketing research data suggests this may not be reflected in EU prescribing behavior.
28108012	[Cancer screening in France: 10 years of analysis of behaviours by the EDIFICE surveys].	Accessibility to cancer screening in France has been facilitated by the implementation of organised programs (breast cancer and colorectal cancer) and by national recommendations (cervical cancer). Personal motivation may also trigger participation in prostate cancer screening. This paper proposes an overview of attitudes toward cancer screening among the general population over a period of more than 10 years and the perception of this behaviour by general practitioners. It is noteworthy that although certain cancer screening programmes, such as for breast cancer, are widely established throughout the population, uptake of others, such as for colorectal or prostate cancer, is contingent on sociological factors and vulnerability. Monitoring of compliance is thus all the more important since participation may be more acutely affected by the impact of social conditions and vulnerability in the current critical economic climate.
28107735	Breast cancers detected in only one of two arms of a tomosynthesis (3D-mammography) population screening trial (STORM-2).	The prospective 'screening with tomosynthesis or standard mammography-2 (STORM-2)' trial compared mammography screen-reading strategies and showed that each of integrated 2D/3D-mammography or 2Dsynthetic/3D-mammography detected significantly more breast cancers than 2D-mammography alone. This short report describes 13 (from 90) cancers detected in only one of two parallel double-reading arms implemented in STORM-2. Amongst this subset of cases, the majority was invasive cancer </=16 mm, mostly depicted as irregular masses or distortions. Furthermore, most were detected at 3D-mammography only and predominantly by one reader from double-reading pairs, highlighting that 3D-mammography may enable detection of cancers that are challenging to perceive at routine screening.
28107734	Patient and medical barriers preclude uptake of tamoxifen preventative therapy in women with a strong family history.	AIMS: To assess the eligibility, uptake and impediments to tamoxifen use in high-risk women attending a risk management clinic due to family history. PATIENTS AND METHODS: All patients with a germline mutation in a cancer predisposing gene or at high genetic risk (based on family history) attending a Breast and Ovarian cancer risk management clinic from February 2014 to May 2015 received both verbal and written evidence-based information on preventive therapy and were recommended to consider endocrine prevention if not contraindicated. Endocrine therapy initiation, use and cessation were captured. Patient eligibility was analysed and reasons for declining, ceasing or contraindications for medication use were recorded. RESULTS: During the study period, 237 women were seen over 305 consultations for breast surveillance and preventative therapy discussion. They comprised 38 BRCA1 and 42 BRCA2 mutation carriers, 4 with Peutz-Jegher syndrome, 153 with a strong family history. Their median age was 39.4 years. Endocrine preventative was considered and discussed with all but 19 women. Of the remaining 218, 34 chose bilateral prophylactic mastectomy, while endocrine preventative was not recommended in 50 women due to contraindications and 25 women declined treatment due to their intention to fall pregnant. In 118 patients who remained eligible, 18.6% (22) tried prevention and 9.4% (14) remained on therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Physician-reluctance is not a dominant reason for poor uptake of endocrine prevention even by high-risk premenopausal women in a specialised risk management clinic. Many women are not eligible, and most elect for alternative options.
28107084	Can Diffusion-Weighted Imaging and Related Apparent Diffusion Coefficient be a Prognostic Value in Women With Breast Cancer?	PURPOSE: To analyze diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and the related apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) in women with breast cancer, correlating these values with the presence at 3 years of distant metastases, and to demonstrate that DWI-Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and related ADC values may represent a prognostic value in the study of women with breast cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty women (aged 45-73 years) affected with breast cancer with a follow-up in 3 years were enrolled. On DWI, we obtained the ADC values, and these were correlated with the clinical condition of patients at 3 years. Moreover, tumour size, lymph node status, and molecular markers, including estrogens receptor, progesterone receptor, Ki-67 index, and human growth factor receptor 2 protein, were correlated with ADC values. This study was approved by the Scientific Committee of our institution. RESULTS: We considered patients with metastasis at 3 years (12 patients - 20%) and without metastasis (48 patients - 80%). The mean ADC value in patients with no metastases at 3 years was 1.06 +/- 0.38, while for patients with metastases it was 0.74 +/- 0.34 (p = .011). The receiver-operator curve analysis identified a value of 0.75 (<0.75 with risk to develop metastasis) as the best predictive cutoff for ADC values, with the highest sensitivity (81.25%) and higher specificity (66.67%). After regression analysis, ADC value, positivity to estrogen-progestin receptors, and presence of lymph nodes were the only prognostic factors found to be statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: DWI-MRI and related ADC values may represent a prognostic value in women with breast cancer.
28106823	Integrated MicroRNA-mRNA Profiling Identifies Oncostatin M as a Marker of Mesenchymal-Like ER-Negative/HER2-Negative Breast Cancer.	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) simultaneously modulate different oncogenic networks, establishing a dynamic system of gene expression and pathway regulation. In this study, we analyzed global miRNA and messenger RNA (mRNA) expression profiles of 17 cell lines representing different molecular breast cancer subtypes. Spearman's rank correlation test was used to evaluate the correlation between miRNA and mRNA expression. Hierarchical clustering and pathway analysis were also performed. Publicly available gene expression profiles (n = 699) and tumor tissues (n = 80) were analyzed to assess the relevance of key miRNA-regulated pathways in human breast cancer. We identified 39 significantly deregulated miRNAs, and the integration between miRNA and mRNA data revealed the importance of immune-related pathways, particularly the Oncostatin M (OSM) signaling, associated with mesenchymal-like breast cancer cells. OSM levels correlated with genes involved in the inflammatory response, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and epidermal growth factor (EGF) signaling in human estrogen receptor (ER)-negative/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative breast cancer. Our results suggest that the deregulation of specific miRNAs may cooperatively impair immune and EMT pathways. The identification of the OSM inflammatory pathway as an important mediator of EMT in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) may provide a novel potential opportunity to improve therapeutic strategies.
28106244	Second malignancy risk in patients with bronchopulmonary carcinoids: epidemiological results from Italian Network of Cancer Registries.	PURPOSE: This epidemiological study aimed to determine the prevalence and characteristics of second tumors (STs) in patients with bronchopulmonary carcinoids (BCs). METHODS: Data on neuroendocrine carcinomas (NECs) from the AIRTUM registry (1975-2011) were used for the analysis. Among 32,325 NECs, we focused our analysis on 3,205 patients (9.9%) affected by BCs. The overall ST number and incidence were calculated. The number of STs was compared with the expected cancer number in the healthy Italian population, and the standardized incidence ratio (SIR) and 95% confidence intervals were calculated. RESULTS: The male/female ratio was 1.5:1 and the mean age 61.7 years (range: 7-94). A total of 640 STs were observed (overall incidence: 20%): 198 tumors were metachronous, 23 synchronous, and 419 occurred before the diagnosis of BC. The most common STs were bladder tumors (12.2%) followed by breast tumors (11.1%). We observed a large number of thyroid tumors (SIR = 3.88), with a remarkably higher frequency of thyroid tumors being synchronously detected with BC in female patients (SIR = 61.39). In male patients there was an increased frequency of urinary system tumors, in particular metachronous tumors of the kidney and renal pelvis (SIR = 3.34) and synchronous tumors of the urinary bladder (SIR = 11.48). CONCLUSIONS: A high frequency of STs is predictable in patients with BCs, with synchronous thyroid tumors being observed in women and kidney and urinary bladder tumors in men. However, these data should be interpreted with caution, considering that the diagnosis of such tumors often occurs as an incidental finding during investigations for other malignancies.
28106227	Can NGAL be employed as prognostic and diagnostic biomarker in human cancers? A systematic review of current evidence.	BACKGROUND: Some studies have reported differentially altered neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) levels in several malignancies. We evaluated NGAL measured in plasma or urine as both prognostic and diagnostic marker for different types of human tumors. METHODS: We performed systematic electronic searches in Medline, Embase and CRDTAS. Studies were included if they evaluated NGAL as a prognostic or diagnostic marker for human cancers. The selection of the studies, screening of the full texts and data extraction were conducted independently by 2 authors. We used the random-effects model for the meta-analyses. A methodological assessment was completed. RESULTS: We included 35 studies dedicated to colorectal, pancreas, breast, thyroid, gastric, kidney, endometrial, brain, liver, lung, esophageal, oral and ovarian cancers. Our meta-analyses showed that, in patients with colorectal and breast cancer, positive NGAL expression was associated with a decrease of disease-free survival (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.27, 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.54-3.36; HR = 1.78, 95% CI, 1.33-2.38, respectively). NGAL was a negative prognostic marker of overall survival in colorectal (HR = 2.37, 95% CI, 1.68-3.34) and endometrial (HR = 4.38, 95% CI, 1.9-10.12) cancers. Discriminative power of NGAL between cancer patients and control was moderate in colorectal cancer (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.6; pooled sensitivity 0.56; pooled specificity 0.72), acceptable in pancreatic cancer (AUC = 0.8; pooled sensitivity 0.6; pooled specificity 0.8) and good in thyroid cancer (AUC = 0.9; pooled sensitivity 0.85; pooled specificity 0.96). CONCLUSIONS: NGAL determination in plasma and urine could be useful in the prognosis of colorectal and breast cancer, but its prognostic accuracy remains uncertain for other human tumors.
28105662	Preoperative MRI of the breast and ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence: Long-term follow up.	BACKGROUND: Local recurrence after breast conserving surgery is reported in 5-10% of cases. This study aims to determine if preoperative MRI is associated with reduced IBTR rates in the longer term and evaluate IBTR rates of a high risk (TN and Her-2 positive) subgroup in those receiving MRI or not. METHODS: Between 1999 and 2005, patients with invasive breast cancer undergoing BCS and radiation were identified. Primary endpoint was IBTR rate. RESULTS: The cohort consisted of 470 cases: 27% underwent MRI and 73% did not. Median follow-up was 97 months. Overall 10-year IBTR rate was 3.6%. There was no significant difference in IBTR rate at 10 years between those receiving MRI or not (1.6% vs. 4.2% (P = 0.37). The TN and Her-2 positive combined subgroup had a higher IBTR rate than all others (9.8% vs. 1.7%, P = 0.001). In the group without MRI, the IBTR rate of the high risk group was 11.8% compared to 1.8% in the remainder (P = 0.002). CONCLUSION: With 10-year follow-up, there was no significant difference in IBTR rate whether preoperative MRI is performed versus not. The high risk population showed an increased IBTR rate, this was more marked in those who did not receive MRI.
28105248	Phenolic Composition and Antioxidant and Antiproliferative Activities of the Extracts of Twelve Common Bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) Endemic Ecotypes of Southern Italy before and after Cooking.	Beans are important dietary components with versatile health benefits. We analysed the extracts of twelve ecotypes of Phaseolus vulgaris in order to determine their phenolic profiles, antioxidant activity, and the in vitro antiproliferative activity. Ultra-performance liquid chromatography with diode array detector (UPLC-DAD) admitted us to detect and quantify some known polyphenols, such as gallic acid, chlorogenic acid, epicatechin, myricetin, formononetin, caffeic acid, and kaempferol. The antioxidant activity (AA) ranged from 1.568 +/- 0.041 to 66.572 +/- 3.197 mg necessary to inhibit the activity of the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical by 50% (EC50). The extracts, except those obtained from the nonpigmented samples, were capable of inhibiting the proliferation of the human epithelial colorectal adenocarcinoma (Caco-2) cells, human breast cancer cells MCF-7, and A549 NSCLC cell line. Cultivars differed in composition and concentration of polyphenols including anthocyanins; cooking affected the antioxidant activity only marginally. Qualitative and quantitative differences in phenolic composition between the groups of beans influenced the biological activities; on the other hand, we did not find significant differences on the biological activities within the same variety, before and after cooking.
28104566	Targeting Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor in triple negative breast cancer: New discoveries and practical insights for drug development.	Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) accounts for 10-20% of cases in breast cancer. Despite recent advances in the treatment of hormonal receptor+ and HER2+ breast cancers, there are no targeted therapies available for TNBC. Evidence supports that most patients with TNBC express the transmembrane Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR). However, early phase clinical trials failed to demonstrate significant activity of EGFR-targeted monoclonal antibodies and/or tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Here, we review the recent discoveries related to the underlying biology of the EGFR pathway in TNBC, clinical progress to date and suggest rational future approaches for investigational therapies in TNBC.
28104137	Prostate Cancer Metastatic to the Renal Allograft: A Case Report.	Malignancy is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in organ transplant recipients who receive immunosuppression. Cancers associated with viruses such as nonmelanotic skin cancer and Kaposi sarcoma occur in allograft recipients at rates that far exceed that in the general population. The increased risk and tumor type may depend not only on degree of immune system modulation but also on the type of organ transplanted. In kidney transplant recipients, the risk of cancers such as prostate and breast does not seem to be increased. However, these cancers tend to be advanced and aggressive. The management of these cancers is similar to the general population with the additional consideration for reduction in immunosuppression and conversion to sirolimus. Given the increased survival of both transplanted organs as well as organ recipients along with the increased number of older recipients, the diagnosis of prostate cancer in the older male organ recipient is increasing. The long-term outcomes using current treatment guidelines for prostate cancer in these individuals are not clear. We report a case of known localized prostate cancer in a renal transplant recipient presenting with metastasis diagnosed as tumor infiltration of the allograft. Our patient, upon initial diagnosis of cancer, opted for radiation with eventual androgen-deprivation therapy. This unusual site of prostate cancer spread heightens the need for awareness among providers as well as the need for further studies of the outcomes in these patients undergoing treatments designed using guidelines developed for those with normally functioning immunity.
28103954	Differential correlation for sequencing data.	BACKGROUND: Several methods have been developed to identify differential correlation (DC) between pairs of molecular features from -omics studies. Most DC methods have only been tested with microarrays and other platforms producing continuous and Gaussian-like data. Sequencing data is in the form of counts, often modeled with a negative binomial distribution making it difficult to apply standard correlation metrics. We have developed an R package for identifying DC called Discordant which uses mixture models for correlations between features and the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm for fitting parameters of the mixture model. Several correlation metrics for sequencing data are provided and tested using simulations. Other extensions in the Discordant package include additional modeling for different types of differential correlation, and faster implementation, using a subsampling routine to reduce run-time and address the assumption of independence between molecular feature pairs. RESULTS: With simulations and breast cancer miRNA-Seq and RNA-Seq data, we find that Spearman's correlation has the best performance among the tested correlation methods for identifying differential correlation. Application of Spearman's correlation in the Discordant method demonstrated the most power in ROC curves and sensitivity/specificity plots, and improved ability to identify experimentally validated breast cancer miRNA. We also considered including additional types of differential correlation, which showed a slight reduction in power due to the additional parameters that need to be estimated, but more versatility in applications. Finally, subsampling within the EM algorithm considerably decreased run-time with negligible effect on performance. CONCLUSIONS: A new method and R package called Discordant is presented for identifying differential correlation with sequencing data. Based on comparisons with different correlation metrics, this study suggests Spearman's correlation is appropriate for sequencing data, but other correlation metrics are available to the user depending on the application and data type. The Discordant method can also be extended to investigate additional DC types and subsampling with the EM algorithm is now available for reduced run-time. These extensions to the R package make Discordant more robust and versatile for multiple -omics studies.
28103951	Multiple metastatic malignant phyllodes tumor of the breast with tonsillar metastasis: a case report.	BACKGROUND: Tonsillar metastasis is very rare and accounts for only 0.8% of tonsillar tumors. And phyllodes tumor of the breast with tonsillar metastasis is very rare. CASE PRESENTATION: A 57-year-old Japanese woman received surgery (partial mastectomy) of malignant phyllodes tumor. Seven months after initial surgery, pharyngeal pain, swelling, and a feeling of dyspnea developed, and tumor was found in the left palatine tonsil. Computed tomography for further evaluation showed a tonsillar lesion with contrast enhancement, and tonsillar metastasis was suspected. The metastatic lung tumors had not progressed. Laryngoscopic biopsy showed a tonsillar metastasis from the malignant phyllodes tumor. Despite the diagnosis of malignant phyllodes tumor with tonsillar and pulmonary metastases, the patient refused further treatment and died about 1 month later. CONCLUSIONS: A patient with a malignant phyllodes tumor of the breast and tonsillar metastasis was reported, along with a discussion of the relevant literature of this very rare pattern of metastasis.
28103504	l-arginine alters the effect of 5-fluorouracil on breast cancer cells in favor of apoptosis.	Chemoresistance in breast cancer is a major obstacle, especially in p53 mutation types. The aim of this study was to evaluate if a combination therapy of l-arginine with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) can alter the effect of this chemotherapy drug on breast cancer cells. The study was performed on BT-20 and MCF-7 cell lines. The effects of l-arginine alone and in combination with 5-FU were investigated on cell viability, apoptosis and nitric oxide (NO) production. Drugs effects on the cellular energetic metabolism were investigated through the lactate production and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) activity assay. Migration and invasion of treated cells were assessed. Real- time PCR was used for analyzing the changes in the expression level of CXCL12 and CXCR4 as two important genes involved in migration and metastasis of breast cancer cells. l-arginine increased 5-FU effect on BT-20 and MCF-7 cell lines by reducing cell viability and increasing apoptosis and NO production. Lactate production and G6PD activity assays showed that cellular energetic metabolism of both cells was altered in favor of cell death. Moreover, l-arginine decreased the metastatic activity of both cells which was confirmed through migration, invasion and gene expression results performed for both cell lines. However, drugs effect on MCF-7 (p53 wild-type) was greater than that of BT-20 (p53 mutation) in all sets of experiments. Our findings indicated that l-arginine increased the anticancer effect of 5-FU in BT-20 and MCF-7 cell lines. So, combination therapy with l-arginine and 5-FU could be considered as an effective strategy in breast cancer therapy.
28102957	RF safety assessment of a bilateral four-channel transmit/receive 7 Tesla breast coil: SAR versus tissue temperature limits.	PURPOSE: The purpose of this work was to perform an RF safety evaluation for a bilateral four-channel transmit/receive breast coil and to determine the maximum permissible input power for which RF exposure of the subject stays within recommended limits. The safety evaluation was done based on SAR as well as on temperature simulations. In comparison to SAR, temperature is more directly correlated with tissue damage, which allows a more precise safety assessment. The temperature simulations were performed by applying three different blood perfusion models as well as two different ambient temperatures. The goal was to evaluate whether the SAR and temperature distributions correlate inside the human body and whether SAR or temperature is more conservative with respect to the limits specified by the IEC. METHODS: A simulation model was constructed including coil housing and MR environment. Lumped elements and feed networks were modeled by a network co-simulation. The model was validated by comparison of S-parameters and B1+ maps obtained in an anatomical phantom. Three numerical body models were generated based on 3 Tesla MRI images to conform to the coil housing. SAR calculations were performed and the maximal permissible input power was calculated based on IEC guidelines. Temperature simulations were performed based on the Pennes bioheat equation with the power absorption from the RF simulations as heat source. The blood perfusion was modeled as constant to reflect impaired patients as well as with a linear and exponential temperature-dependent increase to reflect two possible models for healthy subjects. Two ambient temperatures were considered to account for cooling effects from the environment. RESULTS: The simulation model was validated with a mean deviation of 3% between measurement and simulation results. The highest 10 g-averaged SAR was found in lung and muscle tissue on the right side of the upper torso. The maximum permissible input power was calculated to be 17 W. The temperature simulations showed that temperature maximums do not correlate well with the position of the SAR maximums in all considered cases. The body models with an exponential blood perfusion increase did not exceed the temperature limit when an RF power according to the SAR limit was applied; in this case, a higher input power level by up to 73% would be allowed. The models with a constant or linear perfusion exceeded the limit for the local temperature when the local SAR limit was adhered to and would require a decrease in the input power level by up to 62%. CONCLUSION: The maximum permissible input power was determined based on SAR simulations with three newly generated body models and compared with results from temperature simulations. While SAR calculations are state-of-the-art and well defined as they are based on more or less well-known material parameters, temperature simulations depend strongly on additional material, environmental and physiological parameters. The simulations demonstrated that more consideration needs be made by the MR community in defining the parameters for temperature simulations in order to apply temperature limits instead of SAR limits in the context of MR RF safety evaluations.
28102955	Compound speckle model detects anti-angiogenic tumor response in preclinical nonlinear contrast-enhanced ultrasonography.	PURPOSE: This paper proposes a method for analyzing the first-order speckle statistics of nonlinear contrast-enhanced ultrasound images from tumors. METHODS: Contrast signal intensity is modeled as a compound distribution of exponential probability density functions with a gamma weighting function. The gamma probability weighting function serves as an approximation for log-normally distributed flow velocities in a vascular network. The model was applied to sub-harmonic bolus-injection images acquired from a mouse breast cancer xenograft model treated with murine version bevacizumab. RESULTS: The area under curve produced using the compound statistical model could more accurately discriminate anti-VEGF-treated tumors from untreated tumors than conventional contrast-enhanced ultrasound image processing. This result was validated with gold standard histological measures of microvascular density. Fractal vessel geometry was estimated using the gamma weighting function and tested against micro-CT perfusion casting. Treated tumors had a significantly lower vascular fractal dimension than control tumors. Vascular complexity estimated using the ultrasound compound statistical model performed similarly to micro-CT fractal dimension for discriminating treated from control tumors. CONCLUSION: The proposed technique can quantify tumor perfusion and provide an index of vascular complexity, making it a potentially useful addition for clinical detection of vascular normalization in anti-angiogenic trials.
28102696	Compression forces used in the Norwegian Breast Cancer Screening Program.	OBJECTIVE: Compression is used in mammography to reduce breast thickness, which is claimed to improve image quality and reduce radiation dose. In the Norwegian Breast Cancer Screening Program (NBCSP), the recommended range of compression force for full-field digital mammography (FFDM) is 11-18 kg (108-177 N). This is the first study to investigate the compression force used in the programme. METHODS: The study included information from 17,951 randomly selected females screened with FFDM at 14 breast centres in the NBCSP, during January-March 2014. We investigated the applied compression force on the left breast in craniocaudal and mediolateral oblique views for breast centres, mammography machines within the breast centres and for the radiographers. RESULTS: The mean compression force for all mammograms in the study was 116 N and ranged from 91 N to 147 N between the breast centres. The variation in compression force was wider between the breast centres than that between mammography machines (range 137-155 N) and radiographers (95-143 N) within one breast centre. Approximately 59% of the mammograms in the study complied with the recommended range of compression force. CONCLUSION: A wide variation in applied compression force was observed between the breast centres in the NBCSP. This variation indicates a need for evidence-based recommendations for compression force aimed at optimizing the image quality and individualizing breast compression. Advances in knowledge: There was a wide variation in applied compression force between the breast centres in the NBCSP. The variation was wider between the breast centres than that between mammography machines and radiographers within one breast centre.
28101678	Breast carcinoma subtypes show different patterns of metastatic behavior.	The aim of our retrospective study was to analyze patterns of subtype specific metastatic spread and to identify the time course of distant metastases. A consecutive series of 490 patients with breast cancer who underwent surgery and postoperative treatment at Semmelweis University, Hungary, and diagnosed between the years 2000 and 2007 was identified from the archives of the 2nd Department of Pathology, Hungary. Molecular subtypes were defined based on the 2011 St. Gallen recommendations. Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 22.0. Distant metastasis free survival (DMFS) was defined as the time elapsed between the first pathological diagnosis of the tumor and the first distant metastasis detection. Distant metastases were detected in 124 patients. Mean time to develop metastasis was 29 months (range 0-127 months). The longest DMFS was observed in the Luminal A (LUMA) subtype (mean 39 months) whereas the shortest was seen in the HER2-positive (HER2+) subtype (mean 21 months; p = 0.012). We confirmed that HER2+ tumors carry a higher risk for distant metastases (42.1%). LUMA-associated metastases were found to be solitary in 59% of cases, whereas HER2+ tumors showed multiple metastases in 79.2% of cases. LUMA tumors showed a preference for bone-only metastasis as compared with HER2+ and triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cases, which exhibited a higher rate of brain metastasis. The most frequent second metastatic sites of hormone receptor (HR) positive tumors were the lung and liver, whereas the brain was the most affected organ in HR-negative (HR-) cases. Tumor subtypes differ in DMFS and in pattern of distant metastases. HER2+ tumors featured the most aggressive clinical course. Further identification of subtype-specific factors influencing prognosis might have an impact on clinical care and decision-making.
28101578	A 22q11.2 amplification in the region encoding microRNA-650 correlates with the epithelial to mesenchymal transition in breast cancer primary cultures of Mexican patients.	Breast cancer ranks first in incidence and mortality in working age women. Cancer initiation and progression relies on accumulation of genetic and epigenetic aberrations that alter cellular processes, among them, epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) denotes particularly aggressive neoplasias given its capacity to invade and metastasize. Several microRNAs (miRNA) have been found able to regulate gene expression at the core of EMT. In this study, the Affymetrix CytoScan HD array was used to analyze three different primary tumor cell isolates from Mexican breast cancer patients. We found an amplification in band 22q11.2 shared by the three samples, in the region that encodes miRNA-650. Overexpression of this miRNA has been associated with downregulation of tumor suppressors ING4 and NDRG2, which have been implicated in cancer progression. Using the Pathway Linker platform the ING4 and NDRG2 interaction networks showed a significant association with signaling pathways commonly deregulated in cancer. Also, several studies support their participation in the EMT. Supporting the latter, we found that the three primary isolates were E-cadherin negative, vimentin positive, presented a cancer stem cell-like phenotype CD44+CD24-/low and were invasive in Transwell invasion assays. This evidence suggests that the gain of region 22q11.2 contributes to trigger EMT. This is the first evidence linking miR-650 and breast cancer.
28101573	Combining doxorubicin with a phenolic extract from flaxseed oil: Evaluation of the effect on two breast cancer cell lines.	Breast cancer is one of the most frequently diagnosed forms of cancer and different treatments are used to block its progression. However, it still represents a very common cause of death in women. Doxorubicin (Dox) is reported as an effective agent in breast cancer treatment nonetheless it induces many sideeffects. For this reason, many laboratories are engaged in understanding how it is possible to decrease the drug concentration, considering that one of the possible solutions is to use drug synergy, combining it with natural substances. Recently we showed that a phenolic extract from flaxseed (FS) oil, named PEFSO, induced on MCF7 cell line an increase of apoptosis with related modification of G0/G1 phase cell cycle, and the activation of signaling and prooxidant pathways. In this study we present data on the combined effect of Dox and PEFSO on two different breast cancer cell lines to define the conditions to use lower doses of this chemotherapeutic agent. We report the data relating to the ability of this mixture to induce cytotoxicity and apoptosis, cell cycle modification, mitochondrial membrane depolarization and activation of extrinsic and/or intrinsic apoptotic pathway.
28101567	Influence of arm crank ergometry on development of lymphedema in breast cancer patients after axillary dissection: A randomized controlled trail.	OBJECTIVE: To investigate the safety and efficacy of arm crank ergometry in breast cancer patients after axillary lymph node dissection, with regard to changes in bioelectrical impedance analysis, arm circumference, muscular strength, quality of life and fatigue. DESIGN: Randomized controlled clinical intervention trial. SUBJECTS: Forty-nine patients with breast cancer after axillary lymph node dissection. METHODS: Arm crank ergometer training twice-weekly was compared with usual care over 12 weeks. RESULTS: The arm crank ergometer group improved significantly in terms of lean body mass and skeletal muscle mass, and showed a significant decrease in body fat. In the arm crank ergometer group, as well as the usual care group, a significant increase in armpit circumference was detected during the training period. The magnitude of the gain was higher in the usual care group. For all other measured regions of the arm a significant decrease in circumference was seen in both groups. Muscular strength of the upper extremity increased significantly in both groups, with a greater improvement in the arm crank ergometer group. In both groups a non-significant trend towards improvement in quality of life was observed. The arm crank ergometer group showed significant improvements in physical functioning, general fatigue and physical fatigue. CONCLUSION: These results confirm the feasibility of arm crank ergometer training after axillary lymph node dissection and highlight improvements in strength, quality of life and reduced arm symptoms with this training.
28099330	Clarifying the debate on population-based screening for breast cancer with mammography: A systematic review of randomized controlled trials on mammography with Bayesian meta-analysis and causal model.	BACKGROUND: The recent controversy about using mammography to screen for breast cancer based on randomized controlled trials over 3 decades in Western countries has not only eclipsed the paradigm of evidence-based medicine, but also puts health decision-makers in countries where breast cancer screening is still being considered in a dilemma to adopt or abandon such a well-established screening modality. METHODS: We reanalyzed the empirical data from the Health Insurance Plan trial in 1963 to the UK age trial in 1991 and their follow-up data published until 2015. We first performed Bayesian conjugated meta-analyses on the heterogeneity of attendance rate, sensitivity, and over-detection and their impacts on advanced stage breast cancer and death from breast cancer across trials using Bayesian Poisson fixed- and random-effect regression model. Bayesian meta-analysis of causal model was then developed to assess a cascade of causal relationships regarding the impact of both attendance and sensitivity on 2 main outcomes. RESULTS: The causes of heterogeneity responsible for the disparities across the trials were clearly manifested in 3 components. The attendance rate ranged from 61.3% to 90.4%. The sensitivity estimates show substantial variation from 57.26% to 87.97% but improved with time from 64% in 1963 to 82% in 1980 when Bayesian conjugated meta-analysis was conducted in chronological order. The percentage of over-detection shows a wide range from 0% to 28%, adjusting for long lead-time. The impacts of the attendance rate and sensitivity on the 2 main outcomes were statistically significant. Causal inference made by linking these causal relationships with emphasis on the heterogeneity of the attendance rate and sensitivity accounted for the variation in the reduction of advanced breast cancer (none-30%) and of mortality (none-31%). We estimated a 33% (95% CI: 24-42%) and 13% (95% CI: 6-20%) breast cancer mortality reduction for the best scenario (90% attendance rate and 95% sensitivity) and the poor scenario (30% attendance rate and 55% sensitivity), respectively. CONCLUSION: Elucidating the scenarios from high to low performance and learning from the experiences of these trials helps screening policy-makers contemplate on how to avoid errors made in ineffective studies and emulate the effective studies to save women lives.
28098895	MicroRNA-133b is regulated by TAp63 while no gene mutation is present in colorectal cancer.	Downregulation of miR-133b has been reported in multiple types of malignancies including colorectal cancer (CRC). We previously confirmed that TAp63 actively translates microRNA-133b (miR-133b) transcripts. While the presence of miRNA mutations have frequently been described in CRC, most CRCs do not show any variation in the miR133b coding sequence. Therefore, it is important to elucidate the relationship between TAp63 and miR-133b, and identify other mediators of miR-133b downregulation in CRC. The expression of TAp63 was detected by RT-qPCR, western blotting, immunohistochemistry (IHC) and densitometric analysis using Image-Pro Plus 6.0 software in 38 CRC and corresponding non-cancerous tissues (NCTs). The expression of mature miR133b was determined by RT-qPCR, in situ hybridization (ISH) and densitometric analysis using Image-Pro Plus 6.0 software. The DNA from 38 CRC tissues and NCTs were screened for miR-133b mutations through sequence analysis. Compared with the NCTs, TAp63 mRNA expression was significantly lower in 21 (55.27%) tumor tissues. Compared with the NCTs, the miR133b expression level was significantly lower in 31 (81.58%) tumor tissues. The expression of miR133b was found to be positively correlated with TAp63. Loss of TAp63 and miR-133b was associated with an increased likelihood of metastatic events. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) of TAp63 for CRC was 0.623 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.497-0.748; P=0.046], with 73.7% sensitivity and 50% specificity, respectively. The AUC of miR-133b for CRC was 0.857 (95% CI, 0.7740.940; P<0.0001), with 78.9% sensitivity and 81.6% specificity, respectively. The combined AUC of TAp63 and miR-133b for CRC was 0.881 (95% CI, 0.805-0.956; P<0.0001), with 89.5% sensitivity and 71.1% specificity, respectively. Point mutations within the seed region of miR-133b were found in 1 patient, but the point mutation did not impact the secondary structure of the pre-miR-133b. Therefore, downregulation of TAp63 may be one reason for the dysregulation of miR133b in CRC. The expression analysis of TAp63 and miR-133b revealed that they may be used as valuable prognostic biomarkers for CRC.
28098816	Estrogen Enhances the Expression of the Multidrug Transporter Gene ABCG2-Increasing Drug Resistance of Breast Cancer Cells through Estrogen Receptors.	BACKGROUND: Multidrug resistance is a major obstacle in the successful therapy of breast cancer. Studies have proved that this kind of drug resistance happens in both human cancers and cultured cancer cell lines. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of drug resistance is important for the reasonable design and use of new treatment strategies to effectively confront cancers. RESULTS: In our study, ATP-binding cassette sub-family G member 2 (ABCG2), adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthase and cytochrome c oxidase subunit VIc (COX6C) were over-expressed more in the MCF-7/MX cell line than in the normal MCF7 cell line. Therefore, we believe that these three genes increase the tolerance of MCF7 to mitoxantrone (MX). The data showed that the high expression of COX6C made MCF-7/MX have more stable on mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) expression than normal MCF7 cells under hypoxic conditions. The accumulation of MX was greater in the ATP-depleted treatment MCF7/MX cells than in normal MCF7/MX cells. Furthermore, E2 increased the tolerance of MCF7 cells to MX through inducing the expression of ABCG2. However, E2 could not increase the expression of ABCG2 after the inhibition of estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) in MCF7 cells. According to the above data, under the E2 treatment, MDA-MB231, which lacks ER, had a higher sensitivity to MX than MCF7 cells. CONCLUSIONS: E2 induced the expression of ABCG2 through ERalpha and the over-expressed ABCG2 made MCF7 more tolerant to MX. Moreover, the over-expressed ATP synthase and COX6c affected mitochondrial genes and function causing the over-expressed ABCG2 cells pumped out MX in a concentration gradient from the cell matrix. Finally lead to chemoresistance.
28098771	Breast Cancer Brain Metastases: Clonal Evolution in Clinical Context.	Brain metastases are highly-evolved manifestations of breast cancer arising in a unique microenvironment, giving them exceptional adaptability in the face of new extrinsic pressures. The incidence is rising in line with population ageing, and use of newer therapies that stabilise metastatic disease burden with variable efficacy throughout the body. Historically, there has been a widely-held view that brain metastases do not respond to circulating therapeutics because the blood-brain-barrier (BBB) restricts their uptake. However, emerging data are beginning to paint a more complex picture where the brain acts as a sanctuary for dormant, subclinical proliferations that are initially protected by the BBB, but then exposed to dynamic selection pressures as tumours mature and vascular permeability increases. Here, we review key experimental approaches and landmark studies that have charted the genomic landscape of breast cancer brain metastases. These findings are contextualised with the factors impacting on clonal outgrowth in the brain: intrinsic breast tumour cell capabilities required for brain metastatic fitness, and the neural niche, which is initially hostile to invading cells but then engineered into a tumour-support vehicle by the successful minority. We also discuss how late detection, abnormal vascular perfusion and interstitial fluid dynamics underpin the recalcitrant clinical behaviour of brain metastases, and outline active clinical trials in the context of precision management.
28098572	Metastatic Organotropism: An Intrinsic Property of Breast Cancer Molecular Subtypes.	It has long been known that some cancers have the propensity to metastasize to certain organs thus creating a nonrandom distribution of sites for distant relapse, a phenomenon known as "metastatic organotropism." Some of these examples include ovary primary to abdominal cavity, prostate primary to bone, and pancreas primary to liver. In contrast, other tumor types, such as mammary and renal cell carcinoma, can relapse in multiple organs although approximately half of advanced breast cancers metastasize to bone. On the other hand gene expression profiling studies have identified various breast cancer classes with prognostic significance. Recent studies have revealed that breast cancer subtypes differ not only in primary tumor characteristics but also in their metastatic behavior. In particular, the luminal tumors are remarkable for their significant bone-seeking phenotype; the HER2 subtype demonstrates a significant liver-homing characteristic; whereas so-called triple-negative breast cancers predispose to lung metastases. These findings suggest that this knowledge could potentially be utilized in the development of effective disease surveillance strategies in the pursuit of precision medicine, thus necessitating further investigation.
28096667	Hyaluronan-modified superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles for bimodal breast cancer imaging and photothermal therapy.	Theranostic nanoparticles with both imaging and therapeutic abilities are highly promising in successful diagnosis and treatment of the most devastating cancers. In this study, the dual-modal imaging and photothermal effect of hyaluronan (HA)-modified superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (HA-SPIONs), which was developed in a previous study, were investigated for CD44 HA receptor-overexpressing breast cancer in both in vitro and in vivo experiments. Heat is found to be rapidly generated by near-infrared laser range irradiation of HA-SPIONs. When incubated with CD44 HA receptor-overexpressing MDA-MB-231 cells in vitro, HA-SPIONs exhibited significant specific cellular uptake and specific accumulation confirmed by Prussian blue staining. The in vitro and in vivo results of magnetic resonance imaging and photothermal ablation demonstrated that HA-SPIONs exhibited significant negative contrast enhancement on T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging and photothermal effect targeted CD44 HA receptor-overexpressing breast cancer. All these results indicated that HA-SPIONs have great potential for effective diagnosis and treatment of cancer.
28095872	An unusual combined thymic carcinoma composed of squamous cell carcinoma and type AB thymoma: a rare case report.	BACKGROUND: Combined thymic carcinoma is a malignant neoplasm of the thymus recently added to the 4th edition of the World Health Organization (WHO) classification of tumors of the lung, pleura, thymus and heart. It involves at least one type of thymic carcinoma and another thymic epithelial tumor. The previously used term "combined thymic epithelial tumor" has been abandoned. CASE PRESENTATION: Here, we present an unusual case of combined thymic carcinoma of the thymus in a 44-year-old male who had suffered from fever, chest pain, chest tightness and shortness of breath. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) detected a mass approximately 6.4 cm x 4.2 cm in the anterior mediastinum, and a nonencapsulated tumor approximately 5.0 cm x 3.5 cm x 2.5 cm with an irregular shape was resected. The morphological features and the immunostaining pattern of the tumor revealed it to be an unusual combined thymic carcinoma consisting of type AB thymoma and squamous cell carcinoma. There were cysts of various sizes, some of which had crack-like structures, in the type AB thymoma area. A gradual transition could be seen between these structures and the squamous cell carcinoma, indicating that the carcinoma portion may have originated from the composition of the thymoma. CONCLUSIONS: Combined thymic carcinoma composed of type AB thymoma and squamous cell carcinoma is rare, and the carcinoma portion may have originated from epithelial structures in the type AB thymoma.
28095866	Improvement of displacement estimation of breast tissue in ultrasound elastography using the monogenic signal.	BACKGROUND: In breast ultrasound elastography, tissues displacements estimation is obtained through a technique that follows the evolution of tissues under stress. However, during the acquisition of B-mode images, tissue displacements are often contaminated with multiplicative noise caused by changes in the speckle pattern in the tissue. Thus, the application of monogenic signal technique on the B-mode image in order to estimate displacement tissue, result in a presence of amplified noise in the deformation tissue image, which severely obscures the useful information. In this paper, we propose a new method based on the monogenic features, that is to improve the old monogenic signal (OMS) technique by improving the filtering step, so that the use of an effective denoising technique is enough to ensure a good estimation of displacement tissue. Our proposed method is based on the use of a robust filtering technique combined with the monogenic model. METHODS: Two models of phantom elasticity are used in our test validation sold by CIRS company. In-vivo testing was also performed on the sets of clinical B-mode images to 20 patients including malignant breast tumors. Shrinkage wavelets has been used to eliminate the noise according to the threshold, then a guided filter is introduced to completely filter the image, the monogenic model is used after excerpting the image feature and estimating analytically the displacement tissue. RESULTS: Accurate and excellent displacement estimation for breast tissue was observed in proposed method results. By adapting our proposed approach to breast B-mode images, we have shown that it demonstrated a higher performance for displacement estimation; it gives better values in term of standard deviation, higher contrast to noise ratio, greater peak signal-to-noise ratio, excellent structural similarity and much faster speed than OMS and B-spline techniques. The results of the proposed model are encouraging, allowing quick and reliable estimations. CONCLUSION: Although the proposed approach is used in ultrasound domains, it has never been used in the estimation of the breast tissue displacement. In this context, our proposed approach could be a powerful diagnostic tool to be used in breast displacement estimation in ultrasound elastography.
28094850	Discriminating solitary cysts from soft tissue lesions in mammography using a pretrained deep convolutional neural network.	PURPOSE: It is estimated that 7% of women in the western world will develop palpable breast cysts in their lifetime. Even though cysts have been correlated with risk of developing breast cancer, many of them are benign and do not require follow-up. We develop a method to discriminate benign solitary cysts from malignant masses in digital mammography. We think a system like this can have merit in the clinic as a decision aid or complementary to specialized modalities. METHODS: We employ a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify cyst and mass patches. Deep CNNs have been shown to be powerful classifiers, but need a large amount of training data for which medical problems are often difficult to come by. The key contribution of this paper is that we show good performance can be obtained on a small dataset by pretraining the network on a large dataset of a related task. We subsequently investigate the following: (a) when a mammographic exam is performed, two different views of the same breast are recorded. We investigate the merit of combining the output of the classifier from these two views. (b) We evaluate the importance of the resolution of the patches fed to the network. (c) A method dubbed tissue augmentation is subsequently employed, where we extract normal tissue from normal patches and superimpose this onto the actual samples aiming for a classifier invariant to occluding tissue. (d) We combine the representation extracted using the deep CNN with our previously developed features. RESULTS: We show that using the proposed deep learning method, an area under the ROC curve (AUC) value of 0.80 can be obtained on a set of benign solitary cysts and malignant mass findings recalled in screening. We find that it works significantly better than our previously developed approach by comparing the AUC of the ROC using bootstrapping. By combining views, the results can be further improved, though this difference was not found to be significant. We find no significant difference between using a resolution of 100 versus 200 micron. The proposed tissue augmentations give a small improvement in performance, but this improvement was also not found to be significant. The final system obtained an AUC of 0.80 with 95% confidence interval [0.78, 0.83], calculated using bootstrapping. The system works best for lesions larger than 27 mm where it obtains an AUC value of 0.87. CONCLUSION: We have presented a computer-aided diagnosis (CADx) method to discriminate cysts from solid lesion in mammography using features from a deep CNN trained on a large set of mass candidates, obtaining an AUC of 0.80 on a set of diagnostic exams recalled from screening. We believe the system shows great potential and comes close to the performance of recently developed spectral mammography. We think the system can be further improved when more data and computational power becomes available.
28094662	Clinical and psychological moderators of the effect of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy on persistent pain in women treated for primary breast cancer - explorative analyses from a randomized controlled trial.	BACKGROUND: Mindfulness-based intervention has been found efficacious in reducing persistent pain in women treated for breast cancer. Little, however, is known about possible moderators of the effect. We explored clinical and psychological moderators of the effect on pain intensity previously found in a randomized controlled trial of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) with women treated for breast cancer with persistent pain. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 129 women treated for breast cancer reporting persistent pain were randomized to MBCT or a wait-list control. The primary outcome of pain intensity (11-point numeric rating scale) was measured at baseline, post-intervention, three, and six months follow-up. Proposed clinical moderators included age, axillary lymph node dissection (ALND), radiotherapy, and endocrine treatment. Psychological moderators included psychological distress [the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)], the adult attachment dimensions anxiety and avoidance [the Experiences in Close Relationships Short Form (the ECR-SF)], and alexithymia [the Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20)]. Multi-level models were used to test moderation effects over time, i.e. time x group x moderator. RESULTS: Only attachment avoidance (p = 0.03, d = 0.36) emerged as a statistically significant moderator. Higher levels of attachment avoidance predicted a larger effect of MBCT in reducing pain intensity compared with lower levels attachment avoidance. None of the remaining psychological or clinical moderators reached statistical significance. However, based on the effect size, radiotherapy (p = 0.075, d = 0.49) was indicated as a possible clinical moderator of the effect, with radiotherapy being associated with a smaller effect of MBCT on pain intensity over time compared with no radiotherapy. CONCLUSION: Attachment avoidance, and potentially radiotherapy, may be clinically relevant factors for identifying the patients who may benefit most from MBCT as a pain intervention. Due to the exploratory nature of the analyses, the results should be considered preliminary.
28093828	A systematic review on ethnomedicines of anti-cancer plants.	Cancer is a serious health problem and the second leading cause of death around the globe. Present review is an attempt to provide utmost information based on ethno-pharmacological and toxicological aspects of anti-cancer plants of the world. A total of 276 articles published in English journals and containing maximum ethnomedicinal information were reviewed using several data sources such as; Google scholar, Web of Science, Scopus, PubMed and floras of different countries. A total of 199 anti-cancer plants were recorded in present review and results indicated that traditional medicines are mostly being use in developing countries for cancer treatment. Traditionally and scientifically skin and breast cancer types gained more focus. Seventy plants were reportedly analyzed for in-vitro activities while 32 plants were having in-vivo reports. Twenty nine pure compounds (mostly phenolic) were reportedly isolated from anti-cancer plants and tested against different cancer cell lines. Inspite having better efficiency of ethnomedicines as compared to synthetic drugs, several plants have also shown toxic effects on living system. Therefore, we invite researchers attention to carry out detailed ethno-pharmacological and toxicological studies on un-explored anti-cancer plants in order to provide reliable knowledge to the patients and develop novel anti-cancer drugs.

28093826	Highly sensitive detection of E2 activity in ubiquitination using an artificial RING finger.	The ubiquitin-conjugating (E2) enzymes of protein ubiquitination are associated with various diseases such as leukemia, lung cancer, and breast cancer. Rapid and accurate detection of E2 enzymatic activities remains poor. Here, we described the detection of E2 activity on a signal accumulation ISFET biosensor (AMIS sensor) using an artificial RING finger (ARF). The use of ARF enables the simplified detection of E2 activity without a substrate. The high-sensitivity quantitative detection of E2 activities was demonstrated via real-time monitoring over a response range of femtomolar to micromolar concentrations. Furthermore, the monitoring of E2 activities was successfully achieved using human acute promyelocytic leukemia cells following treatment with the anticancer drug bortezomib, which allowed the assessment of the pathological conditions. This strategy is extremely simple and convenient, and the present detection could be widely applied to specific E2s for various types of cancers.

28093732	Long-term hormone therapy for perimenopausal and postmenopausal women.	BACKGROUND: Hormone therapy (HT) is widely provided for control of menopausal symptoms and has been used for the management and prevention of cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis and dementia in older women. This is an updated version of a Cochrane review first published in 2005. OBJECTIVES: To assess effects of long-term HT (at least 1 year's duration) on mortality, cardiovascular outcomes, cancer, gallbladder disease, fracture and cognition in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women during and after cessation of treatment. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the following databases to September 2016: Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group Trials Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase and PsycINFO. We searched the registers of ongoing trials and reference lists provided in previous studies and systematic reviews. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised double-blinded studies of HT versus placebo, taken for at least 1 year by perimenopausal or postmenopausal women. HT included oestrogens, with or without progestogens, via the oral, transdermal, subcutaneous or intranasal route. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently selected studies, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. We calculated risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous data and mean differences (MDs) for continuous data, along with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We assessed the quality of the evidence by using GRADE methods. MAIN RESULTS: We included 22 studies involving 43,637 women. We derived nearly 70% of the data from two well-conducted studies (HERS 1998; WHI 1998). Most participants were postmenopausal American women with at least some degree of comorbidity, and mean participant age in most studies was over 60 years. None of the studies focused on perimenopausal women.In relatively healthy postmenopausal women (i.e. generally fit, without overt disease), combined continuous HT increased the risk of a coronary event (after 1 year's use: from 2 per 1000 to between 3 and 7 per 1000), venous thromboembolism (after 1 year's use: from 2 per 1000 to between 4 and 11 per 1000), stroke (after 3 years' use: from 6 per 1000 to between 6 and 12 per 1000), breast cancer (after 5.6 years' use: from 19 per 1000 to between 20 and 30 per 1000), gallbladder disease (after 5.6 years' use: from 27 per 1000 to between 38 and 60 per 1000) and death from lung cancer (after 5.6 years' use plus 2.4 years' additional follow-up: from 5 per 1000 to between 6 and 13 per 1000).Oestrogen-only HT increased the risk of venous thromboembolism (after 1 to 2 years' use: from 2 per 1000 to 2 to 10 per 1000; after 7 years' use: from 16 per 1000 to 16 to 28 per 1000), stroke (after 7 years' use: from 24 per 1000 to between 25 and 40 per 1000) and gallbladder disease (after 7 years' use: from 27 per 1000 to between 38 and 60 per 1000) but reduced the risk of breast cancer (after 7 years' use: from 25 per 1000 to between 15 and 25 per 1000) and clinical fracture (after 7 years' use: from 141 per 1000 to between 92 and 113 per 1000) and did not increase the risk of coronary events at any follow-up time.Women over 65 years of age who were relatively healthy and taking continuous combined HT showed an increase in the incidence of dementia (after 4 years' use: from 9 per 1000 to 11 to 30 per 1000). Among women with cardiovascular disease, use of combined continuous HT significantly increased the risk of venous thromboembolism (at 1 year's use: from 3 per 1000 to between 3 and 29 per 1000). Women taking HT had a significantly decreased incidence of fracture with long-term use.Risk of fracture was the only outcome for which strong evidence showed clinical benefit derived from HT (after 5.6 years' use of combined HT: from 111 per 1000 to between 79 and 96 per 1000; after 7.1 years' use of oestrogen-only HT: from 141 per 1000 to between 92 and 113 per 1000). Researchers found no strong evidence that HT has a clinically meaningful impact on the incidence of colorectal cancer.One trial analysed subgroups of 2839 relatively healthy women 50 to 59 years of age who were taking combined continuous HT and 1637 who were taking oestrogen-only HT versus similar-sized placebo groups. The only significantly increased risk reported was for venous thromboembolism in women taking combined continuous HT: Their absolute risk remained low, at less than 1/500. However, other differences in risk cannot be excluded, as this study was not designed to have the power to detect differences between groups of women within 10 years of menopause.For most studies, risk of bias was low in most domains. The overall quality of evidence for the main comparisons was moderate. The main limitation in the quality of evidence was that only about 30% of women were 50 to 59 years old at baseline, which is the age at which women are most likely to consider HT for vasomotor symptoms. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Women with intolerable menopausal symptoms may wish to weigh the benefits of symptom relief against the small absolute risk of harm arising from short-term use of low-dose HT, provided they do not have specific contraindications. HT may be unsuitable for some women, including those at increased risk of cardiovascular disease, increased risk of thromboembolic disease (such as those with obesity or a history of venous thrombosis) or increased risk of some types of cancer (such as breast cancer, in women with a uterus). The risk of endometrial cancer among women with a uterus taking oestrogen-only HT is well documented.HT is not indicated for primary or secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease or dementia, nor for prevention of deterioration of cognitive function in postmenopausal women. Although HT is considered effective for the prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis, it is generally recommended as an option only for women at significant risk for whom non-oestrogen therapies are unsuitable. Data are insufficient for assessment of the risk of long-term HT use in perimenopausal women and in postmenopausal women younger than 50 years of age.
28093334	In vitro antitumor and antiangiogenic effects of Bothropoidin, a metalloproteinase from Bothrops pauloensis snake venom.	Breast cancer is a highly malignant carcinoma and remains the second leading cause of mortality among women. The antitumor effects of metalloproteinases and disintegrins from snake venom on various types of cancer cells have been investigated. In this study, we evaluated the antitumor and antiangiogenic effects on MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells and endothelial cells induced by Bothropoidin, a disintegrin-like metalloproteinase isolated from Bothrops pauloensis snake venom. At 24h after treatment at 100mug/mL, Bothropoidin exerted a moderate cytotoxic effect of 30% on MDA-MB-231 versus 10% cytotoxicity against MCF10A (a non-tumorigenic breast cell line), a significant difference that suggests a possible preference by this protein for targets in cancer cells. Early and late apoptosis of MDA-MB-231 was observed after Bothropoidin treatment (10mug/mL and 40mug/mL). Furthermore, this toxin inhibited not only the adhesion of MDA-MB-231 cells in a dose-dependent manner but also cell migration by approximately 45%. In addition, Bothropoidin decreased endothelial cells viability and adhesion in Matrigel and inhibited in vitro angiogenesis in Matrigel stimulated by bFGF, showing significantly fewer formed vessels. The results demonstrated that Bothropoidin has potent in vitro antitumor and antiangiogenic effect and represents a biotechnological tool for elucidating the antitumor effect of disintegrins-like metalloproteinases in cancer cells.
28093329	Antioxidant, antitumor and immunostimulatory activities of the polypeptide from Pleurotus eryngii mycelium.	The objective of this study was to investigate the antioxidant, antitumor and immunological activities of the polypeptide from Pleurotus eryngii mycelium (PEMP). The ability of the polypeptide to stimulate Ana-1 macrophages to englobe neutral red, secrete NO, H2O2, TNF-alpha, and IL-6, increase TLR2 and TLR4 expression levels and Ana-1 cell survival rate were investigated to study its immunocompetence. Its antitumor activities were studied by examining the survival of cervical, breast, and stomach cancer cells. The antioxidant activities of the polypeptide were studied by examining its reducing power and its ability to scavenge DPPH, O2-, and OH radicals. The results showed that the PEMP was a good antioxidant with antitumor and immunostimulatory activities that was concentration dependent. At concentrations from 0.05 to 2mg/mL, it inhibited the proliferation of cancer cells, but promoted the proliferation of macrophages, TNF-alpha and IL-6 secretion, TLR2 and TLR4 expression and increased macrophage phagocytic ability through NO and H2O2 release. From 0.2 to 1mg/mL, the polypeptide had strong reducing power to clear free radical of DPPH, O2-, OH-, with a concentration-response relationship. Based on these results, PEMP has potential applications in functional foods as a natural anti-aging and anti-virus agent with antioxidant and immunostimulatory activities.
28093034	Fear of cancer recurrence and unmet needs among breast cancer survivors in the first five years. A cross-sectional study.	BACKGROUND: It is unclear to which degree the services available after end of treatment are sufficient to meet the needs of women treated for breast cancer. The aim of the present study was to identify patient-reported supportive care needs and the prevalence of fear of cancer recurrence (FCR) following end of treatment in women treated for breast cancer. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Using a cross-sectional design, women treated for breast cancer (n = 155; mean age 63) completed questionnaires concerning supportive care needs and FCR. Inclusion criteria were: >/=18 years of age and treated for primary breast cancer at Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark and between three months and five years after diagnosis. Associations between demographic characteristics, clinical factors, side effects, late effects and the two dependent variables, unmet needs (examined with linear regression model), and FCR (examined with logistic regression model) were analyzed. RESULTS: The response rate was 79.9%. Almost all (82.6%) women reported at least one unmet need (mean number 9.3; range 0-34). More than half (59.3%) of the unmet needs were rated as strong unmet needs. The most frequent unmet needs were concerned with doctors collaborate to coordinate care; the need for having ongoing dialog with healthcare providers to receive available local health care services, understandable and up-to-date information, to manage side effects and feeling reassured that the best medical care are given. Having unmet needs were associated with young age, short time since primary surgery, and having clinical FCR. FCR was reported by 54.8% of the women and was associated with short time since primary surgery, having chemotherapy, having unmet needs, and moderate to severe muscle and joint pain and fatigue. CONCLUSIONS: Breast cancer survivors experience substantial unmet needs years after end of treatment, particularly among younger women and women having clinical FCR. Furthermore, FCR is frequent among women, particularly when closer in time to primary surgery.
28092843	Therapeutic effects of bach1 siRNA on human breast adenocarcinoma cell line.	BACKGROUND: Despite the great improvements in clinical and therapeutic techniques in recent years, many advanced breast cancer patients still died of the postoperative recurrence and metastasis of disease. Bach1 plays a role in the development of the invasive phenotypes of cancer, cell division and apoptosis in tumor cells. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of specific bach1 siRNAs, on the proliferation, migration, invasive, induction of apoptosis, cell cycle arrest and alter EMT related miRNA of MDA-MB-468 cells (breast cancer). METHODS: siRNA transfection was performed with transfection reagent. The expression levels of Bach1 mRNA and protein were measured by qRT-PCR and western blot analysis, respectively. The survival of cells was determined using MTT assay cells, apoptosis using Tunel assay, Cell migration using scratch assay and Cell cycle analysis by Propidium Iodide (PI) DNA staining method by using flow cytometry on the MDA-MB-468. The expression levels of MMP-9 and CXCR4 were measured by qRT-PCR. RESULTS: Transfection with siRNA significantly suppressed the expression of bach1 gene in dose dependent manner after 48h (p<0.0001). Surprisingly, treatment with bach1 siRNA arrest cell cycle in S phases (p<0.0001). Moreover siRNA transfection had effects on breast adenocarcinoma cells and inhibits the migration (p<0.0001), proliferation (p<0.0001), cell cycle arrest (p=0.03) and induces apoptosis (p<0.0001) and reduces the expression of miR-21 (P=0.0014). CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that the bach1 can be considered as a potent adjuvant in breast cancer therapy.
28092842	Blocking TGF-beta1 by P17 peptides attenuates gastric cancer cell induced peritoneal fibrosis and prevents peritoneal dissemination in vitro and in vivo.	Our previous study demonstrated that the peritoneal stroma environment favors proliferation of tumor cells by serving as a rich source of growth factors and chemokines known to be involved in tumor metastasis. In this study, we investigated the interaction between gastric cancer cells and peritoneal mesothelial cells, and determined the effects of TGF-beta1 in this processing. Human peritoneal tissues and peritoneal wash fluid were obtained, which examined by hematoxylin and eosin staining or ELISA for measurements of TGF-beta1 levels. The peritoneal mesothelial cells were co-incubated with the supernatants of gastric cancer, the expression of TGF-beta1, collagen and fibronectin was observed by ELISA and western blot. We then investigated the effects of serum-free conditioned media from HSC-39 gastric cancer cells on the peritoneum of nude mice, and the effects of peritoneal fibrosis on the development of peritoneal metastasis in vivo. The peritoneum from gastric patients were thickened and contained extensive fibrosis. After co-culture both gastric tumor cells and mesothelial cells, we found that TGF-beta1 expression was greatly increased in the co-culture system compared to individual culture condition. Serum-free Conditioned Media from HSC-39 was able to induce extracellular matrix expression in vitro and in vivo, and tumorigenicity in mice with peritoneal fibrosis was greater than in mice with normal peritoneum, while blocking TGF-beta1 by peptide P17 can partially inhibit these effects. In conclusion, these results indicated that the interaction of gastric cancer with peritoneal fibrosis and determined that TGF-beta1 plays a key role in induction of peritoneal fibrosis, which in turn affected dissemination of gastric cancer.
28091886	Levels of persistent organic pollutants in breast milk of Maya women in Yucatan, Mexico.	In this study, 24 breast milk samples, obtained from rural Maya women, from municipalities of Yucatan, Mexico, were analyzed for organochlorine pesticide (OCP) residues by gas chromatography. Recent studies have shown that Maya communities have a poor perception about the proper usage and handling of OCP. The karstic soil in this area has a high vulnerability to groundwater pollution by the use of OCP in agriculture and livestock activities. The impact of the ecosystem on human health is much more critical due to the prevailing poverty and a very low educational level of these communities. About 30% of the Maya population consumes water directly from contaminated wells and sinkholes, resulting in a chronic exposure to OCP. The samples served to identify and quantify high levels of OCP residues (18.43 mg/kg of heptachlor epoxide and 1.92 mg/kg of endrin in the metropolitan zone; 2.10 mg/kg of dieldrin, 0.117 mg/kg of endosulfan II, 0.103 mg/kg of heptachlor, 0.178 mg/kg of endrin, and 0.127 mg/kg of endrin aldehyde in the main agricultural zone and on the west coast). The detected levels of OCP residues are a major concern and represent a potential risk to women and children in the region. This could be associated with the high rates of cervical uterine and breast cancer mortality in Yucatan. Thus, regulations on the usage of OCP and their enforcement are necessary, and it is important to establish a yearly monitoring program for OCP residues in breast milk and groundwater, as well as to implement health promotion programs for women in particular and the general population in general.
28090067	Discovery and Synthesis of Amino Acids Modified Deoxycholic Acid Derivatives and in Vitro Antiproliferative Evaluation.	A series of deoxycholic acid (DCA) derivatives bearing amino acid moiety has been synthesized and investigated for their potential antiproliferative activities. DCA derivative compounds were synthesized by a two or three step synthetic approach. Their bioactivities were evaluated using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) method and Western blotting analysis on three tumor cell lines A549 (human lung cancer cell line), MCF-7 (human breast cancer cell line) and HeLa (human cervical carcinoma cell). The novel derivatives DCA3d, DCA5a, DCA5b, DCA5c, and DCA5d were found to be promising antiproliferative agents. Furthermore, DCA5b showed the greatest cytotoxic activity by induction of apoptosis. These compounds show potentiality for further optimization as antitumor drugs.
28088315	Paris saponin-induced autophagy promotes breast cancer cell apoptosis via the Akt/mTOR signaling pathway.	Paris saponins possess anticancer, anti-inflammatory, and antiviral effects. However, the anticancer effect of Paris saponins has not been well elucidated and the mechanisms underlying the potential function of Paris saponins in cancer therapy are needed to be further identify. In this study, we report that saponin compounds isolated from Paris polyphylla exhibited antitumor activity against breast cancer cell lines, MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231. Paris saponin XA-2 induced apoptosis in both cell lines, as evidenced by the activation of caspases and cleavage of Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase. The ability of XA-2 to induce autophagy was confirmed by acridine orange staining, accumulation of autophagosome-bound Long chain 3 (LC3)-II, and measurement of autophagic flux. XA-2-induced autophagy was observed to promote apoptosis by the combined treatment of breast cancer cell lines with XA-2 and autophagy inhibitors 3-methyladenine and bafilomycin A1, respectively. Moreover, we report a decrease in the levels of Akt/mTOR signaling pathway proteins, such as the phosphorylated forms of Akt, mTOR, P70S6K, and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 (4EBP1). Taken together, these results provide important insights explaining the anticancer activity of Paris saponins and the potential development of XA-2 as a new therapeutic agent.
28088074	Anti-angiogenic treatment in breast cancer: Facts, successes, failures and future perspectives.	Angiogenesis is one of the hallmarks of cancer and a crucial requisite in the development of tumors. Interrupting this process by blocking the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) with the monoclonal antibody bevacizumab has been considered a possible breakthrough in the treatment of various types of cancer, especially for advanced disease. However in breast cancer, studies have shown ambivalent results causing debate about the value of this drug. In this article, we review the evidence for anti-angiogenic treatment options for breast cancer, as well as discuss the possible factors limiting the effectiveness of anti-angiogenic agents and offer a recommendation regarding the future research on these therapies for the treatment of breast cancer.
28087477	Overexpression of TNFAIP8 is associated with tumor aggressiveness and poor prognosis in patients with invasive ductal breast carcinoma.	Tumor necrosis factor alpha-induced protein 8 (TNFAIP8), a transcription factor nuclear factor kappaB-inducible, antiapoptotic and oncogenic molecule, is associated with prognosis of several human malignancies. However, the relationship between TNFAIP8 and the prognosis of the invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) of the breast remains unclear. TNFAIP8 expression was evaluated using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Western blot analysis in 20 fresh IDC tissues and immunohistochemical analysis in 351 paraffin-embedded IDC tissues. Real-time PCR and Western blot analysis demonstrated that both TNFAIP8 messenger RNA and protein were up-regulated in IDC tissues compared with the paired adjacent noncancerous tissues. Immunohistochemistry revealed that TNFAIP8 expression was significantly correlated with some clinicopathological factors, including axillary lymph node metastasis (P=.001), advanced TNM stage (P<.001), high histologic grade (P<.001), molecular subtype (P<.001), and postoperative recurrence (P<.001). Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses demonstrated that TNFAIP8 overexpression was strongly associated with axillary lymph node metastasis (odds ratio, 1.818; 95% confidence interval, 1.167-2.832; P=.008). Moreover, Kaplan-Meier analysis indicated that IDC patients with high TNFAIP8 expression had a shorter survival time than did those with low TNFAIP8 expression, and multivariate analysis indicated that TNFAIP8 was an independent prognostic factor for overall survival and disease-free survival in IDC (P=.041 and P=.020, respectively). Therefore, TNFAIP8 overexpression may contribute to tumor progression, and it may be a novel prognostic biomarker for the patients with IDC.
28087376	IR780-loaded TPGS-TOS micelles for breast cancer photodynamic therapy.	IR780 iodide is a near-infrared (NIR) dye with a huge potential for cancer imaging and phototherapy. However, its biomedical application is strongly impaired by its lipophilic character. Herein, amphiphilic micelles based on d-alpha-tocopheryl polyethylene glycol succinate (TPGS) and d-alpha-tocopheryl succinate (TOS), two vitamin E derivatives with intrinsic anticancer activity, are explored to load IR780. IR780-loaded micelles with suitable sizes are obtained by using specific TPGS and TOS weight feed ratios during micelles formulation and these are able to encapsulate IR780 with high efficiency. In in vitro assays, the IR780-loaded micelles induce a cytotoxic effect in cancer cells upon exposure to NIR irradiation through the generation of reactive oxygen species (photodynamic therapy). This effective ablation of cancer cells is achieved using an ultra-low IR780 concentration. Moreover, IR780-loaded micelles also have the ability to act as photothermal and imaging agents, which widens their therapeutic and diagnostic potential. Overall, TPGS-TOS micelles are promising nanoplatforms for IR780-mediated cancer phototherapy and imaging.
28087261	DNA aptamer probes for detection of estrogen receptor alpha positive carcinomas.	Estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) also known as NR3A1 (nuclear receptor subfamily 3, group A, member 1) is a ligand-activated transcription factor. It is an important biomarker for breast cancer metastasis. In the present study, we report a novel DNA aptamer candidate against estrogen receptor (ER) alpha structure. The enriched aptamer candidate was obtained after 14 iterative cycles of in vitro protein-SELEX process. Isothermal calorimetry study suggests the nanomolar sensitivity of the candidate ER_Apt1 to its target protein. Fluorescence- and chemiluminescence-binding assays confirm the specificity of the candidate aptamer to ER alpha positive breast cancer cell line. Comparative analysis of ER_Apt1 to ER alpha monoclonal antibody was also performed to analyze the expression of ER alpha in various malignant cancer cell line. Cytochemical and immunohistochemistry assay indicates its potential use as a diagnostic agent against ERalpha positive carcinomas. The nucleotide aptamer sequences described in the present study can be used for the detection, treatment, prophylaxis and diagnosis of ERalpha-related disorder.
28087106	Charge variant analysis of proposed biosimilar to Trastuzumab.	Trastuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb) employed for the treatment of HER2 Positive Breast Cancer. A HER2 overexpressing tumor cell binds to Trastuzumab and attracts immune cells which lead to induction of Antibody Dependent Cellular Cytotoxicity (ADCC) by binding to Fc receptors (CD16a or FcgammaRIIIa) on an effector cell, such as natural killer (NK) cells. The most commonly expressed receptor on NK cell is CD16a which binds to the Fc portion of Trastuzumab. The ligand-independent HER2-HER3 dimerization is the most potent stimulator of downstream pathways for regulation of cell growth and survival. An attempt has been made in this study to understand the impact of charge heterogeneity on the binding kinetics and potency of the monoclonal antibody. Trastuzumab has a pI range of 8.7-8.9 and is composed of mixture of acidic and basic variants beside the main peak. Ion exchange chromatography was used to isolate the acidic, basic, and main peak fractions from in-house proposed biosimilar to Trastuzumab and their activities were compared to the Innovator Trastuzumab Herclon(R). Data from the mass analysis confirmed the potential modifications in both acidic and basic variant. Binding activity studies performed using Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) revealed that acidic variants had lesser binding to HER2 in comparison to the basic variants. Both acidic and basic variant showed no significant changes in their binding to soluble CD16a receptors. In vitro assay studies using a breast cancer cell line (BT-474) confirmed the binding potency of acidic variant to be lesser than basic variant, along with reduced anti-proliferative activity for the acidic variant of Trastuzumab. Overall, these data has provided meaningful insights to the impact of antibody charge variants on in vitro potency and CD16 binding affinity of trastuzumab.
28087099	Prognostic and predictive indicators in early-stage breast cancer and the role of genomic profiling: Focus on the Oncotype DX(R) Breast Recurrence Score Assay.	Although useful prognostic and predictive insights can be gained from patient and tumour characteristics in early-stage breast cancer, it is not always straightforward to predict the likely risk of recurrence for each individual patient following breast surgery. One of the most difficult challenges faced by clinicians is identifying patients who may benefit most from adjuvant chemotherapy, and distinguishing these cases from those where endocrine therapy may be sufficient for cure. Genomic tests such as the Oncotype DX(R) Breast Recurrence Score(R) Assay have been developed to provide a robust and clinically validated assessment of a patient's individual tumour signature. The Oncotype DX Assay is included in treatment guidelines for estimating both the risk of distant recurrence and predicting adjuvant chemotherapy benefit for early-stage breast cancer patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative, oestrogen-receptor positive, and axillary lymph node negative or positive (1-3 positive nodes) disease. In this article, we review unmet needs for prognostication and prediction in early-stage breast cancer, and consider how the information provided by the Recurrence Score is complementary to that gained from the assessment of more traditional clinicopathologic criteria. Routine use of the assay in clinical practice, limitations and possible future directions are also discussed.
28085525	Unilateral breast reconstruction after mastectomy - patient satisfaction, aesthetic outcome and quality of life.	BACKGROUND: An increasing number of women undergo a breast reconstruction (BR) after treatment for breast cancer. The aim of the present study was to evaluate patient-reported esthetic satisfaction, quality of life (QoL), and the association between these, following different types of BR. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All women who underwent unilateral BR in Central Denmark Region between January 2005 and July 2011 were included. Participants were sent a questionnaire package, which included the Body Image Scale, The Beck Depression Inventory, the Impact of Event Scale, and a study-specific patient-reported esthetic satisfaction scale. Additionally, patients were asked if they experienced a change in QoL owing to the BR. Based on reconstructive method and timing, participants were divided into four groups, three delayed: an abdominal flap group, a latissimus dorsi flap group, an implant +/- thoracodorsal flap group; and one immediate BR group. RESULTS: Of 166 eligible participants, a total of 144 women (87%) completed the questionnaire. The mean follow-up was 3.8 years. Esthetic satisfaction differed significantly between groups [F(3,139) = 8.55; p < 0.001], with abdominal flap recipients reporting the highest levels of esthetic satisfaction. No between-group differences were observed for the remaining psychosocial measures. Higher satisfaction with esthetic outcome was associated with reporting higher QoL owing to the BR (odds ratio 1.10, p<0.001; 95% CI 1.06-1.15). CONCLUSIONS: Abdominal flap recipients expressed higher satisfaction with their esthetic outcome, compared to the remaining BR types. Higher esthetic satisfaction was strongly associated with reporting an experience of higher QoL.
28085117	Enantioselective Effects of Metalaxyl Enantiomers on Breast Cancer Cells Metabolic Profiling Using HPLC-QTOF-Based Metabolomics.	In this study, an integrative high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-QTOF) based metabolomics approach was performed to evaluate the enantioselective metabolic perturbations in MCF-7 cells after treatment with R-metalaxyl and S-metalaxyl, respectively. Untargeted metabolomics profile, multivariate pattern recognition, metabolites identification, and pathway analysis were determined after metalaxyl enantiomer exposure. Principal component analysis (PCA) and partitial least-squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) directly reflected the enantioselective metabolic perturbations induced by metalaxyl enantiomers. On the basis of multivariate statistical results, a total of 49 metabolites including carbohydrates, amino acids, nucleotides, fatty acids, organic acids, phospholipids, indoles, derivatives, etc. were found to be the most significantly changed metabolites and metabolic fluctuations caused by the same concentration of R-metalaxyl and S-metalaxyl were enantioselective. Pathway analysis indicated that R-metalaxyl and S-metalaxyl mainly affected the 7 and 10 pathways in MCF-7 cells, respectively, implying the perturbed pathways induced by metalaxyl enantiomers were also enantioselective. Furthermore, the significantly perturbed metabolic pathways were highly related to energy metabolism, amino acid metabolism, lipid metabolism, and antioxidant defense. Such results provide more specific insights into the enantioselective metabolic effects of chiral pesticides in breast cancer progression, reveal the underlying mechanisms, and provide available data for the health risk assessments of chiral environmental pollutants at the molecular level.
28084890	Self-reported physical activity behavior of breast cancer survivors during and after adjuvant therapy: 12 months follow-up of two randomized exercise intervention trials.	BACKGROUND: Exercise during and after breast cancer treatment has shown several health benefits. However, little is known about the courses, patterns, and determinants of physical activity of breast cancer patients, and the role of exercise interventions on their physical activity behavior in the long run. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Self-reported physical activity was assessed in 227 breast cancer survivors before, during, and three, six, and 12 months post-intervention within two randomized resistance exercise trials performed during adjuvant chemo- or radiotherapy, respectively, with similar designs. Multiple ordinal logistic regression analyses were performed to identify determinants of physical activity at these time points. RESULTS: While the intervention group exercised a median 1.8 h/week during adjuvant therapy (interquartile range 1.4-2.5), 68% of controls did not engage in any exercise. At 12-months follow-up 32% of patients did not engage in any exercise irrespective of the intervention. Of the patients who cycled for transportation pre-diagnosis about half stopped cycling in the long term in both groups. In contrast, walking was maintained over time. Major determinants of low levels of exercise at 12-months follow-up were low pre-diagnosis levels of exercise, lower education, being postmenopausal, and having breast problems or depressive symptoms. Further, the intervention appeared to influence the type of sports performed, with strength exercise being the most common type of exercise at follow-up in the exercise group, more frequently compared to the control group. CONCLUSION: The exercise intervention effectively countervailed the decrease in physical activity during cancer therapy and boosted strength exercise in the months following the intervention, but in the longer term many survivors were insufficiently active. Breast cancer survivors may need continued motivation and practical support tailored to their individual characteristics and physical activity history to incorporate exercise in everyday routine in the long term.
28084150	Progressive strength training to prevent LYmphoedema in the first year after breast CAncer - the LYCA feasibility study.	BACKGROUND: Lymphoedema is a common late effect after breast cancer (BC) that has no effective cure once chronic. Accumulating evidence supports progressive strength training (PRT) as a safe exercise modality in relation to the onset and exacerbation of lymphoedema. In the 'preventive intervention against LYmphoedema after breast CAncer' (LYCA) feasibility study we examined the feasibility of a program of PRT in the first year after BC to inform a planned randomised controlled trial (RCT). MATERIAL AND METHODS: LYCA was a one-group prospective pilot trial inviting women operated with axillary lymph node dissection for unilateral primary BC. Participants exercised three times a week for 50 weeks (20 weeks supervised followed by 30 weeks home-based exercise). The program ensured slow individualised progression during the exercise program. The primary outcome was feasibility measured by eligibility and recruitment rates, as well as questionnaire-assessed satisfaction and adherence to exercise. Furthermore, we assessed arm interlimb volume difference by water displacement, muscle strength by dynamic and isometric muscle testing and range of movement in the shoulder by goniometry. RESULTS: In August 2015, eight of 11 eligible patients accepted participation. Two of them dropped out early due to other health issues. The remaining six participants had high exercise adherence through the supervised period, but only three maintained this through the home exercise period. Program satisfaction was high and no serious adverse events from testing or exercising were reported. One participant presented with lymphoedema at 50-week follow-up. Muscle strength markedly increased with supervised exercise, but was not fully maintained through the home exercise period. Range of shoulder movement was not negatively affected by the program. CONCLUSION: Recruitment, testing, and exercise in LYCA was safe and feasible. At the 50-week follow-up, there was one case of lymphoedema. The LYCA program will be further tested in a full-scale RCT.
28083889	A prospective clinical assessment of anatomic variability of the submental vascularized lymph node flap.	INTRODUCTION: The vascularized submental lymph node (VSLN) flap has become a popular choice for the treatment of lymphedema. Despite its favorable characteristics, anatomic variability exists, making the harvest of this flap challenging. Knowledge and characterization of anatomic variability can aid the surgeon in safe and effective flap harvest. METHODS: A prospective analysis of all patients who underwent VSLN flap transfer for lymphedema was performed. Demographics, operative details, and post-operative recovery were analyzed for included patients. Intraoperative videography and detailed anatomic drawings of each case were reviewed to accurately account for anatomic variability and details. RESULTS: Forty-two patients were identified during the study period. Arteriovenous anatomic variability (A1-A2 and V1-V4) existed, with most patients having the artery and vein present superior to the submandibular gland (A1V1; 31%), with other combinations occurring less frequently. Flap harvest time was found to be significantly increased with an intraglandular arterial course (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The VSLN flap can be safely and effectively harvested with knowledge of arteriovenous anatomic variability. Most commonly, the artery and vein travel together superior to the submandibular gland, but other variations exist, which may add time to surgical flap harvest and increased need for dissection. J.

28082219	Characterization and carboplatin loaded chitosan nanoparticles for the chemotherapy against breast cancer in vitro studies.	Aim of the studies to synthesized chitosan nanoparticles by an ionic interaction procedure. The nanoparticles were characterized by physicochemical methods like, DLS, TEM, Surface potential measurements, FT-IR and DSC. The average particle size of chitosan and carboplatin nanoparticles was found to be 277.25+/-11.37nm and 289.30+/-8.15nm and zeta potential was found to be 31+/-3.14mV and 33+/-2.15mV respectively with low polydispersity index. The maximum entrapment of carboplatin in nanoparticles was a spherical shape with a positive charge. The maximum encapsulation and loading efficiencies of carboplatin (5mg/ml) were obtained to be 58.43% and 13.27% respectively. The nanocarboplatin was better blood compatibility as compared to chitosan nanoparticles. Finally, the cytotoxic effects of the carboplatin loaded chitosan nanoparticles were tested in-vitro against breast cancer (MCF-7) cell lines. Our studies showed that the chitosan nanoparticles could be used as a promising candidate for drug delivery for the therapeutic treatment of breast cancer.
28081961	Environmental factors in breast cancer invasion: a mathematical modelling review.	This review presents a brief overview of breast cancer, focussing on its heterogeneity and the role of mathematical modelling and simulation in teasing apart the underlying biophysical processes. Following a brief overview of the main known pathophysiological features of ductal carcinoma, attention is paid to differential equation-based models (both deterministic and stochastic), agent-based modelling, multi-scale modelling, lattice-based models and image-driven modelling. A number of vignettes are presented where these modelling approaches have elucidated novel aspects of breast cancer dynamics, and we conclude by offering some perspectives on the role mathematical modelling can play in understanding breast cancer development, invasion and treatment therapies.
28081733	Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF)-alpha-Induced Protein 8-like-2 (TIPE2) Inhibits Proliferation and Tumorigenesis in Breast Cancer Cells.	Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha)-induced protein 8-like-2 (TNFAIP8L2 or TIPE2), a member of the tumor necrosis TNFAIP8 family, was found to be involved in the development and progression of several tumors. However, to date, the role of TIPE2 in breast cancer is still unclear. Thus, the aim of this study is to explore the role of TIPE2 in breast cancer. Our results indicated that TIPE2 expression was significantly decreased in human breast cancer tissue and cell lines. Overexpression of TIPE2 inhibited the proliferation in vitro and tumor xenograft growth in vivo. TIPE2 also inhibited the migration/invasion of breast cancer cells through preventing the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotype. Mechanically, TIPE2 inhibited the expression of beta-catenin, cyclin D1, and c-Myc in breast cancer cells. In conclusion, our findings show that TIPE2 may play an important role in breast cancer cell proliferation, invasion, and tumorigenesis in vivo. Therefore, TIPE2 may be a potential molecular target for the treatment of breast cancer.
28080186	Satisfaction with sex life in sexually active heterosexual couples dealing with breast cancer: a nationwide longitudinal study.	BACKGROUND: A breast cancer (BC) diagnosis can profoundly affect the sex life of patient and partner within a couple. The purpose of the present study is to examine whether individual and partner sexual functioning, affectionate behavior, emotional closeness and depressive symptoms are associated with change over time in satisfaction with sex life of sexually active heterosexual couples dealing with BC and to explore whether the associations differ between patients and partners after adjustment for basic sociodemographic characteristics, comorbidity and BC treatment. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Women with BC and their male partners participated in a longitudinal study (Time 1, </=4 months after surgery; Time 2, 5 months later). Participants completed items from the PROMIS(R) Sexual Function and Satisfaction measure (version 1.0), two items measuring affectionate behavior, a single item measuring emotional closeness and the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale. Registers provided sociodemographic and medical information. Multilevel models were used, which take the interdependency of couples' scores into account. RESULTS: A total of 287 sexually active couples were included in the analyses. Less vaginal discomfort and more vaginal lubrication were associated with increases in patients' satisfaction with sex life. Patients' and partners' satisfaction increased with higher ratings of their own orgasm ability and of partners' timing of ejaculation. Patients' reports of affectionate behavior were positively associated with their partners' satisfaction, and vice versa for partners. Patients' satisfaction increased the more emotional closeness their partner experienced. Partners' depressive symptoms were negatively associated with their satisfaction. Sociodemographic factors and BC treatment were not significantly associated with change in satisfaction. CONCLUSION: Satisfaction with sex life in sexually active couples dealing with BC needs to be seen as a couple issue. Health professionals should take the partner into account when addressing sexuality issues. Couples' functioning and relationship-related factors may be promising targets for couple interventions.
28080180	Long-term effects on the incidence of second primary cancers in a randomized trial of two and five years of adjuvant tamoxifen.	BACKGROUND: Tamoxifen is a well established treatment for breast cancer, but its long-term effects on the incidence of secondary cancers are not fully evaluated. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We have studied 4128 postmenopausal patients with early stage breast cancer who were alive and free of breast cancer recurrence after two years of tamoxifen, and who were randomized to receive totally two or five years of therapy. RESULTS: Compared to patients randomized to two years of tamoxifen the incidence of contralateral breast cancer [hazard ratio (HR) 0.73; 95% CI 0.56-0.96] and of lung cancer (HR 0.45; 95% CI 0.27-0.77), especially squamous cell and small cell lung cancer, were reduced in the five-year group, and similar results were seen when restricting the analysis to the 10-year period after treatment stopped. An increased incidence of endometrial cancer was observed in the five-year group, but the excess risk decreased over time. CONCLUSION: Further studies of the effects of tamoxifen on the risk of different histological types of lung cancer are needed.
28079816	A comparison study between gross tumor volumes defined by preoperative magnetic resonance imaging, postoperative specimens, and tumor bed for radiotherapy after breast-conserving surgery.	BACKGROUND: The identification and contouring of target volume is important for breast-conserving therapy. The aim of the study was to compare preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), postoperative pathology, excised specimens' (ES) size, and tumor bed (TB) delineation as methods for determining the gross tumor volume (GTV) for radiotherapy after breast-conserving surgery (BCS). METHODS: Thirty-three patients with breast cancer who underwent preoperative MRI and radiotherapy after BCS were enrolled. The GTVs determined by MRI, pathology, and the ES were defined as GTVMRI, GTVPAT, and GTVES, respectively. GTVMRI+1 was defined as a 1.0-cm margin around the GTVMRI. The radiation oncologist delineated GTV of the TB (GTVTB) using planning computed tomography according to >/=5 surgical clips placed in the lumpectomy cavity (LC). RESULTS: The median GTVMRI, GTVMRI+1, GTVPAT, GTVES, and GTVTB were 0.97 cm (range, 0.01-6.88), 12.58 cm (range, 3.90-34.13), 0.97 cm (range, 0.01-6.36), 15.46 cm (range, 1.15-70.69), and 19.24 cm (range, 4.72-54.33), respectively. There were no significant differences between GTVMRI and GTVPAT, GTVMRI+1 and GTVES, GTVES and GTVTB (P = 0.188, 0.070, and 0.264, respectively). GTVMRI is positively related with GTVPAT. However, neither GTVES nor GTVTB correlated with GTVMRI (P = 0.071 and 0.378, respectively). Furthermore, neither GTVES nor GTVTB correlated with GTVMRI+1 (P = 0.068 and 0.375, respectively). CONCLUSION: When >/=5 surgical clips were placed in the LC for BCS, the volume of TB was consistent with the volume of ES. Neither the volume of TB nor the volume of ES correlated significantly with the volume of tumor defined by preoperative MRI.
28079792	Amplification of HER2 and TOP2A and deletion of TOP2A genes in a series of Taiwanese breast cancer.	BACKGROUND: The prognostic relevance of topoisomerase II alpha (TOP2A) copy number change remains not well established. This study is aimed to investigate the frequency and pattern of TOP2A aberrations; to correlate TOP2A alterations with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status and clinicopathological parameters, and further to explore prognostic value of TOP2A and HER2 status in breast cancer in Taiwan. METHODS: We analyzed tissue samples from 311 invasive carcinomas in tissue microarrays for TOP2A and HER2 status by fluorescent in situ hybridization. RESULTS: TOP2A copy number change is an infrequent genetic event (9.8% amplification and 2.7% deletion) and is present in both HER2-amplified and nonamplified tumors. TOP2A amplification is statistically associated with age >50 at diagnosis (P = 0.016) and HER2 amplification (P < 0.001). HER2 amplification, but not TOP2A amplification, is a predictor of unfavorable prognosis (P = 0.002). Univariate and multivariate analysis showed that higher histologic grading, positive nodal involvement, and HER2 positivity were associated with poorer overall survival. Cytogenetically, double minutes-type amplification is the predominant pattern for both genes (HER2: 64% and TOP2A: 93.1%). Homogeneous staining region-type signals of both genes are resistant to RNase digestion, supporting that these were not nuclear accumulation of mRNA transcripts. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate the prognostic value of tumor grading, nodal involvement, and HER2 status in Taiwanese breast cancer. TOP2A aberrations are an infrequent event independent of HER2 status, and TOP2A amplification carries no prognostic value. The predictive value of TOP2A aberrations in patients of breast cancer taking athracycline-containing treatment in Taiwan remains to be determined in prospectively well-designed clinical trials.
28079249	Fractal analysis of visual search activity for mass detection during mammographic screening.	PURPOSE: The objective of this study was to assess the complexity of human visual search activity during mammographic screening using fractal analysis and to investigate its relationship with case and reader characteristics. METHODS: The study was performed for the task of mammographic screening with simultaneous viewing of four coordinated breast views as typically done in clinical practice. Eye-tracking data and diagnostic decisions collected for 100 mammographic cases (25 normal, 25 benign, 50 malignant) from 10 readers (three board certified radiologists and seven Radiology residents), formed the corpus for this study. The fractal dimension of the readers' visual scanning pattern was computed with the Minkowski-Bouligand box-counting method and used as a measure of gaze complexity. Individual factor and group-based interaction ANOVA analysis was performed to study the association between fractal dimension, case pathology, breast density, and reader experience level. The consistency of the observed trends depending on gaze data representation was also examined. RESULTS: Case pathology, breast density, reader experience level, and individual reader differences are all independent predictors of the complexity of visual scanning pattern when screening for breast cancer. No higher order effects were found to be significant. CONCLUSIONS: Fractal characterization of visual search behavior during mammographic screening is dependent on case properties and image reader characteristics.
28078854	Changes of expression of estrogen and progestrone receptors, human epithelial growth factor receptor 2 and Ki-67 after neoadjuvant chemotherapy in the treatment of breast cancer.	Recent studies suggest that the development and prognosis of breast cancer is in close correlation to molecular subtype of breast cancer. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy has been extensively applied in the treatment of local breast cancer in advanced stage. In order to verify the correlation between expression changes of estrogen receptor, progestrone receptor, human epithelial growth factor receptor 2 and Ki-67 after neoadjuvant chemotherapy and neoadjuvant chemotherapy, we studied 120 patients with stage IIAIIIC breast cancer who underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy in Binzhou Medical University Hospital, Shandong, China from February 2011 to February 2015. Clinical characteristics were retrospectively analyzed. The expression of estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, human epithelial growth factor receptor 2 and Ki-67 of patients were detected using the immunohistochemical method before and after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The results suggest that the overall remission rate of neoadjuvant chemotherapy was 76.7% (92/120) of which 16.7% (20/120) of cases had complete remission, 60% (72/120) had partial remission and 23.3% (28/120) were stable. There were no cases of progressive disease. The property of estrogen receptor and the expression of Ki-67 of primary tumor were correlated to the remission rate of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (P less than 0.05). The expression of Ki-67 had a significant decline after neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and the difference had statistical significance (P less than 0.05). The difference in expression of estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor and human epithelial growth factor receptor 2 before and after neoadjuvant chemotherapy had statistical significance (P > 0.05). Hence, it can be concluded that breast cancer patients with negative estrogen receptor expression and high Ki-67 expression before neoadjuvant chemotherapy can achieve better curative effects. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy cannot change the expression states of estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor and human epithelial growth factor receptor 2, but it can lower the expression level of Ki-67. Ki-67 can also be used for predicting the curative effect of neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
28078851	Mechanism of serum miR-21 in the pathogenesis of familial and triple negative breast cancer.	The aim of this study was to clarify the mechanism of miR-21 in familial and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) by exploring the expression of serum miR-21. The sera were collected from healthy women at high risk of breast cancer. miR-39 was employed as the external reference, and real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR was used to detect the expression of serum miR-21 in 77 subjects. The miR-21 expression of the familial breast cancer group, TNBC group, and breast cancer high risk group were significantly higher than those in the normal control group and other breast cancer groups (P less than 0.01). A high serum miR-21 expression level was associated with lymph node metastasis and Ki67 expression (P less than 0.01). Serum miR-21 was closely associated with TNBC and familial breast cancer, and its expression was associated with genetic expression, degree of malignancy, and prognosis.
28077836	[Decision Making Experience on Breast Reconstruction for Women with Breast Cancer].	PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to explore decision making experiences of Korean women with breast cancer who underwent breast reconstruction with/after a mastectomy. METHODS: Data were collected during 2015-2016 through individual in-depth interviews with 10 women who had both mastectomy and breast reconstruction, and analyzed using phenomenological method to identify essential themes on experiences of making a decision to have breast reconstruction. RESULTS: Five theme clusters emerged. First, "expected loss of sexuality and discovery of autonomy" illustrates various aims of breast reconstruction. Second, "holding tight to the reputation of doctors amid uncertainty" specifies the importance of a trust relationship with their physician despite a lack of information. Third, "family members to step back in position" describes support or opposition from family members in the decision making process. Fourth, "bewilderment due to the paradox of appearance-oriented views" illustrates paradoxical environment, resulting in confusion and anger. Lastly, "decision to be made quickly with limited time to oneself" describes the crazy whirling process of decision making. CONCLUSION: Findings highlight aims, worries, barriers, and facilitators that women with breast cancer experience when making a decision about breast reconstruction. Deciding on breast reconstruction was not only a burden for women in a state of shock with a diagnosis of breast cancer, but also an opportunity to decide to integrate their body, femininity, and self which might be wounded from a mastectomy. These findings will help oncology professionals provide effective educational counselling before the operation to promote higher satisfaction after the operation.
28077810	Increased Expression of Long Non-Coding RNA BCAR4 Is Predictive of Poor Prognosis in Patients with Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.	Lung cancer is the most common human cancer, and the majority of lung cancer cases are categorized as non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play key roles in the development and progression of human cancers. LncRNA breast cancer anti-estrogen resistance 4 (BCAR4) has been identified as an oncogenic lncRNA involved in the progression of breast cancer and osteosarcoma. However, the clinical significance of the lncRNA BCAR4 in NSCLC remains largely unclear. In the present study, real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction was used to examine the relative level of lncRNA BCAR4 in 68 cases of NSCLC tissues and their adjacent non-tumor tissues. Our data showed that the expression level of lncRNA BCAR4 was significantly higher in NSCLC tissues compared to their matched non-tumor tissues. Moreover, BCAR4 expression was significantly upregulated in NSCLC cell lines, when compared to the normal human bronchial epithelial cell line BEAS-2B. In addition, the BCAR4 expression was associated with the lymph node metastasis, distant metastasis and clinical stage, but not with the age, sex, tumor size, histological grade, and histological type. The increased expression of BCAR4 was significantly associated with poorer 5-year overall survival rate of NSCLC patients. Multivariate survival analysis indicated that BCAR4 was an independent prognostic factor for NSCLC patients. Taken together, our study suggests that the upregulation of lncRNA BCAR4 expression plays a promoting role in the malignant progression of NSCLC. Thus, BCAR4 is a potential biomarker for NSCLC progress and a therapeutic target for NSCLC.
28077018	Patient factors and quality of life outcomes differ among four subgroups of oncology patients based on symptom occurrence.	CONTEXT: Reviews of the literature on symptoms in oncology patients undergoing curative treatment, as well as patients receiving palliative care, suggest that they experience multiple, co-occurring symptoms and side effects. OBJECTIVES: The purposes of this study were to determine if subgroups of oncology patients could be identified based on symptom occurrence rates and if these subgroups differed on a number of demographic and clinical characteristics, as well as on quality of life (QoL) outcomes. METHODS: Latent class analysis (LCA) was used to identify subgroups (i.e. latent classes) of patients with distinct symptom experiences based on the occurrence rates for the 13 most common symptoms from the Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale. RESULTS: In total, 534 patients with breast, head and neck, colorectal, or ovarian cancer participated. Four latent classes of patients were identified based on probability of symptom occurrence: all low class [i.e. low probability for all symptoms (n = 152)], all high class (n = 149), high psychological class (n = 121), and low psychological class (n = 112). Patients in the all high class were significantly younger compared with patients in the all low class. Furthermore, compared to the other three classes, patients in the all high class had lower functional status and higher comorbidity scores, and reported poorer QoL scores. Patients in the high and low psychological classes had a moderate probability of reporting physical symptoms. Patients in the low psychological class reported a higher number of symptoms, a lower functional status, and poorer physical and total QoL scores. CONCLUSION: Distinct subgroups of oncology patients can be identified based on symptom occurrence rates. Patient characteristics that are associated with these subgroups can be used to identify patients who are at greater risk for multiple co-occurring symptoms and diminished QoL, so that these patients can be offered appropriate symptom management interventions.
28075622	Imaging Surveillance After Primary Breast Cancer Treatment.	OBJECTIVE: Current clinical guidelines are consistent in supporting annual mammography for women after treatment of primary breast cancer. Surveillance imaging beyond standard digital mammography, including digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT), breast ultrasound, and MRI, may improve outcomes. This article reviews the evidence on the performance and effectiveness of breast imaging modalities available for surveillance after treatment of sporadic unilateral primary breast cancer and identifies additional factors to be considered when selecting an imaging surveillance regimen. CONCLUSION: Evidence review supports the use of mammography for surveillance after primary breast cancer treatment. Variability exists in guideline recommendations for surveillance initiation, interval, and cessation. DBT offers the most promise as a potential modality to replace standard digital mammography as a front-line surveillance test; a single published study to date has shown a significant decrease in recall rates compared with standard digital mammography alone. Most guidelines do not support the use of whole-breast ultrasound in breast cancer surveillance, and further studies are needed to define the characteristics of women who may benefit from MRI surveillance. The emerging evidence about surveillance imaging outcomes suggests that additional factors, including patient and imaging characteristics, tumor biology and gene expression profile, and choice of treatment, warrant consideration in selecting personalized posttreatment imaging surveillance regimens.
28075608	Sonographic Appearance of Lesions Diagnosed as Lobular Neoplasia at Sonographically Guided Biopsies.	OBJECTIVE: The objective of our study was to review the sonographic features of breast lesions yielding lobular neoplasia (LN) at sonographically guided biopsy, evaluate the surgical pathology outcome of these lesions, and determine if imaging findings or clinical features can be used to predict an upgrade to malignancy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Of the 8205 sonographically guided breast biopsies (14-gauge cores) performed from 2007 through 2014, 22 yielded a diagnosis of LN, which means that LN was the most severe pathologic lesion. Imaging features were analyzed in consensus by two radiologists. Correlation of biopsy findings with definitive pathologic results was performed when available. RESULTS: Twenty-two LN lesions (20 patients [mean age +/- SD, 52.05 +/- 13.66 years]) were diagnosed at biopsy. Of the LN lesions that were seen on mammography (6/22, 27.3%), most lesions appeared as masses (3/6, 50%). On sonography, LN lesions (mean size, 8.10 mm) appeared as masses (15/22, 68.2%) with oval shape (10/15, 66.7%), well-circumscribed or microlobulated margins (11/15, 73.3%), hypoechoic echotexture (10/15, 66.7%), posterior enhancement (73.3%, 11/15), and parallel orientation (8/15, 53.3%). Most of the masses were categorized as BI-RADS category 4 (21/22, 95.5%). Seven lesions (7/22, 31.8%) appeared as areas of shadowing or distortion without discrete masses. Twenty (20/22, 90.9%) lesions were excised surgically, and pathology results led to an upgrade in five lesions (5/20, 25% [one nonmass lesion and four masses]). Neither mammographic nor sonographic features were associated with malignant outcome (p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: LN diagnosed at sonographically guided 14-gauge core needle biopsy does not show any specific features according to the BI-RADS lexicon and is associated with a 25% underestimation rate. No clinical or imaging characteristic is predictive of malignancy.
28075606	Potential Application of Dual-Energy CT in Gynecologic Cancer: Initial Experience.	OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this article is to review the use of dual-energy CT (DECT) in the assessment of gynecologic cancer. CONCLUSION: DECT has the potential to improve diagnostic performance, may improve the ability to differentiate between simple cystic lesions and primary ovarian cancer, and may also improve the detection of musculoskeletal and liver metastases. Additional studies will be needed to determine the direction of future developments and the degree to which DECT will affect the imaging and management of gynecologic cancer.
28075472	Suppression of PTEN/AKT signaling decreases the expression of TUBB3 and TOP2A with subsequent inhibition of cell growth and induction of apoptosis in human breast cancer MCF-7 cells via ATP and caspase-3 signaling pathways.	The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of PTEN/AKT signaling on TUBB3 and TOP2A expression and on the subsequent cell growth of human breast cancer MCF-7 cells. We found that the disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) of breast cancer patients with TUBB3positive tumors were lower than these rates in the patients with TUBB3-negative tumors. Meanwhile, DFS and OS of breast cancer patients with TOP2A-positive tumors were also lower than these rates in patients with TOP2A-negative tumors. Suppression of PTEN reduced the protein expression of TUBB3 and TOP2A in MCF-7 cells. Suppression of PTEN also reduced cell proliferation and induced apoptosis and caspase-3 activity in MCF-7 cells. Moreover, an increase in ATP also reduced TUBB3 and TOP2A protein expression, reduced cell proliferation and induced apoptosis and caspase-3 activity in the MCF-7 cells following suppression of PTEN. Suppression of phosphorylation-AKT (p-AKT) reduced the protein expression of TUBB3 and TOP2A in the MCF-7 cells. Suppression of p-AKT also reduced cell proliferation and induced apoptosis and caspase-3 activity in the MCF-7 cells. Then, ATP also reduced TUBB3 and TOP2A protein expression, reduced cell proliferation and induced apoptosis and caspase-3 activity in MCF-7 cells following suppression of p-AKT. These results suggest that PTEN/AKT signaling affects the expression of TUBB3 and TOP2A reducing cell growth and inducing apoptosis of human breast cancer MCF-7 cells through ATP and caspase-3 signaling pathways. TUBB3 and TOP2A may be promising prognostic markers for the efficacy of adjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy.
28075466	Co-delivery of doxorubicin and pH-sensitive curcumin prodrug by transferrin-targeted nanoparticles for breast cancer treatment.	The natural product curcumin and the chemotherapeutic agent doxorubicin have been used in the treatment of many cancers, including breast cancer. However, fast clearance and unspecific distribution in the body after intravenous injection are still challenges to be overcome by an ideal nano-sized drug delivery system in cancer treatment. In this study we design transferrin (Tf) decorated nanoparticles (NPs) to co-deliver CUR and DOX for breast cancer treatment. A pH-sensitive prodrug, transferrin-poly(ethylene glycol)-curcumin (Tf-PEG-CUR), was synthesized and used for the selfassembling of NPs (Tf-PEG-CUR NPs). DOX is incorporated into the Tf-PEG-CUR NPs to obtain Tf-PEG-CUR/DOX NPs. In vitro cytotoxicity studies and in vivo antitumor activity were carried out using MCF-7 cells and mice bearing MCF-7 cells, respectively. Tf-PEG-CUR/DOX NPs has a particle size of 89 nm and a zeta potential of -15.6 mV. This system displayed remarkably higher efficiency than other systems both in vitro and in vivo. DOX and CUR were successfully loaded into nanocarriers. The in vitro cell viability assays revealed the combination of Tf-PEG-CUR and DOX NPs exhibited higher cytotoxicity in vitro in MCF-7 cells compared with Tf-PEG-CUR NPs alone. Using the breast cancer xenograft mouse model, we demonstrate that this co-encapsulation approach resulted in an efficient tumor-targeted drug delivery, decreased cytotoxic effects and exhibited stronger antitumor effect.
28075462	DNALK2 inhibits the proliferation and invasiveness of breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells through the Smad-dependent pathway.	Breast cancer is one of the most common malignant neoplasms diagnosed in females worldwide. Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), which belong to the TGF-beta superfamily, regulate a wide range of cellular responses including cell proliferation, differentiation, adhesion, migration and apoptosis in breast cancer. BMPs can bind to type I and II serine/threonine kinase receptors to regulate cell proliferation, invasion, migration, and apoptosis. Type I receptors are expressed in various breast cancer cell lines and primary tumor samples. Activinlike kinase 2 (ALK2) is generally expressed in breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231, MCF7, SK-BR-3 and MDA-MB468); however, the effect of ALK2 on the proliferation and metastasis of breast cancer cells remains unknown. We used a dominant-negative mutant of ALK2 to research the function of ALK2. We aimed to ascertain whether dominant-negative mutant ALK2 adenovirus vector (DNALK2) receptors can compete with wild-type ALK2 receptors. The present study showed that DNALK2 inhibited the growth, migration and metastasis of breast cancer cells by inhibiting the SMAD-dependent pathway and downregulating connective tissue growth factor and inhibitor of differentiation 1 expression, in vivo and in vitro. These observations indicate that ALK2 is a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of breast cancer.
28075453	miR-375 inhibits cancer stem cell phenotype and tamoxifen resistance by degrading HOXB3 in human ER-positive breast cancer.	Cancer stem cell (CSC) formation and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) are pivotal events in tumor cell invasion and metastasis. They have been shown to occur in resistance to tamoxifen. Moreover, microRNAs (miRNAs) have been associated with CSCs, EMT as well as tamoxifen resistance. Studying molecular mechanism of CSCs, EMT as well as tamoxifen resistance will help us to further understand the pathogenesis and progression of the disease and offer new targets for effective therapies. In the present study, we showed that miR-375 inhibits CSC traits in breast cancer MCF-7 cells. Bioinformatics analysis and experimental validation identified HOXB3 as a direct target of miR-375. Overexpressing miR-375 degraded HOXB3 mRNA in MCF-7 cells. Moreover, overexpression of HOXB3 induced formation of CSC phenotypes, EMT and tamoxifen-resistance as well as enhanced ability of migration and invasion in MCF-7 cells. Most ER-positive breast cancer-related deaths occur, because of resistance to standard therapies and metastasis, restoring miR-375 or targeting HOXB3 might serve as potential therapeutic approaches for the treatment of tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer.
28075207	Perceived needs for different components in a rehabilitation program among cancer survivors with chronic fatigue compared to survivors without chronic fatigue.	BACKGROUND: Knowledge about the user' needs is important to develop targeted rehabilitation for cancer patients with chronic fatigue (CF). The aims of the study were to examine prevalence of CF in cancer survivors attending an one-week inpatient educational program (IEP) and to identify characteristics of those with CF. Further to examine the perceived needs for different components in a rehabilitation program, need of complex rehabilitation (at least two components) and aspects of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) among survivors with CF versus those without CF. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Cancer survivors >/=18 years, diagnosed with different types of cancer within the last 10 years and attending a one-week IEP were invited to this cross-sectional study. CF was assessed by the Fatigue Questionnaire, perceived needs by asking a question about needs for different components in a rehabilitation program and HRQoL was assessed by The Medical Outcomes Study Short Form 36. RESULTS: Of 564 participants, 45% reported CF. Breast cancer, mixed cancer types (including small groups with different cancer types) and comorbidities increased the risk for having CF. Compared to participants without CF, the participants with CF reported more frequently need for physical training (86% vs. 65%, p < 0.001), physiotherapy (71% vs. 55%, p < 0.001) and nutrition counseling (68% vs. 53%, p = 0.001). Among participants with CF, 75% reported need for three or more components whereas 54% reported need for the same number of components among those without CF (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Almost half of the cancer survivors attending the IEP had CF. Physical training, physiotherapy and nutrition counseling were the most frequently reported needs and significantly more often observed in participants with CF than without CF. A higher percentage of those with CF reported need for a complex rehabilitation compared to those without CF. More research is necessary to obtain more knowledge to further make targeted programs to better match cancer survivors' needs.
28075166	The predictive value of Ki-67 before neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.	AIM: To review the predictive values of Ki-67 before neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) for breast cancer patients. METHODS: PubMed and EMBASE were searched. Random-effect model meta-analysis was conducted using Revman software. RESULTS: High Ki-67 was associated with more pathological complete responses (pCRs) events (odds ratio: 3.10; 95% CI: 2.52-3.81; 53 studies, 10,848 patients) regardless of HR+, HER2+ and triple-negative breast cancer types, the definitions of pCR and cut-off points for Ki-67. Ki-67 could predict pCR in those who received anthracyclines plus taxanes, and anthracyclines only, and those from Asia and Europe. CONCLUSION: High Ki-67 before NAC was a predictor for pCR in neoadjuvant setting for breast cancer patients.
28073996	Estimate of false-positive breast cancer diagnoses from accuracy studies: a systematic review.	BACKGROUND: False-positive histological diagnoses have the same consequences of overdiagnosis in terms of unnecessary treatment. The aim of this systematic review is to assess their frequency at needle core biopsy (CB) and/or surgical excision of the breast. METHODS: PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library were systematically searched up to 30 October 2015. Eligibility criteria: cross-sectional studies assessing diagnostic accuracy of CB compared with surgical excision; studies assessing reproducibility of pathologists reading the same slides. OUTCOMES: false-positive rates; Misclassification of Benign as Malignant (MBM) histological diagnosis; K statistic. Independent reviewers extracted data and assessed quality using an adapted QUADAS-2 tool. RESULTS: Sixteen studies assessed CB false-positive rates. In 10 studies (41 989 screen-detected lesions), the range of false-positive rates was 0%-7.1%. Twenty-seven studies assessed pathologists' reproducibility. Studies with consecutive, random or stratified samples of all the specimens: at CB the MBM range was 0.25%-2.4% (K values 0.83-0.98); at surgical excision, it was 0.67%-1.2% (K values 0.86-0.94). Studies with enriched samples: the MBM range was 1.4%-6.2% (K values 0.57-0.86). Studies of cases selected for second opinion: the MBM range was 0.29%-12.2% (K values 0.48 and 0.50). CONCLUSIONS: High heterogeneity of the included studies precluded formal pooling estimates. When considering studies of higher sample size or methodological quality, false-positive rates and MBM are around 1%. The impact of false-positive histological diagnoses of breast cancer on unnecessary treatment, as well as that of overdiagnosis, is not negligible and is of importance in clinical practice.
28072715	Conditional disease-free survival among patients with breast cancer.	Conditional disease-free survival (CDFS) reflects changes over time. Because traditional disease-free survival (DFS) is estimated from the date of diagnosis, it is limited in the ability to predict risk of recurrence in patients who have been disease free. In this study, we determined CDFS of breast cancer patients and estimated the prognostic factors for DFS.We retrospectively reviewed clinical data of 7587 consecutive patients who underwent curative surgery for breast cancer between January 2004 and December 2013 at Samsung Medical Center. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify risk factors for DFS, which was computed using the Kaplan-Meier method. CDFS rates were based on cumulative DFS estimates.Median follow-up duration was 20.59 months. Three-year DFS was 93.46% at baseline. Three-year CDFS survival estimates for patients who had been disease free for 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 years after treatment were calculated as 92.84%, 92.37%, 93.03%, 89.41%, and 79.64%, respectively. Three-year CDFS increased continuously each year after 1 year of DFS in hormone receptor (HR)-negative patients but decreased each year in HR-positive patients.In HR-positive patients who are disease free after 3 years, continuous care including surveillance and metastases workup should be considered, although this is not recommended in the current guidelines. On the other hand, the social costs may be reduced in HR-negative patients by extending the surveillance interval. Further studies are needed to identify indicators of DFS prognosis in breast cancer patients.
28072694	Effect of hyperthermic intrathoracic chemotherapy (HITHOC) on the malignant pleural effusion: A systematic review and meta-analysis.	BACKGROUND: Although hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) has been widely used to treat malignant ascites or as a preventive strategy for microscopic carcinomatosis following surgical resection of abdominal tumors, application of hyperthermic intrathoracic chemotherapy (HITHOC) in the treatment of malignant pleural effusion is limited. The objective of the current study was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis on the application of HITHOC in the palliative treatment of malignant pleural effusion. METHODS: After thorough searching of online databases, total 27 articles were included into qualitative systematic review and 5 of them were used to conduct qualitative meta-analysis. RESULTS: It was found that most of HITHOC was used in combination of cytoreductive surgery (CRS) including pleurectomy/decortication or after surgical resection of primary tumors, which mainly were lung cancer, thymoma or thymic carcinoma, breast cancer, and ovarian cancer. Patients who received HITHOC had significantly longer median survival length compared to the patients without HITHOC (Hedges g = 0.763, P < 0.001). In addition, HITHOC therapy was favored (Hedges g = 0.848, P < 0.001) in terms of median survival length, tumor-free survival rate, with tumor survival rate or Karnofsky performance status (KPS) scale. CONCLUSION: HITHOC is a safe and effective therapy in controlling pleural effusion and increasing patient's survival rate.
28072622	170Tm-EDTMP: A Prospective Alternative of 89SrCl2 for Theranostic Treatment of Metastatic Bone Pain.	We have earlier reported the potential of Tm-EDTMP as an alternative cost-effective radiopharmaceutical of SrCl2 for bone pain palliation application. Encouraging results obtained in the radiochemical studies and biological evaluations in animal model have prompted us to initiate the clinical study to evaluate the potential of Tm-EDTMP in human cancer patients. The serial scintigraphic images represent the whole-body scans of a patient (68 years old woman) with skeletal metastases of carcinoma of the breast origin recorded after administering 370 MBq (10 mCi) of Tm-EDTMP at different post-administration time points along with the pre-therapy images recorded with Tc-MDP in the same patient.
28072617	Evaluation of the Response to Breast Cancer Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy Using 18F-FDG Positron Emission Mammography Compared With Whole-Body 18F-FDG PET: A Prospective Observational Study.	PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to assess therapeutic response to breast cancer neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) by F-FDG positron emission mammography (PEM) compared with that to whole-body F-FDG PET (WBPET). METHODS: Twenty patients underwent WBPET and PEM 3 times: the first time was before NAC, the second time was after 2 courses of NAC, and the third time was after all courses of NAC. A pathological complete response (pCR) was defined as no evidence of residual invasive cancer with or without ductal carcinoma in situ. The relationships between each modality's SUVmax and pathological response were evaluated. RESULTS: Nine patients achieved a pCR, whereas the other 11 patients had a non-pCR. The SUVmax of WBPET after 2 courses of NAC was significantly lower in the pCR group than in the non-pCR group (1.4 +/- 0.4 vs 2.7 +/- 2.1, P = 0.0334). There were no significant differences in the SUVmax of PEM (ie, PEM uptake value [PUV]) between the groups. The SUVmax of WBPET (area under the ROC curve [AUC] = 0.761) was superior to the PUVmax (AUC, 0.648) for predicting non-pCR at the interim time point. After all courses of chemotherapy, there were no significant differences between the groups in the SUVmax of WBPET; however, PUVmax was significantly lower in the pCR group than in the non-pCR group (1.0 +/- 0.2 vs 2.5 +/- 2.7, P = 0.0351). After NAC, the PUVmax (AUC, 0.796) was superior to the SUVmax of WBPET (AUC, 0.671). CONCLUSIONS: There proved to be no apparent superiority of PEM in predicting pCR at the interim time point. Positron emission mammography had greater diagnostic capability for detecting residual cancer after all courses of NAC.
28071617	Role of frozen section in the intra-operative margin assessment during breast conserving surgery.	BACKGROUND: Breast conserving surgery (BCS) is increasingly done for early breast cancers in many countries since it has been demonstrated by randomized trials that survival rates after BCS followed by adjuvant therapy are equivalent to those obtained after mastectomy. Frozen section analyses (FSA) is a technique used for intra-operative assessment of margin status in BCS. The aim of this study was to assess the concordance of margin status assessment by FSA and permanent sections and to assess correlation with local recurrence. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 162 patients underwent BCS for in situ or invasive carcinoma with FSA of margins during the year 2008 at our center. The inclusion criteria in this study were patients with intact tumor at the time of surgery. After application of the inclusion criteria, 60 patients could be included in this study. RESULTS: After frozen section, 20 patients had an initial negative margin. 40 subjects underwent additional excisions at the time of initial surgery because of close or positive margins. Of these 40 patients, in 32 patients a negative margin could be achieved with re-excisions. Pathological analyses of frozen section showed concordance to permanent sections in all cases. At a median follow-up of 40 months, there were no local recurrences. CONCLUSION: Intra-operative FSA allows resection of suspicious margins at the time of primary conservative surgery and results in low rates of local recurrence and second surgeries. There is good concordance between results of FSA and the final paraffin section in assessing margin status.
28071616	Presenting features, treatment patterns and outcomes of patients with breast cancer in Pakistan: Experience at a university hospital.	BACKGROUND: Breast cancer is the most common cancer in Pakistani women. We report the presenting features, treatment patterns and survival of breast cancer from a University Hospital in Southern Pakistan and compare the data with international population based studies. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medical records of patients diagnosed to have breast cancer between January 1999 and November 2008 were reviewed retrospectively. RESULTS: A total of 845 patients were identified. Median age of diagnosis was 48 years (range 18-92). Clinical stage was as follows: Stage I 9.9%; Stage II 48.5%; Stage III 26.2%; Stage IV 13.8%; data not available 1.5%. Approximately, half (51.6%) were estrogen receptor (ER) positive and 17.5% over-expressed Her2/neu. Nearly 23% patients received neo-adjuvant chemotherapy while 68.9% received adjuvant chemotherapy. Anthracycline based treatment was the most common treatment until 2003 while later on, patients also received taxanes and trastuzumab based therapy. Age, stage, tumor size, lymph node status, tumor grade, ER status, treatment with hormonal therapy and radiation were the major predictive factors for overall survival (OS). We report an impressive 5 year OS of 75%, stage specific survival was 100%, 88% and 58% for Stages I, II and III respectively. CONCLUSION: The majority of patients present at a younger age and with locally advanced disease. However, short term follow-up reveals that the outcomes are comparable with the published literature from developed countries. Long-term follow-up and inclusion of data from population-based registries are required for accurate comparison.
28071615	Knowledge, attitude and practice about breast cancer and breast self-examination among women seeking out-patient care in a teaching hospital in central India.	BACKGROUND: Breast cancer (BC) continues to be a major cause of morbidity and mortality throughout the world. Early detection of BC and early treatment increases the chance of survival. According to Breast Health Global Initiative guidelines for low and middle income countries, diagnosing BCs early by promoting breast self-awareness; clinical breast examination (CBE) and resource adapted mammographic screening will reduce BC mortality. There is a paucity of data on the knowledge and awareness of BC and self-breast examination in India. We designed this hospital based cross sectional descriptive study to evaluate the current status of knowledge, awareness and practices related to BC and breast self-examination in the female rural population attending a teaching hospital. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We did a random sampling to identify and enroll 360 women and their female relatives. We excluded a participant from the study if she had already undergone a screening mammography or had had a BC. The data was collected by a self-administered questionnaire in vernacular language. RESULTS: Our study population included 360 women with a mean age of 45.81 (+/-10.9) years. Only 5 (1.38%) females had a family history of BC. A whopping 81% of women did not have any knowledge about BC. All the women thought that CBE by doctors was the only way for screening BC. CONCLUSIONS: We concluded that with the results of this study, it is imperative to increase awareness about BC and its detection methods in the community through health education campaigns. We should have major policy changes to increase future screening programs and health education programs which would have an overall positive impact on reducing the disease burden.
28071613	Clinical and pathologic response following taxane based neoadjuvant chemotherapy in locally advanced breast cancer patients in a tertiary care centre in India.	BACKGROUND: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy has become the standard recommendation in the management of patients with locally advanced breast cancer. At present anthracycline based regimen such as CAF (cyclophosphamide, adriamycin and 5-FU) is widely used in clinical practice. The introduction of taxanes has revolutionized this field because of superior results. AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: This study is designed to compare the efficacy of paclitaxel plus doxorubicin regimen and CAF (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and 5-fluorouracil) regimen as neoadjuvant treatment of locally advanced breast cancer and to compare their toxicity profiles and also to correlate the hormonal receptor status in predicting response to the NACT. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this prospective study, 101 patients with newly diagnosed locally advanced breast cancer were randomized to receive either CAF or Paclitaxel/adriamycin as NACT for three cycles. The response was assessed objectively using CT scans and applying RECIST criteria. The patients were monitored for hematologic, cardiac and other minor toxicities. RESULTS: There was a significantly increased complete and objective response seen in the AP group when compared to CAF group (24% and 58% in the AP group versus 7.8% and 39.2% in the CAF group, P value 0.0313 for complete response). The pCR rate was also significantly higher in the AP group compared to CAF group. (20.93% versus 4.34%, P value 0.0237). There was no significant difference between the groups with respect to cardiotoxicity and hematotoxicity. Patients with ER negative tumors have responded well to neoadjuvant chemotherapy better than ER positive patients. (Objective response 62.8% vs. 40%, P - 0.0473). CONCLUSIONS: Based on these results, taxane based regimen such as Paclitaxel/adriamycin can be recommended as a first line neoadjuvant regimen in patients with locally advanced breast cancer.
28069519	Denaturing fixatives are compatible with the NanoString nCounter(R) platform and the Prosigna(R) assay.	The objective of this study was to establish that the denaturing fixative, formalin and acetic acid (AFA), is equivalent to neutral-buffered formalin (NBF) on the nCounter system using the Prosigna assay. Twenty-five previously resected tumors from breast cancer patients were apportioned and fixed with either NBF or AFA prior to embedding in paraffin. Differentially fixed and paraffin embedded tissue pairs were sectioned and pathological review was performed according to the Prosigna assay protocol. RNA was isolated using the Prosigna assay kit and analyzed using the NanoString nCounter Dx Analysis system. 47 of the 50 blocks (94%) passed RNA quality control (QC) criteria and were collectively designated as the analysis set. We found that RNA yield and purity (A260/A280) were not significantly different between the fixatives within the analysis set. In the analysis of ROR score, the tissue pairs had a Pearson Correlation Coefficient of 0.91, similar to the correlation observed between paired tissue blocks using a single fixative in previous studies. Subtype concordance between differentially fixed tissue pairs was high (K=0.80). No significant bias or variability in risk of recurrence (ROR) score attributable to fixative was detected in this study. Further analysis revealed that sample pairs with larger differences in ROR score were limited to nearly-depleted tissue blocks containing large amounts of normal tissue due to proximity of the tumor margin. The results of this study demonstrate that the fixative, AFA, does not contribute significantly to bias and variability of assay results.
28069398	Objective decision making between conventional and oncoplastic breast-conserving surgery or mastectomy: An aesthetic and functional prospective cohort study.	BACKGROUND: Breast-conserving surgery (BCS) is considered the standard treatment for early-stage breast cancer. However, fair to poor cosmetic outcomes following conventional BCS have been observed in as many as one-third of cases. The aim of this study was to determine the critical tumor-to-breast volume ratio for each quadrant of the breast beyond which conventional BCS would no longer offer acceptable cosmetic and functional results or satisfactory quality of life for the patient. METHODS: A prospective cohort study was performed between December 2011 and December 2013 involving 350 patients younger than 70 years with early-stage unifocal (T </= 30 mm) breast cancer who underwent wide excision and axillary sentinel lymph node biopsy followed by whole-breast irradiation. Using validated panels and software (the Breast Cancer Treatment Outcome Scale [BCTOS], EORTC Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire number C30-BR23, and Breast Cancer Conservative Treatment - cosmetic results [BCCT.core] software), quality of life and aesthetic and functional parameters and their changes in correlation to the percentage of breast volume excised were statistically analyzed. RESULTS: The maximum percentages of breast volume that were resectable by conventional BCS without resulting in unacceptable aesthetic and functional outcomes or decreased quality of life were 18-19% in the upper-outer quadrant (p < 0.0001), 14-15% in the lower-outer quadrant (p < 0.0001), 8-9% in the upper-inner quadrant (p < 0.0001), and 9-10% in the lower-inner quadrant (p < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: Aided by the calculated cut-off values for each breast quadrant, breast surgeons might render more objective decisions regarding performing conventional BCS, using oncoplastic techniques or choosing mastectomy with immediate reconstruction.
28069257	Benign breast lesions that mimic malignancy.	Many benign and reactive lesions of the breast show morphological overlap with malignant lesions. These benign mimics of malignancy often present diagnostic challenges to even the most experienced pathologists. This review focuses on several benign lesions of the breast that mimic malignant entities. For each of these lesions, we describe the key morphological and immunohistochemical features, potential diagnostic pitfalls, and our approach to arriving at the correct diagnosis.
28069154	The assessment and management of chemotherapy-related toxicities in patients with breast cancer, colorectal cancer, and Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas: A scoping review.	PURPOSE: The purpose of the eSMART (Electronic Symptom Management using the Advanced Symptom Management System (ASyMS) Remote Technology) study is to evaluate the use of mobile phone technology to manage chemotherapy-related toxicities (CRTs) in people with breast cancer (BC), colorectal cancer (CRC), Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL), and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL)) across multiple European sites. One key objective was to review the published and grey literature on assessment and management of CRTs among patients receiving primary chemotherapy for BC, CRC, HL, and NHL to ensure that ASyMS remained evidence-based and reflected current and local practice. METHODS: Three electronic databases were searched for English papers, with abstracts available from 01/01/2004-05/04/2014. For the grey literature, relevant clinical practice guidelines (CPGs)/evidence-based resources (EBRs) from the main international cancer organisations were reviewed as were symptom management (SM) protocols from the sites. RESULTS: After full-text screening, 27 publications were included. The majority (n = 14) addressed fatigue and focused on BC patients. Relevant CPGs/EBRs were found for fatigue (n = 4), nausea/vomiting (n = 5), mucositis (n = 4), peripheral neuropathy (n = 3), diarrhoea (n = 2), constipation (n = 2), febrile neutropenia/infection (n = 7), palmar plantar erythrodysesthesia (PPE) (n = 1), and pain (n = 4). SM protocols were provided by >40% of the clinical sites. CONCLUSIONS: A need exists for empirical research on SM for PPE, diarrhoea, and constipation. Research is needed on the efficacy of self-care strategies in patients with BC, CRC, HL, and NHL. In general, consistency exists across CPGs/EBRs and local guidelines on the assessment and management of common CRTs.
28069150	Symptoms and self-care following pancreaticoduodenectomy: Perspectives from patients and healthcare professionals - Foundation for an interactive ICT application.	PURPOSE: Poor prognosis and a problematic recovery period after pancreaticoduodenectomy means that patients may benefit from early detection of symptoms and support for self-management. Interactive Information and Communication Technology tools can be used for this purpose, but the content needs to be relevant to patients as well as healthcare professionals. To facilitate development of the content of an application for this purpose, the aim of this study was to explore common symptoms and self-care in the first six months after pancreaticoduodenectomy, as identified by patients and healthcare professionals. METHOD: Data were collected through individual interviews with patients (n = 14), along with two focus group interviews and one individual interview with healthcare professionals (n = 10). Data were analysed using qualitative content analysis. RESULTS: Common symptoms after surgery were those related to eating, bowel function and emotional wellbeing, along with fatigue and pain. Some self-care activities and advice were mentioned in the interviews. The patients often experienced a lack of advice on self-care at discharge. CONCLUSIONS: The results render knowledge of the symptoms it is important to be aware of and to assess regularly after pancreaticoduodenectomy. The results also contribute to knowledge about specific self-care related to these symptoms, even though it was not extensively described, and further research is needed to define evidence-based self-care advice.
28068628	Epoxy clerodane diterpene inhibits MCF-7 human breast cancer cell growth by regulating the expression of the functional apoptotic genes Cdkn2A, Rb1, mdm2 and p53.	Systematic analyses of plants that are used in traditional medicine may lead to the discovery of novel cytotoxic secondary metabolites. Diterpene possesses multiple bioactivities; here, epoxy clerodane diterpene (ECD) was isolated from Tinospora cordifolia (Willd.) stem and shown potential antiproliferative effect in MCF-7 human breast cancer cells. The antiproliferative effect of ECD on MCF-7 cells was systematically analyzed by cell and nuclear morphology, alterations in oxidative stress, and the expression of tumor suppressor and mitochondria-mediated apoptosis-related genes. We found that the IC50 value of ECD was 3.2muM at 24h and 2.4muM at 48h. We observed that the cytotoxicity of ECD was specific to MCF-7 cells, whereas ECD was nontoxic to normal Vero and V79 cells. ECD significantly triggered intracellular ROS generation even from the lower doses of 0.6 and 1.2muM; and it is relative to higher dose of 2.4muM. Further, we used 0.6muM, 1.2muM and 2.4muM as experimental doses to analyze the relative dose-dependent effects. Nuclear staining revealed that cells treated with the 2.4muM dose exhibited characteristic apoptotic morphological changes and that 46% of the cells were apoptotic and 4% were necrotic after 48h. ECD significantly increased the expression of mitochondria-dependent apoptotic pathway-related genes after 48h; we observed significantly (p</=0.05) increased expression of CYP1A, GPX, GSK3beta and TNF-alpha and downregulated expression of NF-kappaB. ECD also increased the expression of tumor suppressor genes such as Cdkn2A, Rb1 and p53. In addition, we observed that ECD treatment significantly (p</=0.001) upregulated the expression of apoptotic genes such as Bax, cas-3, cas-8, cas-9 and p21 and downregulated the expression of BCL-2, mdm2 and PCNA. In conclusion, ECD regulates the expression of Cdkn2A, p53 and mdm2 and induces apoptosis via the mitochondrial pathway in MCF-7 human breast cancer cells.
28068608	Designing of carbon based fluorescent nanosea-urchin via green-synthesis approach for live cell detection of zinc oxide nanoparticle.	The present work reports an eco-friendly and economic method for the preparation of different shaped (spherical, rod, and sea-urchin) heteroatom-doped fluorescent carbon nanoparticles (CNPs) by a unique combination of sonochemical, microwave and hydrothermal approach. Not only in terms of chemical, herein, we used the green precursors i.e. six members from solonaceae family for the synthesis of CNPs. Among the various shapes of CNPs, the sea-urchin shape CNPs (SU-CNPs) shows the high product and quantum yield with good photostability, excellent water dispersibility, narrow size distribution and high storage ability. The high quantum yield of derived CNPs made them suitable for patterning and staining (fluorescent inks) as a better, economic and eco-friendly replacement of dyes. In addition, the synthesized SU-CNPs were employed for quantitative detection of a widely used nanomaterial i.e. zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO). The fluorescence sensor was successfully applied for the detection of ZnO nanoparticles in wastewater, human sera and some cosmetic samples without any cross-reactivity. Herein, for the first time, we have successfully used the SU-CNPs for live cell detection of ZnO nanoparticles. The in vitro cytocompatibility study demonstrated that the SU-CNPs were not harmful to the cell up to a very high concentration of 1500.0mgL-1 and could be used for cell imaging. In addition, the SU-CNPs were successfully utilized for the qualitative and quantitative, intracellular detection of ZnO nanoparticle in breast cancer cell line i.e. MCF-7.
28068605	Questionnaire to assess quality of life in patients with breast cancer - Validation of the Chinese version of the EORTC QLQ-BR 53.	PURPOSE: To evaluate the reliability and validity of the Chinese version of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-Breast Cancer (EORTC QLQ-BR53) questionnaire firstly in north of China. METHODS: A total of 294 outpatients with breast cancer in Tianjin Cancer Institution and Hospital from November 2014 to August 2015 were enrolled in this study. All patients self-administered the EORTC QLQ-BR25 and the Short Form 36 Health Survey (SF-36). The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) scoring was performed to evaluate scores. Internal consistency reliability was determined by Cronbach's alpha coefficient for each dimension, with a Cronbach's alpha coefficient >/=0.7 considered to be statistically significant. RESULTS: A satisfactory internal consistency reliability for most multi-item scales was confirmed, as Cronbach's alpha coefficients were close or greater than 0.7 except for breast symptoms (0.615). Multiple-trait scaling analysis demonstrated a good convergent and divergent validity of EORTC QLQ-BR53. Using SF-36 as a reference standard to evaluate the dimensions of EORTC QLQ-BR53, most items in EORTC QLQ-BR53 possessed a favorable correlation with its own dimension (r > 0.4). A statistically significant difference was discovered in dimension scores between patients grouped by ECOG scores except for individual dimensions. CONCLUSIONS: The Chinese version of EORTC QLQ-BR53 is a reliable and valid instrument for measuring the quality of life among Chinese patients with breast cancer.
28068602	Synthesis of 2,3,6,7-tetramethoxyphenanthren-9-amine: An efficient precursor to access new 4-aza-2,3-dihydropyridophenanthrenes as apoptosis inducing agents.	A new route for the synthesis of novel 2,3,6,7-tetramethoxy phenanthrene amine precursor has been successfully accomplished. Subsequently, this amine precursor has been directly utilized for the synthesis of a new series of 4-aza-2,3-dihydropyridophenanthrene derivatives via a three component reaction with tetronic acid and substituted aldehydes. These compounds were evaluated for their cytotoxic potential against human lung (A549), prostate (PC-3 and DU145), breast (MDA-MB-231 and 4T1), gastric (HGC-27), colon (Caco-2) and cervical (HeLa) cancer cell lines. Compound 10l showed significant anticancer profile against DU145 cell line with an IC50 value of 2.6 +/- 0.34 muM. Disruption of F-actin cytoskeleton structure and cell migration inhibition in DU145 cells clearly indicate that the tumor progression and metastasis are affected by this compound (10l). Cell cycle analysis revealed that it arrests the cells in G2/M phase. Acridine orange/ethidium bromide (AO/EB) staining, Hoechst staining and annexin-V binding assays showed that cell proliferation is inhibited through induction of apoptosis. Moreover, its treatment leads to collapse of the mitochondrial membrane potential (DPsim).
28065930	Rapid Changes in Circulating Tumor DNA in Serially Sampled Plasma During Treatment of Breast Cancer: A Case Report.	BACKGROUND The analysis of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) is expected to be a modality to determine the status of cancer in real time. This case indicated utilities and issues in measuring the ctDNA in cancer patients. CASE REPORT A 45-year-old woman with metastatic breast cancer was treated with bevacizumab and paclitaxel. The lung metastases were decreased but the meningitis carcinoma developed rapidly and she died. During the treatment with bevacizumab and paclitaxel, blood samples were taken serially and ctDNA was analyzed using a next-generation sequencer. TP53 frameshift mutation (TP53; p.Arg158fs with 7 nucleotides deletion) was identified in the tumor, and dynamic change in this mutation in ctDNA was observed in serially sampled plasma in this patient. We observed a rapid decrease of TP53 mutation at the beginning of treatment, then it increased as a sign of relapse. However, the high allelic fraction value of TP53 mutation was not consistent during the progression of cancer, suggesting that several factors affected the value of ctDNA. CONCLUSIONS Although this is a single-case experience, it strongly suggests ctDNA could be a modality to determine the cancer status in real time. However, we found that several factors affected the value of ctDNA. Further investigations are needed to reveal the significance of these very high-sensitivity changes.
28065411	Ki67 assessment in breast cancer: an update.	Although immunohistochemical detection of the Ki67 antigen has been used for many years to assess cancer proliferation, this marker is still not recommended for routine use in clinical management of breast cancer. The major reason for this situation is a lack of a standardised procedure for Ki67 assessment as well as persistence of several issues of debate with regards to the Ki67 assay interpretation and the marker's clinical utility. Nowadays Ki67 assessment is principally used for estimation of prognosis and guiding the decision on adjuvant treatment choice, as well as for prediction of response to neoadjuvant treatment in ER+/HER2- breast cancer. In ER-/HER2+ and ER-/HER2- tumours, high post-neoadjuvant Ki67 index is associated with unfavourable prognosis. We review here the elements impacting analytical validity of the Ki67 immunohistochemical assay, the evidence of its clinical utility and the current recommendations for its use in breast cancer management.
28065370	A new qualitative pattern classification of shear wave elastograghy for solid breast mass evaluation.	OBJECTIVES: To examine the efficacy of qualitative shear wave elastography (SWE) in the classification and evaluation of solid breast masses, and to compare this method with conventional ultrasonograghy (US), quantitative SWE parameters and qualitative SWE classification proposed before. METHODS: From April 2015 to March 2016, 314 consecutive females with 325 breast masses who decided to undergo core needle biopsy and/or surgical biopsy were enrolled. Conventional US and SWE were previously performed in all enrolled subjects. Each mass was classified by two different qualitative classifications. One was established in our study, herein named the Qual1. Qual1 could classify the SWE images into five color patterns by the visual evaluations: Color pattern 1 (homogeneous pattern); Color pattern 2 (comparative homogeneous pattern); Color pattern 3 (irregularly heterogeneous pattern); Color pattern 4 (intralesional echo pattern); and Color pattern 5 (the stiff rim sign pattern). The second qualitative classification was named Qual2 here, and included a four-color overlay pattern classification (Tozaki and Fukuma, Acta Radiologica, 2011). The Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) assessment and quantitative SWE parameters were recorded. Diagnostic performances of conventional US, SWE parameters, and combinations of US and SWE parameters were compared. RESULTS: With pathological results as the gold standard, of the 325 examined breast masses, 139 (42.77%) samples were malignant and 186 (57.23%) were benign. The Qual1 showed a higher Az value than the Qual2 and quantitative SWE parameters (all P<0.05). When applying Qual1=Color pattern 1 for downgrading and Qual1=Color pattern 5 for upgrading the BI-RADS categories, we obtained the highest Az value (0.951), and achieved a significantly higher specificity (86.56%, P=0.002) than that of the US (81.18%) with the same sensitivity (94.96%). CONCLUSIONS: The qualitative classification proposed in this study may be representative of SWE parameters and has potential to be relevant assistance in breast mass diagnoses.
28064426	The impact of mode of presentation on distress in patients with early stage breast cancer.	AIMS: We set out to determine whether a difference exists between levels of psychological distress in women diagnosed with breast cancer through routine screening versus those who presented symptomatically. METHODS: We assessed levels of distress in comparable numbers of patients with screen-detected and non-screen-detected female breast cancer patients being treated with curative intent, using the Hospital Anxiety and Distress Scale (HADS) (total n = 93). RESULTS: In both cohorts, 50.5% scored above threshold for anxiety, depression, or both. Being aged over 60 was associated with concomitant positive anxiety and depression screening in both cohorts. Financial stress was associated with positive depression scores. No statistically significant difference was found between HADS scores for screen-detected versus self-detected patients. CONCLUSION: Over 50% of patients with screen-detected or symptomatic breast cancer experience high levels of distress. Consideration should be made for the routine use of distress screening in this population.
28064235	Outcomes in Patients with pT1-T2, pN0-N1 Breast Cancer After Conservative Surgery and Whole-breast Radiotherapy.	AIM: To evaluate locoregional recurrence, overall survival, disease-free survival and prognostic influence of the number of positive lymph nodes and other variables in breast cancer treatment. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 377 patients with pT1-T2, pN0-N1 invasive breast carcinoma treated from 2005 to 2013 were retrospectively evaluated. Patients underwent conservative surgery followed by whole-breast radiotherapy. Clavicular region irradiation was not performed. RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 4 years, locoregional recurrence rate was 3.4% (nodal recurrence=1.06%). Expression of progesterone receptors was significantly associated with better disease-free survival, tumor size (T>2 cm) with poorer disease-free survival, locoregional recurrence and poorer overall survival; the presence of three nodal metastases was related to significantly poorer overall survival (p=0.024). CONCLUSION: Whole-breast adjuvant radiotherapy without nodal irradiation after breast-conserving surgery led to low rate of locoregional recurrence and high rates of overall survival and disease-free survival in patients with pT1-T2 pN0-N1 breast cancer.
28064227	PET Probe-Guided Surgery in Patients with Breast Cancer: Proposal for a Methodological Approach.	BACKGROUND: Although it is valuable for detecting distant metastases, identifying recurrence, and evaluating responses to chemotherapy, the role of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron-emission tomography/computed tomography (18F-FDG PET/CT) in assessing locoregional nodal status for initial staging of breast cancer has not yet been well-defined in clinical practice. In the current report, we describe a new PET probe-based clinical approach, with evaluation of the technical performance of a handheld high-energy gamma probe for intraoperative localization of breast carcinomas, and evaluation of lymph node metastases during radio-guided oncological surgery. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Three patients underwent a PET/CT scan immediately prior to surgery following the standard clinical protocol. Intraoperatively, tumors were localized and resected with the assistance of a hand-held gamma probe. PET-guided assessment of the presence or absence of regional nodal spread of malignancy was compared with the reference standard of histopathological examination. RESULTS: In all three cases, perioperative 18F-FDG PET/CT imaging and intraoperative gamma probe detection verified complete resection of the hypermetabolic lesions and demonstrated no additional suspicious occult disease. CONCLUSION: This innovative approach demonstrates great promise for providing real-time access to metabolic and morphological tumor information that may lead to an optimal disease-tailored approach. In carefully selected indications, a PET probe can be a useful adjunct in surgical practice, but further trials with a larger number of patients need to be performed to verify these findings.
28064072	Long-term outcome of breast cancer patients with pathologic N3a lymph node stage.	PURPOSE: To evaluate factors influencing the long-term outcome of patients presenting with 10 or more metastatic axillary lymph nodes (pN3a) after surgery for primary breast cancer. METHOD: Between January 1990 and December 2015, a total of 130 patients with pN3a breast cancer at surgery were identified in our Institutions and included in the study. Twenty-nine of them (22.3%) received neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The Multivariate Cox proportional hazards model was used to determine independent prognostic factors associated with DFS and OS. RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 6.4 years (range 0.87-25 years), 2 patients had a local relapse, 59 distant metastases (1 with local relapse) and 52 patients died. The 5-year DFS and OS rates were 61.8% and 71.5%, respectively. At multivariate analysis, pN3a stage after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (ypN3a) was significantly associated with increased risk of recurrence (HR 1.92, p = 0.02) and death (HR 2.05, p = 0.029). Absence of progesterone receptor (PR) expression was the most important tumor characteristic associated with poor prognosis, both in terms of recurrence (HR 2.55, p < 0.001) and death (HR 2.23, p = 0.019). High levels of Ki-67 index (>/=20%) were significantly associated with a shorter OS (HR 2.03, p = 0.027), but not with DFS. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study indicate that ypN3a stage, lack of expression of PR, and Ki-67 >/= 20% negatively affect long-term outcome of patients with pN3a breast cancer.
28063411	The properties of red seaweed (Kappaphycus alvarezii) and its effect on mammary carcinogenesis.	The edible red seaweed (Kappaphycus alvarezii) is one of the algae species which was found to be rich in nutrients and nutraceutical. Hence, K. alvarezii may have the ability to suppress cancer through its antiproliferative properties. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential compounds of K. alvarezii, cytotoxicity properties of K. alvarezii extract on breast cancer cell line (MCF-7), investigated toxicity effect of high dosage K. alvarezii extract in rats and determined the effect of K. alvarezii on 7, 12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA) mammary carcinogenesis in rats. The method of LCMS/MS and MTT assay were used. For animal study, sub-chronic toxicity method was used, the rats were supplemented with 2000mg/kg body weight daily of K. alvarezii crude extracts by oral gavage. For the anticancer effect of K. alvarezii crude extracts, this study consisted of three groups of the experimental, untreated and normal group of rats. The experimental and untreated groups of rats were induced with mammary tumour with DMBA. The experimental group of rats was given with K. alvarezii crude extracts orally. The results were being used to compare with the untreated group of rats and normal group of rats. All the rats were fed with standard diet and water ad libitum. Mortality, behavior changes and tumour sizes were observed specifically. The differences between the three groups of rats were evaluated by using the ANOVA test. By using LCMS/MS method, six unknown compounds were analysed. K. alvarezii crude extract reduced the cell viability of MCF-7 from 84.91% to 0.81% and the IC50 value is 4.1+/-0.69mg/mL. For sub-chronic and heavy metal toxicity studies, no significant difference was found in haematological and biochemical values of the control group and experimental group. The growth rate of tumours in the untreated group of rats was found significantly higher than the experimental group of rats. Besides that, the white blood cells level in untreated group was found significantly higher than the experimental group and the normal group. In conclusion, K. alvarezii extract might able to slow down the growth rate of the tumour cells, therefore, identification of an active compound of inhibition growth rate of the tumour cells can be positively carried out in the future.
28063331	pCR rates in patients with bilateral breast cancer after neoadjuvant anthracycline-taxane based-chemotherapy - A retrospective pooled analysis of individual patients data of four German neoadjuvant trials.	PURPOSE: Patients with bilateral breast cancer (BBC) are usually excluded from participating in clinical trials and little is known about the response and outcome of BBC to neoadjuvant chemotherapy compared to unilateral BC (UBC). METHODS: We prospectively captured the information on patients with BBC in our database treated within four neoadjuvant chemotherapy trials and collected retrospectively the rate of pathological complete response (pCR) defined as ypT0 ypN0, ypT0/is ypN0, ypT0 ypNX, clinical and histologic parameters. Synchronous carcinoma in the contralateral breast was considered as the non-indicator lesion. Patients with UBC only treated within the same neoadjuvant trials performed the control group. RESULTS: From the 6727 patients treated within 4 German neoadjuvant trials 119 (1.8%) patients have been identified with the diagnosis of BBC. The pCR rate (ypT0 ypN0) was 12.6% in the non-indicator lesion group versus 10.9% the indicator lesion group versus 20.9% for patients with unilateral disease (p = 0.003). There were more advanced tumor stages and positive axillary lymph nodes in the indicator lesion than in the nonindicator lesion or in UBC. In 52.5% the molecular subtype was identical between indicator and non-indicator lesion with more triple negative and HER2 positive BC in the group of UBC. The disease free survival rate (DFS) was 25.8% for patients with UBC versus 39.6% for patients with BBC. CONCLUSION: The selection for the indicator lesion was based on tumor size, nodal status and inclusion criteria. Patients with BBC patients had a lower pCR rate and a lower DFS.
28062432	Epirubicin extravasation: consequences of delayed management.	Epirubicin is an anthracycline chemotherapy agent used for treatment of several cancers including oesophageal, breast and gastric. Extravasation is a well-recognised and serious complication of any intravenous therapies but especially chemotherapeutic agents. Signs of the injury can be subtle and without prompt recognition and treatment there can be extensive tissue damage and depending on location of injury this can result in significant functional loss. In this article, a case of delayed management of epirubicin extravasation from a cannula situated at the dorsum of the hand is discussed. Successful surgical reconstruction of the resulting substantial tissue damage using a radial forearm flap 21 days following injury is described.
28061634	Personalized Medicine Approach for an Exceptional Response to Multiple-recurrent and Metastatic HER2-positive Oropharyngeal Squamous Cell Carcinoma.	INTRODUCTION: Advanced stage squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck carries an overall poor prognosis, and survivorship gains have remained relatively stagnant compared to other malignancies due to its complex tumor biology and lack of proven effective targeting agents. METHODS: We present a case of an exceptional responder to molecular-targeted therapy for metastatic oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma using a chemotherapeutic agent FDA approved for breast cancer and targeting the HER2/Neu receptor in order to discuss the larger clinical implications. RESULTS: The National Cancer Institute (NCI) has recently instituted the Exceptional Responders Initiative in order to identify such patients with unexpected outcomes in order to expedite the development of additional targeted therapies. This case illustrates the opportunity for cure using targeted oncogene identification in a scenario of recurrent squamous cell carcinoma with lung metastasis typically considered fatal. CONCLUSIONS: Molecular tumor analysis is an infrequently utilized tool in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma; however, as understanding of biologic mechanisms improves, additional molecular targets will become available and expand treatment opportunities such as HER2/Neu targeting. The Exceptional Responders Initiative is a unique strategy with potential to expedite progress.
28061531	Effects of circadian rhythms and treatment times on the response of radiotherapy for painful bone metastases.	BACKGROUND: Previous studies have observed how the time of radiotherapy delivery can impact toxicities and outcomes. The goal of this study was to determine whether treatment time influenced radiotherapy response for bone metastases. METHODS: Patients who received radiation treatment to painful bone metastases from January 2000 to December 2010 were included in our analysis. Demographic and treatment information including performance status, primary site, treatment dose and fraction, and response were collected prospectively. Treatment times were extracted from patient medical records. Patients were allocated to 8:00 AM-11:00 AM, 11:01 AM-2:00 PM, or 2:01 PM-5:00 PM cohorts based on their treatment times. To compare treatment response between the three cohorts, the Fisher exact test was used. A two-sided P value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Analysis was repeated with males and females separately. RESULTS: A total of 194 patients were included. The median age was 68 years and 55.5% of patients responded to treatment. The dose and fraction of radiation received differed significantly between treatment cohorts using all allocation methods. Females in the 11:01 AM-2:00 PM cohort exhibited a significantly higher response rate (P=0.02) and differing proportions of response types (P=0.03) compared to the 8:00 AM- 11:00 AM and 2:01 PM-5:00 PM cohorts when allocated using all treatment times. No significant differences in response were seen between cohorts when all patients were analysed together or analysed for males only. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment time may affect response in female patients receiving radiotherapy for painful bone metastases. Subsequent chronotherapy studies in radiation should investigate these gender differences.
28060965	The Clinical Research Landscape in Rhode Island.	OBJECTIVES: To present an overview of clinical research activity and the state of medical research funding in Rhode Island. METHODS: We utilized clinicaltrials.gov registry to profile clinical studies between 2011 to 2016. NIH RePORT and other federal databases were used to extract information on levels of federal funding. Previously published hospital financial reports were reviewed for data on hospital-specific total external research funding. RESULTS: During 2011-2016, 1651 clinical studies were registered in clinicaltrials.gov. Nearly a third of all clinical studies were in oncology (21%) and cardiovascular diseases (10%). Alzheimer's dementia, breast cancer, HIV, and hepatitis C accounted for nearly 17% of all clinical trials. Seventy-five percent (75%) of clinical trials in RI were conducted in hospitals affiliated with Lifespan or Care New England. Financial support for clinical trials largely came from industry (60%) with 23% being supported by the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The rest are funded by nonprofit organizations, charitable foundations, educational institutions, and unlisted concerns. [Full article available at http://rimed.org/rimedicaljournal-2017-01.asp].
28058628	A pilot study on plasma levels of micro-RNAs involved in angiogenesis and vascular maturation in patients with breast cancer.	Micro-RNAs (miRNAs) have a complex role in carcinogenesis and tumour progression. Several miRNAs, such as miR-221, miR-27b and miR-132, have been implicated in the regulation of VEGF tumour angiogenic activity. In this pilot study, we assessed angiogenesis and DLL4+ vascular maturation index (VMI) in breast cancer tissues, in parallel with the plasma levels of the above-mentioned miRNAs. Significantly higher than control samples pre-operative levels were recorded in 10/11, 7/11 and 9/11 cases for the miR-221, miR-27b and miR-132, respectively. Seven days after surgery, a significant reduction of these miRNAs was noted in 6/11, 3/11 and 2/11 cases, respectively. High pre-operative levels of miR-27b were linked with node metastasis (p = 0.04). High pre-operative levels of miR-132 were linked with small tumours (p = 0.03) and her2 overexpression (p = 0.003). The DLL4+ VMI ranged from 26 to 69% (median 45%). Patients with poor DLL4+ VMI had significantly high pre-operative and post-operative levels of miR-221 (p = 0.01 and 0.02, respectively) and high post-operative levels of miR-132 (p = 0.02). It is concluded that angiogenesis-related miRs as detected in the plasma of patients may prove of a useful tool in the identification of patients with poor vascular maturation and high risk to develop metastasis. Whether such miRs may identify patients who would benefit from vascular normalization policies is a hypothesis that emerges from the current study.
28058502	A novel loss-of-function heterozygous BRCA2 c.8946_8947delAG mutation found in a Chinese woman with family history of breast cancer.	INTRODUCTION: Breast cancer is the most frequent female malignancy worldwide. Among them, some cases have hereditary susceptibility in two leading genes, BRCA1 and BRCA2. Heterozygous germ line mutations in them are related with increased risk of breast, ovarian and other cancer, following autosomal dominant inheritance mode. METHODS AND RESULTS: For purpose of early finding, early diagnosis and early treatment, mutation detecting of BRCA1/2 genes was performed in unselected 300 breast or ovarian patients and unaffected women using next-generation sequencing and then confirmed by Sanger sequencing. A non-previously reported heterozygous mutation c.8946_8947delAG (p.D2983FfsX34) of BRCA2 gene was identified in an unaffected Chinese woman with family history of breast cancer (her breast cancer mother, also carrying this mutation). The BRCA2-truncated protein resulted from the frame shift mutation was found to lose two putative nuclear localization signals and a Rad51-binding motif in the extreme C-terminal region by bioinformatic prediction. And then in vitro experiments showed that nearly all the mutant protein was unable to translocate to the nucleus to perform DNA repair activity. This novel mutant BRCA2 protein is dysfunction. CONCLUSIONS: We classify the mutation into disease causing and conclude that it is the risk factor for breast cancer in this family. So, conducting the same mutation test and providing genetic counseling for this family is practically meaningful and significant. Meanwhile, the identification of this new mutation enriches the Breast Cancer Information Core database, especially in China.
28056411	Chemotherapy-related late adverse effects on ovarian function in female survivors of childhood and young adult cancer: A systematic review.	BACKGROUND: Anti-cancer treatment may reduce the fertile life span and induce premature menopause. This review aims to provide an overview of the available literature on effects of chemotherapy only on the incidence of ovarian dysfunction and to evaluate the relationship between dose of chemotherapy, age at time of treatment, and time since treatment in female survivors of childhood and young adult cancer. METHODS: A comprehensive search of electronic databases was performed (search date December 2015). RESULTS: 45 studies were included, describing, in total, 5607 female survivors. Median age at menopause was earlier in cancer survivors than in the general population. The prevalence of amenorrhoea varied from 0% to 83%. Those exposed to MVPP protocols were at highest risk for amenorrhoea (39-79%), as were breast cancer survivors receiving cyclophosphamide-containing regimens, in whom the prevalence of amenorrhoea was 40-80%. The most important risk factors for ovarian dysfunction were: (1) alkylating agents, specifically procarbazine and busulfan, (2) older age at treatment. CONCLUSION: Breast cancer survivors, those treated with procarbazine or other alkylating agents and those with a higher age at diagnosis are at highest risk of diminished ovarian function. However, all studies included in this review showed methodological limitations. It is imperative that nation-wide registries guarantee long term follow-up during the adult life of cancer survivors.
28056400	Efficacy and safety of eribulin as first- to third-line treatment in patients with advanced or metastatic breast cancer previously treated with anthracyclines and taxanes.	OBJECTIVES: Despite the survival benefit and acceptable tolerability of eribulin for advanced/metastatic breast cancer (MBC) patients pretreated with anthracyclines and taxanes, there is limited evidence of the clinical benefit of early eribulin use. We investigated the efficacy and safety of first- to third-line eribulin use in patients with MBC. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this phase II, open-label, single-arm study conducted at 14 sites in Kyushu, Japan, women with histologically confirmed human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative MBC were enrolled between December 1, 2011 and November 30, 2013 (Data cut-off: November 30, 2014). Objective response rate (ORR; primary endpoint), disease control rate (DCR), progression-free survival (PFS), duration of response (DOR), overall survival (OS), and safety were evaluated. RESULTS: Of 53 recruited patients, 47 were enrolled. The ORR was 17.0% (95% confidence interval, 7.6-30.8), DCR was 66.0% (51.2-77.8), median PFS was 4.9 months (3.5-7.0), DOR was 6.6 months (1.9-14.3), and median OS was 17.4 months (10.1-not evaluable). The common grade 3/4 adverse events were neutropenia (25 patients; 53.2%), leucopenia (16 patients; 42.1%) and febrile neutropenia (4 patients; 8.5%). Toxicity did not increase during the long-term treatment. Subgroup analysis indicated that first-line treatment led to higher ORR and prolonged PFS and OS than second-/third-line treatment and that incidence of adverse events in patients of second-/third-line treatment was not higher than that in patients of first-line treatment. CONCLUSION: Eribulin exhibited efficacy and manageable tolerability in Japanese women with pretreated MBC in first- to third-line use. (ID: UMIN000007121).
28055266	Quality of life in long-term and very long-term cancer survivors versus population controls in Germany.	BACKGROUND: With the increasing number and diversity of cancer survivors, studies of survivors' physical, emotional, and social health are of growing importance. While there is a growing body of literature on the quality of life (QoL) of cancer patients during the early years past diagnosis, less is known regarding QoL in long-term survivors (LTS) (5 + years past diagnosis) and particularly in very long-term survivors (VLTS) (10 + years past diagnosis). The objective of our study is to: (1) compare QoL of long-term cancer survivors and population norms; and (2) assess whether any deficits in QoL of survivors observed 5-10 years past diagnosis persist beyond the 10th year past diagnosis. METHODS: In total 6952 long-term cancer survivors (5-16 years past diagnosis of breast, colorectal, or prostate cancer) from Germany recruited in the context of the population-based CAESAR + study were compared with 1878 population-based controls without a history of cancer. QoL was assessed with the EORTC QLQ-C30. Differences in QoL between survivors and controls were assessed via multiple regression while controlling for age, gender, education, and case mix for survivors 5-9 years and 10 + years past diagnosis separately. RESULTS: Overall QoL in long-term cancer survivors was comparable to population norms but specific deficits in social, role, emotional, cognitive, and physical functioning and symptoms such as insomnia, fatigue, dyspnea, constipation, diarrhea, and financial difficulties were more prevalent in LTSs. Detriments in QoL persisted during the observation period and affected particularly cancer survivors at younger ages (<50 years). Non-significant aggravations in QoL with longer time since diagnosis were observed in very young and very old cancer survivors. CONCLUSIONS: Detriments in health-related quality of life persist over more than a decade and affect predominantly younger patients. Improvements both in early and long-term follow-up care of cancer survivors seem warranted.
28055247	Staging of breast cancer and the advanced applications of digital mammogram: what the physician needs to know?	OBJECTIVE: To study the role of advanced applications of digital mammogram, whether contrast-enhanced spectral mammography (CESM) or digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT), in the "T" staging of histologically proven breast cancer before planning for treatment management. METHODS: In this prospective analysis, we evaluated 98 proved malignant breast masses regarding their size, multiplicity and the presence of associated clusters of microcalcifications. Evaluation methods included digital mammography (DM), 3D tomosynthesis and CESM. Traditional DM was first performed then in a period of 10-14-day interval; breast tomosynthesis and contrast-based mammography were performed for the involved breast only. Views at tomosynthesis were acquired in a "step-and-shoot" tube motion mode to produce multiple (11-15), low-dose images and in contrast-enhanced study, low-energy (22-33 kVp) and high-energy (44-49 kVp) exposures were taken after the i.v. injection of the contrast agent. Operative data were the gold standard reference. RESULTS: Breast tomosynthesis showed the highest accuracy in size assessment (n = 69, 70.4%) than contrast-enhanced (n = 49, 50%) and regular mammography (n = 59, 60.2%). Contrast-enhanced mammography presented the least performance in assessing calcifications, yet it was most sensitive in the detection of multiplicity (92.3%), followed by tomosynthesis (77%) and regular mammography (53.8%). The combined analysis of the three modalities provided an accuracy of 74% in the "T" staging of breast cancer. CONCLUSION: The combined application of tomosynthesis and contrast-enhanced digital mammogram enhanced the performance of the traditional DM and presented an informative method in the staging of breast cancer. Advances in knowledge: Staging and management planning of breast cancer can divert according to tumour size, multiplicity and the presence of microcalcifications. DBT shows sharp outlines of the tumour with no overlap tissue and spots microcalcifications. Contrast-enhanced spectral mammogram shows the extent of abnormal contrast uptake and detects multiplicity. Integrated analysis provides optimal findings for proper "T" staging of breast cancer.
28054957	Molecular Biomarkers for Prediction of Targeted Therapy Response in Metastatic Breast Cancer: Trick or Treat?	In recent years, the study of genomic alterations and protein expression involved in the pathways of breast cancer carcinogenesis has provided an increasing number of targets for drugs development in the setting of metastatic breast cancer (i.e., trastuzumab, everolimus, palbociclib, etc.) significantly improving the prognosis of this disease. These drugs target specific molecular abnormalities that confer a survival advantage to cancer cells. On these bases, emerging evidence from clinical trials provided increasing proof that the genetic landscape of any tumor may dictate its sensitivity or resistance profile to specific agents and some studies have already showed that tumors treated with therapies matched with their molecular alterations obtain higher objective response rates and longer survival. Predictive molecular biomarkers may optimize the selection of effective therapies, thus reducing treatment costs and side effects. This review offers an overview of the main molecular pathways involved in breast carcinogenesis, the targeted therapies developed to inhibit these pathways, the principal mechanisms of resistance and, finally, the molecular biomarkers that, to date, are demonstrated in clinical trials to predict response/resistance to targeted treatments in metastatic breast cancer.
28054926	A Literature Review of Burns in Reconstructed Breasts After Mastectomy.	OBJECTIVE: The goal of this literature review is to review and combine case studies of accidental burns to the breast, following mastectomy and immediate breast reconstruction with autologous tissue, implants, or tissue expanders. METHODS: The authors searched PubMed and Cochrane Library and reviewed cases of burns of reconstructed breasts after mastectomy from July 1985 to May 2015. Only studies in the English language were included in their search. They also report 5 new cases of burns in patients with burns to the breast, which were either reconstructed with implants or tissue expanders at Sheba Medical Center (Ramat Gan, Israel). RESULTS: The authors found 21 publications regarding burns after breast reconstruction dating from 1985 to 2014, which equaled 59 cases of reported burns in the 21 included publications. The most common causes of burns were due to heat conduction (37/59) followed by solar radiation (19/59) and heat convection (3/59). The majority of the cases were treated by a conservative approach. The 5 new cases added were all due to thermal radiation (5/5). Two of these cases were treated conservatively (2/5), and 3 underwent surgery (3/5). CONCLUSION: The removal of thermoregulatory capabilities of the skin and the thickness of the remaining tissue in the mastectomy procedure are key to understanding the cause of burns to reconstructed breasts.
28054533	Application of accelerated failure time models for breast cancer patients' survival in Kurdistan Province of Iran.	CONTEXT: Breast cancer is the most common cancer and the second common cause of cancer-induced mortalities in Iranian women. There has been a rapid development in hazard models and survival analysis in the last decade. AIMS: The aim of this study was to evaluate the prognostic factors of overall survival (OS) in breast cancer patients using accelerated failure time models (AFT). SETTING AND DESIGN: This was a retrospective-analytic cohort study. SUBJECTS AND MATERIALS: About 313 women with a pathologically proven diagnosis of breast cancer who had been treated during a 7-year period (since January 2006 until March 2014) in Sanandaj City, Kurdistan Province of Iran were recruited. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: Performance among AFT was assessed using the goodness of fit methods. Discrimination among the exponential, Weibull, generalized gamma, log-logistic, and log-normal distributions was done using Akaik information criteria and maximum likelihood. RESULTS: The 5 years OS was 75% (95% CI = 74.57-75.43). The main results in terms of survival were found for the different categories of the clinical stage covariate, tumor metastasis, and relapse of cancer. Survival time in breast cancer patients without tumor metastasis and relapse were 4, 2-fold longer than other patients with metastasis and relapse, respectively. CONCLUSION: One of the most important undermining prognostic factors in breast cancer is metastasis; hence, knowledge of the mechanisms of metastasis is necessary to prevent it so occurrence and treatment of metastatic breast cancer and ultimately extend the lifetime of patients.
28054359	Towards a personalized surgical margin for breast conserving surgery-Implications of field cancerization in local recurrence.	The amount of normal tissue that should be excised during breast conserving surgery is widely debated. Tissue adjacent to breast tumors, although histologically normal, possesses many of the molecular abnormalities found in tumor tissues. Here, we propose that the ideal physical distance for a surgical margin may not be universal. Rather, an adequate surgical margin likely varies from patient to patient, depending on the biology of the tissue that remains after surgery. J. Surg. Oncol. 2017;115:109-115.

28054348	The effect of surgery type on survival and recurrence in very young women with breast cancer.	BACKGROUND: The impact of surgical treatment on outcomes in breast cacner in very young women remains unclear. We sought to determine the effect of surgery type on risk of recurrence and survival in a population-based cohort. METHODS: All women diagnosed with breast cancer aged </=35 (1994-2003) were identified from the Ontario Cancer Registry. Patient, tumor, and treatment variables, including primary surgery, recurrences, and death were abstracted from chart review. Cox regression models were fit to determine the effect of surgery type on recurrence and overall survival. RESULTS: We identified 1,381 patients with 11-year median follow-up of which 793 (57%) had BCS. Of the remaining mastectomy patients, 52% had postmastectomy radiation. Overall, 41% of patients sustained a recurrence of any type and 31% died. Controlling for known confounders, there was no association between type of surgery and death from any cause (HR = 0.98, 95% CI = 0.78, 1.25) or first recurrence (HR = 0.93, 95% CI = 0.75, 1.14). Distant recurrence was most common (13% in BCS; 25.3% in mastectomy) with local recurrence 12.4% after BCS and 7.5% after mastectomy. CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort of very young women who were selected for treatment with BCS and mastectomy, we found similar oncologic outcomes. J. Surg. Oncol. 2017;115:122-130.

28054302	microRNA-761 induces aggressive phenotypes in triple-negative breast cancer cells by repressing TRIM29 expression.	PURPOSE: Despite advances that have been made in systemic chemotherapy, the prognosis of advanced triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients is still poor. The identification of key factors governing TNBC development is considered imperative for the development of novel effective therapeutic approaches. Previously, it has been reported that microRNA (miR)-761 may act as either a tumor suppressor or as an oncogene in different types of cancer. Here, we aimed at assessing the biological role of this miRNA in TNBC. METHODS: First, we measured the expression of miR-761 in primary breast cancer tissues and breast cancer-derived cell lines using qRT-PCR. Subsequently, over-expression and silencing experiments were performed to determine the role of miR-761 in TNBC cell proliferation, colony formation, migration and invasion in vitro. The in vivo role of miR-761 in TNBC growth and metastasis was determined in mouse models. Bioinformatics analyses, dual-luciferase reporter assays, Western blot analyses and rescue experiments were performed to identify miR-761 target gene(s). RESULTS: We found that miR-761 was up-regulated in primary breast cancer tissues and its derived cell lines and, particularly, in TNBC tissues and cell lines. We also found that exogenous miR-761 over-expression augmented in vitro TNBC cell proliferation, colony formation, migration and invasion, whereas miR-761 down-regulation impaired these features. In vivo, we found that miR-761 over-expression facilitated TNBC growth and lung metastasis. Mechanistically, miR-761 was found to negatively regulate the expression of tripartite motif-containing 29 (TRIM29) in TNBC cells by binding to the 3'-untranslated region of its mRNA. In conformity with these results, a significant negative correlation between miR-761 expression and TRIM29 protein expression was noted in primary TNBC tissues (r = -0.452, p = 0.0126). We also found that exogenous TRIM29 over-expression reversed the proliferative and invasive capacities of TNBC cells. CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that miR-761 acts as an oncogene in TNBC. This mode of action can, at least partially, be ascribed to the down-regulation of its target TRIM29. We suggest that miR-761 may serve as a promising therapeutic target for TNBC.
28053982	A Comparative Approach of Tumor-Associated Inflammation in Mammary Cancer between Humans and Dogs.	Infiltrating cells of the immune system are widely accepted to be generic constituents of tumor microenvironment. It has been well established that the development of mammary cancer, both in humans and in dogs, is associated with alterations in numbers and functions of immune cells at the sites of tumor progression. These tumor infiltrating immune cells seem to exhibit exclusive phenotypic and functional characteristics and mammary cancer cells can take advantage of signaling molecules released by them. Cancer related inflammation has an important role in mammary carcinogenesis, contributing to the acquisition of core hallmark capabilities that allow cancer cells to survive, proliferate, and disseminate. Indeed, recent studies in human breast cancer and in canine mammary tumors have identified a growing list of signaling molecules released by inflammatory cells that serve as effectors of their tumor-promoting actions. These include the COX-2, the tumor EGF, the angiogenic VEGF, other proangiogenic factors, and a large variety of chemokines and cytokines that amplify the inflammatory state. This review describes the intertwined signaling pathways shared by T-lymphocytic/macrophage infiltrates and important tissue biomarkers in both human and dog mammary carcinogenesis.
28053523	Anti-MUC1 nano-aptamers for triple-negative breast cancer imaging by single-photon emission computed tomography in inducted animals: initial considerations.	The early and specific detection of tumors remains a barrier in oncology, especially in cases such as the triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). To address this gap, aptamers have found an important application in the recognition of tumor biomarkers such as mucin 1 (MUC1). However, there are still some difficulties in the use of aptamer, as their rapid biological clearance makes their use as drugs limited. In this study, the anti-MUC1 aptamer was used as a drug delivery system (DDS) for a radioactive polymeric nanoparticle (NP) in the imaging of TNBCs. Thus, poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) NPs loaded with the anti-MUC1 aptamer and labeled with technetium-99m were used for a biodistribution study and imaging of TNBC. The results confirmed that the NP was successfully obtained, with a mean size of 262 nm, according to the dynamic light scattering data. The biodistribution assay in induced animal models with TNBC showed that although there was a high capture by intestine (>30%), the DDS developed had a high tumor uptake (5%) and with great in vivo imaging properties, corroborating the possibility of use of this DDS as an imaging drug for TNBC.
28052399	Molecular trail for the anticancer behavior of a novel copper carbohydrazone complex in BRCA1 mutated breast cancer.	Novel chelated metal complexes were synthesized from carbohydrazones to thiocarbohydrazones using metal-based drug designing platforms and their combination effect with Pb, a naphthaquinone were analyzed for anticancer activity in breast cancer cell lines. A panel of BRCA1 wild-type and mutated breast cancer cells: MCF-7 (BRCA1+ /ER+ ), MDA-MB-231 (BRCA1+ /ERalpha- ), HCC-1937 (BRCA1- /ERalpha- ), HCC1937/wt BRCA1, MX1 (BRCA1- /ERalpha- ), and MDA-MB-436 (BRCA1- /ERalpha- ) were screened for anti-cancer activity. Cu2 (HL)(HSO4 ) . H2 O]SO4 . 6 H2 O (CS2) is the most potent anticancer agent among the copper carbohydrazone and thiocarbohydrazone complexes analyzed in this study. It can be suggested that the presence of sulphate, as pharmacologically active centre, can induce cytotoxicity more effectively when compared to chlorine, bromine, perchlorate, and methanol. This is the first report demonstrating that CS2 can bind to DNA by hindering BamH1 activity and could induce DNA double strand breaks as evidenced by gamma-H2AX expression. In addition to this, CS2 could also act as a Topo II inhibitor at a much lower concentration than etoposide and induce apoptosis, making it a potent anticancer agent. In combination with Pb, a potent ROS inducer, CS2 could induce synergistic anti-cancer activity in HR/ BRCA1 defective breast cancer cells. This is the first study reporting the mechanism involved in the induction of apoptosis for a metal chelated copper carbohydrazone complex and its combination effects with Pb in HR defective, BRCA1 mutated breast cancer cells.
28052186	Axillary treatment for operable primary breast cancer.	BACKGROUND: Axillary surgery is an established part of the management of primary breast cancer. It provides staging information to guide adjuvant therapy and potentially local control of axillary disease. Several alternative approaches to axillary surgery are available, most of which aim to spare a proportion of women the morbidity of complete axillary dissection. OBJECTIVES: To assess the benefits and harms of alternative approaches to axillary surgery (including omitting such surgery altogether) in terms of overall survival; local, regional and distant recurrences; and adverse events. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Breast Cancer Group Specialised Register, MEDLINE, Pre-MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL, the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov on 12 March 2015 without language restrictions. We also contacted study authors and checked reference lists. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) including women with clinically defined operable primary breast cancer conducted to compare axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) with no axillary surgery, axillary sampling or sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB); RCTs comparing axillary sampling with SLNB or no axillary surgery; RCTs comparing SLNB with no axillary surgery; and RCTs comparing ALND with or without radiotherapy (RT) versus RT alone. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently assessed each potentially relevant trial for inclusion. We independently extracted outcome data, risk of bias information and study characteristics from all included trials. We pooled data according to trial interventions, and we used hazard ratios (HRs) for time-to-event outcomes and odds ratios (OR) for binary outcomes. MAIN RESULTS: We included 26 RCTs in this review. Studies were at low or unclear risk of selection bias. Blinding was not done, but this was only considered a source of bias for outcomes with potential for subjectivity in measurements. We found no RCTs of axillary sampling versus SLNB, axillary sampling versus no axillary surgery or SLNB versus no axillary surgery. No axillary surgery versus ALND Ten trials involving 3849 participants compared no axillary surgery versus ALND. Moderate quality evidence showed no important differences between overall survival of women in the two groups (HR 1.06, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.96 to 1.17; 3849 participants; 10 studies) although no axillary surgery increased the risk of locoregional recurrence (HR ranging from 1.10 to 3.06; 20,863 person-years of follow-up; four studies). It was uncertain whether no surgery increased the risk of distant metastasis compared with ALND (HR 1.06, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.30; 946 participants; two studies). Low-quality evidence indicated no axillary surgery decreased the risk of lymphoedema compared with ALND (OR 0.31, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.43; 1714 participants; four studies). Axillary sampling versus ALND Six trials involving 1559 participants compared axillary sampling versus ALND. Low-quality evidence indicated similar effectiveness of axillary sampling compared with ALND in terms of overall survival (HR 0.94, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.21; 967 participants; three studies) but it was unclear whether axillary sampling led to increased risk of local recurrence compared with ALND (HR 1.41, 95% CI 0.94 to 2.12; 1404 participants; three studies). The relative effectiveness of axillary sampling and ALND for locoregional recurrence (HR 0.74, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.20; 406 participants; one study) and distant metastasis was uncertain (HR 1.05, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.49; 406 participants; one study). Lymphoedema was less likely after axillary sampling than after ALND (OR 0.32, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.81; 80 participants; one study). SLNB versus ALND Seven trials involving 9426 participants compared SLNB with ALND. Moderate-quality evidence showed similar overall survival following SLNB compared with ALND (HR 1.05, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.25; 6352 participants; three studies; moderate-quality evidence). Differences in local recurrence (HR 0.94, 95% CI 0.24 to 3.77; 516 participants; one study), locoregional recurrence (HR 0.96, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.24; 5611 participants; one study) and distant metastasis (HR 0.80, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.53; 516 participants; one study) were uncertain. However, studies showed little absolute difference in the aforementioned outcomes. Lymphoedema was less likely after SLNB than ALND (OR ranged from 0.04 to 0.60; three studies; 1965 participants; low-quality evidence). Three studies including 1755 participants reported quality of life: Investigators in two studies found quality of life better after SLNB than ALND, and in the other study observed no difference. RT versus ALND Four trials involving 2585 participants compared RT alone with ALND (with or without RT). High-quality evidence indicated that overall survival was reduced among women treated with radiotherapy alone compared with those treated with ALND (HR 1.10, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.21; 2469 participants; four studies), and local recurrence was less likely in women treated with radiotherapy than in those treated with ALND (HR 0.80, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.99; 22,256 person-years of follow-up; four studies). Risk of distant metastasis was similar for radiotherapy alone as for ALND (HR 1.07, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.25; 1313 participants; one study), and whether lymphoedema was less likely after RT alone than ALND remained uncertain (OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.16 to 1.44; 200 participants; one study). Less surgery versus ALND When combining results from all trials, treatment involving less surgery was associated with reduced overall survival compared with ALND (HR 1.08, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.17; 6478 participants; 18 studies). Whether local recurrence was reduced with less axillary surgery when compared with ALND was uncertain (HR 0.90, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.09; 24,176 participant-years of follow up; eight studies). Locoregional recurrence was more likely with less surgery than with ALND (HR 1.53, 95% CI 1.31 to 1.78; 26,880 participant-years of follow-up; seven studies). Whether risk of distant metastasis was increased after less axillary surgery compared with ALND was uncertain (HR 1.07, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.20; 2665 participants; five studies). Lymphoedema was less likely after less axillary surgery than with ALND (OR 0.37, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.46; 3964 participants; nine studies).No studies reported on disease control in the axilla. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: This review confirms the benefit of SLNB and axillary sampling as alternatives to ALND for axillary staging, supporting the view that ALND of the clinically and radiologically uninvolved axilla is no longer acceptable practice in people with breast cancer.
28051275	Ratio of proliferation markers and HSP90 gene expression as a predictor of pathological complete response in breast cancer neoadjuvant chemotherapy.	INTRODUCTION: Prediction of response to preoperative breast cancer chemotherapy may offer a substantial optimization of medical management of this disease. The most efficient prediction would be done a priori, before the start of chemotherapy and based on the biological features of patient and tumor. Numerous markers have been proposed but none of them has been applied as a routine. The role of MKI67 and HSP90 expression has been recently suggested to predict treatment sensitivity in HER2-positive breast cancer. The aim of this study was to validate the utility of proliferation based markers (MKI67 and CDK1) and heat shock proteins (namely HSP90) to predict response to chemotherapy in cohort of breast cancer patients treated preoperatively. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Ninety-three patients with breast cancer, all females, mean age 42.2 years, among them 32% T1-T2 patients, 49% T3 patients and 13% with T4 tumor stage, 27% N0, 42% N1, 16% N2, 15% N3 were subjected to initial chemotherapy. The majority of patients (86%) received anthracycline and taxane chemotherapy. Among the patients there were 9 individuals with metastatic disease (M1) at initial presentation, and 11 patients were not treated surgically after initial chemotherapy (no sufficient disease response). From 82 patients operated on, 20 patients (24%) showed pathological complete response (pCR), while in 62 patients there was no pCR. 42% of patients were hormone-sensitive HER2-negative, 20% hormone-sensitive HER2-positive, 9% only HER-positive and 29% with triple negative breast cancer. Four gene transcripts (MKI67, cyclin-dependent kinase 1 [CDK1], heat shock proteins HSP90AA1 and HSP- 90AB1) were analyzed in total RNA isolated from single core obtained during preoperative core needle biopsy by quantitative real-time PCR with fluorescent probes (Universal Probe Library, Roche). Results were normalized to the panel of reference genes. RESULTS: There were no statistically significant differences in MKI67 and CDK1 expression between pCR and no pCR groups (p = 0.099 and 0.35, respectively), although the median expression of both genes was slightly higher in pCR group. In contrast, both HSP90AA1 and HSP90AB1 transcripts showed decreased expression in pCR group (medians 0.77 and 0.55) when compared to no p CR group (median 0.86 and 0.73), statistically significant for HSP90AA1 (p = 0.031) and of borderline significance for HSP90AB1 (p = 0.054). The most significant predictor of pCR was the ratio of CDK1 transcript to HSP90AA transcript. This ratio was significantly higher in CR group (median 0.99) than in no CR group (median 0.68, p = 0.0023), and showed a potential diagnostic utility (area under receiver operating characteristic [ROC] curve 0.72). CONCLUSIONS: HSP90AA1 and AB1 genes exhibit low expression in breast cancers highly sensitive to chemotherapy and may indicate the patients with higher probability of pathological complete response. The ratio of HSP90AA1 to proliferation-related markers (CDK1 or MKI67) may be even better predictor of pCR chance, with higher expression of proliferation genes and lower stress response in patients sensitive to chemotherapy.
28051026	Blood Oxygenation Level-dependent Magnetic Resonance Imaging of Breast Cancer: Correlation with Carbonic Anhydrase IX and Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor.	BACKGROUND: Blood oxygenation level-dependent magnetic resonance imaging (BOLD-MRI) is a functional MRI technique which involves using the paramagnetic properties of deoxyhemoglobin to image the local tissue oxygen concentration. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether BOLD-MRI could evaluate hypoxia and angiogenesis of breast invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC). METHODS: Ninety-eight female patients with IDC were retrospectively included in this research. All patients underwent breast BOLD-MRI at 3.0 T before surgery. R2* values of BOLD-MRI were measured. The expression of carbonic anhydrase IX (CA IX) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was analyzed by immunohistochemistry. Spearman's correlation analysis was used to correlate R2* value with CA IX and VEGF levels. RESULTS: Heterogeneous intensity on BOLD-MRI images was the main finding of IDCs. The mean R2* value was 52.8 +/- 18.6 Hz. The R2* values in patients with axillary lymph node metastasis were significantly higher than the R2* values in patients without axillary lymph node metastasis (t = 2.882, P= 0.005). R2* values increased with CA IX level and positively correlated with the level of CA IX (r = 0.616, P< 0.001); however, R2* value had no significantly correlation with the level of VEGF (r = 0.110, P= 0.281). CONCLUSION: BOLD-MRI could noninvasively evaluate chronic hypoxia of IDC, but not angiogenesis.
28049953	Cobalt Chloride Induces Expression and Function of Breast Cancer Resistance Protein (BCRP/ABCG2) in Human Renal Proximal Tubular Epithelial Cell Line HK-2.	The human breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP/ABCG2), a member of the ATP-binding cassette transporter family, is a drug transporter restricting absorption and enhancing excretion of many compounds including anticancer drugs. The cis-regulatory elements in the BCRP promoter include a hypoxia response element, i.e., the DNA binding site for hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1). In this study, we investigated the effect of cobalt chloride, a chemical inducer of HIF-1alpha, on the expression and function of BCRP in human renal proximal tubular cell line HK-2. Cobalt chloride treatment significantly increased the mRNA expression of not only glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1), a typical HIF-1 target gene mRNA, but also ABCG2 mRNA in HK-2 cells. The BCRP inhibitor Ko143-sensitive accumulation of BCRP substrates such as Hoechst33342 and mitoxantrone was significantly enhanced by cobalt chloride treatment. In addition, treatment with cobalt chloride significantly increased the Ko143-sensitive accumulation of fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled methotrexate in HK-2 cells. Furthermore, cobalt chloride treatment attenuated the cytotoxicity induced by mitoxantrone and methotrexate, which might be, at least in part, due to the increase in BCRP-mediated transport activity via HIF-1 activation. These findings indicate that HIF-1 activation protects renal proximal tubular cells against BCRP substrate-induced cytotoxicity by enhancing the expression and function of BCRP in renal proximal tubular cells.
28049579	Tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes and the emerging role of immunotherapy in breast cancer.	Breast cancer has not previously been considered a highly immunogenic cancer. Observations of tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in and around neoplastic cells in tumour samples, and associations with improved pathological complete response and clinical survival end points have changed our perspective on this. Lymphocytic infiltrates have long been observed in breast cancer; however, more recently, retrospective analysis of prospectively collected tissue samples from clinical trials has demonstrated the potential role of host immunosurveillance in influencing the biology of breast cancer. This association appears to be strongest in triple negative and HER2 positive breast cancer subtypes. Contrastingly, the association in luminal tumours is less clear, and is potentially limited by substantial tumoural heterogeneity. Several methodologies have been employed to quantify, and describe the composition of TILs, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. The results of these analyses have been generally consistent, and valuable efforts are currently underway to standardise the evaluation of TILs toward a universal approach. More technical methods of TIL characterisation remain important in the research setting. The evaluation of TILs becomes increasingly relevant with the emerging role of immunotherapy in breast cancer. Early phase trials of checkpoint blockade show promising results; however, it is likely that some patients will require combination treatments to maximise therapeutic benefits. Equally, some patients may not derive any benefit from immunotherapies. This underscores the importance of the development of relevant predictive biomarkers. As a key representative of the immune interaction between host and tumour, lymphocytic infiltrates are ideally placed for continued research into the determinants of immunogenicity, and response to immunotherapeutic approaches. In this review, we will discuss the current methodologies of evaluation, and the clinical relevance of TILs. Additionally, we discuss the emerging role of immunotherapy in breast cancer, and the future of TIL characterisation in this context.
28049578	Vascular tumours of the breast: a comprehensive review with focus on diagnostic challenges encountered in the core biopsy setting.	Vascular proliferations of the breast comprise a spectrum of benign and malignant lesions. In limited samples, such as core needle biopsies (CNB), these lesions may be difficult to distinguish due to significant overlap in morphological features. As the treatment and prognosis of these entities vary widely, it is important for pathologists to consider a complete differential diagnosis and correctly synthesise histological features, results of adjunctive immunohistochemical studies, and pertinent clinical and imaging information, to render an accurate diagnosis in such limited samples. The diagnostic pitfalls of under- or overdiagnosis of vascular lesions sampled in CNB will also be discussed.
28049561	Achieving clear margins. Directed shaving using MarginProbe, as compared to a full cavity shave approach.	BACKGROUND: Following lumpectomy, full cavity shaving approach is used to reduce positive margin rates, among other issues previously studied by others, at an expense of increase in tissue volume removed. We present our experience after switching from full cavity shaving to a targeted shaving approach using MarginProbe, an intra-operative margin assessment device. METHODS: Specimen excision was performed according to standard of care. Additional shavings were taken based on device readings on the lumpectomy specimen. Intra-operative imaging was used, as required. RESULTS: We compared 137 MarginProbe cases to 199 full cavity shave cases. The re-excision rate was reduced by 57% (P = 0.026), from 15.1% to 6.6%. The overall tissue volume removed was reduced by 32% (P = 0.0023), from 115 cc to 78 cc. CONCLUSIONS: MarginProbe enabled a change in the lumpectomy technique from full cavity shavings to directed shavings guided by the device. There was a significant reduction in re-excisions and in the overall tissue volume removed.The lower amount of shavings also contributed to a reduction in pathology work.
28049253	Prostate Cancer in a Patient with a Family History of BRCA Mutation: a Case Report and Literature Review.	One of the most significant risk factors for prostate cancer (PC) is a family history of the disease, with germ-line mutations in the breast cancer predisposition gene (BRCA) 2 conferring the highest risk. We here report a 56-year-old man presented with painful gait disturbance and diagnosed PC with multiple disseminated bone metastases. The patient had a strong family history of breast cancer with his 2 nieces affected. Furthermore, his aunts and uncles from both sides were diagnosed with stomach, ovarian, and colorectal cancers. His genomic sequencing analysis of the BRCA genes revealed the same BRCA2 deleterious mutation that his breast cancer-affected nieces carried. Previous studies have suggested that BRCA2-mutated PC is associated with a more aggressive phenotype and poor prognosis. Our experience in the present case also indicated the urgent needs for novel treatment modality and PC screening in this high-risk group of patients.
28049092	Antiproliferative activity of Alisol B in MDA-MB-231 cells is mediated by apoptosis, dysregulation of mitochondrial functions, cell cycle arrest and generation of reactive oxygen species.	Previous studies have demonstrated that Alisol B has inhibitory activity in cancer cells. However, the exact mechanism through which inhibition is achieved is still poorly understood. In the present study, the authors examined the effects of Alisol B in human breast cancer cells. Alisol B showed significant anticancer activity in MDA-MB-231 cells. The results demonstrated that the cytotoxicity induced by Alisol B was mediated by induction of apoptosis, decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential, cell cycle arrest, activation of caspases and accumulation of ROS (reactive oxygen species) level. Interestingly, pretreatment of cells with the general caspase inhibitor z-VAD-FMK significantly prevented Alisol B-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, western blot analysis revealed the upregulation of p-p38 and downregulation of p-AKT, p-p65 and p-mTOR. Taken together, the above results suggest that Alisol B suppresses the growth of MDA-MB-231 cells mainly through induction of apoptosis; this outcome may represent the major mechanism of Alisol B-mediated apoptosis.
28045731	18F-FDG PET/CT in the Staging and Management of Breast Cancer: Value in Disease Outcome and Planning Therapy.	In hormone receptor-positive locally advanced breast cancer, endocrine therapy becomes an integral part of the therapeutic strategy. There are now significant numbers of available hormonal directed compounds, including selective aromatase and mTOR inhibitors, which allow an important therapeutic advance in these patients. Sequential F-FDG PET/CT studies provided essential information regarding response to different treatments, including targeted therapies, and adverse therapeutic effects that helped to better define the right moment to implement each therapeutic approach.
28045433	Functions and Epigenetic Regulation of Wwox in Bone Metastasis from Breast Carcinoma: Comparison with Primary Tumors.	Epigenetic mechanisms influence molecular patterns important for the bone-metastatic process, and here we highlight the role of WW-domain containing oxidoreductase (Wwox). The tumor-suppressor Wwox lacks in almost all cancer types; the variable expression in osteosarcomas is related to lung-metastasis formation, and exogenous Wwox destabilizes HIF-1alpha (subunit of Hypoxia inducible Factor-1, HIF-1) affecting aerobic glycolysis. Our recent studies show critical functions of Wwox present in 1833-osteotropic clone, in the corresponding xenograft model, and in human bone metastasis from breast carcinoma. In hypoxic-bone metastatic cells, Wwox enhances HIF-1alpha stabilization, phosphorylation, and nuclear translocation. Consistently, in bone-metastasis specimens Wwox localizes in cytosolic/perinuclear area, while TAZ (transcriptional co-activator with PDZ-binding motif) and HIF-1alpha co-localize in nuclei, playing specific regulatory mechanisms: TAZ is a co-factor of HIF-1, and Wwox regulates HIF-1 activity by controlling HIF-1alpha. In vitro, DNA methylation affects Wwox-protein synthesis; hypoxia decreases Wwox-protein level; hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) phosphorylates Wwox driving its nuclear shuttle, and counteracting a Twist program important for the epithelial phenotype and metastasis colonization. In agreement, in 1833-xenograft mice under DNA-methyltransferase blockade with decitabine, Wwox increases in nuclei/cytosol counteracting bone metastasis with prolongation of the survival. However, Wwox seems relevant for the autophagic process which sustains metastasis, enhancing more Beclin-1 than p62 protein levels, and p62 accumulates under decitabine consistent with adaptability of metastasis to therapy. In conclusion, Wwox methylation as a bone-metastasis therapeutic target would depend on autophagy conditions, and epigenetic mechanisms regulating Wwox may influence the phenotype of bone metastasis.
28045199	Yoga for improving health-related quality of life, mental health and cancer-related symptoms in women diagnosed with breast cancer.	BACKGROUND: Breast cancer is the cancer most frequently diagnosed in women worldwide. Even though survival rates are continually increasing, breast cancer is often associated with long-term psychological distress, chronic pain, fatigue and impaired quality of life. Yoga comprises advice for an ethical lifestyle, spiritual practice, physical activity, breathing exercises and meditation. It is a complementary therapy that is commonly recommended for breast cancer-related impairments and has been shown to improve physical and mental health in people with different cancer types. OBJECTIVES: To assess effects of yoga on health-related quality of life, mental health and cancer-related symptoms among women with a diagnosis of breast cancer who are receiving active treatment or have completed treatment. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Breast Cancer Specialised Register, MEDLINE (via PubMed), Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2016, Issue 1), Indexing of Indian Medical Journals (IndMED), the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) search portal and Clinicaltrials.gov on 29 January 2016. We also searched reference lists of identified relevant trials or reviews, as well as conference proceedings of the International Congress on Complementary Medicine Research (ICCMR), the European Congress for Integrative Medicine (ECIM) and the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO). We applied no language restrictions. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials were eligible when they (1) compared yoga interventions versus no therapy or versus any other active therapy in women with a diagnosis of non-metastatic or metastatic breast cancer, and (2) assessed at least one of the primary outcomes on patient-reported instruments, including health-related quality of life, depression, anxiety, fatigue or sleep disturbances. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently collected data on methods and results. We expressed outcomes as standardised mean differences (SMDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and conducted random-effects model meta-analyses. We assessed potential risk of publication bias through visual analysis of funnel plot symmetry and heterogeneity between studies by using the Chi2 test and the I2 statistic. We conducted subgroup analyses for current treatment status, time since diagnosis, stage of cancer and type of yoga intervention. MAIN RESULTS: We included 24 studies with a total of 2166 participants, 23 of which provided data for meta-analysis. Thirteen studies had low risk of selection bias, five studies reported adequate blinding of outcome assessment and 15 studies had low risk of attrition bias.Seventeen studies that compared yoga versus no therapy provided moderate-quality evidence showing that yoga improved health-related quality of life (pooled SMD 0.22, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.40; 10 studies, 675 participants), reduced fatigue (pooled SMD -0.48, 95% CI -0.75 to -0.20; 11 studies, 883 participants) and reduced sleep disturbances in the short term (pooled SMD -0.25, 95% CI -0.40 to -0.09; six studies, 657 participants). The funnel plot for health-related quality of life was asymmetrical, favouring no therapy, and the funnel plot for fatigue was roughly symmetrical. This hints at overall low risk of publication bias. Yoga did not appear to reduce depression (pooled SMD -0.13, 95% CI -0.31 to 0.05; seven studies, 496 participants; low-quality evidence) or anxiety (pooled SMD -0.53, 95% CI -1.10 to 0.04; six studies, 346 participants; very low-quality evidence) in the short term and had no medium-term effects on health-related quality of life (pooled SMD 0.10, 95% CI -0.23 to 0.42; two studies, 146 participants; low-quality evidence) or fatigue (pooled SMD -0.04, 95% CI -0.36 to 0.29; two studies, 146 participants; low-quality evidence). Investigators reported no serious adverse events.Four studies that compared yoga versus psychosocial/educational interventions provided moderate-quality evidence indicating that yoga can reduce depression (pooled SMD -2.29, 95% CI -3.97 to -0.61; four studies, 226 participants), anxiety (pooled SMD -2.21, 95% CI -3.90 to -0.52; three studies, 195 participants) and fatigue (pooled SMD -0.90, 95% CI -1.31 to -0.50; two studies, 106 participants) in the short term. Very low-quality evidence showed no short-term effects on health-related quality of life (pooled SMD 0.81, 95% CI -0.50 to 2.12; two studies, 153 participants) or sleep disturbances (pooled SMD -0.21, 95% CI -0.76 to 0.34; two studies, 119 participants). No trial adequately reported safety-related data.Three studies that compared yoga versus exercise presented very low-quality evidence showing no short-term effects on health-related quality of life (pooled SMD -0.04, 95% CI -0.30 to 0.23; three studies, 233 participants) or fatigue (pooled SMD -0.21, 95% CI -0.66 to 0.25; three studies, 233 participants); no trial provided safety-related data. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Moderate-quality evidence supports the recommendation of yoga as a supportive intervention for improving health-related quality of life and reducing fatigue and sleep disturbances when compared with no therapy, as well as for reducing depression, anxiety and fatigue, when compared with psychosocial/educational interventions. Very low-quality evidence suggests that yoga might be as effective as other exercise interventions and might be used as an alternative to other exercise programmes.
28044346	Technical Note: Issues related to external marker block placement for deep inspiration breath hold breast radiotherapy.	PURPOSE: It has been suggested that the Real-time Position Management (RPM) marker block should be placed directly on the breast or sternum to verify deep inspiration breath hold (DIBH) level for breast radiotherapy. We explore three potential issues with this practice: (a) surface dose effect of placing the marker block in the primary beam; (b) effect of marker block tilt on the accuracy of the RPM system; and (c) correlation between marker block positions on the patient surface and internal chest wall position. METHODS: (a) The surface dose under the two-, four-, and six-dot marker blocks was measured at incident angles of 0 degrees and 30 degrees ; (b) the motion amplitude detected when using the two- and six-dot marker blocks was recorded for block tilts from 0 degrees to 60 degrees about the RPM camera line of sight; (c) the correlation between median displacement of the chest wall and median displacement of the surface contour between breath holds was investigated for superior, middle, and inferior block positions using contours extracted from portal images of eight left-sided breast cancer patients. RESULTS: (a) The marker blocks increased the surface dose for a 6 MV direct field by 48.2-52.2% of Dmax ; (b) at lateral tilts greater than 10 degrees , the two-dot marker block overestimated the motion amplitude; however, the six-dot marker block amplitude remained accurate up to 60 degrees ; (c) the whole, superior, and middle surface positions were strongly correlated with chest wall displacement (R2 = 0.83; R2 = 0.90; R2 = 0.83), whereas the inferior position was moderately correlated (R2 = 0.36). CONCLUSIONS: The RPM marker block can be placed on the breast for DIBH treatments; however, caution should be used regarding surface dose effects. The two-dot marker block should not be used for block tilts beyond 20 degrees . Marker block placement at a middle or superior position on the breast results in the strongest correlation with chest wall position.
28044054	Pituitary Metastasis from Renal Cell Carcinoma: Description of a Case Report.	BACKGROUND Pituitary metastasis is uncommon, breast and lung cancers being the most frequent primary tumors. Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is a rare cause of pituitary metastases, with only a few cases described to date. CASE REPORT We report a case of a 61-year-old man who presented with a progressive deterioration of visual acuity and field associated with a bitemporal hemianopsia. Two years ago, he underwent radical right nephrectomy for a clear cell RCC (ccRCC). The biological tests showed pan-hypopituitarism and diabetes insipidus. Brain MRI revealed a large sellar tumor lesion bilaterally infiltrating the cavernous sinuses, which was surgically resected. Histology confirmed a ccRCC pituitary metastasis. The patient received post-surgical radiotherapy. Considering the presence of concomitant extra-pituitary metastases, treatment with sunitinib was started, followed by several lines of therapy with axitinib, everolimus, and sorafenib because of tumor progression. The patient also presented with a pituitary tumor recurrence, which was treated by stereotaxic radiotherapy. He died five years after the initial diagnosis of RCC and 30 months after the diagnosis of the pituitary metastasis. CONCLUSIONS There are no standardized treatment guidelines for management of pituitary metastases. Pituitary surgery plays a role in symptom palliation, and it does not have any relevant impact on survival. Exclusive radiotherapy or stereotaxic radiotherapy could be an alternative to surgery in patients whose general condition is poor or who have concomitant extra-pituitary metastases.
28043647	The morphological spectrum of salivary gland type tumours of the breast.	Salivary gland like tumours of the breast constitute a wide spectrum of entities each one showing peculiar features and clinical behaviour. They can be subdivided as follows: (1) tumours showing pure myoepithelial cell differentiation, such as pure benign and malignant myoepitheliomas; (2) tumours with mixed epithelial and myoepithelial cell differentiation, such as pleomorphic adenoma, adenomyoepithelioma and adenoid cystic carcinoma; and (3) tumours with pure epithelial cell differentiation, such as acinic cell carcinoma, oncocytic carcinoma, mucoepidermoid carcinoma and polymorphous adenocarcinoma. These tumours share similar features with the salivary gland counterparts, but different clinical behaviour. Most salivary gland type tumours of the breast are negative for oestrogen and progesterone receptor and lack HER2 gene amplification, therefore they are classified as 'triple negative' tumours. Nevertheless, some of the malignant entities (such as classical adenoid cystic carcinoma) exhibit good behaviour and do not need any treatment in addition to local control. The aim of the present paper is to review the morphological and prognostic features of salivary gland like tumours of the breast, in order to highlight the correct clinical management.
28043088	Fulvestrant for hormone-sensitive metastatic breast cancer.	BACKGROUND: Fulvestrant is a selective oestrogen receptor down-regulator (SERD), which by blocking proliferation of breast cancer cells, is an effective endocrine treatment for women with hormone-sensitive advanced breast cancer. The goal of such systemic therapy in this setting is to reduce symptoms, improve quality of life, and increase survival time. OBJECTIVES: To assess the efficacy and safety of fulvestrant for hormone-sensitive locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer in postmenopausal women, as compared to other standard endocrine agents. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Breast Cancer Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP), and ClinicalTrials.gov on 7 July 2015. We also searched major conference proceedings (American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) and San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium) and practice guidelines from major oncology groups (ASCO, European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO), National Comprehensive Cancer Network, and Cancer Care Ontario). We handsearched reference lists from relevant studies. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included for analyses randomised controlled trials that enrolled postmenopausal women with hormone-sensitive advanced breast cancer (TNM classifications: stages IIIA, IIIB, and IIIC) or metastatic breast cancer (TNM classification: stage IV) with an intervention group treated with fulvestrant with or without other standard anticancer therapy. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently extracted data from trials identified in the searches, conducted 'Risk of bias' assessments of the included studies, and assessed the overall quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach. Outcome data extracted from these trials for our analyses and review included progression-free survival (PFS) or time to progression (TTP) or time to treatment failure, overall survival, clinical benefit rate, toxicity, and quality of life. We used the fixed-effect model for meta-analysis where possible. MAIN RESULTS: We included nine studies randomising 4514 women for meta-analysis and review. Overall results for the primary endpoint of PFS indicated that women receiving fulvestrant did at least as well as the control groups (hazard ratio (HR) 0.95, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.89 to 1.02; P = 0.18, I2= 56%, 4258 women, 9 studies, high-quality evidence). In the one high-quality study that tested fulvestrant at the currently approved and now standard dose of 500 mg against anastrozole, women treated with fulvestrant 500 mg did better than anastrozole, with a HR for TTP of 0.66 (95% CI 0.47 to 0.93; 205 women) and a HR for overall survival of 0.70 (95% CI 0.50 to 0.98; 205 women). There was no difference in PFS whether fulvestrant was used in combination with another endocrine therapy or in the first- or second-line setting, when compared to control treatments: for monotherapy HR 0.97 (95% CI 0.90 to 1.04) versus HR 0.87 (95% CI 0.77 to 0.99) for combination therapy when compared to control, and HR 0.93 (95% CI 0.84 to 1.03) in the first-line setting and HR 0.96 (95% CI 0.88 to 1.04) in the second-line setting.Overall, there was no difference between fulvestrant and control treatments in clinical benefit rate (risk ratio (RR) 1.03, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.10; P = 0.29, I2 = 24%, 4105 women, 9 studies, high-quality evidence) or overall survival (HR 0.97, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.09, P = 0.62, I2 = 66%, 2480 women, 5 studies, high-quality evidence). There was no significant difference in vasomotor toxicity (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.18, 3544 women, 8 studies, high-quality evidence), arthralgia (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.09, 3244 women, 7 studies, high-quality evidence), and gynaecological toxicities (RR 1.22, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.57, 2848 women, 6 studies, high-quality evidence). Four studies reported quality of life, none of which reported a difference between the fulvestrant and control arms, though specific data were not presented. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: For postmenopausal women with advanced hormone-sensitive breast cancer, fulvestrant is at least as effective and safe as the comparator endocrine therapies in the included studies. However, fulvestrant may be potentially more effective than current therapies when given at 500 mg, though this higher dosage was used in only one of the nine studies included in the review. We saw no advantage with combination therapy, and fulvestrant was equally as effective as control therapies in both the first- and second-line setting. Our review demonstrates that fulvestrant is a safe and effective systemic therapy and can be considered as a valid option in the sequence of treatments for postmenopausal women with hormone-sensitive advanced breast cancer.
28042842	Novel 2,3-Dihydro-1H-pyrrolo[3,2,1-ij]quinazolin-1-ones: Synthesis and Biological Evaluation.	Herein we describe the synthesis and evaluation of a series of novel 2,3-dihydro-1H-pyrrolo[3,2,1-ij]quinazolin-1-ones for in vitro cytotoxicity against three human cancer cell lines as well as for potential antimalarial activity against the chloroquine-sensitive strain 3D7 of Plasmodium falciparum. The title compounds were prepared via PdCl(2)-mediated endo-dig cyclization of 2-aryl-8-(arylethynyl)-6-bromo-2,3-dihydroquinazolin-4(1H)-ones. The latter were prepared, in turn, via initial Sonogashira cross-coupling of 2-amino-5-bromo-3-iodobenzamide with aryl acetylenes followed by boric acid-mediated cyclocondensation of the intermediate 2-amino-3-(arylethynyl)-5-bromobenzamides with benzaldehyde derivatives. The 2,3-dihydro-1H-pyrrolo[3,2,1-ij]quinazolin-1-ones 4a-k were evaluated for potential in vitro cytotoxicity against the breast (MCF-7), melanoma (B16) and endothelioma (sEnd.2) cell lines. All of the compounds except 4h and 4i were found to be inactive against the three cancer cell lines. Compound 4h substituted with a 4-methoxyphenyl and 4-fluorophenyl groups at the 3- and 5-positions was found to exhibit significant cytotoxicity against the three cancer cell lines. The presence of phenyl and 3-chlorophenyl groups at the 3- and 5-posiitons of the pyrroloquinazolinone 4i, on the other hand, resulted in significant cytotoxicity against vascular tumour endothelial cells (sEnd.2), but reduced activity against the melanoma (B16) and breast cancer (MCF-7) cells except at higher concentrations. The 2,3-dihydro-1H-pyrrolo[3,2,1-ij]quinazolin-1-ones 4a-l were found to be inactive against the chloroquine sensitive 3D7 strain of Plasmodium falciparum.
28042706	Do CDK4/6 inhibitors have potential as targeted therapeutics for squamous cell cancers?	Introduction Dysregulation of cell cycle progression has an established link to neoplasia and cancer progression. Components of the cyclin D-CDK4/6-INK4-Rb pathway are frequently altered in squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) by diverse mechanisms, including viral oncogene-induced degradation, mutation, deletion, and amplification. Activation of the CDK4/6 pathway may predict response to CDK4/6 inhibitors and provide clinical biomarkers. Recently, the CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib showed clinical efficacy in combination with cetuximab in HNSCC patients. Areas covered This review focuses on the current research on the use of CDK4/6 inhibitors, comprising preclinical animal studies through phase II clinical trials across all SCCs. Expert opinion CDK4/6 inhibitors have a proven clinical benefit in breast cancer, but data on SCCs are sparse. Although frequent dysregulation of the cyclin D-CDK4/6-INK4-Rb pathway in SCCs suggests that targeting CDK4/6 may hold promise for improved clinical outcomes, single-agent activity has been modest in preclinical studies and absent in clinical studies. Combinations with immunotherapy or inhibitors of the PI3 K/mTOR or EGFR pathway may be effective. Given that SCCs caused by human papillomavirus have high levels of p16 and low levels of Rb, the CDK4/6 inhibitors are predicted to be ineffective in these cancers.
28041972	Breast cancer biomarkers before and after neoadjuvant chemotherapy: does repeat testing impact therapeutic management?	In patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC), there is no consensus on retesting biomarkers within the excision specimen. Our aim was to investigate the clinical relevance of biomarker changes post-NAC at a large tertiary medical center. A retrospective search was performed to identify cases from 2012 to 2015 with needle biopsy-confirmed invasive breast carcinoma treated with NAC and subsequent excision containing residual invasive tumor. Biomarkers (estrogen receptor [ER], progesterone receptor [PR], and HER2/neu [HER2]) were performed on all pre-NAC biopsies. One hundred fifty-four NAC-treated cases were identified in which 83 (54%) had repeat testing of at least 1 biomarker on the surgical specimen. Twenty-five (30%) of 83 repeated cases demonstrated changes in pre-NAC biopsy versus post-NAC resection biomarker status. There was no impact of age or grade on biomarker status changes. Tumors that were triple negative at biopsy were more likely to remain triple negative. Clinically relevant changes were identified including the following: (1) ER negative to ER positive, 2 (3%) of 75; (2) PR negative to PR positive with ER negative both pre- and post-NAC, 2 (3%) of 73; and (3) HER2 negative to positive, 1 (1%) of 77. Four of 5 of the changes led to modifications of the adjuvant treatment regimen, including the addition of adjuvant tamoxifen, anastrazole, or trastuzumab. In summary, post-NAC biomarker repeat testing in patients with breast cancer impacts therapeutic management in a small subset of patients and therefore, repeat testing may be considered for patients that are hormone receptor and/or HER2 negative before NAC.
28041942	Pleiotrophin as a potential biomarker in breast cancer patients.	BACKGROUND: Pleiotrophin (PTN), a multifunctional growth factor, is up-regulated in many tumors. PTN is reported to play an important role in the regulation of several cellular processes. The objective of this study is to evaluate the clinical significance of PTN as a tumor marker in breast cancer (BC). METHODS: Serum PTN levels were detected in 105 BC patients and 40 healthy volunteers using ELISA. In addition, PTN expression was examined in 80 BC tissues in a nested case-control study by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Serum PTN levels were elevated in BC patients compared to healthy controls. Area under receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was 0.878 (95% CI: 0.824-0.932). The sensitivity of serum PTN was superior to CEA and CA15-3. High serum PTN levels were associated with TNM stage, histology grade, and distant metastasis. Moreover, serum PTN levels decreased significantly after surgical treatment. In BC tissues, PTN expression was significantly higher in BC tissues relative to paired paracancerous tissues. Tissue PTN expression proved to be a prognostic factor for breast cancer according to multivariable logistic regression analysis. CONCLUSION: PTN could be considered as a potential biomarker for the presence of breast cancer.
28041648	Short term safety of oncoplastic breast conserving surgery for larger tumors.	BACKGROUND: Oncoplastic surgery (OPS) replaces lumpectomy as standard technique in breast conserving surgery (BCS). OPS has shown to give good cosmetic results, but is it as safe as standard lumpectomy? We conducted a retrospective cohort study to determine postoperative complications, resection margins and re-excision rates for OPS compared to standard lumpectomy. METHODS: Based on data from the 'Netherlands Cancer Registry' and medical records we scored patient, treatment and follow-up related variables. All consecutive patients, with an initially breast conserving operation for primary breast cancer, performed between January 2010 and December 2014 in a dedicated breast center were eligible. Breast surgeons performed the operations. Invasive and in situ tumors were included. Postoperative complications within 30 days after surgery and the need for additional treatment were classified using the Clavien Dindo classification. Involved margin rates and subsequent re-excision were compared. RESULTS: We included 828 women with 842 breast cancers, who had a standard lumpectomy (62.7%) or oncoplastic resection (37.3%). OPS was performed more often for larger tumors (17.5 mm vs 13.6 mm, p = 0.002) and for tumors in the caudal half of the breast (33.1% vs 16.9%, p < 0.001). There was no significant difference in postoperative complications. Positive surgical margins were similar (OPS 22.6%, lumpectomy 18.2%, p = 0.119), as were re-excision rates (p = 0.337). CONCLUSION: Oncoplastic breast surgery can be safely applied in larger tumors, resulting in comparable postoperative complications, resection margins and re-excision rates compared to standard lumpectomy.
28040598	Radiolabeled bombesin derivatives for preclinical oncological imaging.	Despite efforts, cancer is still one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide, with approximately 14 million new cases and 8.2 million cancer-related deaths each year, according to the World Health Organization. Among the strategies to reduce cancer progression and improving its management, implementing early detection technologies is crucial. Based on the fact that several types of cancer cells overexpress surface receptors, small molecule ligands, such as peptides, have been developed to allow tumor identification at earlier stages. Allied with imaging techniques such as PET and SPECT, radiolabeled peptides play a pivotal role in nuclear medicine. Bombesin, a peptide of 14 amino acids, is an amphibian homolog to the mammalian gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP), that has been extensively studied as a targeting ligand for diagnosis and therapy of GRP positive tumors, such as breast, pancreas, lungs and prostate cancers. In this context, herein we provide a review of reported bombesin derivatives radiolabeled with a multitude of radioactive isotopes for diagnostic purposes in the preclinical setting. Moreover, since animal models are highly relevant for assessing the potential of clinical translation of this radiopeptides, a brief report of the currently used GRP-positive tumor-bearing animal models is described.
28040452	Delay techniques for nipple-sparing mastectomy: A systematic review.	BACKGROUND: Rare but serious complications of nipple-sparing mastectomy (NSM) include necrosis of the nipple-areolar complex (NAC) and mastectomy skin flaps. NAC and mastectomy flap delay procedures are novel techniques designed to avoid these complications and may be combined with retroareolar biopsy as a first-stage procedure. We performed a systematic review of the literature to evaluate various techniques for NAC and mastectomy flap delay. METHODS: PubMed and Cochrane databases were searched from January 1975 through April 15, 2016. The following search terms were used for both titles and key words: 'nipple sparing mastectomy' AND ('delay' OR 'stage' OR 'staged'). Two independent reviewers determined the study eligibility, only accepting studies involving patients who underwent a delay procedure prior to NSM and studies with objective results including specific outcomes of NAC and mastectomy flap necrosis. RESULTS: The literature search yielded 242 studies, of which five studies met the inclusion criteria, with a total of 101 patients. Various techniques for NSM delay have been described, all of which involve undermining the nipple and surrounding mastectomy skin to some degree. Partial NAC necrosis was reported in a total of 9 patients (8.9%). Mastectomy flap necrosis was reported in a total of 8 patients (7.9%). Three of five studies reported positive retroareolar biopsy findings in a total of 7 patients (6.9%). CONCLUSIONS: Delay procedures for NSM have a good safety profile and may be considered in patients at risk for NAC or mastectomy flap necrosis, such as patients with pre-existing breast scars, active smoking, prior radiation, or ptosis. These procedures have the added benefit of allowing a retroareolar biopsy to be sent for permanent sections prior to mastectomy, allowing the surgical team to plan for the removal of the NAC at the time of mastectomy if indicated and eliminating the risk of a false-negative result on frozen section analysis.
28040451	Regulation of XIAP Turnover Reveals a Role for USP11 in Promotion of Tumorigenesis.	The emerging regulatory role of deubiquitinases (DUBs) has been implicated in various fundamental processes and pathogenesis. To determine the pivotal role that DUBs play in mediating tumorigenesis, we have performed a non-biased screen of 67 human DUBs based on a mammary cell transformation assay. This led to the identification of USP11 as a critical determinant of mammary tumor initiation and progression. Using an approach of protein complex purification coupled with mass spectrometry, we further identified XIAP to be a target for USP11. We demonstrated that, while depletion of XIAP attenuates cell transformation, elevated USP11 significantly promotes the tumor colony formation through stabilization of XIAP. Molecular modeling coupled with mutagenesis analyses further revealed that Leu207 on the BIR2 domain of XIAP facilitates its interaction with USP11. Stabilization of XIAP due to its deubiquitylation by USP11 leads to the inhibition of cell anoikis and apoptosis, which in turn promotes tumorigenesis. Finally, immunohistochemical staining revealed that aberrant accumulation of USP11 correlates with elevated levels of XIAP in breast cancer tissues. We therefore propose that aberrant USP11, via stabilization of XIAP, promotes tumor initiation and progression.
28040314	Aesthetic and functional outcome after breast conserving surgery - Comparison between conventional and oncoplastic resection.	BACKGROUND: Recent studies implicate that oncoplastic breast cancer surgery provides better aesthetic outcome than conventional resection. Several factors have been associated with poor aesthetic outcome. This study aims to compare patient-reported aesthetic and functional outcome after conventional and oncoplastic resection and to evaluate prognostic factors for poor aesthetic outcome in a population-based setting. METHODS: 637 patients having breast conserving treatment (BCT) due to unilateral primary breast cancer at a single hospital district during 2010 were included. Aesthetic and functional outcome were evaluated using two questionnaires three years after surgery. RESULTS: Questionnaires were returned by 379 (59%) patients; 293 (77%) of these had conventional and 86 (23%) oncoplastic resection. Patients in oncoplastic resection group had larger tumour diameter (p < 0.001), larger resection specimens (p < 0.001), and more often multifocal tumours (p = 0.032), node positive cancer (p = 0.029) and lower quadrant tumour localization (p = 0.007). Aesthetic outcome according to BCTOS questionnaire was good in 284 (75%) patients; 52 (61%) patients in the oncoplastic group and 230 patients (81%) in the conventional resection group, p < 0.001. Larger tumour diameter (p = 0.033), multifocality (p = 0.022), weight of resection specimen (<0.001) and oncoplastic surgery (p < 0.001) were predicting poor aesthetic outcome, when all patients were included. Tumour multifocality (p = 0.013) remained predictor of poor aesthetic outcome in conventional resection group but not in oncoplastic resection group. CONCLUSIONS: Patient satisfaction to aesthetic outcome after BCT is high. Conventional resection provides good aesthetic outcome in appropriately selected patients. Oncoplastic resection enables BCT in patients with larger and multifocal tumours with favourable aesthetic outcome.
28040199	Molecular classification of breast cancer: what the pathologist needs to know.	Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease featuring distinct histological, molecular and clinical phenotypes. Although traditional classification systems utilising clinicopathological and few molecular markers are well established and validated, they remain insufficient to reflect the diverse biological and clinical heterogeneity of breast cancer. Advancements in high-throughput molecular techniques and bioinformatics have contributed to the improved understanding of breast cancer biology, refinement of molecular taxonomies and the development of novel prognostic and predictive molecular assays. Application of such technologies is already underway, and is expected to change the way we manage breast cancer. Despite the enormous amount of work that has been carried out to develop and refine breast cancer molecular prognostic and predictive assays, molecular testing is still in evolution. Pathologists should be aware of the new technology and be ready for the challenge. In this review, we provide an update on the application of molecular techniques with regard to breast cancer diagnosis, prognosis and outcome prediction. The current contribution of emerging technology to our understanding of breast cancer is also highlighted.
28040198	The biological and clinical significance of stromal-epithelial interactions in breast cancer.	There is evidence that an aberrant tumour microenvironment (TME) facilitates cancer development, progression, and responses to treatment. While many of the mechanisms underlying the phenotype and cancer-promoting behaviour of the TME are unknown, epigenetic mechanisms in cancer cells and the TME are thought to play important roles. As a result, cancer profiling strategies for drug and biomarker development require a thorough understanding of both the epithelial tissue compartment and the TME. This review discusses recent advances in our understanding of how cancer epithelial cells interact with their microenvironment and how this knowledge can be exploited clinically.
28039786	DNA interaction, antimicrobial, antioxidant and anticancer studies on Cu(II) complexes of Luotonin A.	Luotonin A (L), a novel natural cytotoxic and anti-inflammatory alkaloid, chelated with copper(II) to improve its cytotoxic effect against the cancer cells. The complexes [Cu(L)H2OCl]Cl (1) and [Cu(L)2]Cl2 (2) are prepared by using copper(II) chloride and L with ligand/metal molar ratio of 1:1 and 2:1 respectively. A solution of complexes 1 &2 are characterized by physical spectroscopic methods using Ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectrophotometer, Fourier Transform-Infra red (FT-IR) spectroscopy, Electron Para magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (EPR) and by electrochemical methods. The interaction of these complexes 1 &2 with calf thymus (CT-DNA) have been investigated by physical methods to propose the modes of DNA binding with the complexes 1 &2. Absorption spectral titration studies of complex 1 with CT-DNA shows a red-shift of 5nm with the DNA binding affinity of Kb, 8.65x103M-1, but complex 2does not show any red-shift with binding constant Kb, 7.32x103M-1 reveals that the complex 1 binding with DNA strongly than complex 2 and the binding occurs in between the base pairs of DNA as intercalation. Strong interactions of the two complexes 1 & 2 with CT-DNA have also been confirmed by fluorescence spectral titration studies. The evaluated values of KSV and Kass shows that, the complexes 1 &2 interact with DNA through the intercalation, coincide with other partial intercalators strongly than the free ligand L. Complex 1 exhibits potent antioxidant activity with SC50 value of 23.9+/-0.69muM is evaluated by DPPH radical scavenging assay and which has potent antimicrobial activity against pathogens than 2 and L. The anticancer activity of L, complexes 1 &2 against human breast cancer cell line (MCF-7) and cervical cancer cell line (HeLa) has also been studied by using fluorescence staining method. The IC50 values of L, complexes 1&2 against MCF-7 and HeLa cell lines with the incubation time intervals of 24hrs are 1 (5.0+/-0.25, 12.0+/-0.30muM)<2 (6.5+/-0.27, 15.0+/-0.30muM)<L (7.0+/-0.15, 25.0+/-0.35muM) respectively. Interestingly, complex 1 exhibits anticancer activity more potent than L against both MCF-7 and HeLa cell lines. The result of anticancer activity studies show that the cytotoxic activity of L against MCF-7 and HeLa cells is increased, when chelated with Cu(II).
28039034	Development and evaluation of a novel RT-qPCR based test for the quantification of HER2 gene expression in breast cancer.	Accurate measurement of Human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER2) gene expression is central for breast or stomach cancer therapy orientation and prognosis. The current standards testing methods for HER2 expression are immunohistochemistry (IHC) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). In the current study, we explored the use of quantitative real time reverse transcription-PCR (RT-qPCR) as a potential method for the accurate relative quantification of the HER2 gene using formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) breast cancer biopsy samples. The main aim of the current study is to measure the level of concordance of RT-qPCR based quantification of HER2 overexpression with both IHC and FISH. Accordingly, an endogenous control gene (ECG) is required for this relative quantification and should ideally be expressed equivalently across tested samples. Stably expressed ECGs have been selected from a panel of seven genes using GenEx V6 software which is based on geNorm and NormFinder and statistical methods. Quantification of HER2 gene expression was performed by our RT-qPCR-based test and compared to the results obtained by both IHC and FISH methods. HER2 gene quantification using RT-qPCR test was normalized using the two ECGs (RPL30 and RPL37A) that were successfully identified and selected from a panel of seven genes as the most stable and reliable ECGs. We evaluated a total of 216 FFPE tissue samples from breast cancer patients. The results obtained with RT-qPCR in the current study were compared to both IHC and FISH data collected for the same patients. In addition to an internal evaluation, an external evaluation of this assay was also performed in a recognized pathology center in Europe (Clinic Barcelona Hospital Universitari, Spain) using 116 FFPE breast cancer tissue samples. The results demonstrated a high concordance between RT-qPCR and either IHC (98%) or FISH (72%) methods. Accordantly, the overall concordance was 85%. To our knowledge, this is the first study using the specific combination of RPL30 and RPL37 as reference genes for an accurate HER2 gene quantification in FFPE biopsy samples. Although further clinical validation regarding evolution and therapeutic response using RT-qPCR for the quantification of HER2 expression are still needed, the present study constitutes definitely a factual element that the RT-qPCR based assay may constitute a valid complementary test to accurately measure HER2 expression for a better treatment orientation.
28038779	Usefulness of combined BI-RADS analysis and Nakagami statistics of ultrasound echoes in the diagnosis of breast lesions.	AIM: To develop a method combining the statistics of the ultrasound backscatter and the Breast Imaging-Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) classification to enhance the differentiation of breast tumours. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Nakagami shape parameter m was used to characterise the scatter properties of breast tumours. Raw data from the radiofrequency (RF) echo-signal and B-mode images from 107 (32 malignant and 75 benign) lesions and their surrounding tissue were recorded. Three different characteristic values of the shape parameters of m (maximum [mLmax], minimum [mLmin] and average [mLavg]) and differences between m parameters (Deltammax, Deltammin, Deltamavg) of the lesions and their surrounding tissues were assessed. A lesion with a BI-RADS score of 3 was considered benign, while a lesion with a score of 4 was considered malignant (a cut-off of BI-RADS 3/4 was set for all patients). RESULTS: The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) was equal to 0.966 for BI-RADS, with 100% sensitivity and 54.67% specificity. All malignant lesions were diagnosed correctly, whereas 34 benign lesions were biopsied unnecessarily. In assessing the Nakagami statistics, the sum of the sensitivity and specificity was the best for mLavg (62.5% and 93.33%, respectively). Only four of 20 lesions were found over the cut-off value in BI-RADS of 4a. When comparing the differences in m parameters, Deltamavg had the highest sensitivity of 90% (only three of 32 lesions were false negative). These three lesions were classified as BI-RADS category 4c. The combined use of B-mode and mLmin parameter improve the AUC up to 0.978 (p=0.088), compared to BI-RADS alone. CONCLUSION: The combination of the parametric imaging and the BI-RADS assessment does not significantly improve the differentiation of breast lesions, but it has the potential to better identify the group of patients with mainly benign lesions that have a low level of suspicion for malignancy with a BI-RADS score of 4a.
28038704	GATA3 expression in clinically useful groups of breast carcinoma: a comparison with GCDFP15 and mammaglobin for identifying paired primary and metastatic tumors.	GATA3 has been recognized as the novel marker for identifying primary and metastatic breast carcinomas, consistently showing that GATA3 was significantly more sensitive than traditional markers gross cystic disease fluid protein 15 (GCDFP15) and mammaglobin (MGB). However, clinically useful groups of breast carcinomas status were not identified, which were determining appropriate treatment strategy, affecting the prognosis. In this study, we undertook a comparative study of the marker GATA3 and GCDFP15 and MGB in clinically useful groups of paired primary and metastatic breast cancer. We retrieved 64 cases of matched primary and metastatic breast cancer from the surgical pathology archive at our institution. According to the emerging 2015 St. Gallen Consensus, the clinically useful groups were divided into ER and/or PR (+), HER2 (-), abbreviated as A; ER and/or PR (+), HER2 (+), abbreviated as B; ER and PR (-), HER2 (+), abbreviated as C; ER, PR and HER2 (-), abbreviated as D; each group contained 16 cases (n=16). Tissue microarrays were created, with three 1-mm punch specimens from each case. The tissue microarrays were cut at 4-mum thickness and stained with monoclonal antibodies to GATA3, GCDFP15, and MGB. Staining intensity (0-3+) and extent (0%-100%) were scored with an H-score calculated (range, 0-300). Sensitivities by varying H-score cutoffs (any; >/=50; >/=150) for a positive result in the clinically useful groups of matched primary or metastatic breast cancer among GATA3, GCDFP15, and MGB. GATA3 was significantly more sensitive than GCDFP15 and MGB A and B groups (P<.05) rather than C and D groups (P>.05). However, GATA3 in conjunction with GCDFP15 and MGB detection could improve the sensitivity of C group (P<.05) rather than D group (P>.05). Significantly, good coincidence was observed between primary and metastatic tumor GATA3 expression (kappa value = 0.826 >0.75) as compared with the coincidence of GCDFP15 (kappa value =0.492 <0.75) and MGB (kappa value =0.593 <0.75) (both P<.05). In conclusion, GATA3 expression did not show the same sensitivity for the clinically useful groups of breast cancer. GATA3 expression is positively correlated with ER-positive, PR-positive, and HER2-positive carcinomas. In addition, the matched primary and metastatic tumor expression of GATA3 shows good coincidence. We propose the careful selection of GATA3 for identifying hormone receptor negativity of breast cancer, especially in the case of triple-negative breast cancer.
28038327	Synthesis of new sarsasapogenin derivatives with cytotoxicity and apoptosis-inducing activities in human breast cancer MCF-7 cells.	Based on the fact that Timosaponin A-III, a saponin isolated from the rhizome of Anemarrhena asphodeloides, is a promising bioactive lead compound in the treatment of cancer, structural modification at the C3 and C26 positions of sarsasapogenin has always been the focus of our structure-activity investigations. In this paper, we describe the synthesis of a range of new derivatives 5a-5o and the evaluation of their antitumor activities in a panel of six human cancer cell lines using the MTT assay in vitro. The results obtained showed that compounds 5h, 5i, and 5n exhibited significant cytotoxic activities against the six cell lines, being more potent than their parent compound sarsasapogenin. Furthermore, the p-fluorobenzyloxy series of compounds generally exhibited stronger cytotoxicities against all the tested cancer cells compared with the benzyloxy and p-methoxybenzyloxy series, and the substitution of pyrrolidinyl and piperazinyl groups at the C26 position was the preferred option for these compounds to display antitumor activities. Compound 5n exhibited excellent cytotoxic activity against MCF-7 cell line (IC50 = 2.95 muM), and was 16.7-fold more potent than sarsasapogenin. Further studies of the cellular mechanism of 5n showed that it arrested MCF-7 cells at the G2/M phase and induced apoptosis and necrosis. All these results show that it is important to carry out structural modification of sarsasapogenin to obtain some promising derivatives with marked antitumor activities, and the representative compound 5n is a lead compound for further research.
28038323	Synthesis and biological evaluation of curcumin inspired indole analogues as tubulin polymerization inhibitors.	In our endeavour towards the development of potent cytotoxic agents, a series of some new curcumin inspired indole analogues, in which indole and phenyl moieties are linked on either sides of 1,5-diaryl-1,4-pentadien-3-one system have been synthesized and characterized by spectral data. All the newly synthesized analogues were tested for their cytotoxic potential against a panel of eight cancer cell lines namely, lung (A549), breast (MDA-MB-231, BT549 and 4T1), prostate (PC-3, DU145), gastric (HGC-27) and cervical (HeLa). Notably, among all the compounds tested, compounds 11c, 11d and 11f showed potent growth inhibition on PC-3 and BT549 with IC50 values in the range of 3.12-6.34 muM and 4.69-8.72 muM respectively. The most active compound (11c) was also tested on RWPE-1 (normal prostate) cells and was found to be safe compared to the PC-3 cells. In tubulin polymerization assay, compounds 11c and 11f effectively inhibited microtubule assembly with IC50 values of 10.21 +/- 0.10 and 8.83 +/- 0.06 muM respectively. The results from molecular modelling studies revealed that these compounds bind at the colchicine binding site of the tubulin. Moreover, DAPI and acridine orange/ethidium bromide staining studies indicated that compounds 11c and 11f can induce apoptosis in PC-3 cells. Further flow-cytometry analysis revealed that compound 11c arrests PC-3 cells in G2/M phase of the cell cycle while compound 11f treatment resulted in moderate increase in the G2/M population. Additionally, the treatment by these compounds led to the impairment of mitochondrial membrane potential (DPsim) in PC-3 cells.
28038321	Barriers, beliefs and practice patterns for breast cancer reconstruction: A provincial survey.	BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to characterize beliefs and practice patterns for breast cancer reconstruction among physicians who treat patients with breast cancer, in order to delineate current clinical practice. This survey was administered prior to Cancer Care Ontario guideline publication. METHOD: Survey questions addressed four domains: survival, delayed or obscured recurrence detection, delayed adjuvant therapy, and aesthetics. The survey was administered to 1160 Ontario plastic and general surgeons and radiation and medical oncologists. Data were compared to published guidelines. RESULTS: The overall response rate was 48%, with 57% of respondents treating breast cancer. Of those treating breast cancer, 75% are affiliated with an academic center. Immediate breast reconstruction (IBR) is not available to 28%. Autologous reconstruction is thought to interfere with recurrence detection by 23% (oncologists 30%, surgeons 19%, p = 0.04). For patients not expected to require radiation therapy, IBR is not supported by 30%. Autologous IBR is believed to delay delivery of adjuvant chemotherapy by 45% (oncologists 55%, surgeons 41%, p = 0.02). Up to 42% of respondents believe delays in adjuvant therapy delivery following IBR are due to insufficient health care resources (ie. coordinating an oncologic and reconstructive surgeon). Radiation therapy following reconstruction is believed to have negative aesthetic outcomes, and increase the need for revision surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Unfavourable beliefs about certain clinical actions do not align with recent provincial guideline recommendations. Insufficient healthcare resources are perceived to be a significant barrier to IBR and timely care.
28036090	Antiproliferative Effects of Cynara cardunculus L. var. altilis (DC) Lipophilic Extracts.	Besides being traditionally used to relieve hepatobiliary disorders, Cynara cardunculus L. has evidenced anticancer potential on triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). This study highlights the antiproliferative effects of lipophilic extracts from C. cardunculus L. var. altilis (DC) leaves and florets, and of their major compounds, namely cynaropicrin and taraxasteryl acetate, against MDA-MB-231 cells. Our results demonstrated that MDA-MB-231 cells were much less resistant to leaves extract (IC50 10.39 microg/mL) than to florets extract (IC50 315.22 microg/mL), during 48 h. Moreover, leaves extract and cynaropicrin (IC50 6.19 microg/mL) suppressed MDA-MB-231 cells colonies formation, via an anchorage-independent growth assay. Leaves extract and cynaropicrin were also assessed regarding their regulation on caspase-3 activity, by using a spectrophotometric assay, and expression levels of G2/mitosis checkpoint and Akt signaling pathway proteins, by Western blotting. Leaves extract increased caspase-3 activity, while cynaropicrin did not affect it. Additionally, they caused p21Waf1/Cip1 upregulation, as well as cyclin B1 and phospho(Tyr15)-CDK1 accumulation, which may be related to G2 cell cycle arrest. They also downregulated phospho(Ser473)-Akt, without changing total Akt1 level. Cynaropicrin probably contributed to leaves extract antiproliferative action. These promising insights suggest that cultivated cardoon leaves lipophilic extract and cynaropicrin may be considered toward a natural-based therapeutic approach on TNBC.
28036030	Xanthohumol, a Prenylated Chalcone from Hops, Inhibits the Viability and Stemness of Doxorubicin-Resistant MCF-7/ADR Cells.	Xanthohumol is a unique prenylated flavonoid in hops (Humulus lupulus L.) and beer. Xanthohumol has been shown to possess a variety of pharmacological activities. There is little research on its effect on doxorubicin-resistant breast cancer cells (MCF-7/ADR) and the cancer stem-like cells exiting in this cell line. In the present study, we investigate the effect of xanthohumol on the viability and stemness of MCF-7/ADR cells. Xanthohumol inhibits viability, induces apoptosis, and arrests the cell cycle of MCF-7/ADR cells in a dose-dependent manner; in addition, xanthohumol sensitizes the inhibition effect of doxorubicin on MCF-7/ADR cells. Interestingly, we also find that xanthohumol can reduce the stemness of MCF-7/ADR cells evidenced by the xanthohumol-induced decrease in the colony formation, the migration, the percentage of side population cells, the sphere formation, and the down-regulation of stemness-related biomarkers. These results demonstrate that xanthohumol is a promising compound targeting the doxorubicin resistant breast cancer cells and regulating their stemness, which, therefore, will be applied as a potential candidate for the development of a doxorubicin-resistant breast cancer agent and combination therapy of breast cancer.
28035996	Novel Nine-Exon AR Transcripts (Exon 1/Exon 1b/Exons 2-8) in Normal and Cancerous Breast and Prostate Cells.	Nearly 20 different transcripts of the human androgen receptor (AR) are reported with two currently listed as Refseq isoforms in the NCBI database. Isoform 1 encodes wild-type AR (type 1 AR) and isoform 2 encodes the variant AR45 (type 2 AR). Both variants contain eight exons: they share common exons 2-8 but differ in exon 1 with the canonical exon 1 in isoform 1 and the variant exon 1b in isoform 2. Splicing of exon 1 or exon 1b is reported to be mutually exclusive. In this study, we identified a novel exon 1b (1b/TAG) that contains an additional TAG trinucleotide upstream of exon 1b. Moreover, we identified AR transcripts in both normal and cancerous breast and prostate cells that contained either exon 1b or 1b/TAG spliced between the canonical exon 1 and exon 2, generating nine-exon AR transcripts that we have named isoforms 3a and 3b. The proteins encoded by these new AR variants could regulate androgen-responsive reporters in breast and prostate cancer cells under androgen-depleted conditions. Analysis of type 3 AR-GFP fusion proteins showed partial nuclear localization in PC3 cells under androgen-depleted conditions, supporting androgen-independent activation of the AR. Type 3 AR proteins inhibited androgen-induced growth of LNCaP cells. Microarray analysis identified a small set of type 3a AR target genes in LNCaP cells, including genes known to modulate growth and proliferation of prostate cancer (PCGEM1, PEG3, EPHA3, and EFNB2) or other types of human cancers (TOX3, ST8SIA4, and SLITRK3), and genes that are diagnostic/prognostic biomarkers of prostate cancer (GRINA3, and BCHE).
28035725	Cyclophosphamide promotes breast cancer cell migration through CXCR4 and matrix metalloproteinases.	Cyclophosphamide is indicated for the treatment of cancerous diseases such as breast cancer and cervical cancer. Recent studies have shown that cyclophosphamide may induce cancer metastasis, but the cause of this unexpected adverse effect is not fully understood. In this study, we investigate the effect of cyclophosphamide on cancer cell migration and its correlation to chemokine (C-X-C motif) receptor 4 (CXCR4), a biomarker for cancer metastasis. Two human cancer cell lines with significant difference in endogenous CXCR4 expression, the breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB-231, and the melanoma cell line, MDA-MB-435S, were treated with various concentrations of cyclophosphamide, followed by the assessment of CXCR4 expression and cell migration. We found that the migration ability of MDA-MB-231 cells was enhanced with increasing concentrations of cyclophosphamide, which induced the cell-surface expression of CXCR4, but had no effect on the overall amount of CXCR4. In MDA-MB-435S cells, in which CXCR4 was barely detectable, cyclophosphamide was unable to activate cell-surface CXCR4, and did not promote cell migration. Studies on the mRNA expression profile of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in MDA-MB-231 cells further indicate that MMP9 and MMP13 may be involved in the action of cyclophosphamide. The protein expression of both MMP9 and MMP13 was increased in the presence of cyclophosphamide. Results from this study provide the molecular basis for the possible pathway of cyclophosphamide to induce cancer metastasis.
28035580	Simultaneous PET/MRI assessment of response to cytotoxic and hormone neo-adjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer: a preliminary report.	The aim of this study was to assess the response to cytotoxic and hormone neo-adjuvant chemotherapy in four patients with locally advanced breast cancer by simultaneous PET/MRI. Four patients with locally advanced breast cancer underwent simultaneous PET/MRI of the breast using a 3 T Biograph mMR before and after neo-adjuvant chemotherapy (two patients were treated with hormone-therapy and two patients were treated with cytotoxic chemotherapy). Morpho-structural tumoral features and tumor size were assessed; area value, metabolic (SUV and MTV) and functional (ADC, K trans, V e, k ep and iAUC) data were obtained by positioning regions of interest. A comparison of all parameters between the pre- and post-treatment PET/MRI examinations and between the two different therapeutic schedules was assessed. In patients treated with cytotoxic chemotherapy and classified as PR, there was a significant reduction of post-treatment morphological, metabolic and functional parameters. In a patient treated with hormone therapy, classified as SD, there was an increase of all post-treatment perfusion parameters, a substantially stable ADC value and a poor reduction of lesion size and of maximum SUV (SUVmax) values; the last patient, treated with hormone therapy and classified as PR, showed a significant reduction of lesion size and SUVmax values with a reduction of perfusion parameters and substantially stable ADC values. Multiparametric evaluation with simultaneous PET/MRI could be a useful tool to assess the response to cytotoxic and hormone neo-adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with breast cancer. Future studies in a larger cohort of patients are warranted to confirm the results of this preliminary study.
28035539	Brucine inhibits bone metastasis of breast cancer cells by suppressing Jagged1/Notch1 signaling pathways.	OBJECTIVE: To examine the effects of brucine on the invasion, migration and bone resorption of receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappa B ligand (RANKL)-induced osteoclastogenesis. METHODS: The osteoclastogenesis model was builded by co-culturing human breast tumor MDA-MB-231 and mouse RAW264.7 macrophages cells. RANKL (50 ng/mL) and macrophage-colony stimulating factor (50 ng/mL) were added to this system, followed by treatment with brucine (0.02, 0.04 and 0.08 mmol/L), or 10 mumol/L zoledronic acid as positive control. The migration and bone resorption were measured by transwell assay and in vitro bone resorption assay. The protein expressions of Jagged1 and Notch1 were investigated by Western blot. The expressions of transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1), nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) and Hes1 were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: Compared with the model group, brucine led to a dose-dependent decrease on migration of MDA-MB-231 cells, inhibited RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption of RAW264.7 cells (P<0.01). Furthermore, brucine decreased the protein levels of Jagged1 and Notch1 in MDA-MB-231 cells and RAW264.7 cells co-cultured system as well as the expressions of TGF-beta1, NF-kappaB and Hes1 (P<0.05 or P<0.01). CONCLUSION: Brucine may inhibit osteoclastogenesis by suppressing Jagged1/Notch1 signaling pathways.
28035408	Identification of antibiotic resistance genes in the multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii strain, MDR-SHH02, using whole-genome sequencing.	This study aimed to investigate antibiotic resistance genes in the multidrug-resistant (MDR) Acinetobacter baumannii (A. baumanii) strain, MDR-SHH02, using wholegenome sequencing (WGS). The antibiotic resistance of MDR-SHH02 isolated from a patient with breast cancer to 19 types of antibiotics was determined using the KirbyBauer method. WGS of MDR-SHH02 was then performed. Following quality control and transcriptome assembly, functional annotation of genes was conducted, and the phylogenetic tree of MDR-SHH02, along with another 5 A. baumanii species and 2 Acinetobacter species, was constructed using PHYLIP 3.695 and FigTree v1.4.2. Furthermore, pathogenicity islands (PAIs) were predicted by the pathogenicity island database. Potential antibiotic resistance genes in MDR-SHH02 were predicted based on the information in the Antibiotic Resistance Genes Database (ARDB). MDR-SHH02 was found to be resistant to all of the tested antibiotics. The total draft genome length of MDR-SHH02 was 4,003,808 bp. There were 74.25% of coding sequences to be annotated into 21 of the Clusters of Orthologous Groups (COGs) of protein terms, such as 'transcription' and 'amino acid transport and metabolism'. Furthermore, there were 45 PAIs homologous to the sequence MDRSHH02000806. Additionally, a total of 12 gene sequences in MDR-SHH02 were highly similar to the sequences of antibiotic resistance genes in ARDB, including genes encoding aminoglycosidemodifying enzymes [e.g., aac(3)-Ia, ant(2'')Ia, aph33ib and aph(3')-Ia], beta-lactamase genes (bl2b_tem and bl2b_tem1), sulfonamide-resistant dihydropteroate synthase genes (sul1 and sul2), catb3 and tetb. These results suggest that numerous genes mediate resistance to various antibiotics in MDR-SHH02, and provide a clinical guidance for the personalized therapy of A. baumannii-infected patients.
28035403	Propofol induces proliferation partially via downregulation of p53 protein and promotes migration via activation of the Nrf2 pathway in human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231.	Antioxidants induce the proliferation of cancers by decreasing the expression of p53. Propofol, one of the most extensively used intravenous anesthetics, provides its antioxidative activity via activation of the nuclear factor E2-related factor-2 (Nrf2) pathway, but the mechanisms involved in the effects remain unknown. Thus, we aimed to investigate the function of p53 and Nrf2 in the human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 following treatment with propofol. The cells were treated with propofol (2, 5 and 10 microg/ml) for 1, 4 and 12 h, and MTT assay was used to evaluate cell proliferation, and a wound healing assay was used to evaluate cell migration. Cell apoptosis, caspase-3 activity, and western blot analysis for p53 and Nrf2 protein were also assessed. Finally, PIK-75, a potent Nrf2 inhibitor, was used to confirm the effects of Nrf2 after treatment with propofol. Treatment of MDA-MB231 cells with propofol resulted in increased proliferation and migration in a dose- and time-dependent manner. After treatment with propofol for 12 h, the Nrf2 protein expression was increased, while the percentage of apoptotic cells, caspase-3 activity, and expression of p53 were significantly decreased. Additionally, treatment with the Nrf2 inhibitor increased the percentage of apoptotic cells, inhibited the migration almost completely, and decreased the degree of proliferation, while the expression of p53 was not affected. In conclusion, propofol increased the proliferation of human breast cancer MDA-MB231 cells, which was at least partially associated with the inhibition of the expression of p53, and induced cell migration, which was involved in the activation of the Nrf2 pathway.
28034806	Targeting the extracellular matrix of ovarian cancer using functionalized, drug loaded lyophilisomes.	Epithelial ovarian cancer is characterized by a high mortality rate and is in need for novel therapeutic avenues to improve patient outcome. The tumor's extracellular matrix ("stroma") offers new possibilities for targeted drug-delivery. Recently we identified highly sulfated chondroitin sulfate (CS-E) as a component abundantly present in the ovarian cancer extracellular matrix, and as a novel target for anti-cancer therapy. Here, we report on the functionalization of drug-loaded lyophilisomes (albumin-based biocapsules) to specifically target the stroma of ovarian carcinomas with the potential to eliminate cancer cells. To achieve specific targeting, we conjugated single chain antibodies reactive with CS-E to lyophilisomes using a two-step approach comprising sortase-mediated ligation and bioorthogonal click chemistry. Antibody-functionalized lyophilisomes specifically targeted the ovarian cancer stroma through CS-E. In a CS-E rich micro-environment in vitro lyophilisomes induced cell death by extracellular release of doxorubicin which localized to the nucleus. Immunohistochemistry identified CS-E rich stroma in a variety of solid tumors other than ovarian cancer, including breast, lung and colon cancer indicating the potential versatility of matrix therapy and the use of highly sulfated chondroitin sulfates in cancer stroma as a micro-environmental hook for targeted drug delivery.
28034681	Risks of second malignancies after breast cancer treatment: Long-term results.	PURPOSE: To estimate the long-term risk of second malignancies after breast cancer treatment in a large homogeneous cohort from a single institution. PATIENTS AND METHODS: All patients in this study were treated for non-metastatic breast cancer at the Curie institute, Paris, between 1981 and 2000. We calculated the cumulative incidence of second malignancies and the risk of developing each type of second malignancies over a period of 10 to 15 years. The observed crude incidence rates in the entire patient population were then compared to the expected incidence in the general population of French women, as provided by age-standardized data. A standardized incidence ratio (SIR) was calculated for all second malignancies. We also calculated second malignancies standardized incidence ratios for patients who underwent adjuvant therapy for breast cancer. RESULTS: The study cohort included a total of 17,745 women. The median follow-up since diagnosis was 13.4 years (range: 2-29 years). The 15-year cumulative incidence of second malignancies was 1.807 per 100,000 (CI 1.729-1.884). A total of 2370 second malignancies were observed during follow-up, 2010 in the radiotherapy arm and 360 in the no radiotherapy arm (relative risk [RR] 1.15 [1.03-1.28], P=0.0134). Crude incidence rates were significantly higher in our cohort than in the general population for contralateral breast cancer (SIR 2.96 [confidence interval (CI) 2.82-3.12], P<0.0001), sarcomas (SIR 8.48 [CI 6.41-11.22], P<0.0001), leukaemia (SIR 2.37 [CI 1.85-3.04], P<0.0001), lung cancer (SIR 1.39 [CI 1.13-1.72], P<0.0022) and gynaecological cancer (SIR 1.31 [CI 1.15-1.50], P=0.0001). Among patients treated for breast cancer, those who received radiotherapy was associated with an excess risk of sarcoma as compared to those have not had (RR 5.59 [CI 1.35-23.17], P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Women treated for breast cancer had a significantly increased risk of several kinds of second malignancies compared to the general population.
28034454	Comprehensive genomic sequencing and the molecular profiles of clinically advanced breast cancer.	Targeting specific mutations that have arisen within a tumour is a promising means of increasing the efficacy of treatments, and breast cancer is no exception to this new paradigm of personalised medicine. Traditional DNA sequencing methods used to characterise clinical cancer specimens and impact treatment decisions are highly sensitive, but are often limited in their scope to known mutational hot spots. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies can also test for these well-known hot spots, as well as identifying insertions and deletions, copy number changes such as ERBB2 (HER2) gene amplification, and a wide array of fusion or rearrangement events. By rapidly analysing many genes in parallel, NGS technologies can make efficient use of precious biopsy material. Comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) by NGS can reveal targetable, clinically relevant genomic alterations that can stratify tumours by predicted sensitivity to a variety of therapies, including HER2- or MTOR-targeted therapies, immunotherapies, and other kinase inhibitors. Many clinically relevant genomic alterations would not be identified by IHC or hotspot testing, but can be detected by NGS. In addition to the most common breast carcinoma subtypes, rare subtypes analysed with CGP also harbour clinically relevant genomic alterations that can potentially direct therapy selection, illustrating that CGP is a powerful tool for guiding treatment across all breast cancer subtypes.
28034453	DNA damage repair in breast cancer and its therapeutic implications.	The DNA damage response (DDR) involves the activation of numerous cellular activities that repair DNA lesions and maintain genomic integrity, and is critical in preventing tumorigenesis. Inherited or acquired mutations in specific genes involved in the DNA damage response, for example the breast cancer susceptibility genes 1/2 (BRCA1/2), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) and P53 are associated with various subtypes of breast cancer. Such changes can render breast cancer cells particularly sensitive to specific DNA damage response inhibitors, for example BRCA1/2 germline mutated cells are sensitive to poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors. The aims of this review are to discuss specific DNA damage response defects in breast cancer and to present the current stage of development of various DDR inhibitors (namely PARP, ATM/ATR, DNA-PK, PARG, RECQL5, FEN1 and APE1) for breast cancer mono- and combination therapy.
28033510	Sentinel node detection in early breast cancer with intraoperative portable gamma camera: UK experience.	PURPOSE: Access to nuclear medicine department for sentinel node imaging remains an issue in number of hospitals in the UK and many parts of the world. Sentinella(R) is a portable imaging camera used intra-operatively to produce real time visual localisation of sentinel lymph nodes. METHODS: Sentinella(R) was tested in a controlled laboratory environment at our centre and we report our experience on the first use of this technology from UK. Moreover, preoperative scintigrams of the axilla were obtained in 144 patients undergoing sentinel node biopsy using conventional gamma camera. Sentinella(R) scans were done intra-operatively to correlate with the pre-operative scintigram and to determine presence of any residual hot node after the axilla was deemed to be clear based on the silence of the hand held gamma probe. RESULTS: Sentinella(R) detected significantly more nodes compared with CGC (p < 0.0001). Sentinella(R) picked up extra nodes in 5/144 cases after the axilla was found silent using hand held gamma probe. In 2/144 cases, extra nodes detected by Sentinella(R) confirmed presence of tumour cells that led to a complete axillary clearance. CONCLUSIONS: Sentinella(R) is a reliable technique for intra-operative localisation of radioactive nodes. It provides increased nodal visualisation rates compared to static scintigram imaging and proves to be an important tool for harvesting all hot sentinel nodes. This portable gamma camera can definitely replace the use of conventional lymphoscintigrams saving time and money both for patients and the health system.
28033509	Atlas-based segmentation in breast cancer radiotherapy: Evaluation of specific and generic-purpose atlases.	OBJECTIVES: Atlas-based automatic segmentation (ABAS) addresses the challenges of accuracy and reliability in manual segmentation. We aim to evaluate the contribution of specific-purpose in ABAS of breast cancer (BC) patients with respect to generic-purpose libraries. MATERIALS AND METHODS: One generic-purpose and 9 specific-purpose libraries, stratified according to type of surgery and size of thorax circumference, were obtained from the computed tomography of 200 BC patients. Keywords about contralateral breast volume and presence of breast expander/prostheses were recorded. ABAS was validated on 47 independent patients, considering manual segmentation from scratch as reference. Five ABAS datasets were obtained, testing single-ABAS and multi-ABAS with simultaneous truth and performance level estimation (STAPLE). Center of mass distance (CMD), average Hausdorff distance (AHD) and Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) between corresponding ABAS and manual structures were evaluated and statistically significant differences between different surgeries, structures and ABAS strategies were investigated. RESULTS: Statistically significant differences between patients who underwent different surgery were found, with superior results for conservative-surgery group, and between different structures were observed: ABAS of heart, lungs, kidneys and liver was satisfactory (median values: CMD<2 mm, DSC>/=0.80, AHD<1.5 mm), whereas chest wall, breast and spinal cord obtained moderate performance (median values: 2 mm </= CMD<5 mm, 0.60 </= DSC<0.80, 1.5 mm </= AHD<4 mm) and esophagus, stomach, brachial plexus and supraclavicular nodes obtained poor performance (median CMD>/=5 mm, DSC<0.60, AHD>/=4 mm). The application of STAPLE algorithm generally yields higher performance and the use of keywords improves results for breast ABAS. CONCLUSION: The homogeneity in the selection of atlases based on multiple anatomical and clinical features and the use of specific-purpose libraries can improve ABAS performance with respect to generic-purpose libraries.
28033508	Pathological complete response in invasive breast cancer treated by skin sparing mastectomy and immediate reconstruction following neoadjuvant chemotherapy and radiation therapy: Comparison between immunohistochemical subtypes.	CONTEXT: Even if neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) and oncoplastic techniques have increased the breast conserving surgery rate, mastectomy is still a standard for multifocal or extensive breast cancers (BC). In the prospect of increasing breast reconstruction, an alternative therapeutic protocol was developed combining NACT with neoadjuvant radiation therapy (NART), followed by mastectomy with immediate breast reconstruction (IBR). The oncological safety of this therapeutic plan still needs further exploration. We assessed pathological complete response (pCR) as a surrogate endpoint for disease free survival. METHODS: Between 2010 and 2016, 103 patients undergoing mastectomy after NACT and NART were recruited. After CT and RT were administrated, a completion mastectomy with IBR by latissimus dorsi flap was achieved 6 to 8 weeks later. pCR was defined by the absence of residual invasive disease in both nodes and breast. Histologic response was analyzed for each immunohistochemical subset. RESULTS: pCR was obtained for 53.4% of the patients. This pCR rate was higher in hormonal receptor negative (HER2 and triple negative) patients when compared to luminal tumours (69.7% vs 45.7%, p=0.023). DISCUSSION: The pCR rate found in this study is higher than those published in studies analyzing NACT (12.5%-27.1%). This can be explained by the combination of anthracycline and taxane, the use of trastuzumab when HER2 was overexpressed but also by RT associated to NACT. CONCLUSION: Inverting the sequence protocol for BC, requiring both CT and RT, allows more IBR without diminishing pCR and should therefore be considered as an acceptable therapeutic option.
28033448	Second Opinions From Medical Oncologists for Early-Stage Breast Cancer: Prevalence, Correlates, and Consequences.	Importance: Advances in the evaluation and treatment of breast cancer have made the clinical decision-making context much more complex. A second opinion from a medical oncologist may facilitate decision making for women with breast cancer, yet little is known about second opinion use. Objective: To investigate the patterns and correlates of second opinion use and the effect on chemotherapy decisions. Design, Setting, and Participants: A total of 1901 women newly diagnosed with stages 0 to II breast cancer between July 2013 and September 2014 (response rate, 71.0%) were accrued through 2 population-based Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results registries (Georgia and Los Angeles County, California) and surveyed about their experiences with medical oncologists, decision making, and chemotherapy use. Main Outcomes and Measures: Factors associated with second opinion use were evaluated using logistic regression. Also assessed was the association between second opinion and chemotherapy use, adjusting for chemotherapy indication and propensity for receiving a second opinion. Multiple imputation and weighting were used to account for missing data. Results: A total of 1901 patients with stage I to II breast cancer (mean [SD] age, 61.6 [11.0] years; 1071 [56.3%] non-Hispanic white) saw any medical oncologist. Analysis of multiply imputed, weighted data (mean n = 1866) showed that 168 (9.8%) (SE, 0.74%) received a second opinion and 54 (3.2%) (SE, 0.47%) received chemotherapy from the second oncologist. Satisfaction with chemotherapy decisions was high and did not differ between those who did (mean [SD], 4.3 [0.08] on a 1- to 5-point scale) or did not (4.4 [0.03]) obtain a second opinion (P = .29). Predictors of second opinion use included college education vs less education (odds ratio [OR], 1.85; 95% CI, 1.24-2.75), frequent use of internet-based support groups (OR, 2.15; 95% CI, 1.12-4.11), an intermediate result on the 21-gene recurrence score assay (OR, 1.85; 95% CI, 1.11-3.09), and a variant of uncertain significance on hereditary cancer genetic testing (OR, 3.24; 95% CI, 1.09-9.59). After controlling for patient and tumor characteristics, second opinion use was not associated with chemotherapy receipt (OR, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.71-1.52). Conclusions and Relevance: Second opinion use was low (<10%) among patients with early-stage breast cancer, and high decision satisfaction regardless of second opinion use suggests little unmet demand. Along with educational level and use of internet support groups, uncertain results on genomic testing predicted second opinion use. Patient demand for second opinions may increase as more complex genomic tests are disseminated.
28033447	Assessment of Overall Survival, Quality of Life, and Safety Benefits Associated With New Cancer Medicines.	Importance: There is a dearth of evidence examining the impact of newly licensed cancer medicines on therapy. This information could otherwise support clinical practice, and promote value-based decision-making in the cancer drug market. Objective: To evaluate the comparative therapeutic value of all new cancer medicines approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) between 2003 and 2013. Design, Setting, and Participants: We used a narrative synthesis approach to systematically synthesize and analyze English, French, and Australian health technology assessments (HTAs) of all new cancer medicines licensed in the United States and Europe between 2003 and 2013. Interventions: Sixty-two new molecular entities with a primary oncology indication. Main Outcomes and Measures: Overall survival (OS), quality of life (QoL), and safety. Results: Of the 62 new active cancer molecules approved by the FDA and EMA between 2003 and 2013, 53 were appraised by English, French, or Australian HTA agencies through May 2015. Of these 53 drugs, 23 (43%) increased OS by 3 months or longer, 6 (11%) by less than 3 months, and 8 (15%) by an unknown magnitude; there was no evidence to suggest that the remaining 16 (30%) increased OS over best alternative treatments. Where overall survival gains could be quantified, all new cancer drugs were associated with a mean (SE) total increase in OS of 3.43 (0.63) months over the treatments that were available in 2003. Drug-related improvements in OS were, however, widely distributed across therapeutic targets-ranging between 0 (thyroid, ascites) and 8.48 months (breast cancers)-and were sometimes based on modeled data, indirect or nonactive comparisons, or nonvalidated evidence. Although 22 (42%) of 53 new medicines were associated with an increase in QoL, 24 (45%) were also associated with reduced patient safety. Of the 53 new cancer drugs, 42 (79%) were associated with at least some improvement in OS, QoL, or safety. Conclusions and Relevance: Although innovation in the oncology drug market has contributed to improvements in therapy, the magnitude and dimension of clinical benefits vary widely, and there may be reasons to doubt that claims of efficacy reflect real-world effectiveness exactly. These findings raise important questions for clinical decision-making and value-based policy.
28033224	Skeletal Scintigraphy in Radiation-Induced Fibrosis With Lymphedema.	Despite increasing reliance on CT, MRI, and FDG PET/CT for oncological imaging, whole-body skeletal scintigraphy remains a frontline modality for staging and surveillance of osseous metastatic disease. We present a 54-year-old woman with metastatic breast cancer who received palliative external-beam radiation to the left ilium. Serial follow-up Tc-MDP bone scans demonstrated progressive soft-tissue uptake in her left lower extremity, extending from thigh to leg, with associated enlargement and skin thickening, consistent with lymphedema related to radiation-induced fibrosis. Correlative abdominopelvic CT scans confirmed fibrotic changes in the left thigh.
28032909	A novel pre-processing technique for improving image quality in digital breast tomosynthesis.	PURPOSE: Nonlinear pre-reconstruction processing of the projection data in computed tomography (CT) where accurate recovery of the CT numbers is important for diagnosis is usually discouraged, for such a processing would violate the physics of image formation in CT. However, one can devise a pre-processing step to enhance detectability of lesions in digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) where accurate recovery of the CT numbers is fundamentally impossible due to the incompleteness of the scanned data. Since the detection of lesions such as micro-calcifications and mass in breasts is the purpose of using DBT, it is justified that a technique producing higher detectability of lesions is a virtue. METHODS: A histogram modification technique was developed in the projection data domain. Histogram of raw projection data was first divided into two parts: One for the breast projection data and the other for background. Background pixel values were set to a single value that represents the boundary between breast and background. After that, both histogram parts were shifted by an appropriate amount of offset and the histogram-modified projection data were log-transformed. Filtered-backprojection (FBP) algorithm was used for image reconstruction of DBT. To evaluate performance of the proposed method, we computed the detectability index for the reconstructed images from clinically acquired data. RESULTS: Typical breast border enhancement artifacts were greatly suppressed and the detectability of calcifications and masses was increased by use of the proposed method. Compared to a global threshold-based post-reconstruction processing technique, the proposed method produced images of higher contrast without invoking additional image artifacts. CONCLUSIONS: In this work, we report a novel pre-processing technique that improves detectability of lesions in DBT and has potential advantages over the global threshold-based post-reconstruction processing technique. The proposed method not only increased the lesion detectability but also reduced typical image artifacts pronounced in conventional FBP-based DBT.
28032817	The BRCA1 Ubiquitin ligase function sets a new trend for remodelling in DNA repair.	The protein product of the breast and ovarian cancer gene, BRCA1, is part of an obligate heterodimer with BARD1. Together these RING bearing proteins act as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. Several functions have been attributed to BRCA1 that contribute to genome integrity but which of these, if any, require this enzymatic function was unclear. Here we review recent studies clarifying the role of BRCA1 E3 ubiquitin ligase in DNA repair. Perhaps the most surprising finding is the narrow range of BRCA1 functions this activity relates to. Remarkably ligase activity promotes chromatin remodelling and 53BP1 positioning through the remodeller SMARCAD1, but the activity is dispensable for the cellular survival in response to cisplatin or replication stressing agents. Implications for therapy response and tumor susceptibility are discussed.
28030943	Is there a rationale for aggressive breast cancer liver metastases resections in Polish female patients? Analysis of overall survival following hepatic resection at a single centre in Poland.	INTRODUCTION: Breast cancer (BC) makes up nearly 26% of malignant tumours worldwide and is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in European women. With approximately 18,000 new cases of BC diagnosed in Polish women annually, breast cancer liver metastasis (BCLM) is respectively an increasing issue. Recent data found in literature indicates improved survival following liver resection with systemic therapy. OBJECTIVE: The aim of study was to evaluate surgical treatment in patients with isolated BCLM. MATERIALS AND METHOD: During 2009-2013, a retrospective study was undertaken and 30 cases analysed. From nearly 2,000 liver resections performed, 11 female patients at the mean age of 59.18 years with BCLM were qualified for surgery. RESULTS: The median time between primary and secondary treatment was 3.5 years (1-7). One patient (9.1%) presented an extrahepatic lesion - bone metastasis. The left lobe, right lobe and both lobes of the liver were affected, respectively, in 3 (27.3%), 4 (36.4%) and 4 (36.4%) patients. 5 patients (45.5%) presented single hepatic lesion, in contrast to the maximum number of lesions which equalled 6 in the right lobe. Average hospitalisation period was 13.27 days and discharge on the 11.3 postoperative day. One-year survival was 72.7% (8 patients); therefore, three-year survival was 36.4% (4 patients). CONCLUSIONS: Oncological centres should assess BCLM patients more openly and qualify them for hepatic resection along with adjuvant systemic treatment in order to improve overall survival. This, however, needs to be studied in a multicentre randomized trial.
28030917	Application of the BPCQ questionnaire to assess pain management in selected types of cancer.	INTRODUCTION: Pain is one of the most prevalent unpleasant sensation in people that may significantly lower the quality of life. More than a half of cancer patients suffer from various forms of pain, which becomes more frequent and intense as disease progresses. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to assess the degree of pain control in patients diagnosed with breast, lung, colorectal and prostate cancer. The analysis also covered the effect of socio-economic factors on pain management in patients with the above types of cancer. MATERIALS AND METHOD: The study included 902 patients treated at the Outpatient's Department of the Maria Sklodowska-Curie Memorial Cancer Center - Institute of Oncology in Warsaw in 2013. The patients consisted of those diagnosed with breast, lung, colorectal or prostate carcinoma. The Paper and Pencil Interview (PAPI) technique was applied. A questionnaire interview included demographic-type questions (socio-economic variables) and the Beliefs about Pain Control Questionnaire (BPCQ) test which measures the power of factors influencing pain control in patients. RESULTS: It was demonstrated that regarding beliefs in the source of pain control, patients attributed the highest importance to the power of doctors (mean value = 16.60) and the lowest to chance events (mean = 15.82). The internal factors are regarded as having the strongest influence by respondents diagnosed with colorectal or breast cancer. With regards to the locus of pain control, only the internal control of pain is diversified by the primary site. CONCLUSIONS: With regards to the source of pain management, only the internal control of pain is diversified by the primary site. The external factors were regarded as having the strongest influence by respondents diagnosed with colorectal or breast cancer. The major socio-economic variables differentiating the way in which pain control is perceived are education and net income-per-household-member. The results of analyses of individual groups of patients revealled strong correlations between the beliefs in the doctors' influence, and the beliefs in chance events and socio-economic factors.
28030783	Total tumor load assessed by one-step nucleic acid amplification assay as an intraoperative predictor for non-sentinel lymph node metastasis in breast cancer.	BACKGROUND: This study aimed to determine the relationship between CK19 mRNA copy number in sentinel lymph nodes (SLN) assessed by one-step nucleic acid amplification (OSNA) technique, and non-sentinel lymph nodes (NSLN) metastization in invasive breast cancer. A model using total tumor load (TTL) obtained by OSNA technique was also constructed to evaluate its predictability. METHODS: We conducted an observational retrospective study including 598 patients with clinically T1-T3 and node negative invasive breast cancer. Of the 88 patients with positive SLN, 58 patients fulfill the inclusion criteria. RESULTS: In the analyzed group 25.86% had at least one positive NSLN in axillary lymph node dissection. Univariate analysis showed that tumor size, TTL and number of SLN macrometastases were predictive factors for NSLN metastases. In multivariate analysis just the TTL was predictive for positive NSLN (OR 2.67; 95% CI 1.06-6.70; P = 0.036). The ROC curve for the model using TTL alone was obtained and an AUC of 0.805 (95% CI 0.69-0.92) was achieved. For TTL >1.9 x 105 copies/muL we got 73.3% sensitivity, 74.4% specificity and 88.9% negative predictive value to predict NSLN metastases. CONCLUSION: When using OSNA technique to evaluate SLN, NSLN metastases can be predicted intraoperatively. This prediction tool could help in decision for axillary lymph node dissection.
28030702	Effect of Longer-Interval vs Standard Dosing of Zoledronic Acid on Skeletal Events in Patients With Bone Metastases: A Randomized Clinical Trial.	Importance: Zoledronic acid, a third-generation aminobisphosphonate, reduces the incidence of skeletal-related events and pain in patients with bone metastases. The optimal dosing interval for zoledronic acid is uncertain. Objective: To determine whether zoledronic acid administered every 12 weeks is noninferior to zoledronic acid administered every 4 weeks. Design, Setting, Participants: Randomized, open-label clinical trial conducted at 269 academic and community sites in the United States. Patients (n = 1822) with metastatic breast cancer, metastatic prostate cancer, or multiple myeloma who had at least 1 site of bone involvement were enrolled between May 2009 and April 2012; follow-up concluded in April 2014. Interventions: Patients were randomized to receive zoledronic acid administered intravenously every 4 weeks (n = 911) vs every 12 weeks (n = 911) for 2 years. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary end point was the proportion of patients having at least 1 skeletal-related event (defined as clinical fracture, spinal cord compression, radiation to bone, or surgery involving bone) within 2 years after randomization and a between-group absolute difference of 7% as the noninferiority margin. Secondary end points included the proportion of patients with at least 1 skeletal-related event by disease type, pain as assessed by the Brief Pain Inventory (range, 0-10; higher scores indicate worse pain), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (range, 0-4; higher scores indicate worse disability), incidence of osteonecrosis of the jaw, kidney dysfunction, skeletal morbidity rate (mean number of skeletal-related events per year), and, in a subset of 553 patients, suppression of bone turnover (assessed by C-terminal telopeptide levels). Results: Among 1822 patients who were randomized (median age, 65 years; 980 [53.8%] women; 855 with breast cancer, 689 with prostate cancer, and 278 with multiple myeloma), 795 completed the study at 2 years. A total of 260 patients (29.5%) in the zoledronic acid every 4-week dosing group and 253 patients (28.6%) in the every 12-week dosing group experienced at least 1 skeletal-related event within 2 years of randomization (risk difference of -0.3% [1-sided 95% CI, -4% to infinity]; P < .001 for noninferiority). The proportions of skeletal-related events did not differ significantly between the every 4-week dosing group vs the every 12-week dosing group for patients with breast cancer, prostate cancer, or multiple myeloma. Pain scores, performance status scores, incidence of jaw osteonecrosis, and kidney dysfunction did not differ significantly between the treatment groups. Skeletal morbidity rates were numerically identical in both groups, but bone turnover was greater (C-terminal telopeptide levels were higher) among patients who received zoledronic acid every 12 weeks. Conclusions and Relevance: Among patients with bone metastases due to breast cancer, prostate cancer, or multiple myeloma, the use of zoledronic acid every 12 weeks compared with the standard dosing interval of every 4 weeks did not result in an increased risk of skeletal events over 2 years. This longer interval may be an acceptable treatment option. Trial Registration: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00869206.
28030476	Socioeconomic Disparities in Mortality Among Women With Incident Breast Cancer Before and After Implementation of Medicare Part D.	BACKGROUND: Breast cancer patients exhibit survival disparities based on socioeconomic status (SES). Disparities may be attributable to access to expensive oral endocrine agents. OBJECTIVES: Define recent socioeconomic disparities in breast cancer survival and determine whether these improved after implementation of the Medicare Part D program. DESIGN: Difference-in-difference natural experiment of women diagnosed and treated before or after implementation of Medicare Part D. SUBJECTS: Female Medicare beneficiaries with early-stage breast cancer: 54,772 diagnosed in 2001 and 46,371 in 2007. MEASURES: SES was based on Medicaid enrollment and zip code per capita income, all-cause mortality from Medicare, and cause of death from National Death Index. RESULTS: Among women diagnosed pre-Part D, 40.5% of poor beneficiaries had died within 5 years compared with 20.3% of high-income women (P<0.0001). Post-Part D, 33.6% of poor women and 18.4% of high-income women died by 5 years. After adjustment for potential confounders, improvement in all-cause mortality post-Part D was greater for poorer women compared with more affluent women (P=0.002). However, absolute improvement in breast cancer-specific mortality was 1.8%, 1.2%, and 0.8% (P=0.88 for difference in improvement by SES), respectively for poor, near-poor, and high-income women, whereas analogous improvement in mortality from other causes was 5.1%, 3.8%, and 0.9% (P=0.067 for difference in improvement by SES). CONCLUSIONS: Large survival disparities by SES exist among breast cancer patients. The Part D program successfully ameliorated SES disparities in all-cause mortality. However, improvement was concentrated in causes of death other than breast cancer, suggesting remaining gaps in care.
28029602	Use of both antegrade and retrograde internal mammary vessels in the bipedicled deep inferior epigastric perforator flap for unilateral breast reconstruction.	BACKGROUND: Autologous abdominal tissue transfer is a well-established method of breast reconstruction. The deep inferior epigastric perforator (DIEP) flap has the additional benefit of minimal donor site morbidity as it spares the muscle and fascia. Conventional DIEP flaps may not provide adequate volume in cases where the patient is thin, has midline abdominal scars, and/or has a large volume of tissue to replace. One solution is to use a bipedicled DIEP flap, incorporating all the available abdominal tissue. Bipedicled DIEP flaps have been described in a number of different configurations. The literature appears to favor intra-flap anastomosis, with a minimal exposition of two recipient vessels. It has been demonstrated that both the antegrade internal mammary artery (aIMA) and retrograde internal mammary artery (rIMA) are adequate recipient vessels. Here, the authors present a single-center experience with bipedicled DIEP flaps to both the aIMA and rIMA, showing their feasibility and safety. METHODS: A retrospective review of patients who underwent unilateral breast reconstruction using bipedicled DIEP flaps was performed to assess outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 20 patients who underwent unilateral breast reconstruction using a bipedicled DIEP flap were selected for this study. All of them were previously diagnosed with cancer. There were zero flap failure and zero instance of abdominal hernia or issue with abdominal wall functionality following the surgeries. CONCLUSIONS: The series of surgeries described in this study resulted in successful breast reconstruction in 20 women using a bipedicled DIEP flap. The results show that this approach allows for reconstruction in places where a conventional DIEP does not provide adequate volume, achieved safely, and does not increase morbidity. The bipedicled DIEP flap is a viable option for large-volume autologous breast reconstruction, providing ample tissue for successful reconstruction while also allowing for shorter recovery and limited donor site morbidity.
28029227	Physicochemical, Antioxidant, and Cytotoxic Properties of Xao Tam Phan (Paramignya trimera) Root Extract and Its Fractions.	Xao tam phan (Paramignya trimera (Oliv.) Guillaum) has been used as a medicinal plant for cancer prevention and treatment in recent years. The objective of this study was to determine the physicochemical, antioxidant, and cytotoxic properties of crude P. trimera root (PTR) extract and its fractions using MeOH as a solvent and microwave-assisted extraction as an advanced technique for preparation of the PTR extract. The results showed that the PTR extract had high contents of saponins, phenolics, flavonoids, and proanthocyanidins (7731.05 mg escin equiv. (EE), 238.13 mg gallic acid equiv. (GAE), 81.49 mg rutin equiv., and 58.08 mg catechin equiv. (CE)/g dried extract, resp.). Antioxidant activity of PTR extract was significantly higher (P < 0.05) than those of four its fractions and ostruthin, a key bioactive compound in the P. trimera, while potent cytotoxic capacity of PTR extract on various cancer cell lines in terms of MiaPaCa-2 (pancreas), HT29 (colon), A2780 (ovarian), H460 (lung), A431 (skin), Du145 (prostate), BE2-C (neuroblastoma), MCF-7 (breast), MCF-10A (normal breast), and U87, SJ-G2, SMA (glioblastoma) was observed with GI50 values ranging from 15 to 32 mug/ml. Cytotoxic potential on pancreatic cancer cells of PTR extract (100 - 200 mug/ml) was significantly higher (P < 0.05) than those of its four fractions (50 mug/ml), ostruthin (20 mug/ml) and gemcitabine (50 nm), and being comparable to a saponin-enriched extract from quillajia bark, a commercial product. Based on the results achieved, we can conclude that the PTR extract is a potential source for application of in the nutraceutical, medical, and pharmaceutical industries.
28028262	[Maintenance of Long-Term Stable Disease(SD)in Metastatic Breast Cancer with Eribulin - A Case Report of Long-Term SD in Japan].	This case report discusses a 48-year-old woman with metastatic breast cancer: T4c(10.5 cm)N2bM1,(OSS, LYM), stage IV, estrogen receptor(ER)(+), progesterone receptor(PgR)(+), human epidermal growth factor receptor-2(HER2) (-), and Ki-67 17.2%. Administration of eribulin was initiated after treatment with anthracycline and taxane. Thereafter, 28 courses of eribulin maintained a SD state for over a year and improved the quality of life(QOL). Eribulin is effective for both prolonging life and improving QOL, which are the main goals in the treatment of metastatic or recurrent cancer. Therefore, this evidence suggests that eribulin can be effective in various clinical situations.
28028261	[Two Cases of ER-Positive Postmenopausal Breast Cancer That Increased in Size during Neoadjuvant Hormone Therapy].	The first patient was a 62-year-old woman who was referred to our hospital with the complaint of a left breast tumor. She was diagnosed with invasive ductal carcinoma(T1N0M0, stage I). The tumor was ER-positive, PgR-negative, and HER2- negative. She was treated with toremifene, letrozole, and anastrozole as neoadjuvant hormone therapy for 4 months, but the tumor increased in size. The clinical response was judged as progressive disease, and a left partial mastectomy and axillary lymph node dissection were performed. Chemotherapy and radiotherapy were performed after surgery. The second patient was a 68-year-old woman who was referred to our hospital with the complaint of a right breast tumor. She was diagnosed as invasive ductal carcinoma(T1N0M0, stage I). The tumor was ER-positive, PgR-negative, and HER2-negative. She was treated with letrozole as neoadjuvant hormone therapy for 4 months, but the tumor increased in size. The clinical response was judged as progressive disease, and a right partial mastectomy and axillary lymph node dissection were performed. Chemotherapy and radiotherapy were performed after surgery. Although the evidence is still insufficient, with neoadjuvant hormone therapy for hormone-sensitive breast cancer, improved tumor shrinkage and breast conservation have been reported. We experienced two cases in which the tumor increased in size during neoadjuvant hormone therapy; however, even though these cases showed no apparent effect, chemotherapy may be effective in future cases.
28028256	[Treatment Continuation and Safety of Eribulin for the Treatment of Metastatic Breast Cancer].	The purpose of treatment for patients with metastatic breast cancer is to maintain the patient's quality of life(QOL)with continued treatment for as long as possible.Eribulin was approved in April 2011 for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer, further increasing the selection of therapies available for the management of this disease.The current study presents a retrospective review of 31 patients who received eribulin in our hospital, and analyzes the factors related to the continuation and safety of its use.The median treatment continuation was 114 days(range, 8-281 days), and the treatment involved an average of 5 courses(range, 1-13 courses).There were no significant differences in the continuation of eribulin with regard to the number of previous chemotherapy regimens and modifications undergone by the patients.Neutropenia accounted for 80.6% of adverse eventsBGrade 3; however, the recovery was rapid.The rates of peripheral neuropathy and liver function failures were 12.9% and 6.5%, respectively. These results suggest that eribulin can be continued to be administered with the aim of maintaining QOL, and the therapy can be adjusted according to the patient's situation and the occurrence of adverse events by reducing the dose and treatment delays.
28027766	Radiological assessment of the breast following enhancement with Macrolane: Managing the challenges.	Macrolane VRF(R), a biodegradable, stabilized hyaluronic acid gel, was used for breast enhancement 2008-2012. Similar to permanent implants, the presence of Macrolane gel may interfere with interpretation of mammography. This short communication aims to provide a guide to the appearance of Macrolane on radiology examination (including mammography, ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging) and aid selection of the most appropriate imaging modality to facilitate breast examination in women who have undergone Macrolane breast enhancement.
28027762	Pressure-standardised mammography does not affect visibility, contrast and sharpness of stable lesions.	INTRODUCTION: A recent technological development allows pressure-standardised mammography by personalizing the compression force to the breast size and firmness. The technique has been shown to reduce pain and compression variability between consecutive exams, but also results in a slightly thicker compressed breast during exposure. This raises the question whether visibility, contrast and sharpness of lesions are affected? METHODS: Four experienced radiologists compared 188 stable lesions and structures including (clusters of) calcifications, (oil) cysts and lymph nodes that were visible in mammograms obtained in 2009 with a pain-tolerance limited 18 daN target force compression protocol, and in 2014/2015 obtained with a 10kPa (75mmHg) pressure-standardised compression protocol. Observers were blinded for all DICOM metadata and rated which of the randomly ordered, side by side presented images had better lesion visibility, contrast and sharpness, or whether they saw no difference. They also indicated which overall image they preferred, if any, and whether the non-preferred image was still adequate. Statistical non-inferiority is concluded when the lower limit of the 95% confidence interval of the 4-rater averaged 'new protocol better' proportions exceed the non-inferiority limit of 0.463. RESULTS: In 2014/2015, the compressions were significantly milder, with on average 17% (mediolateral oblique) to 29% (craniocaudal) lower forces. Breasts remained on average 2.4% (1.4mm) thicker. Dose was significantly lower (6.5%), which is explained by glandular atrophy. The 95% confidence interval lower limits are 0.479 for visibility, 0.473 for contrast, 0.488 for sharpness and 0.486 for preference, all exceeding the non-inferiority limit. Of the 60 non-preferred mammograms, multiple observers found only five to be inadequate: 4 obtained with the force protocol and 1 with the pressure protocol. CONCLUSION: Pain-reduced mammography with 10kPa pressure-standardised compression has non-inferior visibility, contrast and sharpness for stable lesions compared to pain-tolerance limited 18daN target force compression.
28027759	Imaging features of automated breast volume scanner: Correlation with molecular subtypes of breast cancer.	OBJECTIVES: To investigate the correlation between the imaging features obtained by an automated breast volume scanner (ABVS) and molecular subtypes of breast cancer. METHODS: We examined 303 malignant breast tumours by ABVS for specific imaging features and by immunohistochemical analysis to determine the molecular subtype. ABVS imaging features, including retraction phenomenon, shape, margins, echogenicity, post-acoustic features, echogenic halo, and calcifications were analysed by univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses to determine the significant predictive factors of the molecular subtypes. RESULTS: By univariate logistic regression analysis, the predictive factors of the Luminal-A subtype (n=128) were retraction phenomenon (odds ratio [OR]=10.188), post-acoustic shadowing (OR=5.112), and echogenic halo (OR=3.263, P<0.001). The predictive factors of the Human-epidermal-growth-factor-receptor-2-amplified subtype (n=39) were calcifications (OR=6.210), absence of retraction phenomenon (OR=4.375), non-mass lesions (OR=4.286, P<0.001), absence of echogenic halo (OR=3.851, P=0.035), and post-acoustic enhancement (OR=3.641, P=0.008). The predictors for the Triple-Negative subtype (n=47) were absence of retraction phenomenon (OR=5.884), post-acoustic enhancement (OR=5.255, P<0.001), absence of echogenic halo (OR=4.138, P=0.002), and absence of calcifications (OR=3.363, P=0.001). Predictors for the Luminal-B subtype (n=89) had a relatively lower association (OR</=2.328). By multivariate logistic regression analysis, retraction phenomenon was the strongest independent predictor for the Luminal-A subtype (OR=9.063, P<0.001) when present and for the Triple-Negative subtype (OR=4.875, P<0.001) when absent. CONCLUSIONS: ABVS imaging features, especially retraction phenomenon, have a strong correlation with the molecular subtypes, expanding the scope of ultrasound in identifying breast cancer subtypes with confidence.
28027758	Role of pharmacokinetic parameters derived with high temporal resolution DCE MRI using simultaneous PET/MRI system in breast cancer: A feasibility study.	PURPOSE: To evaluate the reliability of pharmacokinetic parameters like Ktrans, Kep and ve derived through DCE MRI breast protocol using 3T Simultaneous PET/MRI (3Tesla Positron Emission Tomography/Magnetic Resonance Imaging) system in distinguishing benign and malignant lesions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: High temporal resolution DCE (Dynamic Contrast Enhancement) MRI performed as routine breast MRI for diagnosis or as a part of PET/MRI for cancer staging using a 3T simultaneous PET/MRI system in 98 women having 109 breast lesions were analyzed for calculation of pharmacokinetic parameters (Ktrans, ve, and Kep) at 60s time point using an in-house developed computation scheme. RESULTS: Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis revealed a cut off value for Ktrans, Kep, ve as 0.50, 2.59, 0.15 respectively which reliably distinguished benign and malignant breast lesions. Data analysis revealed an overall accuracy of 94.50%, 79.82% and 87.16% for Ktrans, Kep, ve respectively. Introduction of native T1 normalization with an externally placed phantom showed a higher accuracy (94.50%) than without native T1 normalization (93.50%) with an increase in specificity of 87% vs 84%. CONCLUSION: Overall the results indicate that reliable measurement of pharmacokinetic parameters with reduced acquisition time is feasible in a 3TMRI embedded PET/MRI system with reasonable accuracy and application may be extended to exploit the potential of simultaneous PET/MRI in further work on breast cancer.
28027751	A matrix of morphology and distribution of calcifications in the breast: Analysis of 849 vacuum-assisted biopsies.	OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this retrospective analysis was to evaluate the likelihood of malignancy in prospectively categorized BI-RADS 4 and BI-RADS 5 calcifications. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This analysis included 849 women who underwent vacuum biopsy for BI-RADS 4 (with the subgroups 4A, 4B and 4C) or BI-RADS 5 calcifications between February 2007 and May 2015. Calcifications were classified according to the morphology and distribution descriptors of the BI-RADS lexicon (BI-RADS 4th edition lexicon). A standardized scheme (matrix) was used to combine the characteristics of the grouped calcifications with the BI-RADS assessment category. RESULTS: Overall, 275/849 (32%) lesions were found to be malignant. 285/327/208/29 calcified lesions were prospectively classified as BI-RADS 4A/4B/4C/5 indicating a risk for malignancy of 16%/27%/55%/90%, respectively. The morphology descriptors predicted the risk for malignancy as follows: typically benign (n=55): 2%; indeterminate (n=676): 27%; typically malignant (n=118): 80%. The distribution descriptors correlated with a malignant histology as follows: diffuse (n=0); round or oval (n=261): 22%; regional (n=398): 33%; segmental (n=106): 42%; linear or branching (n=85): 55%. There was a significant difference between the descriptor categories (p<0.0001). CONCLUSION: A standard scheme combining the morphology and distribution characteristics proved to be a helpful tool in diagnosis of calcifications, bridging the gap between description and classification of these lesions.
28027535	Hyaluronic acid decorated pluronic P85 solid lipid nanoparticles as a potential carrier to overcome multidrug resistance in cervical and breast cancer.	This work aimed to develop hyaluronic acid (HA) decorated pluronic 85 (P85) coated solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN) loaded with paclitaxel (HA-PTX-P85-SLN) and to evaluate its potential to overcome drug resistance and to increase antitumor efficacy in mice bearing cervical and breast tumor. P85-Distearoyl Phosphoethanolamine (DSPE) was synthesized from P85 and DSPE by coupling in the presence of 1,10-carbonyldiimidazole (CDI) as a catalyst. The SLN were prepared by the hot homogenization technique and electrostatic interaction. PTX-loaded SLN was characterized for mean diameter, zeta potential, morphology, entrapment efficiency (EE), drug loading capacity (LC) and in vitro drug release. In vivo animal evaluation containing antitumor effect, pharmacokinetics and biodistribution were conducted in mice bearing cervical and breast tumor. The HA-PTX-P85-SLN showed a mean diameter of 160.3nm, negative zeta potential (-31.6mV), EE of 88.2%, and LC of 4.9%. PTX from HA-PTX-P85-SLN exhibited greater sustained drug release profiles compared free PTX. Pharmacokinetics results indicated that HA-PTX-P85-SLN exhibited a 5.5-fold increase in AUC in comparison to free PTX. Biodistribution results revealed that HA-PTX-P85-SLN exhibited higher tumor drug concentration compared with free PTX.
28027454	Apocrine carcinoma of the breast: A brief update on the molecular features and targetable biomarkers.	Apocrine carcinoma of the breast is a rare, primary breast cancer characterized by the apocrine morphology, estrogen receptor-negative and androgen receptor-positive profile with a frequent overexpression of Her-2/neu protein (~30%). Apart from the Her-2/neu target, advanced and/or metastatic apocrine carcinomas have limited treatment options. In this review, we briefly describe and discuss the molecular features and new theranostic biomarkers for this rare mammary malignancy. The importance of comprehensive profiling is highlighted due to synergistic and potentially antagonistic molecular events in the individual patients.
28026205	Preoperative Breast MRI: Surgeons' Patient Selection Patterns and Potential Bias in Outcomes Analyses.	OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to determine which patient- and tumor-related and clinical variables influence dedicated breast surgeons' and general surgeons' referrals for preoperative breast MRI for patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Surgeons who perform breast surgery responded to a survey from June 16, 2014, through August 11, 2014. Participants self-identified as breast or general surgeons and provided professional practice details. They used Likert scores (range, 1-7 with increasing likelihood to order MRI) to weigh numerous patient- and tumor-related and clinical variables. Mean likelihood scores were calculated and compared using a linear mixed model. A p </= 0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: Two hundred eighty-nine surveys from 154 (53%) breast surgeons and 135 (47%) general surgeons showed an overall likelihood to refer for patients with a BRCA mutation (mean Likert score, 6.17), familial (mean Likert score, 5.33) or personal (mean Likert score, 5.10) breast cancer history, extremely dense breasts (mean Likert score, 5.30), age younger than 40 years (mean Likert score, 5.24), axillary nodal involvement (mean Likert score, 6.22), tumor that is mammographically occult (mean Likert score, 5.62) or fixed to the pectoralis (mean Likert score, 5.49), tumor that is a candidate for neoadjuvant treatment (mean Likert score, 5.38), multifocal or multicentric disease (mean Likert score, 5.22), invasive lobular carcinoma (mean Likert score, 5.20), T3 (mean Likert score, 4.48) or T2 (mean Likert score, 4.41) tumor, triple-negative breast cancer (mean Likert score, 4.66), a patient who is a candidate for mastectomy requesting breast conservation therapy (mean Likert score, 5.27), and radiologists' recommendations (mean Likert score, 5.19). Across all patient ages, breast surgeons referred more often than did general surgeons (mean Likert score, 4.32 vs 3.92; p = 0.03), especially for patients with BRCA mutation (mean Likert score, 6.39 vs 5.93; p = 0.01) and tumors smaller than 1 cm (mean Likert score, 3.84 vs 3.40; p = 0.002). Breast surgeons referred less often than did general surgeons for multifocal or multicentric disease (mean Likert score, 5.02 vs 5.44; p = 0.001). Breast surgeons and general surgeons similarly weighed other variables. CONCLUSION: Preoperative breast MRI referral trended with certain higher risk patient- and tumor-related and clinical variables and were nonuniform between the breast surgeons and general surgeon cohorts. Selection bias could affect outcomes analyses for preoperative breast MRI.
28025960	Metastatic spread of systemic neoplasms to central nervous system tumors: review of the literature and case presentation of esophageal carcinoma metastatic to meningioma.	Metastatic spread of a systemic neoplasm to a central nervous system malignancy is a rare but well-documented phenomenon. Over 100 case reports of tumor-to-tumor spread involving the central nervous system have been described since the first report in 1930. Overwhelmingly, intracranial meningioma represents the most common recipient tumor, while breast and lung are the first and second most common donor malignancies, respectively. The propensity for meningiomas to harbor metastatic lesions has been attributed to cell-to-cell adhesion molecules, favorable metabolic environment as well as hormonal and mechanical factors. We distinguish the concepts of true "tumor-to-tumor metastasis" and "tumor collision" and discuss potential non-invasive diagnostic modalities that may aid in preoperatively identifying intracranial lesions harboring distal metastasis. We present the first incidence, to our knowledge, of metastatic esophageal carcinoma spread to intracranial meningioma..
28025124	Major triterpenoids in Chinese hawthorn "Crataegus pinnatifida" and their effects on cell proliferation and apoptosis induction in MDA-MB-231 cancer cells.	The cytotoxicity and antiproliferative effect of phytochemicals presenting in the fruits of Chinese hawthorn (Crataegus pinnatifida) were evaluated. Shanlihong (Crataegus pinnatifida Bge. var. major N.E.Br.) variety possessed significant levels of flavonoids and triterpenoids, and showed potent antiproliferative effect against HepG2, MCF-7 and MDA-MB- 231 human cancer cells lines. Triterpenoids-enriched fraction (S9) prepared by Semi-preparative HPLC, and its predominant ingredient ursolic acid (UA) demonstrated remarkably antiproliferative activities for all the tested cancer cell lines. DNA flow cytometric analysis showed that S9 fraction and UA significantly induced G1 arrest in MDA-MB-231 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Western blotting analysis revealed that S9 fraction and UA significantly induced PCNA, CDK4, and Cyclin D1 downregulation in MDA-MB-231 cells, followed by p21Waf1/Cip1 up-regulation. Additionally, flow cytometer and DNA ladder assays indicated that S9 fraction and UA significantly induced MDA-MB-231 cells apoptosis. Mitochondrial death pathway was involved in this apoptosis as significantly induced caspase-9 and caspase-3 activation. These results suggested that triterpenoids-enriched fraction and UA exhibited antiproliferative activity through the cell cycle arrest and apoptosis induction, and was majorly responsible for the potent anticancer activity of Chinese hawthorn.
28024847	Dark-Field Imaging: Recent developments and potential clinical applications.	This paper describes an X-ray phase contrast imaging technique using analyzer-based optics called X-ray Dark-Field Imaging that has been under development for the past 10years. We describe the theory behind XDFI, the X-ray optics required for implementing it in practice, and algorithms used for 2D, 2.5D, and 3D image reconstruction. The XDFI optical chain consists of an asymmetrically cut, Bragg-type monochromator-collimator that provides a planar monochromatic X-ray beam, a positioning stage for the specimens, a Laue-case angle analyzer, and one or two cameras to capture the dark and bright field images. We demonstrate the soft-tissue discrimination capabilities of XDFI by reconstructing images with absorption and phase contrast. By using a variety of specimens such as breast tissue with cancer, joints with articular cartilage, ex-vivo human eye specimen, and others, we show that refraction-based contrast derived from XDFI is more effective in characterizing anatomical features, articular pathology, and neoplastic disease than conventional absorption-based images. For example, XDFI of breast tissue can discriminate between the normal and diseased terminal duct lobular unit, and between invasive and in-situ cancer. The final section of this paper is devoted to potential future developments to enable clinical and histo-pathological applications of this technique.
28017458	Specific adverse events are associated with response to exemestane therapy in postmenopausal breast cancer patients: Results from the TEAMIIA study (BOOG2006-04).	PURPOSE: In the adjuvant setting, specific adverse events (AEs) such as vasomotor symptoms (VMS) and musculoskeletal AEs are associated with relapse-free survival in aromatase inhibitor (AI)-treated patients. In the neoadjuvant setting, specific AEs may be associated with tumor response to AIs as well. METHODS: Between 2007 and 2012, 107 patients participated in the prospective TEAMIIA trial, a prospective, phase II trial investigating 6 months of neoadjuvant exemestane in patients with strongly ER-positive breast cancer. Radiological response (>/=30% decrease in tumor size) was studied in relation to VMSs and MSAEs. Pearson's Chi-Square tests and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to evaluate of statistical significance (p < 0.05). RESULTS: Out of 102 patients 26 patients (25.4%) experienced at least one episode of VMS and 27 patients (26.4%) experienced MSAE. Out of 240 reported adverse events, 71 were specific AEs (40 MSAEs, 31 VMSs). Radiological response was greater in patients who reported VMSs compared to patients who did not (70.8% vs. 49.3%, multivariate OR 2.91, 95% C.I. 1.03-8.26, P = 0.045). No significant advantage towards better response was observed in patients who experienced MSAEs (60.0% vs. 53.3%, univariate OR 1.33, 95% C.I. 0.53-3.38, P = 0.545). CONCLUSION: VMSs are associated with tumor response to neoadjuvant exemestane and may be useful for predicting treatment outcomes of AI treatment at an early stage in patients treated with neoadjuvant AIs.
28017260	Comparison of dissection with harmonic scalpel and conventional bipolar electrocautery in deep inferior epigastric perforator flap surgery: A consecutive cohort study.	Reduced tissue damage is a theoretical advantage of using an ultrasonic harmonic scalpel. We hypothesized that the harmonic scalpel would outperform electrocautery in deep inferior epigastric perforator flap surgery, possibly resulting in a shorter operative time and reduced postoperative drainage and pain. Between January and August 2015, 24 consecutive patients were assigned to immediate deep inferior epigastric perforator flap elevation (12 for bipolar electrocautery and 12 for harmonic scalpel). The main outcome variables were total operative time, flap elevation time (starting from the fascia incision), and drainage volume. We compared the number of perforators isolated and the Moon and Taylor classification of the pedicle. Data were tested for normality using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test before analysis. Continuous variables were compared by Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Data were analyzed using the statistical software SAS, version 9.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA). Both groups were comparable with respect to clinical characteristics (mean age, body mass index, and flap weights). There was a statistically significant difference in the operative time between dissection with the harmonic scalpel and electrocautery (305.2 vs. 380.3 min, respectively, p = 0.002). The flap elevation time was reduced, particularly when using the harmonic scalpel where its usage seems crucial for dissecting deep inferior epigastric perforators (59.8 vs. 145.9 min, respectively, p < 0.0001). No statistical difference was observed in the drainage volume and length of hospital stay between the groups. We conclude that the harmonic scalpel may be more reliable and efficient as an alternative to electrocautery.
28013032	Radiation therapy for malignant phyllodes tumor of the breast: An analysis of SEER data.	PURPOSE: Malignant phyllodes tumor of the breast (MPTB) accounts for less than 1% of whole breast neoplasm. Surgery is regarded as the primary treatment of choice in patients with MPTB, but the necessity of postoperative radiation therapy (RT) has been a subject of debate. Our aim was to evaluate effects of postoperative RT for MPTB using a large population database. METHODS: Using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program (SEER) database (1983-2013), clinico-pathologic prognostic factors were evaluated. Postoperative RT, tumor extent, grade, and lymph node (LN) metastasis were included in the analysis. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regressions were performed to evaluate prognostic power of variables on cancer specific survival (CSS). RESULTS: A total of 1974 patients with MPTB were reviewed. Of these, 825 (42%) and 1149 (58%) patients underwent mastectomy and breast conserving surgery (BCS), respectively. In each group, 130 (16%) and 122 (11%) patients received postoperative RT. For patients with adverse risk factors including high grade and large tumor size, postoperative RT was more likely to be performed. In multivariate analysis, age, ethnicity, tumor size, tumor extension and LN status were correlated with prognosis in mastectomy group, while postoperative RT did not affect CSS. In BCS group, age and grade were significant prognostic factors on CSS, meanwhile postoperative RT did not impact CSS in multivariate analysis. CONCLUSION: Although patients with more adverse prognostic factors underwent postoperative RT, RT groups were not inferior to non-RT group on CSS regardless of surgery (mastectomy or BCS).
28012411	Omitting radiation therapy in women with triple-negative breast cancer leads to worse breast cancer-specific survival.	PURPOSE: To examine locoregional recurrence (LRR) and breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS) after breast-conserving therapy (BCT) or mastectomy (ME) with or without radiation therapy (RT) in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). MATERIAL & METHODS: We identified non-metastatic TNBC cases from a single institution database. BCT, ME with RT (ME + RT) and ME only were compared with respect to LRR and BCSS. Cox regression models were used to analyze the association between prognostic factors and outcome. RESULTS: 439 patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Median follow-up was 10.2 years (interquartile range 7.9; 12.4 years). Patients in the BCT (n = 239), ME + RT (n = 116) and ME only (n = 84) group differed with respect to age, pT, pN, lymphovascular invasion, lymph node dissection and chemotherapy administration. Ten-year LRR rates were seven percent, three percent and eight percent for the BCT, ME + RT and ME only group, respectively. pN was associated with LRR. In multivariable analysis LRR were significantly lower in the ME + RT group compared to the BCT and the ME only group (p 0.037 and 0.020, respectively). Ten year BCSS was 87%, 84% and 75% for the BCT, ME + RT and ME only group, respectively. pT, pN, lymph node dissection, lymphovascular invasion and the administration of chemotherapy were associated with BCSS. In multivariable analysis BCSS was significantly lower in the ME only group compared to the BCT group and the ME + RT group (p 0.047 and 0.003, respectively). CONCLUSION: TNBC patients treated with ME without adjuvant RT showed significant lower BCSS compared to patients treated with BCT or ME + RT and significant more LRR compared to ME + RT when corrected for known clinicopathological prognostic factors.
28012410	The effect of marital status on breast cancer-related outcomes in women under 65: A SEER database analysis.	BACKGROUND: Marital status is strongly associated with improved health and longevity. Being married has been shown to be positively associated with survival in patients with multiple different types of malignancy; however, little is known about the relationship between marital status and breast cancer in younger women. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of marital status on diagnosis, and survival of women under the age of 65 with breast cancer. METHODS: The SEER 18 regions database was used to identify women between the ages of 25-64 diagnosed with invasive breast cancer in the years 2004-2009. Logistic regression was used to predict later stage diagnosis by marital status and Cox proportional hazards models were used to compare breast cancer-related and all-cause survival by marital status classification. Models were stratified by AJCC stage. RESULTS: After adjusting for age, race, and ER status, unmarried women were 1.18 times more likely to be diagnosed at a later stage than married women (95% CI 1.15, 1.20). In adjusted analysis unmarried women were more likely to die of breast cancer and more likely to die of all causes than married women across all AJCC stages. CONCLUSIONS: Younger unmarried women with breast cancer may benefit from additional counseling, psychosocial support and case management at the time of diagnosis to ensure their overall outcomes are optimized.
28012397	miR-381 inhibited breast cancer cells proliferation, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and metastasis by targeting CXCR4.	BACKGROUND: MicroRNAs act as posttranscriptional regulators of gene expression in many biological processes, which played a vital role in regulation cancer cells epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and metastasis. The deregulation of miR-381 has been identified in breast cancer. However, the role and mechanism of miR-381 in breast cancer have not been completely unexplored. METHODS: Total RNA was extracted from the tissues of 27 patients with breast cancer and two breast cancer cell lines, respectively. The expression levels of miR-381 were examined by quantitative real-time PCR. The stable overexpress or silence miR-381 expression cells lines and control cells line were constructed by lentivirus infection. Subsequently, cell proliferation, cell migration, invasion assay and western blot assay were performed to detect the biological functions of miR-381 in vitro. Moreover, a luciferase reporter assay was conducted to confirm target associations. RESULTS: In this study, we validated the lower expression of miR-381 in breast cancer tissues than their adjacent non-neoplastic tissues in 27 breast cancer patients. The result also showed that miR-381 was lowly expressed in breast cancer cell lines MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 than human epithelial cell line MCF-10A. The miR-381 expression was significantly up-regulated under exogenous miRNA-381 treatment in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR. The results also indicated that an inverse correlation existed between miR-381 expression level and breast cancer cell proliferation, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and metastasis. Furthermore, miR-381 was predicted as a regulatory miRNA of CXCR4 in breast cancer, and the data analysis revealed that there was a negatively relationship between miR-381 and CXCR4 expression in breast cancer tissues from the patients. miR-381 played an important role in breast cancer cells proliferation, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and metastasis by targeting CXCR4. CONCLUSIONS: This present study revealed that miR-381 might be considered as a novel therapeutic target for breast cancer treatment.
28012317	A mass spectrometry-based multiplex SNP genotyping by utilizing allele-specific ligation and strand displacement amplification.	We herein describe a new mass spectrometry-based method for multiplex SNP genotyping by utilizing allele-specific ligation and strand displacement amplification (SDA) reaction. In this method, allele-specific ligation is first performed to discriminate base sequence variations at the SNP site within the PCR-amplified target DNA. The primary ligation probe is extended by a universal primer annealing site while the secondary ligation probe has base sequences as an overhang with a nicking enzyme recognition site and complementary mass marker sequence. The ligation probe pairs are ligated by DNA ligase only at specific allele in the target DNA and the resulting ligated product serves as a template to promote the SDA reaction using a universal primer. This process isothermally amplifies short DNA fragments, called mass markers, to be analyzed by mass spectrometry. By varying the sizes of the mass markers, we successfully demonstrated the multiplex SNP genotyping capability of this method by reliably identifying several BRCA mutations in a multiplex manner with mass spectrometry.
28012015	Modulation of cell death in human colorectal and breast cancer cells through a manganese chelate by involving GSH with intracellular p53 status.	Chemotherapy is central to current treatment modality especially for advanced and metastatic colorectal and breast cancers. Targeting the key molecular events of the neoplastic cells may open a possibility to treat cancer. Although some improvements in understanding of colorectal and breast cancer treatment have been recorded, the involvement of glutathione (GSH) and dependency of p53 status on the modulation of GSH-mediated treatment efficacy have been largely overlooked. Herein, we tried to decipher the underlying mechanism of the action of Mn-N-(2-hydroxyacetophenone) glycinate (MnNG) against differential p53 status bearing Hct116, MCF-7, and MDA-MB-468 cells on the backdrop of intracellular GSH level and reveal the role of p53 status in modulating GSH-dependant abrogation of MnNG-induced apoptosis in these cancer cells. Present study discloses that MnNG targets specifically wild-type-p53 expressing Hct116 and MCF-7 cells by significantly depleting both cytosolic, mitochondrial GSH, and modulating nuclear GSH through Glutathione reductase and Glutamate-cysteine ligase depletion that may in turn induce p53-mediated intrinsic apoptosis in them. Thus GSH addition abrogates p53-mediated apoptosis in wild-type-p53 expressing cells. GSH addition also overrides MnNG-induced modulation of phase II detoxifying parameters in them. However, GSH addition partially replenishes the down-regulated or modulated GSH pool in cytosol, mitochondria, and nucleus, and relatively abrogates MnNG-induced intrinsic apoptosis in p53-mutated MDA-MB-468 cells. On the contrary, although MnNG induces significant cell death in p53-null Hct116 cells, GSH addition fails to negate MnNG-induced cell death. Thus p53 status with intracellular GSH is critical for the modulation of MnNG-induced apoptosis.
28012014	Analysis of the expression of human bitter taste receptors in extraoral tissues.	The 25 bitter taste receptors (T2Rs) in humans perform a chemosensory function. However, very little is known about the level of expression of these receptors in different tissues. In this study, using nCounter gene expression we analyzed the expression patterns of human TAS2R transcripts in cystic fibrosis bronchial epithelial (CuFi-1), normal bronchial epithelial (NuLi-1), airway smooth muscle (ASM), pulmonary artery smooth muscle (PASM), mammary epithelial, and breast cancer cells. Our results suggest a specific pattern of TAS2R expression with TAS2R3, 4, 5, 10, 13, 19, and 50 transcripts expressed at moderate levels and TAS2R14 and TAS2R20 (or TASR49) at high levels in the various tissues analyzed. This pattern of expression is mostly independent of tissue origin and the pathological state, except in cancer cells. To elucidate the expression at the protein level, we pursued flow cytometry analysis of select T2Rs from CuFi-1 and NuLi-1 cells. The expression levels observed at the gene level by nCounter analysis correlate with the protein levels for the T2Rs analyzed. Next, to assess the functionality of the expressed T2Rs in these cells, we pursued functional assays measuring intracellular calcium mobilization after stimulation with the bitter compound quinine. Using PLC inhibitor, U-73122, we show that the calcium mobilized in these cells predominantly takes place through the Quinine-T2R-Galphabetagamma-PLC pathway. This report will accelerate studies aimed at analyzing the pathophysiological function of T2Rs in different extraoral tissues.
28011513	Tumescent Anesthesia in Skin- and Nipple-sparing Mastectomy: Results of a Prospective Clinical Study.	BACKGROUND: The tumescent mastectomy technique has been used to facilitate dissection of subcutaneous tissue and mammary gland in order to reduce intraoperative bleeding and speed the operation. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A prospective clinical study was performed on 30 female patients undergoing immediate breast reconstructions after skin-sparing mastectomy (SSM) or nipple-sparing mastectomy (NSM) in order to assess early postoperative complications, pain, and final esthetic outcome of skin flaps related to tumescent anesthesia (TA). RESULTS: TA significantly speeded-up the operative procedure (131+/-49.99 vs. 180.5+/-67.15 min; p=0.03) achieving less skin damage compared to patients who did not have TA (p=0.045); moreover, no significant difference occurred with regard to the length of in-hospital stay and overall lymphatic drainage. CONCLUSION: The length of the operation as well as the final cosmetic outcome of skin flaps was significantly improved due to TA, with no appreciable side-effects.
28011497	Gemcitabine and S-1 Induction Chemotherapy Followed by Chemoradiotherapy for Locally Advanced Pancreatic Cancers.	BACKGROUND: Gemcitabine and S-1 are drugs commonly used for treating locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC). However, the safety and efficacy of combination of these agents for induction chemotherapy (IC) followed by chemoradiotherapy are not well-defined. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifteen patients with LAPC (IC-CRT group) were treated with gemcitabine and S-1 IC, followed by S-1 chemoradiotherapy. The clinical outcomes were compared to a cohort of 38 patients who received chemoradiotherapy alone (CRT group). RESULTS: Disease control rates in the CRT and IC-CRT groups were 84% and 93%, respectively (p=0.024). The median time of disease progression was 10.8 and 15.4 months in the CRT and IC-CRT group, respectively (p=0.043). The median overall survival time was longer in the IC-CRT group compared to CRT (23.4 vs. 17.3 months), but this increase was not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: Gemcitabine and S-1 combination chemotherapy, followed by CRT, is a promising IC regimen for treating LAPC.
28011488	Different Expression Patterns of CXCR4, CCR7, Maspin and FOXP3 in Luminal Breast Cancers and Their Sentinel Node Metastases.	AIM: Luminal A breast cancers (BC) represent low-risk tumors conferring better outcome than luminal B and human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2)-positive or triple-negative tumors. One reason for the heterogeneous outcome among patients with luminal BC is the variation in cell proliferation. As chemokine receptors and tumor suppressors show potential for estimation of infiltration to regional lymph nodes, we aimed to compare differently sized sentinel node metastases with their primary tumors (PT). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We compared 29 BCs of luminal subtype A and 23 of subtype B (Ki-67 cut off at 14%) by immunohistochemistry for the chemokine receptors C-X-C chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4), C-C-chemokine receptor 7 (CCR7), the tumor suppressor Maspin and the regulatory T-cell immunosuppressor forkhead box protein 3 (FOXP3) between PTs and their metastases of different size. RESULTS: Expression of CXCR4 was low in luminal A type tumors, and CCR7 and FOXP3 expression were high in luminal B type cancer. CXCR4 expression significantly positively correlated with CCR7 both in PTs and metastases. Most Maspin-positive PTs became negative in the metastases. The PTs for all Maspin-positive metastases were luminal B type. CONCLUSION: High CXCR4 expression in PTs was found to be associated with luminal A type tumor, suggesting more favorable outcome. In contrast, CCR7 and FOXP3 expressions in PTs represented luminal B tumors, pointing to more aggressive tumor behavior. Maspin expression did not differ between luminal types.
28011479	The Effects of Petroselinum Crispum on Estrogen Receptor-positive Benign and Malignant Mammary Cells (MCF12A/MCF7).	BACKGROUND: Phytoestrogens have controversial effects on hormone-dependent tumors. Herein we investigated the effects of parsley root extract (PCE) on DNA synthesis performance, metabolic activity and cytotoxicity in malignant and benign breast cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The PCE was prepared and analyzed by mass spectrometry. MCF7 and MCF12A cells were incubated with various concentrations of PCE and analyzed for DNA synthesis performance, metabolic activity and cytotoxicity by BrdU proliferation, MTT and LDH assays, respectively. RESULTS: PCE was found to contain a substantial ratio of lignans. At a concentration range of 0.01 mug/ml-100 mug/ml the LDH assay analysis showed no significant cytotoxicity of PCE in both cell lines. However, at 500 mug/ml PCE's cytotoxicity was well over 70% of total cell population in both cell lines. According to the BrdU proliferation assay analysis, PCE demonstrated significant DNA synthesis inhibition of up to 80% at concentrations of 10, 50, 100 and 500 mug/ml in both cell lines. Based on the MTT assay analysis, only at a concentration of 500 mug/ml, PCE demonstrated a statistically significant inhibition of cellular metabolic activity of 63% in MCF7 and 75% in MCF12A of their respective normal capacity. CONCLUSION: PCE showed antiproliferative effects in MCF7 and MCF12A cells. Further investigation is required to determine whether this effect can be solely attributed to its phytoestrogens.
28011475	A Novel NHERF1 Mutation in Human Breast Cancer and Effects on Malignant Progression.	Na+/H+ exchanger regulatory factor 1 (NHERF1) has been reported to interact with post-synaptic density protein/Drosophila disc large tumour suppressor/zonula occludens 1 protein (PDZ) binding proteins by its two PDZ domains. These associations have effects on cellular signal transductions. NHERF1 has also been indicated as a cancer-related gene in several solid tumour types. We identified a novel mutation (A190D), of the PDZ2 domain of NHERF1 in breast cancer tissues. NHERF1 A190D mutation abolished NHERF1 modulation of proliferation and migration. In this study, we found that NHERF1 A190D mutation increased nuclear localisation of the protein compared to wild-type NHERF1. It has been reported that YES-associated protein (YAP) interacts with NHERF1. Here we found that NHERF1 A190D mutation increased the binding affinity between NHERF1 and YAP, which inhibited the phosphorylation of YAP. These data suggest that wild-type NHERF1 acts as a tumour suppressor, while NHERF1 A190D mutation abolishes the tumour-suppressive effect in cancer cells, due to A190D mutation-mediated nuclear NHERF1 translocation and induction of YAP phosphorylation.
28011473	Comparison of Tumor Recurrence After Resection of Highly- and Poorly-Metastatic Triple-negative Breast Cancer in Orthotopic Nude-Mouse Models.	BACKGROUND: Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), defined by the absence of receptors for estrogen, progesterone and human epithelial receptor 2, is a recalcitrant disease in need of effective therapy. We previously isolated highly-metastatic variants of the human TNBC cell line MDA-MB-231 using serial orthotopic implantation in nude mice. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In the present report, we compared local and metastatic recurrence in lymph nodes in orthotopic nude-mouse models after bright-light surgery (BLS) of tumors from highly-metastatic variants or poorly-metastatic parental MDA-MB-231-RFP cells. Orthotopic tumors from parental MDA-MB-231 or highly-metastatic MDA-MB-231 were resected under bright light similar to an operating room. RESULTS: After resection of primary tumors, local recurrence from highly-metastatic MDA-MB-231 cells grew more rapidly than did parental MDA-MB-231 cells. Lymph-node metastasis from highly-metastatic MDA-MB-231 cells occurred after primary tumor resection much more extensively than after parental MDA-MB-231 tumors were resected. CONCLUSION: The results of the present report suggest that conventional surgery under bright light was unable to control highly-metastatic compared with poorly-metastatic MDA-MB-231 TNBC.
28011471	Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors: An Attractive Therapeutic Strategy Against Breast Cancer.	With a lifetime risk estimated to be one in eight in industrialized countries, breast cancer is the most frequent type of cancer among women worldwide. Patients are often treated with anti-estrogens, but it is common that some tumors develop resistance to therapy. The causation and progression of cancer is controlled by epigenetic processes, so there is an ongoing interest in research into mechanisms, genes and signaling pathways associating carcinogenesis with epigenetic modulation of gene expression. Given the fact that histone deacetylases (HDACs) have a great impact on chromatin remodeling and epigenetics, their inhibitors have become a very interesting field of research. AIM: This review focused on the use of HDAC inhibitors as anticancer treatment and explains the mechanisms of therapeutic effects on breast cancer. We anticipate further clinical benefits of this new class of drugs, both as single agents and in combination therapy. Molecules such as suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid, trichostatin A, suberoylbis-hydroxamic acid, panobinostat, entinostat, valproic acid, sodium butyrate, SK7041, FTY720, N-(2-hydroxyphenyl)-2-propylpentanamide, Scriptaid, YCW1, santacruzamate A and ferrocenyl have shown promising antitumor effects against breast cancer. HDAC inhibitors consists an attractive field for targeted therapy against breast cancer. Future therapeutic strategies will include combination of HDAC inhibitors and chemotherapy or other inhibitors, in order to target multiple oncogenic signaling pathways. More trials are needed.
28011074	Patient database analysis of fulvestrant 500 mg in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer: A European perspective.	INTRODUCTION: Clinical guidelines recommend that patients with hormone receptor (HR)-positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC) should be preferentially treated with endocrine therapy. Fulvestrant (a selective estrogen receptor degrader) is approved for use in these patients following relapse after, or relapse or progression during, antiestrogen therapy. This descriptive study analyzed European treatment patterns for HR-positive MBC in real-world clinical practice. METHODS: The IMS Oncology Analyzer (OA), a retrospective cancer treatment database reporting physician-entered patient case histories, was used to identify records for postmenopausal women with HR-positive MBC from April 1, 2004 to June 30, 2013 in France, Germany, Italy, and Spain. Treatments were allocated to mutually exclusive categories (fulvestrant-containing, aromatase inhibitor [AI]-containing, tamoxifen-containing, or chemotherapy-containing regimens) and assessed by line of therapy for MBC. Fulvestrant use was also assessed pre- and post-2010 (when fulvestrant 500 mg dosing was approved). RESULTS: In total, 27,214 eligible patients were included (France: 6801; Germany: 6852; Italy: 7061; Spain: 6500). Chemotherapy-based regimens were the most common first-line treatments for MBC across all countries. Across countries, the proportion of patients initiating on each treatment category ranged from: chemotherapy, 57.5-70.4%; AI, 23.5-30.1%; tamoxifen, 2.7-9.8%; fulvestrant 0.8-2.6%. When administered, fulvestrant was usually given as first- or second-line treatment. Post-2010, more patients received fulvestrant 500 mg than fulvestrant 250 mg in France, Germany, and Spain; in Italy, more patients continued to receive fulvestrant 250 mg. CONCLUSION: Most patients with HR-positive MBC receive chemotherapy over endocrine therapy; fulvestrant constitutes a small proportion of treatments for such patients.
28010934	Facilitating shared decision-making with breast augmentation patients: Acceptability of the PEGASUS intervention.	BACKGROUND: PEGASUS is an intervention to facilitate shared decision-making by helping prospective patients consider their expectations of surgery, so that surgeons have a clear understanding of their individual goals. To date, shared decision-making interventions within aesthetic surgery are lacking. The present mixed methods study therefore explored the acceptability of implementing PEGASUS into routine private practice with breast augmentation patients and aesthetic providers. METHOD: Seventeen women presenting for breast augmentation surgery from three practices received the PEGASUS intervention pre-operatively and completed a process evaluation post-operatively. Semi-structured interviews exploring 3 aesthetic providers' experiences of using PEGASUS were subjected to a thematic analysis, whilst a content analysis was conducted on the 77 goals identified by patients. RESULTS: The majority of patients reported that the PEGASUS intervention was relevant, helpful and useful, and they felt comfortable during it. Qualitatively, patients and aesthetic providers found that PEGASUS enabled them to reflect on and discuss about their expectations from surgery. Aesthetic providers discussed some of the issues and barriers associated with implementing PEGASUS in routine private practice, factors that must be considered prior to further evaluation. CONCLUSION: This study provides preliminary support for the acceptability of PEGASUS to breast augmentation patients and to aesthetic providers working in the private sector.
28009814	A Novel Pathogenic BRCA1 Splicing Variant Produces Partial Intron Retention in the Mature Messenger RNA.	About 10% of all breast cancers arise from hereditary mutations that increase the risk of breast and ovarian cancers; and about 25% of these are associated with the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes. The identification of BRCA1/BRCA2 mutations can enable physicians to better tailor the clinical management of patients; and to initiate preventive measures in healthy carriers. The pathophysiological significance of newly identified variants poses challenges for genetic counseling. We characterized a new BRCA1 variant discovered in a breast cancer patient during BRCA1/2 screening by next-generation sequencing. Bioinformatic predictions; indicating that the variant is probably pathogenetic; were verified using retro-transcription of the patient's RNA followed by PCR amplifications performed on the resulting cDNA. The variant causes the loss of a canonic donor splice site at position +2 in BRCA1 intron 21; and consequently the partial retention of 156 bp of intron 21 in the patient's transcript; which demonstrates that this novel BRCA1 mutation plays a pathogenetic role in breast cancer. These findings enabled us to initiate appropriate counseling and to tailor the clinical management of this family. Lastly; these data reinforce the importance of studying the effects of sequence variants at the RNA level to verify their potential role in disease onset.
28009422	Position paper of the Italian Association of Medical Oncology on early palliative care in oncology practice (Simultaneous Care).	One of the priorities of personalized medicine regards the role of early integration of palliative care with cancer-directed treatments, called simultaneous care. This article, written by the Italian Association of Medical Oncology (AIOM) Simultaneous and Continuous Care Task Force, represents the position of Italian medical oncologists about simultaneous care, and is the result of a 2-step project: a Web-based survey among medical oncologists and a consensus conference. We present the opinion of more than 600 oncologists who helped formulate these recommendations. This document covers 4 main aspects of simultaneous care: 1) ethical, cultural, and relational aspects of cancer and implications for patient communication; 2) training of medical oncologists in palliative medicine; 3) research on the integration between cancer treatments and palliative care; and 4) organizational and management models for the realization of simultaneous care. The resulting recommendations highlight the role of skills and competence in palliative care along with implementation of adequate organizational models to accomplish simultaneous care, which is considered a high priority of AIOM in order to grant the best quality of life for cancer patients and their families.
28008248	Coalescence of functional gold and monodisperse silver nanoparticles mediated by black Panax ginseng Meyer root extract.	A rapid biological synthesis of multifunctional gold nanoparticle (AuNp) and monodisperse silver nanoparticle (AgNp) was achieved by an aqueous extract of black Panax ginseng Meyer root. The physicochemical transformation into black ginseng (BG) greatly enhanced the pharmacological activities of white ginseng and its minor ginsenoside content. The optimal temperature conditions and kinetics of bioreduction were investigated. Formation of BG-AuNps and BG-AgNps was verified by ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometry at 548 and 412 nm, respectively. The biosynthesized BG-AgNps were spherical and monodisperse with narrow distribution, while BG-AuNps were icosahedral-shaped and moderately polydisperse. Synthesized nanoparticles exhibited long-term stability in buffers of pH 7.0-8.0 and biological media (5% bovine serum albumin) at an ambient temperature and at 37 degrees C. BG-AgNps showed effective antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. BG-AuNps and BG-AgNps demonstrated increased scavenging activity against 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl free radicals. In addition, BG-AuNps and BG-AgNps were nontoxic to HaCaT and MCF-7 cells; the latter showed no cytotoxicity at concentrations lower than 10 microg/mL. At higher concentrations, BG-AgNps exhibited apparent apoptotic activity in MCF-7 breast cancer cell line through reactive oxygen species generation and nuclear fragmentation.
28008166	Effect of Fu-Zheng-Xiao-Liu Granules on Expression of Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER-2) and Proliferation and Apoptosis of Breast Cancer Cell Line SKBR-3.	BACKGROUND Previous research showed that granulized Fu-Zheng-Xiao-Liu has a significant effect on breast cancer. However, it remains unclear whether HER-2 plays a role in this anti-cancer effect. MATERIAL AND METHODS Serum of male SD rats administered Fu-Zheng-Xiao-Liu granules (SF) was prepared and used to treat HER-2 positive breast cancer cell line SKBR-3. PBS and herceptin were used as negative and positive controls, respectively. MTT was used to detect the proliferation of SKBR-3 cells. Flow cytometry was used to measure the apoptosis of SKBR-3 cells. Western blot and immunofluorescence were used to measure the expression change of HER-2. RESULTS Serum of male SD rats administered Fu-Zheng-Xiao-Liu granules had significantly reduced HER-2 expression at both mRNA level and protein level, significantly inhibited proliferation of SKBR-3 cells, and significantly increased apoptosis of SKBR-3 cells, compared to that of the blank control group or serum control group. CONCLUSIONS Fu-Zheng-Xiao-Liu granules affect proliferation and apoptosis through inhibition of HER-2 transcription and translation, providing an experimental basis for further study of the mechanism by which Fu-Zheng-Xiao-Liu granules affect breast cancer.
28008161	Baicalein Inhibits Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transition via Downregulation of Cyr61 and LOXL-2 in MDA-MB231 Breast Cancer Cells.	Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a critical step in the acquisition of the migratory and invasive capabilities associated with metastatic competence. Cysteine-rich protein 61 (CCN1/Cyr61) has been implicated as an important mediator in the proliferation and metastasis of breast cancer. Hence, Cyr61 and associated pathways are attractive targets for therapeutic interventions directed against the EMT. In the present study, we report that baicalein significantly inhibits the expression of Cyr61 and migration and invasion of MDA-MB231 human breast cancer cells. Exposure to baicalein led to increased E-cadherin expression, possibly due to the ubiquitination of Snail and Slug, which was mediated by the Cyr61/Akt/glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK3beta) pathway. Further analysis revealed that baicalein inhibited the expression of lysyl oxidase like-2 (LOXL-2), which is a functional collaborator of Snail and Slug, and subsequently attenuated the direct interaction between LOXL-2 and Snail or Slug, thereby enhancing GSK3beta-dependent Snail and Slug degradation. Our findings provide new insights into the antimetastatic mechanism of baicalein and may contribute to its beneficial use in breast cancer therapies.
28007294	[The frequency of cancer in France: Most recent data and trends].	We present and discuss recent data on the frequency of cancer in France and on cancer survival. In the male population, the incidence of prostate and head and neck cancers diminishes rapidly and the incidence of the other common cancers: lung and colorectal diminishes less markedly; cancer mortality decreases for most sites. In the female population, the incidence of breast cancer diminishes rapidly, the incidence of colorectal and uterus cancers diminish less markedly and the incidence of lung cancer increases very fast: the mortality trends are similar. Cancer survival has improved in the last 16 years but some of the improvements are an artifact induced by overdiagnosis.
28007036	Genomic landscape of colorectal cancer in Japan: clinical implications of comprehensive genomic sequencing for precision medicine.	BACKGROUND: Comprehensive genomic sequencing (CGS) has the potential to revolutionize precision medicine for cancer patients across the globe. However, to date large-scale genomic sequencing of cancer patients has been limited to Western populations. In order to understand possible ethnic and geographic differences and to explore the broader application of CGS to other populations, we sequenced a panel of 415 important cancer genes to characterize clinically actionable genomic driver events in 201 Japanese patients with colorectal cancer (CRC). METHODS: Using next-generation sequencing methods, we examined all exons of 415 known cancer genes in Japanese CRC patients (n = 201) and evaluated for concordance among independent data obtained from US patients with CRC (n = 108) and from The Cancer Genome Atlas-CRC whole exome sequencing (WES) database (n = 224). Mutation data from non-hypermutated Japanese CRC patients were extracted and clustered by gene mutation patterns. Two different sets of genes from the 415-gene panel were used for clustering: 61 genes with frequent alteration in CRC and 26 genes that are clinically actionable in CRC. RESULTS: The 415-gene panel is able to identify all of the critical mutations in tumor samples as well as WES, including identifying hypermutated tumors. Although the overall mutation spectrum of the Japanese patients is similar to that of the Western population, we found significant differences in the frequencies of mutations in ERBB2 and BRAF. We show that the 415-gene panel identifies a number of clinically actionable mutations in KRAS, NRAS, and BRAF that are not detected by hot-spot testing. We also discovered that 26% of cases have mutations in genes involved in DNA double-strand break repair pathway. Unsupervised clustering revealed that a panel of 26 genes can be used to classify the patients into eight different categories, each of which can optimally be treated with a particular combination therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Use of a panel of 415 genes can reliably identify all of the critical mutations in CRC patients and this information of CGS can be used to determine the most optimal treatment for patients of all ethnicities.
28006691	Spontaneous photon emission: A promising non-invasive diagnostic tool for breast cancer.	Ultra-weak photon emission (UPE) has attracted significant scientific attention for its potential to monitor the physiological and pathological characteristics of living systems. In this study, we investigated the strength of spontaneous photon emission (SPE) from the right (R) and left (L) side of body surface of human breast cancer-bearing nude mice models, considering the entire breast cancer growth process, and healthy controls using a photon detector. And then we calculated the ratio of the average SPE strength (ratio (R/L)) between the right and left side of each mouse. Cluster analysis was used to evaluate the accuracy rates of strength-R, strength-L, ratio (R/L) and their combination to identify tumor mice from the controls. Our results revealed that the discriminating powers of different parameters were different in different growth stages of tumor: in tumor incubation period, the accuracy rates of strength-R, strength-L, ratio (R/L) and their combination to identify tumor mice from control mice were 63.6%, 40.9%, 81.8% and 86.4%, respectively; For nude mice with tumor diameter <0.5cm, the accuracies were 72.7%, 45.5%, 86.4% and 90.9%; and for nude mice with tumor diameters larger than 1.5cm, the accuracies were 86.4%, 77.3%, 95.5% and 100%, respectively. These results indicated that the SPE from the body surface of the lesion site could significantly distinguish tumor mice from the controls when tumors were obvious or when there were no obvious morphological changes, although the accuracy was relatively low. The results suggest that SPE, as a sensitive and promising optical method, may contribute to the preliminary screening of breast cancer, especially for early diagnosis, and it may play a critical role in curtailing the effects of breast cancer and improving the survival of patients in the future.
28006688	Cyanine5-doped silica nanoparticles as ultra-bright immunospecific labels for model circulating tumour cells in flow cytometry and microscopy.	In this work, ultra-bright fluorescent silica nanoparticles (NPs) labels have been shown to selectively bind to a model circulating tumour cell (CTC) line, MCF-7, a metastatic breast cancer by targeting epithelial cellular adhesion molecule (EpCAM) present on the MCF-7 cell membrane. Silica NPs approximately 40nm in diameter were doped with different concentrations of Cyanine5 dye molecules, using the reverse microemulsion method. The NPs were two orders of magnitude brighter than Cyanine5 free dye and the measured fluorescence intensity matched a homo-Forster Resonance Energy Transfer model. NPs were conjugated with anti-EpCAM antibody to the NP surface for immunospecific targeting. In flow cytometry experiments the NPs were twice as bright as two commercial anti-EpCAM red fluorophore conjugates, APC and AlexaFluor(R)647. This increase is achieved while keeping non-specific binding low as established in control tests with a non-metastatic cancer cell line (HeLa). The NPs were also immunospecific in fluorescence microscopy experiments performed at room temperature on non-fixed cells. Confocal microscopy was used to confirm the NPs were located on the surface of the cells, matching with the location of the EpCAM marker. These NPs labels have excellent potential in biomedical diagnostics, particularly when high signal to noise and good photostability are needed, for example, in point-of-care testing.
28006669	Alkynyloxy derivatives of 5,8-quinolinedione: Synthesis, in vitro cytotoxicity studies and computational molecular modeling with NAD(P)H:Quinone oxidoreductase 1.	The natural 7-amino-5,8-quinolinodione antibiotics were the substrate for the NQO1 protein. The structure-activity relationship showed that the 5,8-quinolinedione moiety was responsible for the interaction with the enzyme. In our research, we presented the synthesis, cytotoxic activity and theoretical study of a 5,8-quinolinedione compound as a potential inhibitor of the NQO1 enzyme. Mono and disubstituted alkynyloxy derivatives of the 5,8-quinolinedione were synthesized and characterized by 1H, 13C NMR, IR and HR-MS spectra. Newly synthesized derivatives were also tested for their biological activity in vitro against the human cancer cell lines. They showed high cytotoxic activity depending on the type of substituent and the employed tumor cell lines. Moreover, two breast cancer cell lines, MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7, were chosen for analysis as they are characterized by different NQO1 protein levels. It was found that cytotoxic activities of all studied compounds increased against the cell line with a higher NQO1 protein level. The molecular docking was used to examine the probable interaction between the molecules of alkynyloxy derivatives and human NAD[P]H-quinone oxidoreductase (NQO1) protein. The computational studies showed that the 5,8-quinolinedione moiety of all docked compounds was located deeply in the hydrophobic matrix of the active site near the side chains of aromatic residues in positions Trp 105, Phe 178, Tyr 126 and Tyr 128. In every case, introduction of aromatic moieties into the 5,8-quinolinedione molecule led to an increase in the binding affinity in relation to the 6,7-dichloro-5,8-quinolinedione.
28006668	Design and synthesis of novel 7-aminosubstituted pyrido[2,3-b]pyrazines exhibiting anti-breast cancer activity.	Breast cancer (BrCa) remains an unmet medical need despite the revolutionary development of antibody treatments and protein kinase inhibitors. In the current study, a series of novel substituted pyridopyrazine derivatives have been rationally designed and evaluated as multi-kinase inhibitors in the PI3K pathway. The target compounds were prepared from 6-amino-2-picoline, which upon nitration and selective reduction was converted to suitably substituted 6-methyl-7-aminopyrido[2,3-b]pyrazines. Suitable manipulation of the former amines provided the designed analogues, which were then assessed in vitro against several BrCa cell lines using the MTT cytotoxicity assay. The most potent compounds underwent evaluation in a broad spectrum of protein kinases, while their pharmacokinetic parameters were measured by LC-MS/MS. In vivo evaluation of a hit compound (14a) was performed in a HER2 amplified BrCa xenograft model (HCC1954) and efficacy was determined using Western blot based phosphokinase assays and immunohistochemistry. This derivative showed low micromolar cytotoxic potency in all BrCa cell lines, a mild inhibition of the PI3Kalpha wild type and H1047R mutated enzyme and excellent pharmacokinetic parameters following oral and intraperitoneal administration at the designed dose of 10 mg/kg, with absence of in vivo phenotypic toxicity. Interestingly, compound 14a inhibited the growth of xenografted tumors. Analysis of excised tumors from the treated animals showed a significantly reduced population of Ki-67 positive cells, as well as downregulated levels of phosphorylated AKT, ERK1/2 and SRC compared to vehicle treated animals. Finally, the specificity of 14a was assessed in a panel of 31 kinases where a mild, but direct, inhibition of the MET receptor tyrosine kinase was observed.
28006055	Association of DNA Mismatch Repair and Mutations in BRAF and KRAS With Survival After Recurrence in Stage III Colon Cancers : A Secondary Analysis of 2 Randomized Clinical Trials.	Importance: The association of biomarkers with patient survival after recurrence (SAR) of cancer is poorly understood but may guide management and treatment. Objective: To determine the association of DNA mismatch repair (MMR) status and somatic mutation in the B-Raf proto-oncogene (c.1799T>A [V600E]; BRAFV600E) or exon 2 of the KRAS proto-oncogene (KRAS) in the primary tumor with SAR in patients with stage III colon carcinomas treated with adjuvant chemotherapy. Design, Setting, and Participants: Patients with resected stage III colon cancers were randomized to adjuvant FOLFOX (folinic acid [leucovorin calcium], fluorouracil, and oxaliplatin) chemotherapy with or without cetuximab (North Central Cancer Treatment Group N0147 trial) or adjuvant FOLFOX chemotherapy with or without bevacizumab (National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project C-08 trial). Associations of biomarkers with SAR were analyzed using Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for clinicopathologic features and time to recurrence (data collected February 10, 2004, to August 7, 2015). Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary study outcome was survival after recurrence of cancer. A secondary outcome measure was the effect of the site of the primary tumor on the association of biomarkers with SAR. Results: Among 871 patients with cancer recurrence in the N0147 trial (472 men [54.2%] and 399 women [45.8%]; mean [SD] age, 57.8 [11.2] years) and 524 in the C-08 trial (269 men [51.3%] and 255 women [48.7%]; mean [SD] age, 57.0 [11.7] years), multivariable analysis revealed that patients whose tumors had deficient vs proficient MMR had significantly better SAR (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR], 0.70; 95% CI, 0.52-0.96; P = .03). Patients whose tumors harbored mutant BRAFV600E (AHR, 2.45; 95% CI, 1.85-3.25; P < .001) or mutant KRAS (AHR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.00-1.47; P = .052) had worse SAR compared with those whose tumors had wild-type copies of both genes, although only results for BRAFV600E achieved statistical significance. Significant interactions were found for MMR (P = .03) and KRAS (P = .02) by primary tumor site for SAR. Improved SAR was observed for patients with deficient MMR tumors of the proximal vs distal colon (AHR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.40-0.83; P = .003), and worse SAR was observed for tumors of the distal colon with mutant KRAS in codon 12 (AHR, 1.76; 95% CI, 1.30-2.38; P < .001) and codon 13 (AHR, 1.76; 95% CI, 1.08-2.86; P = .02). Conclusions and Relevance: In patients with recurrence of stage III colon cancer, deficient MMR was significantly associated with better SAR, and this benefit was limited to primary tumors of the proximal colon. Mutations in BRAFV600E were significantly associated with worse SAR, and worse SAR for BRAFV600E or KRAS mutant tumors was more strongly associated with distal cancers. These biomarkers have implications for patient management at recurrence. Trial Registration: clinicaltrials.gov Identifiers: NCT00079274 and NCT00096278.
28005837	Multiple Roles of WNT5A in Breast Cancer.	Breast cancer is one of the most common malignant tumors of women. Modern combinatorial therapeutic regimens can reduce patient tumor burdens to undetectable levels, yet in many cases these tumors will relapse. Understanding of breast cancer biology, developing more potent therapeutic approaches, and overcoming resistance are of great importance. WNT5A is a non-canonical signaling member of the WNT family. Its role in breast cancer still remains unclear. Most of the evidence shows that WNT5A is a suppressor in breast cancer and loss of its expression is associated with poor prognosis, while some evidence suggests the tumorigenicity of WNT5A. WNT signaling molecules are potent targets for treatment of cancer. Therefore, understanding the role of WNT5A in breast cancer may provide new ideas and methods for breast cancer treatment. We review the evidence concerning WNT5A and breast cancer involving the signaling pathways and the molecular-targeted therapy of WNT5A. Our results show that the role WNT5A plays depends on the availability of key receptors and intercellular interactions among different cell types.
28005646	Lymphoscintigraphic SPECT/CT-Contralateral Axillary Sentinel Lymph Node Drainage in Breast Cancer.	A 58-year-old woman with previous right breast carcinoma treated with lumpectomy, right axillary clearance, chemo-radiotherapy, and adjuvant hormonal therapy underwent a lymphoscintigraphy for a new right breast lesion. On planar images, an alternate route of lymphatic drainage was observed to the right internal mammary chain and the left axilla. A chest SPECT/CT was performed to confirm the location of the sentinel nodes. The patient underwent a right mastectomy and left axillary sentinel lymph node biopsy, which showed no evidence of lymphovascular invasion. Combining planar imaging and SPECT/CT techniques can accurately identify sentinel lymph nodes at their new unpredicted location.
28004976	Perfusion Parameters on Breast Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced MRI Are Associated With Disease-Specific Survival in Patients With Triple-Negative Breast Cancer.	OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the association between perfusion parameters on MRI performed before treatment and survival outcome (disease-free survival [DFS], disease-specific survival [DSS]) in patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty-one patients (median age, 50 years; age range, 27-77 years) with TNBC (tumor size on MRI: median, 25.5 mm; range, 11.0-142.0 mm) were included. We analyzed clinical and pathologic variables and MRI parameters. Cox proportional hazards models were used to determine associations with survival outcome. RESULTS: The median follow-up time was 46.1 months (range, 13.9-58.4 months). Eleven of 61 (18.0%) patients had events (i.e., local, regional, or distant recurrence or contralateral breast cancer) and seven (11.5%) died of breast cancer. Among the pretreatment variables, a larger tumor size on MR images (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.024, p = 0.003) was associated with worse DFS at univariate analysis. In multivariate pretreatment models for DSS, a higher fractional volume of extravascular extracellular space per unit volume of tissue (ve) value (HR = 1.658, p = 0.038), higher peak enhancement (HR = 1.843, p = 0.018), and a larger tumor size on MR images (HR = 1.060, p = 0.001) were associated with worse DSS. In multivariate posttreatment models, a larger pathologic tumor size (HR for DFS, 1.074 [p = 0.005]; HR for DSS, 1.050 [p = 0.042]) and metastasis in surgically resected axillary lymph nodes (HR for DFS, 5.789 [p = 0.017]; HR for DSS, 23.717 [p = 0.005]) were associated with worse survival outcome. CONCLUSION: A higher ve value, higher peak enhancement, and larger tumor size of the primary tumor on pretreatment MRI were independent predictors of worse DSS in patients with TNBC.
28004350	Identification of an RNA aptamer binding hTERT-derived peptide and inhibiting telomerase activity in MCF7 cells.	Human telomerase reverse transcriptase is an essential rate-limiting component of telomerase complex. hTERT protein in association with other proteins and the human telomerase RNA (hTR) shows telomerase activity, essential for maintaining genomic integrity in proliferating cells. hTERT binds hTR through a decapeptide located in the RID2 (RNA interactive domain 2) domain of N-terminal region. Since hTERT is essential for telomerase activity, inhibitors of hTERT are of great interest as potential anti-cancer agent. We have selected RNA aptamers against a synthetic peptide from the RID2 domain of hTERT by employing in vitro selection protocol (SELEX). The selected RNAs could bind the free peptide, as CD spectra suggested conformational change in aptamer upon RID2 binding. Extracts of cultured breast cancer cells (MCF7) expressing this aptamer showed lower telomerase activity as estimated by TRAP assay. hTERT-binding RNA aptamers hold promise as probable anti-cancer therapeutic agent.
28003747	MicroRNA-200c delivered by solid lipid nanoparticles enhances the effect of paclitaxel on breast cancer stem cell.	BACKGROUND: One of the major obstacles in the treatment of breast cancer is breast cancer stem cells (BCSC) which are resistant to standard chemotherapeutic drugs. It has been proven that microRNA-200c (miR-200c) can restore sensitivity to microtubule-targeting chemotherapeutic drugs by reducing the expression of class III beta-tubulin. In this study, combination therapy with miR-200c and paclitaxel (PTX) mediated by lipid nanoparticles was investigated as an alternative strategy against BCSC. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cationic lipid 1,2-dioleoyl-3-trimethylammonium-propane was strategically selected to formulate solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN) for miR-200c delivery. Nanostructured lipid carriers (NLC) with 20 wt% oleic acid were prepared for PTX delivery. Mammospheres, which gained the characteristics of BCSC, were used as a cell model to evaluate the efficiency of combination therapy. RESULTS: The cationic SLN could condense anionic miRNA to form SLN/miRNA complexes via charge interactions and could protect miRNA from degradation by ribonuclease. SLN/miR-200c complexes achieved 11.6-fold expression of miR-200c after incubation for 24 hours, compared with that of Lipofectamine 2000/miR-200c complexes (*P<0.05). Intracellular drug release assay proved that miRNA can be released from SLN/miRNA complexes efficiently in 12 hours after cellular uptake. After BCSC were transfected with SLN/miR-200c, the expression of class III beta-tubulin was effectively downregulated and the cellular cytotoxicity of PTX-loaded NLC (NLC/PTX) against BCSC was enhanced significantly (**P<0.01). CONCLUSION: The results indicated that the cationic SLN could serve as a promising carrier for miRNA delivery. In addition, the combination therapy of miR-200c and PTX revealed a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of BCSC.
28002821	Cutaneous Metastasis: A Study of 138 Cases Diagnosed by Fine-Needle Aspiration Cytology.	BACKGROUND: Cutaneous metastases can occur in a wide variety of internal malignancies and may be the first sign of a clinically silent visceral cancer. STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective analysis was made of 138 cases diagnosed with cutaneous and subcutaneous metastasis on fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC). Primary tumors of the skin/subcutis were excluded. RESULTS: Of 138 cases, the primary was known in 101 cases and unknown in 37 cases. The age of the patients ranged from 5 to 86 years, and 76 (55.1%) were male and 62 (44.9%) were female. Clinically, the most common lesion was a single nodule (n = 77, 55.8%). The chest wall was the predominant site (n = 53, 38.4%). In males and females, the most common primary sites were the lung (n = 16) and breast (n = 24), respectively. On cytology, the most common diagnosis was metastatic adenocarcinoma (n = 41, 29.7%). Of 37 cases with an unknown primary, FNAC helped to locate the primary site in 17 (45.9%) cases, while in 20 cases it remained undiagnosed. CONCLUSIONS: FNAC is a rapid and safe technique that can be used as a first line of investigation for confirmation of metastatic lesions of the skin. Critical evaluation of cytomorphological features along with relevant clinical details could help in the localization of an unknown primary site in some cases.
28002557	Reoperation Rates in Ductal Carcinoma In Situ vs Invasive Breast Cancer After Wire-Guided Breast-Conserving Surgery.	Importance: New techniques for preoperative localization of nonpalpable breast lesions may decrease the reoperation rate in breast-conserving surgery (BCS) compared with rates after surgery with the standard wire-guided localization. However, a valid reoperation rate for this procedure needs to be established for comparison, as previous studies on this procedure include a variety of malignant and benign breast lesions. Objectives: To determine the reoperation rate after wire-guided BCS in patients with histologically verified nonpalpable invasive breast cancer (IBC) or ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and to examine whether the risk of reoperation is associated with DCIS or histologic type of the IBC. Design, Setting, and Participants: This nationwide study including women with histologically verified IBC or DCIS having wire-guided BCS performed between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2013, used data from the Danish National Patient Registry that were cross-checked with the Danish Breast Cancer Group database and the Danish Pathology Register. Main Outcomes and Measures: Reoperation rate after wire-guided BCS in patients with IBC or DCIS. Results: Wire-guided BCS was performed in 4118 women (mean [SD] age, 60.9 [8.7] years). A total of 725 patients (17.6%) underwent a reoperation: 593 were reexcisions (14.4%) and 132 were mastectomies (3.2%). Significantly more patients with DCIS (271 of 727 [37.3%]) than with IBC (454 of 3391 [13.4%]) underwent a reoperation (adjusted odds ratio, 3.82; 95% CI, 3.19-4.58; P < .001). After the first reexcision, positive margins were still present in 97 patients (16.4%). The risk of repeated positive margins was significantly higher in patients with DCIS vs those with IBC (unadjusted odds ratio, 2.21; 95% CI, 1.42-3.43; P < .001). The risk of reoperation was significantly increased in patients with lobular carcinoma vs those with ductal carcinoma (adjusted odds ratio, 1.44; 95% CI 1.06-1.95; P = .02). A total of 202 patients (4.9%) had a subsequent completion mastectomy, but no difference was found in the type of reoperation between patients with DCIS and those with IBC. Conclusions and Relevance: A lower reoperation rate after wire-guided BCS was found in this study than those shown in previous studies. However, the risk of reoperation in patients with DCIS was 3 times higher than in those with IBC. The widespread use of mammographic screening will increase the number of patients diagnosed with DCIS, making a precise localization of nonpalpable DCIS lesions even more important.
28002506	The utility of bone remodeling markers in the diagnosis, evolution and treatment response evaluation in bone metastases.	After the lungs and liver, the bone is the third most common site for metastatic disease, appearing frequently in breast and prostate malignancies. These pathological bone events that occur during the evolution of the metastatic disease are usually the onset of osteolysis and they lower the patient's life quality, and are sometimes the cause of death due to the required treatments (surgery, radiotherapy). Due to the nature of the bone remodeling process, the markers that control bone resorption are the main early indicators of bone malignancy. These markers can be found in excess quantities of 50-150% in patients with bone metastases. Analyzing these indicators in conjunction with traditional tumoral markers such as the prostate specific antigen (PSA) and the type I collagen cross-linked telopeptide (ICTP) can often increase the sensibility of the investigation and the chances of diagnosing bone metastases. The studies that were carried out in order to research this area of knowledge have had good and expected results. Most of the efforts are now channeled into developing a better therapeutic strategy that would allow for the early diagnosis and treatment of the pathological bone events. Until these markers can be used as standard investigation methods in all of our patients, some controlled studies must be carried out in order to statistically prove these results, which are purely observational.
28002335	Spatial and temporal variations of screening for breast and colorectal cancer in the United States, 2008 to 2012.	Cancer screening tests are important tools to combat cancer-related morbidity and mortality. There is limited up-to-date research on spatial and temporal variations of colorectal and breast cancer screening in the United States.County-level data of cancer screening adherence rates were generated from 2008 to 2012 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. We performed the univariate local indicators for spatial analyses (LISA) for the geographic differences of screening adherence rate and the differential LISA for the change of screening adherence rate from 2008 to 2012.In the univariate LISA, low-to-low clusters were consistently identified in counties of New Mexico, Wyoming, and Mississippi (P < 0.05) for both screenings. In the differential LISA, we found low-to-low clusters in Indiana counties (P < 0.05) for mammography screening, which implied that counties with a below-average difference in mammography adherence were surrounded by counties of below-average difference in adherence rates. A high-to-high cluster was also identified in the southern Appalachian counties for mammography screening (P < 0.05). No obvious spatial pattern was found for the colorectal cancer screening adherence rate across the United States.We found low-to-low clusters over time in adherence to screening guidelines for both cancer types in New Mexico, Wyoming, and Mississippi, and clusters of potential decrease in adherence to mammography screening guideline in counties of Indiana. The study also showed improvement on mammography screening clustered in southern Appalachia. The methodology adopted in this study identified areas with clusters of consistent low adherence to screening and a decrease in adherence, which implies that further research and intervention is warranted.
28001333	Breast-related stereotype threat contributes to a symptom cluster in women with breast cancer.	AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To investigate the prevalence of breast-related stereotype threat and its effects on a symptom cluster consisting of anxiety, depression and fatigue and on each symptom. BACKGROUND: The stereotype that breasts are a sign of women's femininity results in patients with breast cancer fearing diminished femininity and rejection, which may induce psychological problems that co-occur as a symptom cluster. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. METHODS: A total of 131 patients with breast cancer postmastectomy completed the study. A question measuring breast-related stereotype threat, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue Scale were used to assess their breast-related stereotype threat and symptoms of anxiety, depression and fatigue. RESULTS: Of the 131 patients who answered the breast-related stereotype threat question, 86 (65.6%) reported breast-related stereotype threat. They did not differ significantly in social and clinical characteristics compared with those without the stereotype, but did report significantly higher levels of the symptom cluster and each symptom (anxiety, depression and fatigue). The odds ratios of the stereotype were significant for the symptom cluster, depression and fatigue (odds ratios = 2.52-3.98, p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The breast-related stereotype threat was common in patients with breast cancer. There was about a twofold increase in their risk of experiencing the symptom cluster and symptoms of depression and fatigue. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: In clinical practice, breast-related stereotype threat should be measured together with prevalent symptoms (e.g. anxiety, depression and fatigue) in patients with breast cancer. Our findings will aid the development of interventions for improving the mental health of women with breast cancer.
28000875	Fulvestrant reverses doxorubicin resistance in multidrug-resistant breast cell lines independent of estrogen receptor expression.	Drug resistance, a major obstacle to successful cancer chemotherapy, frequently occurs in recurrent or metastatic breast cancer and results in poor clinical response. Fulvestrant is a new type of selective estrogen receptor (ER) downregulator and a promising endocrine therapy for breast cancer. In this study, we evaluated the combination treatment of fulvestrant and doxorubicin in ER-negative multidrug-resistant (MDR) breast cancer cell lines Bads200 and Bats72. Fulvestrant potentiated doxorubicin-induced cytotoxicity, apoptosis and G2/M arrest with upregulation of cyclin B1. It functioned as a substrate for P-glycoprotein (P-gp) without affecting its expression. Furthermore, fulvestrant not only restored the intracellular accumulation of doxorubicin but also relocalized it to the nuclei in Bats72 and Bads200 cells, which may be another potential mechanism of reversal of P-gp mediated doxorubicin resistance. These results indicated that the combination of fulvestrant and doxorubicin-based chemotherapy may be feasible and effective for patients with advanced breast cancer.
28000866	Testin is a tumor suppressor in non-small cell lung cancer.	The Testin gene was previously identified in the fragile chromosomal region FRA7G at 7q31.2. It has been implicated in several types of cancers including prostate, ovarian, breast and gastric cancer. In the present study, we investigated the function of the candidate tumor-suppressor Testin gene in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In NSCLC cell lines, we observed lower expression of Testin compared to that noted in normal human bronchial epithelial cells. MTT assays, flow cytometry, clonogenic assay and invasion assay showed that the overexpression of the Testin gene inhibited cancer cell proliferation, invasion and colony formation. In tumor xenograft models, Testin markedly inhibited lung cancer cell xenograft formation and growth in athymic nude mice. Taken together, these data suggest that Testin plays an important role in the development and progression of NSCLC. Testin may be an effective novel target in NSCLC prevention and treatment.
28000849	Comparative analysis of gene regulatory networks of highly metastatic breast cancer cells established by orthotopic transplantation and intra-circulation injection.	Metastasis signature genes in breast cancer have been studied comparing transcriptomic profiles of highly metastatic cancer cell lines established by intra-circulation injection with that of their parental cell line. However, this method is not suitable to analyze the initial steps of metastasis including invasion into local tissues and the circulatory system. To characterize the molecular mechanisms of early metastasis, we established highly metastatic MDA-MB-231 cell lines that metastasized to lung by the two animal transplantation models: the orthotopic transplantation method, which mimics all steps of metastasis, or intra-circulation injection method. We then performed data-mining and network analysis of gene expression profiles of metastatic cell lines established by each transplantation method. Transcriptome analysis of seven metastatic cell lines revealed novel lung metastasis signature genes, including known metastasis promoting genes and signature genes. In the OXconc (orthotopic xenograft concentration) signature, 'chemotaxis' and 'cell adhesion' terms were enriched. In the TVIconc (tail vein injection concentration) signature, 'antigen recognition' and 'cell adhesion' were enriched. Furthermore, network analysis of the metastasis signature genes highlighted hub genes in the gene regulatory network. Our findings show that expression profiles of highly metastatic cell lines were different between the orthotopic transplantation and intra-circulation injection method. It also indicates that some metastatic signature genes have been missed in previous studies. Characterization of metastasis genes using the orthotopic transplantation method will be helpful in understanding the multi-step mechanisms of metastasis. Signature genes in OXconc may have the potential to become prognostic markers.
28000658	Evaluation of Left Ventricular Ejection Fractions in Breast Cancer Patients Undergoing Long-Term Trastuzumab Treatment.	BACKGROUND The aim of this study was to assess the long-term clinical tolerance and cardiac safety during trastuzumab treatment for patients diagnosed as having breast cancer with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) overexpression. MATERIAL AND METHODS A total 105 female cases diagnosed as having breast cancer with high expression of Her2, were treated with trastuzumab (T). All of them underwent electrocardiography monitoring in the process of T treatment. Left ventricular ejection fractions (LVEFs) were estimated using echocardiography before the T treatment and every 3 months. General clinical data and above parameters were collected and reviewed as analysis. RESULTS The mean value of LVEFs with baseline was higher than those at other time points. All LVEFs were more than 50% during the course of trastuzumab treatment. The decline scope >/=15% of LVEFs ranged from 2 months to 16 months, and the ratios were counted for 3.1% at 2 months, 4.3% at 6 months, 3.8% at 10 months, and 5.4% at 16 months. Furthermore, a larger decrease of LVEF during the course occurred mainly in the patients with cumulative dose of A >300 mg/m(2), without CPD and 16-month duration of T treatment. There was a strong correlation between cumulative dose of A, cyto/cardio-protection drugs (CPD), duration of T, and the change of LVEF (P=0.82, P=0.744, and P=0.717, respectively), which indicated that 3 factors may be associated with the change in LVEF (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS The LVEF in patients with trastuzumab treatment was significantly decreased, which may be seen as a favorable benefit-risk ratio for patients undergoing long-term trastuzumab treatment.
28000160	Radiotherapy and nipple-areolar complex necrosis after nipple-sparing mastectomy: a systematic review and meta-analysis.	OBJECTIVE: To perform a meta-analysis to determine the effect of radiotherapy (RT) on nipple-areolar complex (NAC) and skin flap necrosis, and local recurrence in women who undergo nipple-sparing mastectomy (NSM) and immediate breast reconstruction. METHODS: Medline, PubMed, Cochrane, and Google Scholar databases were searched until October 16, 2015. Randomized-controlled-trials, prospective, retrospective, and cohort studies were included. The primary outcome was the NAC necrosis rate, and the secondary outcomes were the skin flap necrosis and local recurrence rates. RESULTS: Of 186 studies identified, 2 prospective and 5 retrospective studies including a total of 3692 patients were included in the meta-analysis. Five, 3, and 2 studies reported data of NAC necrosis (3461 breasts), skin flap necrosis (2490 breasts), and local recurrence (988 breasts), respectively. Pooled results showed no difference in the odds of NAC necrosis [odds ratio (OR) = 1.250, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.481-3.247, P = 0.647], or local recurrence (OR = 0.564, 95% CI 0.056-5.710, P = 0.627) between patients who received and did not receive RT. Patients treated with RT had a higher likelihood of skin flap necrosis (OR = 2.534, 95% CI 1.720-3.735, P < 0.001). Significant heterogeneity, however, was noted in the analysis of NAC and local recurrence. CONCLUSIONS: Because of the limitations of the small number of studies and heterogeneity in the analysis, this study does not allow drawing any definitive conclusions and highlights the need of well-controlled trials to determine the effect of RT in patients undergoing NSM.
27999982	The prognostic effect of DDX3 upregulation in distant breast cancer metastases.	Metastatic breast cancer remains one of the leading causes of death in women and identification of novel treatment targets is therefore warranted. Functional studies showed that the RNA helicase DDX3 promotes metastasis, but DDX3 expression was never studied in patient samples of metastatic cancer. In order to validate previous functional studies and to evaluate DDX3 as a potential therapeutic target, we investigated DDX3 expression in paired samples of primary and metastatic breast cancer. Samples from 79 breast cancer patients with distant metastases at various anatomical sites were immunohistochemically stained for DDX3. Both cytoplasmic and nuclear DDX3 expression were compared between primary and metastatic tumors. In addition, the correlation between DDX3 expression and overall survival was assessed. Upregulation of cytoplasmic (28%; OR 3.7; p = 0.002) was common in breast cancer metastases, especially in triple negative (TN) and high grade cases. High cytoplasmic DDX3 levels were most frequent in brain lesions (65%) and significantly correlated with high mitotic activity and triple negative subtype. In addition, worse overall survival was observed for patients with high DDX3 expression in the metastasis (HR 1.79, p = 0.039). Overall, we conclude that DDX3 expression is upregulated in distant breast cancer metastases, especially in the brain and in TN cases. In addition, high metastatic DDX3 expression correlates with worse survival, implying that DDX3 is a potential therapeutic target in metastatic breast cancer, in particular in the clinically important group of TN patients.
27999356	Modulation of GLO1 Expression Affects Malignant Properties of Cells.	The energy metabolism of most tumor cells relies on aerobic glycolysis (Warburg effect) characterized by an increased glycolytic flux that is accompanied by the increased formation of the cytotoxic metabolite methylglyoxal (MGO). Consequently, the rate of detoxification of this reactive glycolytic byproduct needs to be increased in order to prevent deleterious effects to the cells. This is brought about by an increased expression of glyoxalase 1 (GLO1) that is the rate-limiting enzyme of the MGO-detoxifying glyoxalase system. Here, we overexpressed GLO1 in HEK 293 cells and silenced it in MCF-7 cells using shRNA. Tumor-related properties of wild type and transformed cells were compared and key glycolytic enzyme activities assessed. Furthermore, the cells were subjected to hypoxic conditions to analyze the impact on cell proliferation and enzyme activities. Our results demonstrate that knockdown of GLO1 in the cancer cells significantly reduced tumor-associated properties such as migration and proliferation, whereas no functional alterations where found by overexpression of GLO1 in HEK 293 cells. In contrast, hypoxia caused inhibition of cell growth of all cells except of those overexpressing GLO1. Altogether, we conclude that GLO1 on one hand is crucial to maintaining tumor characteristics of malignant cells, and, on the other hand, supports malignant transformation of cells in a hypoxic environment when overexpressed.
27998789	DNA methylation contributes to deregulation of 12 cancer-associated microRNAs and breast cancer progression.	The methylation of promoter CpG islands and the interaction between microRNAs (miRNAs) and messenger RNAs (mRNAs) of target genes are considered two crucial mechanisms for gene and pathway deregulation in malignant tumors. The aim of this study was to analyze the role of promoter methylation in altering the expression of 13 miRNAs that are associated with breast cancer (BC): miR-124, -125b, -127, -132, -137, -148a, -191, -193a, -203, -212, -34b, -375, -9. The role of methylation in the deregulation of these miRNAs has not been previously assessed in the representative set of BC samples. We used a set of 58 paired (tumor/normal) breast tissue samples and methylation-specific PCR to demonstrate significant aberrations in the methylation patterns of 9 miRNA genes. In particular, we observed hypermethylation of MIR-127, -132, and -193a, and hypomethylation of MIR-191 for the first time. Using quantitative PCR, we established a strong correlation between promoter methylation and expression levels for 12 miRNA genes (all except MIR-212); this finding demonstrates the functional importance of altered methylation patterns. We also performed a correlation analysis between expression levels of the 13 miRNAs and 5 cancer-associated genes, namely RASSF1(A), CHL1, APAF1, DAPK1, and BCL2, which were predicted as targets for these miRNAs, to investigate the impact of these miRNAs on these genes with key cellular functions in BC. Significant negative correlation was revealed for the following miRNA-mRNA pairs: miR-127-5p and DAPK1, miR-375 and RASSF1(A), and miR-124-3p and BCL2. Additionally, we also found a strong association between hypermethylation of MIR-127 and MIR-125b-1 and BC progression, particularly metastasis. Thus, our findings provide evidence for the significant role of methylation in the deregulation of 12 miRNA genes in BC, identify putative novel functional miRNA-mRNA pairs, and suggest MIR-127 and MIR-125b-1 hypermethylation to be potential biomarkers of BC metastasis.
27996311	Evaluating the Application of Tissue-Specific Dose Kernels Instead of Water Dose Kernels in Internal Dosimetry: A Monte Carlo Study.	PURPOSE: The aim of this work is to evaluate the application of tissue-specific dose kernels instead of water dose kernels to improve the accuracy of patient-specific dosimetry by taking tissue heterogeneities into consideration. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Tissue-specific dose point kernels (DPKs) and dose voxel kernels (DVKs) for yttrium-90 (90Y), lutetium-177 (177Lu), and phosphorus-32 (32P) are calculated using the Monte Carlo (MC) simulation code GATE (version 7). The calculated DPKs for bone, lung, adipose, breast, heart, intestine, kidney, liver, and spleen are compared with those of water. The dose distribution in normal and tumorous tissues in lung, liver, and bone of a Zubal phantom is calculated using tissue-specific DVKs instead of those of water in conventional methods. For a tumor defined in a heterogeneous region in the Zubal phantom, the absorbed dose is calculated using a proposed algorithm, taking tissue heterogeneity into account. The algorithm is validated against full MC simulations. RESULTS: The simulation results indicate that the highest differences between water and other tissue DPKs occur in bone for 90Y (12.2% +/- 0.6%), 32P (18.8% +/- 1.3%), and 177Lu (16.9% +/- 1.3%). The second highest discrepancy corresponds to the lung for 90Y (6.3% +/- 0.2%), 32P (8.9% +/- 0.4%), and 177Lu (7.7% +/- 0.3%). For 90Y, the mean absorbed dose in tumorous and normal tissues is calculated using tissue-specific DVKs in lung, liver, and bone. The results are compared with doses calculated considering the Zubal phantom water equivalent and the relative differences are 4.50%, 0.73%, and 12.23%, respectively. For the tumor in the heterogeneous region of the Zubal phantom that includes lung, liver, and bone, the relative difference between mean calculated dose in tumorous and normal tissues based on the proposed algorithm and the values obtained from full MC dosimetry is 5.18%. CONCLUSIONS: A novel technique is proposed considering tissue-specific dose kernels in the dose calculation algorithm. This algorithm potentially enables patient-specific dosimetry and improves estimation of the average absorbed dose of 90Y in a tumor located in lung, bone, and soft tissue interface by 6.98% compared with the conventional methods.
27996164	Neoalbaconol inhibits angiogenesis and tumor growth by suppressing EGFR-mediated VEGF production.	Neoalbaconol, derived from Albatrellus confluens, shows anti-cancer activities in the previously study, but its role in angiogenesis is unknown. Here, we determined whether neoalbaconol could attenuate angiogenesis and how does it occur. Data demonstrated that neoalbaconol could inhibit the proliferation of breast cancer cells and induce apoptosis. Also, neoalbaconol suppressed vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-induced human umbilical vascular endothelial cells (HUVECs) proliferation, migration, invasion, and capillary-like tube formation in vitro and reduced tumor angiogenesis in vivo. VEGF receptor activation and the downstream signal transduction cascades activation were inhibited by neoalbaconol. Additionally, neoalbaconol blocked EGFR-mediated VEGF production. EGFR overexpression reversed the neoalbaconol-induced VEGF reduction, confirming the importance of the EGFR inhibition in anti-angiogenesis of neoalbaconol. Furthermore, neoalbaconol inhibited tumor growth and tumor angiogenesis in a breast cancer xenograft model in vivo. Taken together, these results indicate that neoalbaconol could inhibit tumor angiogenesis and growth through direct suppression effects on vascular endothelial cells and reduction of proangiogenic factors in cancer cells.
27995542	Bone scan index of the jaw: a new approach for evaluating early-stage anti-resorptive agents-related osteonecrosis.	OBJECTIVE: A computer-aided diagnosis of bone scintigraphy using a bone scan index (BSI) has not been applied to a diagnosis of anti-resorptive agents-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (ARONJ). The aim of this study was to validate a diagnostic ability of BSI for early-stage ARONJ. METHODS: A total of 44 cancer patients treated with anti-resorptive drugs were evaluated retrospectively. All patients underwent bone scintigraphy and the tracer uptakes were analyzed by BSI. The software BONENAVI (FUJIFILM RI Pharma; EXINIbone, EXINI Diagnostics) could automatically detect abnormal intensities and calculate each regional BSI (rBSI). Among the rBSIs, the largest one in the jaw was manually selected and defined as maximum BSI of the jaw (BSIJmax). Uptake ratio (UR) between the maximum jaw count-to-average forehead count was also calculated. Screening accuracy of ARONJ based on 2 parameters was compared. Receiver operating characteristic analysis and Fisher's exact test were performed. RESULTS: The BSIJmax was significantly higher in patients who developed ARONJ than in those who did not, 3 months before the diagnosis of stage 2 ARONJ (p < 0.0001 and p = 0.02 in the maxilla and mandible, respectively). Using the cutoff values of 0.09% in the maxilla and 0.06% in the mandible, BSIJmax for predicting stage 2 ARONJ showed sensitivity and specificity of 88 and 96%, respectively, in the maxilla and 64 and 89%, respectively, in the mandible at 3 months before the diagnosis. The BSIJmax >0.09% and BSIJmax >0.06% in the maxilla and mandible, respectively, were much more frequently observed in patients who subsequently developed stage 2 ARONJ 3 months after the bone scintigraphy than in those who did not (p < 0.0001 and odds ratio = 182 in the maxilla and p < 0.005 and odds ratio = 14 in the mandible). The UR showed comparable diagnostic ability. CONCLUSION: The BSIJ provided a new index for evaluating ARONJ. For predicting occurrence of ARONJ, the thresholds of BSIJmax = 0.09 and 0.06% in the maxilla and mandible, respectively, may be used in patients treated with anti-resorptive drugs, and a differential diagnosis including ARONJ is recommended.
27995416	Synergistic action of cisplatin and echistatin in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells.	The aim of our study was to determine whether the use of cisplatin in the presence echistatin in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells leads to a reduction of toxic effects associated with the use of cisplatin. The expression of beta1-integrin and insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-IR), signaling pathway protein expression: protein kinase B (AKT), mitogen-activated protein kinases (ERK1/ERK2), nuclear factor kappa B (NFkappaB), and caspase-3 and -9 activity was measured after 24 h of incubation with tested compounds to explain detailed molecular mechanism of induction of apoptosis. The viability of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells was determined by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. Annexin V-FITC/propidium iodide staining assay was performed to detect the induction of apoptosis. Inhibition DNA biosynthesis was determined by [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA. The expression of of beta1-integrin, IGF-IR, AKT, ERK1/ERK2, NFkappaB, caspase-3 and -9 was evaluated using Western blot. The results suggest that treatment of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells for 24 h cisplatin plus echistatin severely inhibits cell growth and activates apoptosis by upregulation of caspase-3 and -9 expressions. The effect was stronger than treatment cisplatin and echistatin alone. In this study, we have found that cisplatin plus echistatin treatment decreases collagen biosynthesis in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells stronger than the individual compounds. The inhibition was found to be dependent on the beta1-integrin and IGF receptor activation. A significant reduction of ERK1/ERK2, AKT expression in cancer cells after cisplatin plus echistatin treatment was also found. The cancer cells treated by echistatin, cisplatin, and in particular the combination of both compounds drastically increased expression of NFkappaB transcription factor. Our results suggest that combined therapy cisplatin plus echistatin is a possible way to improve selectiveness of cisplatin. This mechanism probably is due to downregulation of expression of beta1-integrin and IGF-IR receptors, and the signaling pathway proteins induced by these receptors. Our results suggest that therapy cisplatin plus echistatin is a possible way to improve selectiveness of cisplatin.
27994463	A novel double-targeted nondrug delivery system for targeting cancer stem cells.	Instead of killing cancer stem cells (CSCs), the conventional chemotherapy used for cancer treatment promotes the enrichment of CSCs, which are responsible for tumor growth, metastasis, and recurrence. However, most therapeutic agents are only able to kill a small proportion of CSCs by targeting one or two cell surface markers or dysregulated CSC pathways, which are usually shared with normal stem cells (NSCs). In this study, we developed a novel nondrug delivery system for the dual targeting of CSCs by conjugating hyaluronic acid (HA) and grafting the doublecortin-like kinase 1 (DCLK1) monoclonal antibody to the surface of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)-poly(d,l-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) nanoparticles (NPs), which can specifically target CD44 receptors and the DCLK1 surface marker - the latter was shown to possess the capacity to distinguish between CSCSs and NSCs. The size and morphology of these NPs were characterized by dynamic light scattering (DLS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). This was followed by studies of NP encapsulation efficiency and in vitro drug release properties. Then, the cytotoxicity of the NPs was tested via Cell Counting Kit-8 assay. Finally, the 4T1 CSCs were obtained from the alginate-based platform, which we developed as an in vitro tumor model. Tumor-bearing nude mice were used as in vivo models to systematically detect the ability of NPs to target CSCs. Our results showed that the DCLK1-HA-PEG-PLGA NPs exhibited a targeting effect toward CSCs both in vitro and in vivo. These findings have important implications for the rational design of drug delivery systems that target CSCs with high efficacy.
27994460	Stimuli-responsive hybrid nanocarriers developed by controllable integration of hyperbranched PEI with mesoporous silica nanoparticles for sustained intracellular siRNA delivery.	Small interfering RNA (siRNA) is a highly potent drug in gene-based therapy with the challenge being to deliver it in a sustained manner. The combination of mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) and polycations in the confined pore space allows for incorporation and controlled release of therapeutic siRNA payloads. We hereby constructed MSNs with expanded mesopores and pore-surface-hyperbranched poly(ethyleneimine) (PEI) tethered with redox-cleavable linkers that could carry a high payload of siRNA (120 mg.g-1). The developed nanocarriers were efficiently taken up by cancer cells and were subsequently able to escape to the cytoplasm from the endosomes, most likely owing to the integrated PEI. Triggered by the intracellular redox conditions, the siRNA was sustainably released inside the cells over a period of several days. Functionality of siRNAs was demonstrated by using cell-killing siRNA as cargo. Despite not being the aim of the developed system, in vitro experiments using cell-killing siRNAs showed that the efficacy of siRNA transfection was comparable to the commercial in vitro transfection agent Lipofectamine. Consequently, the developed MSN-based delivery system offers a potential approach to hybrid nanocarriers for more efficient and long-term siRNA delivery and, in a longer perspective, in vivo gene silencing for RNA interference (RNAi) therapy.
27993876	Emerging Role of MDM2 as Target for Anti-Cancer Therapy: A Review.	The mouse/murine protein, MDM2, and its human homolog, HDM2, are important negative regulators of the p53 tumor suppressor protein. In normal, untransformed cells, MDM2 levels are tightly regulated to control expression of p53 and apoptosis. Conversely, MDM2 expression appears inherently higher in multiple types of cancer cells, thereby supporting its role as a suppressor of p53 pro-apoptotic activity. MDM2 amplification ranges between two- and ten-fold as reported in brain, breast, lung, and soft tissue tumors. MDM2 regulates p53 by two mechanisms: acting as a physical blockade of the transcriptional activation domain and E3 ubiquitin ligase. In addition to its relationship with p53, MDM2 behaves as an independent oncogene. These inherent characteristics make MDM2 a promising target for developing anti-cancer therapies. Investigators are now exploring both p53- dependent and independent cancer cell death pathways by targeting MDM2. Disrupting MDM2-p53 interaction with resultant increase in p53 induces cancer cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Targeting over-expressed MDM2 on cancer cell membranes disrupts membrane integrity by pore formation, causing membrane destabilization and rapid cancer cell-specific necrosis. In this review, evidence supporting the evolving role of MDM2 as an anti-cancer target and a molecular-based tumor biomarker will be discussed.
27993547	Large variation between hospitals in immediate breast reconstruction rates after mastectomy for breast cancer in the Netherlands.	BACKGROUND: The present study aimed to describe the use of immediate breast reconstruction (IBR) after mastectomy for invasive breast cancer and ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) in hospitals in the Netherlands and determine whether patient and tumor factors account for the variation. METHODS: Patients undergoing mastectomy for primary invasive breast cancer or DCIS diagnosed between January 1, 2011 and December 31, 2013 were selected from the NABON Breast Cancer Audit. All the 92 hospitals in the Netherlands were included. The use of IBR in all hospitals was compared using unadjusted and adjusted analyses. Patient and tumor factors were evaluated by univariate and multivariate analyses. RESULTS: In total, 16,953 patients underwent mastectomy: 15,072 for invasive breast cancer and 1881 for DCIS. Unadjusted analyses revealed considerable variation between hospitals in postmastectomy IBR rates for invasive breast cancer (mean 17%; range 0-64%) and DCIS (mean 42%; range 0-83%). For DCIS, younger age and multifocal disease were factors that significantly increased IBR rates. For patients diagnosed with invasive breast cancer, IBR was more often used in younger patients, multifocal tumors, smaller tumors, tumors with a lower grade, absence of lymph node involvement, ductal carcinomas, or hormone-receptor positive/HER2-positive tumors. After case-mix adjustments for these factors, the variation in the use of IBR between hospitals remained large (0-43% for invasive breast cancer and 0-74% for DCIS). CONCLUSIONS: A large variation between hospitals was found in postmastectomy IBR rates in the Netherlands for both invasive breast cancer and DCIS even after adjustment for patient and tumor factors.
27993142	Identification and characterization of cancer stem cells in canine mammary tumors.	Cancer stem cells (CSC) represent a small subpopulation of cells in malignant tumors that possess the unique ability to self-renew, differentiate and resist chemo- and radiotherapy. These cells have been postulated to be the basis for some of the difficulties in treating cancer, and therefore, numerous approaches have been developed to specifically target and eliminate CSC in diverse types of cancer, including breast cancer. Spontaneously occurring mammary tumors in canines share clinical and molecular similarities with the human counterpart, making the dog a potentially powerful model for the study of human breast cancer and clinical trials. Studies focused on canine mammary CSC might therefore enhance our understanding of the biology and possible treatment of the disease in both dogs and humans. In this review, we discuss various approaches currently in use to isolate and characterize canine mammary CSC.
27992844	(Very) Early technology assessment and translation of predictive biomarkers in breast cancer.	Predictive biomarkers can guide treatment decisions in breast cancer. Many studies are undertaken to discover and translate these biomarkers, yet few biomarkers make it to practice. Before use in clinical decision making, predictive biomarkers need to demonstrate analytical validity, clinical validity and clinical utility. While attaining analytical and clinical validity is relatively straightforward, by following methodological recommendations, the achievement of clinical utility is extremely challenging. It requires demonstrating three associations: the biomarker with the outcome (prognostic association), the effect of treatment independent of the biomarker, and the differential treatment effect between the prognostic and the predictive biomarker (predictive association). In addition, economical, ethical, regulatory, organizational and patient/doctor-related aspects are hampering the translational process. Traditionally, these aspects do not receive much attention until formal approval or reimbursement of a biomarker test (informed by Health Technology Assessment (HTA)) is at stake, at which point the clinical utility and sometimes price of the test can hardly be influenced anymore. When HTA analyses are performed earlier, during biomarker research and development, they may prevent further development of those biomarkers unlikely to ever provide sufficient added value to society, and rather facilitate translation of the promising ones. Early HTA is particularly relevant for the predictive biomarker field, as expensive medicines are under pressure and the need for biomarkers to guide their appropriate use is huge. Closer interaction between clinical researchers and HTA experts throughout the translational research process will ensure that available data and methodologies will be used most efficiently to facilitate biomarker translation.
27990198	Magnetic Resonance Imaging as an Adjunct to Mammography for Breast Cancer Screening in Women at Less Than High Risk for Breast Cancer: A Health Technology Assessment.	BACKGROUND: Screening with mammography can detect breast cancer early, before clinical symptoms appear. Some cancers, however, are not captured with mammography screening alone. Among women at high risk for breast cancer, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been suggested as a safe adjunct (supplemental) screening tool that can detect breast cancers missed on screening mammography, potentially reducing the number of deaths associated with the disease. However, the use of adjunct screening tests may also increase the number of false-positive test results, which may lead to unnecessary follow-up testing, as well as patient stress and anxiety. We investigated the benefits and harms of MRI as an adjunct to mammography compared with mammography alone for screening women at less than high risk (average or higher than average risk) for breast cancer. METHODS: We searched Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE), Centre for Reviews and Dissemination (CRD) Health Technology Assessment Database, and National Health Service (NHS) Economic Evaluation Database, from January 2002 to January 2016, for evidence of effectiveness, harms, and diagnostic accuracy. Only studies evaluating the use of screening breast MRI as an adjunct to mammography in the specified populations were included. RESULTS: No studies in women at less than high risk for breast cancer met our inclusion criteria. CONCLUSIONS: It remains uncertain if the use of adjunct screening breast MRI in women at less than high risk (average or higher than average risk) for breast cancer will reduce breast cancer-related mortality without significant increases in unnecessary follow-up testing and treatment.
27989825	Specific targeting delivery to MUC1 overexpressing tumors by albumin-chitosan nanoparticles conjugated to DNA aptamer.	Chitosan-coated human serum albumin nanoparticles were functionalized by MUC1 aptamer to obtain a selective drug carrier toward cancers overexpressing MUC1. The negative charges of albumin nanoparticles were shifted to positive charges by surface modification with chitosan, and MUC1 was conjugated through an acrylate spacer. The cytotoxicity of targeted nanoparticles was significantly more than non-aptamer nanoparticles, and also the chitosan-coated nanoparticles had more cytotoxic effects than the negatively charged albumin nanoparticles. The IC50 of targeted nanoparticles was 28 and 26% of free paclitaxel in MCF7 and T47D cells at 48h, respectively. Confocal laser scanning electron microscopy showed that aptamer conjugation and positive charge increase the cellular uptake. 66% of paclitaxel was released within 32h, but 100% of drug was released at pH=5.5 (similar cancer cells). The paclitaxel plasma amount was at a good level of 17.6% at 2h for increasing the chance of cellular uptake.
27989630	[Specificities of carcinomas in adolescents and young adults].	Carcinomas are rare tumors of the adolescent-young adult (AYA) with a different spectrum from those of adults. The most common sites outside of the thyroid is the nasopharynx, salivary gland, colon-rectum and ovaries. If nasopharyngeal carcinoma or salivary gland tumors are good prognosis, others are more reserved prognosis, such as digestive carcinomas, gynecological or midline. The revelation modes are non-specific and depend on the location: mass, tumor syndrome, pain, impaired general condition. The unusual of pediatric carcinomas led to propose a systematic oncogenetic exploration. The medical history of the family, the symptoms and the type of the carcinoma should guide the analysis. In the absence of guidance, analysis of TP53 gene and, for carcinomas of the expanded spectrum of the hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) syndrome, the search for mutation of MMR genes (mismatch repair) seems essential. Because of the rarity of these diseases and the absence of homogeneous recommendations, members of the rare tumors committee of the SFCE recommended for the management of these AJA, an histological review by a pathologist familiar with carcinomas of the adult, a double discussion between pediatric and adult oncologists, analysis of adult standards with adaptation to pediatric data, especially in terms of risk of side effects. An advice to a national opinion (by a member of FRACTURE group) or European (group EXPERT) is sometimes necessary in the most complex situations.
27989600	Novel ferrocenyl pyrazoles inhibit breast cancer cell viability via induction of apoptosis and inhibition of PI3K/Akt and ERK1/2 signaling.	Despite the advances in early detection and targeted therapies, chemotherapy is still of vital importance in breast cancer treatment. However, development of drug resistance and serious side effects limits their usage. Thus, there is an urgent need for safer and more effective agents against breast cancer. We have previously described the synthesis of a number of pyrazole derivatives, and in the current study, we have investigated the effects of two different ferrocenyl pyrazole (FP) derivates, 5-ferrocenyl-1-phenyl-1H-pyrazole (FP-Ph) and 5-ferrocenyl-1H-pyrazole (FP-H), on breast cancer cells. First, we investigated the effects of both FPs on cell viability and induction of cell death in breast cancer cells and benign MCF-10A cells by XTT and DNA fragmentation assays, respectively. Morphological changes in human breast cancer cells after FPs treatment were detected by both phase contrast microscope and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Then, we tested whether FPs exert their cytotoxic effect through inhibiting PI3K/Akt and/or ERK1/2 signaling pathways by using specific inhibitors. Both FPs induced cytotoxicity in a time and concentration-dependent manner in breast cancer cells; however, MCF-10A benign breast epithelial cells were much less susceptible to the cytotoxic effect of both FPs. FPs inhibited both PI3K/Akt and ERK 1/2 signaling pathways in breast cancer cells. The ultra structure images of MCF-7 cells by AFM showed that the cell surface was smooth in untreated cells, but it was rough with protrusions in treated cells. Both FPs induced apoptotic cell death in MDA-MB-231 cells; however, necrotic cell death was induced in caspase-3 lack MCF-7 cells, which implies that the synthesized FPs may induce apoptosis through caspase-3 dependent mechanism. In summary, these results suggest that FPs might be promising agents for the breast cancer therapy.
27988895	Radiopharmaceuticals for metastatic bone pain palliation: available options in the clinical domain and their comparisons.	Bone pain arising due to skeletal metastases is one of the common complications experienced by the majority of patients suffering from prostate, breast and lung cancer at the advanced stage of the disease. These patients are subjected to palliative care in order to improve the quality of their remaining life. With the gradually increasing number of cancer cases, palliation of metastatic bone pain is gaining importance. Bone-seeking radiopharmaceuticals play a pivotal role in the management of cancer pain, particularly in patients with multiple metastases, as these agents are proven to be effective in controlling the bone pain with minimum side effects. Although a plethora of such radiopharmaceuticals have been developed and evaluated in animal models, only a few are regularly used in clinics while some of these agents are at different stages of clinical evaluations. The present article describes only those bone-seeking radiopharmaceuticals, which have been reported to be clinically administered till date, along with their relative merits and drawbacks.
27988472	Co-delivery of docetaxel and verapamil by reduction-sensitive PEG-PLGA-SS-DTX conjugate micelles to reverse the multi-drug resistance of breast cancer.	The clinical usage of docetaxel (DTX) has been blocked in the clinic because of its poor solubility and tumour multi-drug resistance (MDR). The dominating mechanism of MDR is the over-expression of p-gp on tumour cells. Traditional nano-medicines, such as nanoparticles and micelles, have been used to physically entrap DTX to improve their solubility, while the drug loading content was very low and the tumour resistance was neglected. In this study, the synthesized reduction-sensitive mPEG-PLGA-SS-DTX conjugate was utilized to load the p-gp inhibitor veraparmil (VRP) to prepare DTX and VRP co-delivered mPEG-PLGA-SS-DTX/VRP (PP-SS-DTX/VRP) multi-functional micelles to reverse MDR and enhance the anti-tumour effect of DTX. The micelles had a high drug loading content and showed an obvious reduction-sensitive release property for both DTX and VRP. In addition, an in vitro anti-tumour assay revealed that the micelles markedly inhibited the efflux activity of p-gp and accelerated cell apoptosis, resulting in the improvement of anti-tumour activity and reversal of MDR. The PP-SS-DTX micelles markedly enhanced the in vivo circulation time and increased the drug accumulation in tumour tissues. Therefore, the PP-SS-DTX/VRP micelle is a desirable drug delivery system for multi-drug resistance therapy of DTX and is very promising for clinical usage.
27988412	Breast reconstruction after mastectomy: A ten-year analysis of trends and immediate postoperative outcomes.	The landscape of breast reconstruction has changed significantly. This study assesses trends in type of reconstruction performed after mastectomy and impact on immediate postoperative complications. METHODS: Data for 67,450 patients undergoing mastectomy for breast cancer were analyzed using the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) database for years 2005-2014. Primary outcomes were wound, nonwound related infections, and bleeding complications. Data were analyzed by univariate and multivariate analysis. RESULTS: The percentage of patients that underwent reconstruction after breast cancer increased from 26.94% in 2005 to 43.30% in 2014 (p < 0.01). There was increased wound (5.59%), bleeding (6.82%), and infection (1.80%) complications after flap-based reconstruction (p < 0.01). There was no difference in wound, infection, and bleeding complications between immediate implant reconstruction and tissue expander (TE) at 4.38 vs. 3.89% (p = 0.18), 0.82 vs. 0.7%, p = 0.46), and 0.76 vs. 0.64% (p = 0.45), respectively. Several independent factors were associated with increased wound complications in patients undergoing all or any forms of reconstruction after mastectomy such as being overweight (OR 1.38, CI 1.23-1.55), obese (OR 2.11, CI 1.89-2.35), morbidly obese (OR 3.84, CI 3.34-4.43), ASA Class III (OR 1.35, CI 1.08-1.69), ASA Class IV (OR 1.49, 1.06-2.10), diabetic (OR 1.28 , CI 1.14-1.43), and smokers (OR 1.76, CI 1.59-1.94). TRAM flap was associated with increased risk of wound complication (OR 1.87, CI 1.28-2.75). CONCLUSION: More women are undergoing reconstruction as utilization of TE increases drastically. Immediate implant placement has only seen moderate increase likely due to surgeon preference.
27988150	Nipple-areola complex reconstruction improves psychosocial and sexual well-being in women treated for breast cancer.	INTRODUCTION: Women choose to undergo nipple-areola complex (NAC) reconstruction as part of breast reconstruction following breast cancer treatment. However, the effect of this procedure on psychosocial and sexual well-being is not well studied. The present study aimed to evaluate how NAC reconstruction affects patient satisfaction with regard to psychosocial and sexual well-being. METHODS: A retrospective chart review was performed for all patients who underwent NAC reconstruction at Magee-Women's Hospital from January 1, 2004 to July 31, 2011. A letter and questionnaire based on the BREAST-Q were mailed to patients to request their participation in the study. Patient satisfaction and health-related quality of life were measured before and after NAC reconstruction. RESULTS: In total, 107 of 328 patients (32.6%) completed the survey. The BREAST-Q scale score for satisfaction with outcome following NAC reconstruction was 85.1 +/- 15.8, with higher satisfaction scores for patients with a follow-up of <1.5 years than those with a follow-up of >2.5 years (82.5 +/- 21.7 vs. 69.5 +/- 19.5; p < 0.01). No significant differences were found in satisfaction with the breast mound before and after NAC reconstruction. Women scored significantly higher on the psychosocial and sexual well-being scales after NAC reconstruction (p < 0.002 and 0.00004, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that patients are highly satisfied after undergoing NAC reconstruction. Satisfaction with the procedure, however, may decrease over time. NAC reconstruction significantly contributes to patient psychosocial and sexual well-being, and this effect did not change over time. NAC reconstruction improves patient outcomes in those who choose to undergo the procedure.
27987795	Biocompatible hyperbranched polyglycerol modified beta-cyclodextrin derivatives for docetaxel delivery.	The development of biocompatible vector for hydrophobic drug delivery remains a longstanding issue in cancer therapy. We design and synthesis a drug delivery system based on HPG modified beta-CD (beta-CD-HPG) by conjugating HPG branches onto beta-CD core and its structure was confirmed by NMR, FTIR, GPC and solubility. In vitro biocompatibility tests showed that HPG modification significantly improved red blood cells morphology alteration and hemolysis cause by beta-CD and beta-CD-HPG displayed cell safety apparently in a wide range of 0.01-1mg/mL. An anti-cancer drug, docetaxel, was effectively encapsulated into beta-CD-HPG which was confirmed by DSC analysis. This copolymer could form nanoparticles with small size (<200nm) and exhibited better DTX loading capacity and controlled release kinetics without initial burst release behavior compared with beta-CD. Furthermore, antitumor assay in vitro show that beta-CD-HPG/DTX effectively inhibited proliferation of human breast adenocarcinoma cells. Therefore, beta-CD-HPG/DTX exhibit great potential for cancer chemotherapy.
27987753	Sequel of MgO nanoparticles in PLACL nanofibers for anti-cancer therapy in synergy with curcumin/beta-cyclodextrin.	Pharmaceutical industries spend more money in developing new and efficient methods for delivering successful drugs for anticancer therapy. Electrospun nanofibers and nanoparticles loaded with drugs have versatile biomedical applications ranging from wound healing to anticancer therapy. We aimed to attempt for fabricating elastomeric poly (l-lactic acid-co-epsilon-caprolactone) (PLACL) with Aloe Vera (AV), magnesium oxide (MgO) nanoparticles, curcumin (CUR) and beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CD) composite nanofibers to control the growth of MCF-7 cells for breast cancer therapy. The study focused on the interaction of MgO nanoparticle with CUR and beta-CD inhibiting the proliferation of Michigan Cancer Foundation-7 (MCF-7) breast cancer cells. FESEM micrographs of fabricated electrospun PLACL, PLACL/AV, PLACL/AV/MgO, PLACL/AV/MgO/CUR and PLACL/AV/MgO/beta-CD nanofibrous scaffolds achieved bead free, random and uniform nanofibers with fiber diameter in the range of 786+/-286, 507+/-171, 334+/-95, 360+/-94 and 326+/-80nm respectively. Proliferation of MCF-7 cells was decreased by 65.92% in PLACL/AV/MgO/CUR with respect to PLACL/AV/MgO nanofibrous scaffolds on day 9. The obtained results proved that 1% CUR interacting with MgO nanoparticles showed higher inhibition of MCF-7 cells among all other nanofibrous scaffolds thus serving as a promising biocomposite material system for the breast cancer therapy.
27987409	Competitive RNA-RNA hybridization-based integrated nanostructured-disposable electrode for highly sensitive determination of miRNAs in cancer cells.	A new method for the detection of miRNAs making use of a competitive RNA/RNA hybridization configuration is described in this work. A biotinylated miRNA (biotin-miRNA) of identical sequence to that of the target miRNA is mixed with the samples to be analyzed allowing competition to be accomplished with the target miRNA for a thiolated RNA probe assembled onto a gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) modified screen-printed electrode. After labeling the hybridized biotin-miRNA with streptavidin-HRP conjugates, amperometric detection at -0.20V was carried out using the H2O2/hydroquinone (HQ) system. The decrease in the amperometric response was proportional to the concentration of model target miRNA-21 in the 100 fM to 25.0 pM range. The integrated sensor provided a very low detection limit (25 fM, 0.25 attomol in 10muL sample) for miRNA-21 without any amplification step, a complete discrimination against single nucleotide mismatched sequences under practical conditions and high storage stability. The usefulness of the developed method was demonstrated by determining the endogenous levels of the mature target miRNA in total RNA (RNAt) extracted from cancerous and non-cancerous cells.
27986634	Novel interacting proteins identified by tandem affinity purification coupled to nano LC-MS/MS interact with ribosomal S6 protein kinase 4 (RSK4) and its variant protein (RSK4m).	Ribosomal S6 protein kinase 4 (RSK4) is an important novel tumor suppressor that inhibits breast cancer cell growth and induces senescence. However, RSK4m, which is a variant of RSK4 resulting from alternative splicing, may play distinct roles in some aspects. Knowledge about the mechanisms of RSK4 or RSK4m activity has been lacking. Analysis of the RSK4 and RSK4m interactome could provide insight into their specific functions and integrative mechanisms. Using tandem affinity purification, we obtained protein complexes that interacted with RSK4 or RSK4m. Mass spectrum analysis was performed to identify the obtained protein complexes, and bioinformatics analysis was performed. In this study, we isolated and identified 82 RSK4-associated proteins and 137 RSK4m-associated proteins using two STREP II and a single Flag tag-based tandem affinity purification (SF-TAP) coupled with nano LC-MS/MS in MDA-MB-231 cells. Gene Ontology and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis analyses provided functional annotations and protein-protein interaction networks of the protein interactome of RSK4 and RSK4m. Functional annotations of these proteins by bioinformatics analyses highlight the essential role of RSK4 and RSK4m in coordination with their interacting partners to mediate multiple biological processes, especially cell senescence. Moreover, after comparing the interactome of RSK4 and RSK4m, we found that RSK4m is involved in more molecular functions than RSK4.
27986267	[Evaluation of the immune infiltrate in breast cancer].	Tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) are major components of the immune/"inflammatory" infiltrate found in tumour microenvironment. They reflect the intensity and the quality of the immune reaction to cancer. In breast cancer, TIL density and phenotypic profile have been demonstrated to be predictive of response to neoadjuvant treatment and of patient outcome. TIL density, currently the best-developed TIL-related biomarker, is defined as the percentage of tumour stroma surface occupied by TIL. The baseline TIL density of 50% and higher is associated with particularly high rates of pathological complete response to neoadjuvant therapy in triple negative and HER2+ breast cancer, as well as with significantly better recurrence-free and overall survival. Similar predictive and prognostic value has been demonstrated for the ratio between the numbers of CD8+ and FoxP3+ TIL. TIL density and the CD8+/FoxP3+ ratio are promising biomarkers in breast cancer, which could be used in tailoring of neoadjuvant and adjuvant systemic therapy and in selection of patients for different immunotherapy modalities. This article reviews elements of the immune response to cancer, methods of TIL analysis, evidence of TIL' prognostic and predictive value in the current breast cancer management as well as the perspectives for use of TIL' characteristics as biomarkers in breast cancer immunotherapy.
27984119	Comparative study on toxicity of extracellularly biosynthesized and laboratory synthesized CdTe quantum dots.	Nanobiosynthesis belongs to the most recent methods for synthesis of nanoparticles. This type of synthesis provides many advantages including the uniformity in particle shape and size. The biosynthesis has also a significant advantage regarding chemical properties of the obtained particles. In this study, we characterized the basic properties and composition of quantum dots (QDs), obtained by the extracellular biosynthesis by Escherichia coli. Furthermore, the toxicity of the biosynthesized QDs was compared to QDs prepared by microwave synthesis. The obtained results revealed the presence of cyan CdTe QDs after removal of substantial amounts of organic compounds, which stabilized the nanoparticle surface. QDs toxicity was evaluated using three cell lines Human Foreskin Fibroblast (HFF), Human Prostate Cancer cells (PC-3) and Breast Cancer cells (MCF-7) and the MTT assay. The test revealed differences in the toxicity between variants of QDs, varying about 10% in the HFF and 30% in the MCF-7 cell lines. The toxicity of the biosynthesized QDs to the PC-3 cell lines was about 35% lower in comparison with the QDs prepared by microwave synthesis.
27983617	Molecular Mechanisms and Translational Therapies for Human Epidermal Receptor 2 Positive Breast Cancer.	Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death among women. Human epidermal receptor 2 (HER2) positive breast cancer (HER2+ BC) is the most aggressive subtype of breast cancer, with poor prognosis and a high rate of recurrence. About one third of breast cancer is HER2+ BC with significantly high expression level of HER2 protein compared to other subtypes. Therefore, HER2 is an important biomarker and an ideal target for developing therapeutic strategies for the treatment HER2+ BC. In this review, HER2 structure and physiological and pathological roles in HER2+ BC are discussed. Two diagnostic tests, immunohistochemistry (IHC) and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), for evaluating HER2 expression levels are briefly introduced. The current mainstay targeted therapies for HER2+ BC include monoclonal antibodies, small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors, antibody-drug conjugates (ADC) and other emerging anti-HER2 agents. In clinical practice, combination therapies are commonly adopted in order to achieve synergistic drug response. This review will help to better understand the molecular mechanism of HER2+ BC and further facilitate the development of more effective therapeutic strategies against HER2+ BC.
27983536	New variants in the BRCA1 gene in Buryat Mongol breast cancer patients: Report from two families.	BACKGROUND: The BRCA1 mutations that are endemic to the Slavic population of Russia have not been identified among indigenous peoples, including the Buryats, Tuvinians and Altaians with hereditary breast cancer. OBJECTIVE: This study was aimed to identify the mutations that are responsible for the occurrence of hereditary breast cancer in the indigenous population of the Republic of Buryatia. METHODS: Mutations in the BRCA1 gene were identified in blood samples by Sanger-based sequencing. RESULTS: We identified 11 polymorphisms (10 SNPs and 1 Indel) and 6 new unclassified sequence variants in the BRCA1 gene. In our study three new sequence variants (c.321T>A, c.366T>A, c.4357+2T>A) were found in position of previously described polymorphisms in dbSNPs: rs80357544 (c.321delT), rs190900046 (c.366T>G), and rs80358152 (c.4357+2T>C), respectively. Other three new sequence variants (c.3605A>G, c.1998A>C, and c.80+13A>C) have not been previously described in dbSNP, BIC and Human Gene Mutation Databases. CONCLUSIONS: We described six new sequence variants that have never been published in the literature or databases. Further studies are required to confirm the impact of new sequence variants on the risk of breast cancer in the Buryat Mongol population.
27983530	Role of GSK3beta in breast cancer susceptibility.	BACKGROUND: Breast cancer is one of the principal causes of death among Brazilian women, so it is a challenge to find new and specific early diagnostic markers, using simple and fast procedures. GSK3beta gene is an important Wnt signaling regulator involved in beta-Catenin degradation. Wnt signaling is associated with initiation and progression process in many tumor types, and alterations in beta-Catenin explain only a small proportion of aberrant signaling found in breast cancer, indicating that other Wnt signaling components and/or regulators as GSK3beta may be involved. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the genetic, epigenetic and transcriptional alterations of GSK3beta in breast cancer. METHODS: Peripheral blood samples from 204 breast cancer and healthy women were collected. Assessment of rs334558 polymorphism was performed by PCR-RFLP, promoter methylation profiles analysis by MS-PCR and qPCR was used to determine GSK3beta expression levels. RESULTS: The rs334558 polymorphism showed a strong association with aggressive cancer. A significant increase was observed in GSK3beta expression level respect to hormone receptors status and tumor size. CONCLUSION: The results indicated an inverse relationship between GSK3beta performance and tumor progression. This is the first study to relate GSK3beta gene with breast cancer in Brazilian population.
27983524	Combined detection of plasma miR-127-3p and HE4 improves the diagnostic efficacy of breast cancer.	OBJECTIVE: To explore the diagnostic value of combined detection of plasma miR-127-3p and HE4 for breast cancer (BC). METHODS: Included in this study were 102 patients with pathologically confirmed BC who received treatment in the affiliated hospital of Nantong University between March 2015 and April 2016, 87 patients with benign breast tumors, and 90 healthy volunteers as control. Plasma miR-127-3p was detected by SYBR Green RT-qPCR, and plasma HE4 was detected by chemiluminescent immunoassay. The diagnostic efficacy of miR-127-3p alone, HE4 alone and combined detection of miR-127-3p and HE4 in BC women patients was evaluated by ROC curve analysis. RESULTS: The relative expression quantity (RQ) of plasma miR-127-3p and HE4 in BC patients was 13.561 (3.345 approximately 18.281) pmol/L and 105.42 (40.28 approximately 156.31) pmol/L. The RQ of plasma miR-127-3p in BC patients was significantly higher than that in benign breast tumor patients and healthy individuals (both P< 0.001), and there was no significant difference between benign breast tumor patients and healthy individuals (P> 0.05). There was no significant correlation between plasma miR-127-3p and HE4 levels (r2= 0.086, P= 0.471). ROC curve analysis on the diagnostic efficacy of plasma miR-127-3p and HE4 in BC diagnosis showed that the cut-off value of miR-127-3p and HE4 in BC diagnosis was 3.471 and 63.21 pmol/L; AUC was 0.767 and 0.670; sensitivity was 78.2% and 64.6%; specificity was 79.1% and 69.3%; accuracy was 73.2% and 65.1%, respectively. Prediction probability (P) obtained from the miR-127-3p and HE4 model established by logistic regression was P= 1/ [1 + exp (-0.142miR-127-3p-0.024HE4 + 2.875)]. AUC calculated from ROC was 0.825 and the sensitivity was increased to 87.4%. CONCLUSION: Combined detection of plasma miR-127-3p and HE4 greatly improved the sensitivity of BC diagnosis and may prove to be a candidate biomarker for early detection and diagnosis of BC.
27983523	CpG methylation of APC promoter 1A in sporadic and familial breast cancer patients.	Tumour suppressor gene (TSG) silencing through promoter hypermethylation plays an important role in cancer initiation. The aim of this study was to assess the extent of methylation of APC gene promoter in 91 sporadic and 44 familial cases of Tunisian patients with breast cancer (BC) in. The frequency of APC promoter methylation is somewhat similar for sporadic and familial breast cancer cases, (52.1%, and 54.5% respectively). For sporadic breast cancer patients, there was a significant correlation of APC promoter hypermethylation with TNM stage (p = 0.024) and 3-year survival (p = 0.025). Regarding the hormonal status (HR), we found significant association between negativity to PR and unmethylated APC (p= 0.005) while ER and Her2/neu are not correlated. Moreover, unmethylated APC promoter is more frequent in tumours expressing at least one out the 3 proteins compared to triple negative cases (p= 0.053). On the other hand, aberrant methylation of APC was associated with tumour size (p = 0.036), lymph node (p = 0.028), distant metastasis (p = 0.031), and 3-year survival (p = 0.046) in the group of patients with familial breast cancer. Moreover, patients with sporadic breast cancer displaying the unmethylated profile have a significant prolonged overall survival compared to those with the methylated pattern of APC promoter (p log rank = 0.008). Epigenetic change at the CpG islands in the APC promoter was associated with the silence of its transcript and the loss of protein expression suggesting that this event is the main mechanism regulating the APC expression in breast cancer. In conclusion, our data showed that the loss of APC through aberrant methylation is associated with the aggressive behavior of both sporadic and familial breast cancer in Tunisian patients.
27982755	Cytotoxicity and Proteasome Inhibition by Alkaloid Extract from Murraya koenigii Leaves in Breast Cancer Cells-Molecular Docking Studies.	Murraya koenigii (curry tree) leaves are rich in bioactive compounds such as flavonoids, alkaloids, and coumarins. Alkaloids from M. koenigii leaves have antianalgesic, antiulcerogenic, antiobesity, and antitumor activities. In this study, we tested the cytotoxic and proteasome-inhibitory potential of a total alkaloid extract (TAE) from M. koenigii leaves in the breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231. The TAE decreased cell viability with an IC50 of 14.4 mug/mL and altered growth kinetics of breast cancer cells. TAE (32 mug/mL) arrested cells (35%) in the "S" phase of the cell cycle and induced apoptosis. The 26S proteasome, a multicatalytic protease complex, promotes tumor cell proliferation and protects tumor cells from apoptosis. The TAE and mahanine, a carbazole alkaloid present in M. koenigii leaves, preferentially inhibited the trypsin-like, but not the chymotrypsin-like proteolytic activity of the proteasome with an IC50 of 162 mug/mL and 287 muM, respectively. In silico analysis of 26 compounds from M. koenigii leaves revealed significant docking scores for mahanine and two other carbazole alkaloids with the beta2 and beta5 subunits of the catalytic 20S proteasome. Taken together, this study demonstrates that inhibition of the proteasome is an important biological activity of M. koenigii alkaloids, which may lead to cancer cell death.
27981485	1H-MR spectroscopy of suspicious breast mass lesions at 3T: a clinical experience.	OBJECTIVES: To test 3T proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) for breast mass lesions. METHODS: Patients with BI-RADS 4-5 lesions at mammography/ultrasound were prospectively enrolled. After contrast-enhanced breast MRI, single-voxel MRS (point-resolved volume selection, PRESS); pencil-beam shimming; volume of interest 1 cm3; TR/TE = 3000/135 ms) was performed. Spectra were considered reliable if the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the water peak was </=45 Hz. A signal-to-noise ratio of the total choline (tCho) peak at 3.21 ppm >/=2 was used as cutoff for malignancy. All lesions underwent needle sampling. Final pathology was available for all malignant lesions; for benign lesions the reference standard was final pathology or at least 1-year negative follow-up. RESULTS: Reliable spectra were obtained in 115/127 lesions (91%), with a mean FWHM of 32.4 Hz (range 8-45 Hz). A tCho peak SNR >/=2 was detected in 66 malignant lesions (62 invasive cancers; 4 ductal carcinoma in situ) and in 3 benign lesions. Excluding lesions located </=1 cm from the skin (n = 3) or pectoral muscle (n = 11), sensitivity was 65/73 [89%, 95% confidence interval (CI): 80-95%], and specificity 25/28 (89%) (95% CI: 72-98%). Considering only invasive cancers, sensitivity reached 61/68 (90%, 95% CI: 81-96%). MRS additional time was 8 min. CONCLUSIONS: When lesions close to the skin or pectoral muscle are excluded, 3T 1H-MRS of mass lesions >/=1 cm showed a high diagnostic performance, however, insufficient to avoid needle biopsy.
27981422	Effects of Electroporation on Tamoxifen Delivery in Estrogen Receptor Positive (ER+) Human Breast Carcinoma Cells.	Estrogen receptor positive breast cancer is the most common type of breast cancer and in most cases, hormone therapy is considered complementary to surgery. Tamoxifen is one of the most common drugs used in hormone therapy for treating estrogen receptor positive breast cancer cells. However, it has severe side-effects depending on the duration of treating breast cancer and amount of tamoxifen used. In this study, we examined the effects of electroporation on the tamoxifen uptake in estrogen receptor positive MCF-7 breast cancer cells. The survival rate of MCF-7 cells had a negative relationship with energy dissipation in cells. Similarly, the electrical charge delivered to cells during electroporation was inversely proportional to survival rate. The combined application of electroporation and tamoxifen is much more effective than the usage of tamoxifen alone in the treatment of estrogen receptor positive breast cancer. The application of electroporation increased the uptake of tamoxifen into MCF-7 cells and reduced the minimal tamoxifen dosage which, is needed for the treatment of estrogen receptor positive breast cancer.
27979631	Indole-3-carbinol (I3C) analogues are potent small molecule inhibitors of NEDD4-1 ubiquitin ligase activity that disrupt proliferation of human melanoma cells.	The HECT domain-containing E3 ubiquitin ligase NEDD4-1 (Neural precursor cell Expressed Developmentally Down regulated gene 4-1) is frequently overexpressed in human cancers and displays oncogenic-like properties through the ubiquitin-dependent regulation of multiple protein substrates. However, little is known about small molecule enzymatic inhibitors of HECT domain-containing ubiquitin ligases. We now demonstrate that indole-3-carbinol (I3C), a natural anti-cancer phytochemical derived from cruciferous vegetables such as cabbage and broccoli, represents a new chemical scaffold of small molecule enzymatic inhibitors of NEDD4-1. Using in vitro ubiquitination assays, I3C, its stable synthetic derivative 1-benzyl-I3C and five novel synthetic analogues were shown to directly inhibit NEDD4-1 ubiquitination activity. Compared to I3C, which has an IC50 of 284muM, 1-benzyl-I3C was a significantly more potent NEDD4-1 enzymatic inhibitor with an IC50 of 12.3muM. Compounds 2242 and 2243, the two indolecarbinol analogues with added methyl groups that results in a more nucleophilic benzene ring pi system, further enhanced potency with IC50s of 2.71muM and 7.59muM, respectively. Protein thermal shift assays that assess small ligand binding, in combination with in silico binding simulations with the crystallographic structure of NEDD4-1, showed that each of the indolecarbinol compounds bind to the purified catalytic HECT domain of NEDD4-1. The indolecarbinol compounds inhibited human melanoma cell proliferation in a manner that generally correlated with their effectiveness as NEDD4-1 enzymatic inhibitors. Taken together, we propose that I3C analogues represent a novel set of anti-cancer compounds for treatment of human melanomas and other cancers that express indolecarbinol-sensitive target enzymes.
27978515	AQP5 Variants Affect Tumoral Expression of AQP5 and Survival in Patients with Early Breast Cancer.	BACKGROUND: Our previous study showed the association of AQP5 upregulation with cancer proliferation and migration in breast cancer cell lines and with unfavorable prognosis in patients with early breast cancer (EBC). In the current study, we analyzed the association of AQP5 variants or their haplotypes with AQP5 expression and their prognostic impact for survival in patients with EBC. METHODS: Three AQP5 polymorphisms (rs74091166, rs3736309, and rs1964676) were selected based on the SNP database and genotyped using the Sequenom MassARRAY in 374 out of 447 patients with EBC in whom AQP5 expression had been investigated in our previous study. RESULTS: The allele frequencies of the selected variants in the current study were similar to those from Asian data previously reported. In a univariate analysis, both rs74091166 and rs1964676 were statistically associated with survival as a dominant model of minor allele. Moreover, a multivariate survival analysis revealed that the CC genotype of rs1964676 is an independent prognostic marker of survival in EBC patients, regardless of stage, tumor subtype, and adjuvant treatment [hazard ratio = 0.399, 0.384, and 0.205; p = 0.021, 0.027, and 0.016 for disease-free survival (DFS), distant DFS, and disease-specific survival, respectively]. In particular, the CT/TT genotype of rs1964676 showed an association with strong expression of AQP5 (58.6 vs. 26.0%; p = 0.001), without any associations with clinical or pathological characteristics including tumor subtype, stage, or histologic grade. CONCLUSION: The current study suggests AQP5 rs1964676 as a new potential prognostic marker in patients with EBC involved in AQP5 expression.
27977639	Leading Causes of Cancer Mortality - Caribbean Region, 2003-2013.	Cancer is one of the leading causes of deaths worldwide (1); in 2012, an estimated 65% of all cancer deaths occurred in the less developed regions of the world (2). In the Caribbean region, cancer is the second leading cause of mortality, with an estimated 87,430 cancer-related deaths reported in 2012 (3). The Pan American Health Organization defines the Caribbean region as a group of 27 countries that vary in size, geography, resources, and surveillance systems.* CDC calculated site- and sex-specific proportions of cancer deaths and age-standardized mortality rates (ASMR) for 21 English- and Dutch-speaking Caribbean countries, the United States, and two U.S. territories (Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands [USVI]), using the most recent 5 years of mortality data available from each jurisdiction during 2003-2013. The selection of years varied by availability of the data from the countries and territories in 2015. ASMR for all cancers combined ranged from 46.1 to 139.3 per 100,000. Among males, prostate cancers were the leading cause of cancer deaths, followed by lung cancers; the percentage of cancer deaths attributable to prostate cancer ranged from 18.4% in Suriname to 47.4% in Dominica, and the percentage of cancer deaths attributable to lung cancer ranged from 5.6% in Barbados to 24.4% in Bermuda. Among females, breast cancer was the most common cause of cancer deaths, ranging from 14.0% of cancer deaths in Belize to 29.7% in the Cayman Islands, followed by cervical cancer. Several of the leading causes of cancer deaths in the Caribbean can be reduced through primary and secondary preventions, including prevention of exposure to risk factors, screening, early detection, and timely and effective treatment.
27977602	Scarce information about breast cancer screening: An Italian websites analysis.	Although the public should have complete and correct information about risk/benefit ratio of breast cancer screening, public knowledge appears generally scarce and oriented to overestimate benefits, with little awareness of possible disadvantages of the screening.We evaluated any document specifically addressed to the general female public and posted on internet by Italian public health services. The presence of false positive, false positive after biopsy, false negative, interval cancer, overdiagnosis, lead-time bias, exposure to irradiation, and mortality reduction was analyzed.Of the 255 websites consulted, 136 (53.3%) had sites addressed to the female public. The most commonly reported information points were the false-positive (30.8% of sites) and radiation exposure (29.4%) rates. Only 11 documents mentioned overdiagnosis, 2 mentioned risk of false positive with biopsy, and only 1 mentioned lead-time bias. Moreover, only 15 sites (11.0%) reported quantitative data for any risk variables.Most documents about breast cancer screening published on the web for the female public contained little or no information about risk/benefit ratio and were biased in favor of screening.
27977584	Impact of lifestyle and psychological stress on the development of early onset breast cancer.	The present study aimed to investigate risk factors for early onset breast cancer that are related to lifestyle and psychological stress. A comparative case-control study was performed among patients from the Department of Breast Surgery in Shanghai Cancer Center of Fudan University. The information regarding risk factors associated with the development of early onset breast cancer was collected using a questionnaire in a face-to-face interview. The distribution of the risk factors associated with the development of early onset breast cancer between the patient group and the control group was analyzed with logistic regression. A total of 582 cases of young patients (</=40 years old) with breast cancer and 540 controls of young patients (</=40 years old) with benign breast disease were included in this study. The risk factors for breast cancer in young women include age at first birth (odds ratio [OR] = 0.93, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.88-0.98), history of breast cancer in an immediate family member (OR = 2.36, 95% CI: 1.14-4.89), history of genital surgery (OR = 2.11, 95% CI: 1.16-3.82), active and passive smoking in daily life or the environment (OR = 1.64, 95% CI: 1.19-2.25), weekly intake of soy products (OR = 1.24, 95% CI: 1.02-1.49), use of household cooking oil (OR = 2.04, 95% CI: 1.04-4.00), disharmonious marital status (OR = 1.16, 95% CI: 1.06-1.26), frequent depression (OR = 1.32, 95% CI: 1.00-1.75), and negative emotional experiences (OR = 1.15, 95% CI: 1.03-1.29). Our study could provide the basis for risk assessment and preventive interventions for early onset breast cancer.
27977253	Reducing disparities and achieving equity in African American women's health.	The colloquial phrase "Black Don't Crack" refers to perceptions of African American women retaining youthful features over time and seemingly defying the aging process. This conjecture appears to only be skin deep, as across almost every health indicator, African American women fare worse than women in other racial/ethnic groups. African American women experience excess morbidity in obesity, diabetes, and adverse birth outcomes, and are more likely than women of other ethnic groups to die from breast and cervical cancer, cardiovascular disease, and HIV/AIDS. This article provides an overview of social, biological, psychological, and cultural factors that contribute to African American women's health. Attention is directed to cultural factors that are both protective and risky for African American women's health. There is a need to garner a better understanding of the complex nature of health disparities experienced by African American women in order to move the field forward in making progress toward achieving health equity for this population. This article addresses this need and offers recommendations for translating science in this area into meaningful population level impact. (PsycINFO Database Record
27975070	Overexpression of MMP-3 and uPA with Diminished PAI-1 Related to Metastasis in Ductal Breast Cancer Patients Attending a Public Hospital in Mexico City.	Extracellular matrix metalloproteases and the fibrinolytic system are important protease systems interacting with each other in charge of remodeling and recycling of tissues. Their role in tumor invasion and metastasis is often discussed. In this study several metalloproteases such as MMP-1, MMP-3, MMP-9, and TIMP-1 together with molecules from the fibrinolytic system like uPA, its receptor uPAR, and its inhibitor, PAI-1, were studied by immune-histochemistry to establish a comparison with and without metastasis. From the (118) primary tumors of Mexican patients with ductal breast cancer studied, 56% were grade II and 69% were size T2; the group with metastatic ganglia included 64 samples (54.3%). In patients with metastasis the estimated expression of MMP-3 and uPA (resp., 28% and 45%) was higher than that from no metastatic tumors; it means there is higher expression of both markers in metastatic tumors (p < 0.05). At the same time, metastatic tumors showed statistically significant lower signal of PAI-1 (24%) than tumors without metastasis (p < 0.05). We concluded that overexpression of MMP-3 and uPA, altogether with diminished expression of PAI-1 from metastatic tumors, might be a crucial step towards metastasis in ductal breast cancer. Nevertheless, additional studies in different populations are necessary to establish a pattern.
27974927	Development of new immunotherapy treatments in different cancer types.	Cancer immunotherapy involves the use of therapeutic modalities that determine a manipulation of the immune system by using immune agents such as cytokines, vaccines, cell therapies and humoral, transfection agents. Immunotherapy of cancer has to stimulate the host's anti-tumor response by increasing the effector cell number and the production of soluble mediators and decrease the host's suppressor mechanisms by inducing tumor killing environment and by modulating immune checkpoints. Immunotherapy seems to work better in more immunogenic tumors. Making a review of literature, the article presents the new immunologic treatments in cancers less presented in the latest conferences, cancers in which, immunotherapy is still under investigation. Bladder cancer was the first indication for which immunotherapy was used in 1970. A promising clinical research in bladder cancer is the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors. Although breast cancer is considered immunologically silent, several preclinical and clinical studies suggested that immunotherapy has the potential to improve the clinical outcomes for patients with breast cancer. Cervical cancer, brain cancer, head and neck cancer and colorectal and esophageal cancers are cancer types for which new immune-based cancer treatments are currently under development. Recent agents used in clinical trials will be described in before mentioned cancers.
27974914	Modulating the extension of axillary lymphadenectomy for early stage breast cancer.	Axillary lymph node evaluation remains essential in breast cancer surgery, first as a prognostic factor, because it indicates the degree of dissemination of the disease to the main lymphatic drainage basin of the breast, and, on the other hand, as an element of preventing the local relapse. In the era of the sentinel lymph node, complete axillary lymphadenectomy, considered valuable until recently, but as therapeutic and diagnostic, has become an intervention performed increasingly rare in selected cases. Axillary lymphatic tissue resections are accompanied by morbidity (lymphedema, paresthesia, limitations of arm movement) and symptom magnitude is proportional to the extension of the intervention. For this reason, a solution to avoid these kinds of complications was looked for. Since Gould, in 1960, who mentioned cancer parotid and continuing with Cabanas, Morton, or Veronesi, many surgeons have contributed to the development of safe techniques with which the multidisciplinary team involved in the surgical treatment for breast cancer could perform a safe oncological intervention and at the same time could conserve the healthy tissue, thus limiting morbidity. To achieve this standard, axillary lymphadenectomy has passed through several stages, from over radical interventions that followed the Halsted era, in which, besides axillary lymph nodes, the internal mammary and jugulo-carotidian lymph nodes were excised, to the absence of axillary surgery and replacing it with radiation therapy.
27974911	The etiopathogenesis of uterine fibromatosis.	Uterine fibroids or uterine leiomyomas are the most common benign tumors of the uterus among women of fertile age, while the etiology is still incompletely elucidated. The occurrence and development of the fibromatosis may be related to certain risk factors and genic mechanisms, although the exact causes are not yet fully known. The development of uterine fibroids is correlated not only with the metabolism and with the level of female sexual hormones, estrogen, and progesterone, but also with the number of these hormone receptors expressed on the surface of the myometrium. Proliferative effects of estrogen and progesterone may be exercised through proinflammatory factors (TNF alpha), growth factors (IGF1, IGF2, TGFbeta3 and betaFGF) or inhibitors of apoptosis (p53 suppression). A number of predisposing factors such as ethnicity - black skin, early menarche, nulliparity, caffeine and alcohol, chronic inflammation, obesity, were also identified. Approximately 40% of the uterine fibroids are caused by the same cytogenetic alterations found in the other tumor types such as kidney, lung, or leiomyosarcoma. As part of a system dysfunction, uterine fibromatosis was connected to other disorders such as AHT (arterial hypertension), endometrium adenocarcinoma, adenomyosis, endometriosis, diabetes mellitus, breast tumors, seemingly with a common causality. The action and effect of some hormonal imbalances over the various organs depend on the histological and local expression particularities of the various receptors, being the cause for many disorders, among which the uterine fibromatosis, coexisting or accompanying the later. This article examines and summarizes the latest data refreshed literature etiopathogenesis offering indicators of uterine fibroids.
27974793	Targeting metastasis-initiating cells through the fatty acid receptor CD36.	The fact that the identity of the cells that initiate metastasis in most human cancers is unknown hampers the development of antimetastatic therapies. Here we describe a subpopulation of CD44bright cells in human oral carcinomas that do not overexpress mesenchymal genes, are slow-cycling, express high levels of the fatty acid receptor CD36 and lipid metabolism genes, and are unique in their ability to initiate metastasis. Palmitic acid or a high-fat diet specifically boosts the metastatic potential of CD36+ metastasis-initiating cells in a CD36-dependent manner. The use of neutralizing antibodies to block CD36 causes almost complete inhibition of metastasis in immunodeficient or immunocompetent orthotopic mouse models of human oral cancer, with no side effects. Clinically, the presence of CD36+ metastasis-initiating cells correlates with a poor prognosis for numerous types of carcinomas, and inhibition of CD36 also impairs metastasis, at least in human melanoma- and breast cancer-derived tumours. Together, our results indicate that metastasis-initiating cells particularly rely on dietary lipids to promote metastasis.
27974484	Buprenorphine, Norbuprenorphine, R-Methadone, and S-Methadone Upregulate BCRP/ABCG2 Expression by Activating Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor in Human Placental Trophoblasts.	Opioid dependence during pregnancy is a rising concern. Maintaining addicted pregnant women on long-acting opioid receptor agonist is the most common strategy to manage drug abuse in pregnant women. Methadone (MET) and buprenorphine (BUP) are widely prescribed for opiate maintenance therapy. Norbuprenorphine (NBUP) is the primary active metabolite of BUP. These medications can cross the placenta to the fetus, leading to postpartum neonatal abstinence syndrome. Despite their use during pregnancy, little is known about the cellular changes in the placenta brought about by these drugs. In this study, we showed that BUP, NBUP, and MET at clinically relevant plasma concentrations significantly induced BCRP mRNA up to 10-fold in human model placental JEG3 and BeWo cells and in primary human villous trophoblasts, and this induction was abrogated by CH223191, an aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR)-specific antagonist. These drugs increased AhR recruitment onto the AhR-response elements and significantly induced breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) gene transcription. AhR overexpression further increased BCRP mRNA and protein expression. Knockdown of AhR by shRNA decreased BCRP expression, and this decrease was reversed by rescuing AhR expression. Finally, induction of BCRP expression in JEG3 and BeWo cells was accompanied by an increase in its efflux activity. Collectively, we have demonstrated, for the first time, that BUP, NBUP, and MET are potent AhR agonists and can induce BCRP in human placental trophoblasts by activating AhR. Given the critical role of BCRP in limiting fetal exposure to drugs and xenobiotics, long-term use of these medications may affect fetal drug exposure by altering BCRP expression in human placenta.
27974323	Do celebrity endorsements matter? Observational study of BRCA gene testing and mastectomy rates after Angelina Jolie's New York Times editorial.	OBJECTIVE: To examine the effect on BRCA testing and mastectomy rates of a widely viewed 2013 New York Times editorial by public figure Angelina Jolie that endorsed BRCA testing and announced Jolie's decision to undergo preventive mastectomy. DESIGN: Observational study with difference-in-difference analysis. SETTING: Commercially insured US population. PARTICIPANTS: Women aged 18-64 years with claims in the Truven MarketScan commercial claims database (n=9 532 836). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Changes in BRCA testing rates in the 15 business days before versus after 14 May 2013 (editorial date) compared with the change in the same period in 2012; mastectomy rates in the months before and after publication, both overall and within 60 days of BRCA testing among women who were tested; national estimates of incremental tests and expenditures associated with Jolie's article in the 15 days after publication. RESULTS: Daily BRCA test rates increased immediately after the 2013 editorial, from 0.71 tests/100 000 women in the 15 business days before to 1.13 tests/100 000 women in the 15 business days after publication. In comparison, daily test rates were similar in the same period in 2012 (0.58/100 000 women in the 15 business days before 14 May versus 0.55/100 000 women in the 15 business days after), implying a difference-in-difference absolute daily increase of 0.45 tests/100 000 women or a 64% relative increase (P<0.001). The editorial was associated with an estimated increase of 4500 BRCA tests and $13.5m ( pound10.8m; euro12.8) expenditure nationally among commercially insured adult women in those 15 days. Increased BRCA testing rates were sustained throughout 2013. Overall mastectomy rates remained unchanged in the months after publication, but 60 day mastectomy rates among women who had a BRCA test fell from 10% in the months before publication to 7% in the months after publication, suggesting that women who underwent tests as a result of to the editorial had a lower pre-test probability of having the BRCA mutation than women tested before the editorial. CONCLUSIONS: Celebrity endorsements can have a large and immediate effect on use of health services. Such announcements can be a low cost means of reaching a broad audience quickly, but they may not effectively target the subpopulations that are most at risk for the relevant underlying condition.
27973439	Down-Regulation of Ca2+-Activated K(+) Channel KCa1.1 in Human Breast Cancer MDA-MB-453 Cells Treated with Vitamin D Receptor Agonists.	Vitamin D (VD) reduces the risk of breast cancer and improves disease prognoses. Potential VD analogs are being developed as therapeutic agents for breast cancer treatments. The large-conductance Ca2+-activated K(+) channel KCa1.1 regulates intracellular Ca2+ signaling pathways and is associated with high grade tumors and poor prognoses. In the present study, we examined the effects of treatments with VD receptor (VDR) agonists on the expression and activity of KCa1.1 in human breast cancer MDA-MB-453 cells using real-time PCR, Western blotting, flow cytometry, and voltage-sensitive dye imaging. Treatments with VDR agonists for 72 h markedly decreased the expression levels of KCa1.1 transcripts and proteins in MDA-MB-453 cells, resulting in the significant inhibition of depolarization responses induced by paxilline, a specific KCa1.1 blocker. The specific proteasome inhibitor MG132 suppressed VDR agonist-induced decreases in KCa1.1 protein expression. These results suggest that KCa1.1 is a new downstream target of VDR signaling and the down-regulation of KCa1.1 through the transcriptional repression of KCa1.1 and enhancement of KCa1.1 protein degradation contribute, at least partly, to the antiproliferative effects of VDR agonists in breast cancer cells.
27969575	Women's preferences for contralateral prophylactic mastectomy following unilateral breast cancer: What risk-reduction makes it worthwhile?	OBJECTIVES: Contralateral prophylactic mastectomy (CPM) reduces the risk of contralateral breast cancer (BC) following unilateral BC, but may not increase survival in BRCA1/2 mutation negative women. Despite this, and the risk for adverse physical and psychological impact, uptake is increasing in BRCA1/2 mutation negative women. We aimed to quantify the degree of reduction in lifetime contralateral BC risk women required to justify CPM, and to explore demographic, disease and psychosocial predictors of preferences using Protection Motivation Theory (PMT) as a theoretical framework. Reasoning behind preferences was also examined. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 388 women previously diagnosed with unilateral BC, of negative or unknown BRCA1/2 status, were recruited from an advocacy group research database. Two hypothetical risk trade-off scenarios were used to quantify the reduction in lifetime contralateral BC risk that women judged necessary to justify CPM, using a 5% and 20% baseline. Demographic, disease and PMT measures were assessed using a questionnaire. RESULTS: Most women required their risk to be more than halved from a 5% or 20% baseline to justify CPM. Polarised preferences were also common, with some women consistently accepting or refusing CPM independent of risk/benefit trade-offs. Preferences were associated with coping self-efficacy and having a prior CPM. Explanations for judging CPM worthwhile included reducing or eliminating contralateral BC risk, attaining breast symmetry and reducing worry. CONCLUSION: Risk-reduction preferences were highly variable. Decisive factors in women's preferences for CPM related to clinical, psychological and cosmetic outcomes, but not to demographic or disease characteristics.
27966220	Semi-automated delineation of breast cancer tumors and subsequent materialization using three-dimensional printing (rapid prototyping).	OBJECTIVE: Three-dimensional (3D) printing has become widely available, and a few cases of its use in clinical practice have been described. The aim of this study was to explore facilities for the semi-automated delineation of breast cancer tumors and to assess the feasibility of 3D printing of breast cancer tumors. METHODS: In a case series of five patients, different 3D imaging methods-magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT), and 3D ultrasound-were used to capture 3D data for breast cancer tumors. The volumes of the breast tumors were calculated to assess the comparability of the breast tumor models, and the MRI information was used to render models on a commercially available 3D printer to materialize the tumors. RESULTS: The tumor volumes calculated from the different 3D methods appeared to be comparable. Tumor models with volumes between 325 mm3 and 7,770 mm3 were printed and compared with the models rendered from MRI. The materialization of the tumors reflected the computer models of them. CONCLUSION: 3D printing (rapid prototyping) appears to be feasible. Scenarios for the clinical use of the technology might include presenting the model to the surgeon to provide a better understanding of the tumor's spatial characteristics in the breast, in order to improve decision-making in relation to neoadjuvant chemotherapy or surgical approaches.

27966219	Oncofertility program implementation increases access to fertility preservation options and assisted reproductive procedures for breast cancer patients.	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Breast cancer treatment can cause premature ovarian failure, yet the majority of young cancer patients do not receive adequate education about treatment effects before initiating chemotherapy. We studied the impact of an oncofertility program on access to fertility preservation. METHODS: An oncofertility program was initiated to foster collaboration between oncologists and reproductive endocrinologists, and to help increase access to fertility preservation. Documented conversations about fertility concerns, specialist referrals, appointments, and fertility preservation procedures were compared between breast cancer patients from 2004 to 2006, before oncofertility program initiation, and 2007-2012, after program initiation. The study included women <45, stages 0-III, diagnosed before (n = 278) and after (n = 515) program initiation. RESULTS: Demographics for the cohorts were similar. Fertility discussions (P < 0.0001), patients interested in maintaining fertility at diagnosis (P = 0.0041), referrals to reproductive endocrinologists (P < 0.0001), appointments (P < 0.0001), and fertility preservation procedures (P < 0.0183) increased significantly after programmatic implementation. CONCLUSIONS: An oncofertility program increased discussions about fertility preservation and access to assisted reproductive procedures. This program positively impacted compliance with national guidelines advising reproductive-age cancer patients to be offered fertility preservation counseling as an initial component of the multidisciplinary care plan.

27965916	In Vivo Flow Cytometry of Circulating Tumor-Associated Exosomes.	Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) demonstrated the potential as prognostic markers of metastatic development. However, the incurable metastasis can already be developed at the time of initial diagnosis with the existing CTC assays. Alternatively, tumor-associated particles (CTPs) including exosomes can be a more valuable prognostic marker because they can be released from the primary tumor long before CTCs and in larger amount. However, little progress has been made in high sensitivity detection of CTPs, especially in vivo. We show here that in vivo integrated photoacoustic (PA) and fluorescence flow cytometry (PAFFC) platform can provide the detection of melanoma and breast-cancer-associated single CTPs with endogenously expressed melanin and genetically engineered proteins or exogenous dyes as PA and fluorescent contrast agents. The two-beam, time-of-light PAFFC can measure the sizes of CTCs and CTPs and identify bulk and rolling CTCs and CTC clusters, with no influence on blood flow instability. This technique revealed a higher concentration of CTPs than CTCs at an early cancer stage. Because a single tumor cell can release many CTPs and in vivo PAFFC can examine the whole blood volume, PAFFC diagnostic platform has the potential to dramatically improve (up to 105-fold) the sensitivity of cancer diagnosis.
27964748	Non-coding single nucleotide variants affecting estrogen receptor binding and activity.	BACKGROUND: Estrogen receptor (ER) activity is critical for the development and progression of the majority of breast cancers. It is known that ER is differentially bound to DNA leading to transcriptomic and phenotypic changes in different breast cancer models. We investigated whether single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in ER binding sites (regSNVs) contribute to ER action through changes in the ER cistrome, thereby affecting disease progression. Here we developed a computational pipeline to identify SNVs in ER binding sites using chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) data from ER+ breast cancer models. METHODS: ER ChIP-seq data were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). GATK pipeline was used to identify SNVs and the MACS algorithm was employed to call DNA-binding sites. Determination of the potential effect of a given SNV in a binding site was inferred using reimplementation of the is-rSNP algorithm. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data were integrated to correlate the regSNVs and gene expression in breast tumors. ChIP and luciferase assays were used to assess the allele-specific binding. RESULTS: Analysis of ER ChIP-seq data from MCF7 cells identified an intronic SNV in the IGF1R gene, rs62022087, predicted to increase ER binding. Functional studies confirmed that ER binds preferentially to rs62022087 versus the wild-type allele. By integrating 43 ER ChIP-seq datasets, multi-omics, and clinical data, we identified 17 regSNVs associated with altered expression of adjacent genes in ER+ disease. Of these, the top candidate was in the promoter of the GSTM1 gene and was associated with higher expression of GSTM1 in breast tumors. Survival analysis of patients with ER+ tumors revealed that higher expression of GSTM1, responsible for detoxifying carcinogens, was correlated with better outcome. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, we have developed a computational approach that is capable of identifying putative regSNVs in ER ChIP-binding sites. These non-coding variants could potentially regulate target genes and may contribute to clinical prognosis in breast cancer.
27960236	Radiation-associated neoplasia: clinical, pathological and genomic correlates.	Ionizing radiation is an established risk factor for the development of benign and malignant tumours. The epidemiology of radiation-associated neoplasia has been studied over the decades in diverse populations, including Japanese atomic bomb survivors, exposed communities following the Chernobyl nuclear power plant disaster, and paediatric and adult populations receiving therapeutic irradiation. Radiation has been associated with an increased risk of neoplasia throughout the human body, with some sites showing a markedly increased relative risk of developing tumours (thyroid; soft tissues), depending on patient age and the context of exposure. Although the mechanisms of cellular injury and repair resulting from ionizing radiation are well described, the genomics of radiation-induced tumours are still relatively poorly understood, with some exceptions, such as RET rearrangement in thyroid carcinomas following iodine-131 exposure and MYC amplification in cutaneous angiosarcoma following chest wall irradiation for breast cancer. This review will provide a general overview of the epidemiology, molecular mechanism, pathology and genomics of radiation-associated neoplasia in humans.
27960235	Modern therapies and iatrogenic changes in breast pathology.	Iatrogenic changes within the breast can provide challenges for the histopathologist in routine practice. Diagnostic procedures, such as core biopsies, result in reactive changes and can cause displacement of benign and malignant cells, the interpretation of which may cause difficulties in the resection specimen. Breast augmentation surgery with implants or injection of fillers, performed for cosmetic reasons or as part of a reconstructive process following removal of breast cancer, also produces reactive changes locally and at distant sites that may mimic cancer. The entity of implant-associated anaplastic large-cell lymphoma is now well recognized, with progress in our understanding of the underlying biological factors that drive its development. Chemotherapy and radiotherapy used in the treatment of breast cancer causes characteristic changes in normal breast tissue, and can alter the histological appearance and receptor status of the tumour. Radiotherapy to the breast, for breast cancer or childhood malignancies, increases the risk of developing a secondary malignancy in the breast long after treatment. In this review, we describe some of the iatrogenic changes that may be seen in histological specimens from the breast.
27960229	Automated telephone communication systems for preventive healthcare and management of long-term conditions.	BACKGROUND: Automated telephone communication systems (ATCS) can deliver voice messages and collect health-related information from patients using either their telephone's touch-tone keypad or voice recognition software. ATCS can supplement or replace telephone contact between health professionals and patients. There are four different types of ATCS: unidirectional (one-way, non-interactive voice communication), interactive voice response (IVR) systems, ATCS with additional functions such as access to an expert to request advice (ATCS Plus) and multimodal ATCS, where the calls are delivered as part of a multicomponent intervention. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of ATCS for preventing disease and managing long-term conditions on behavioural change, clinical, process, cognitive, patient-centred and adverse outcomes. SEARCH METHODS: We searched 10 electronic databases (the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials; MEDLINE; Embase; PsycINFO; CINAHL; Global Health; WHOLIS; LILACS; Web of Science; and ASSIA); three grey literature sources (Dissertation Abstracts, Index to Theses, Australasian Digital Theses); and two trial registries (www.controlled-trials.com; www.clinicaltrials.gov) for papers published between 1980 and June 2015. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised, cluster- and quasi-randomised trials, interrupted time series and controlled before-and-after studies comparing ATCS interventions, with any control or another ATCS type were eligible for inclusion. Studies in all settings, for all consumers/carers, in any preventive healthcare or long term condition management role were eligible. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used standard Cochrane methods to select and extract data and to appraise eligible studies. MAIN RESULTS: We included 132 trials (N = 4,669,689). Studies spanned across several clinical areas, assessing many comparisons based on evaluation of different ATCS types and variable comparison groups. Forty-one studies evaluated ATCS for delivering preventive healthcare, 84 for managing long-term conditions, and seven studies for appointment reminders. We downgraded our certainty in the evidence primarily because of the risk of bias for many outcomes. We judged the risk of bias arising from allocation processes to be low for just over half the studies and unclear for the remainder. We considered most studies to be at unclear risk of performance or detection bias due to blinding, while only 16% of studies were at low risk. We generally judged the risk of bias due to missing data and selective outcome reporting to be unclear.For preventive healthcare, ATCS (ATCS Plus, IVR, unidirectional) probably increase immunisation uptake in children (risk ratio (RR) 1.25, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.18 to 1.32; 5 studies, N = 10,454; moderate certainty) and to a lesser extent in adolescents (RR 1.06, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.11; 2 studies, N = 5725; moderate certainty). The effects of ATCS in adults are unclear (RR 2.18, 95% CI 0.53 to 9.02; 2 studies, N = 1743; very low certainty).For screening, multimodal ATCS increase uptake of screening for breast cancer (RR 2.17, 95% CI 1.55 to 3.04; 2 studies, N = 462; high certainty) and colorectal cancer (CRC) (RR 2.19, 95% CI 1.88 to 2.55; 3 studies, N = 1013; high certainty) versus usual care. It may also increase osteoporosis screening. ATCS Plus interventions probably slightly increase cervical cancer screening (moderate certainty), but effects on osteoporosis screening are uncertain. IVR systems probably increase CRC screening at 6 months (RR 1.36, 95% CI 1.25 to 1.48; 2 studies, N = 16,915; moderate certainty) but not at 9 to 12 months, with probably little or no effect of IVR (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.99, 1.11; 2 studies, 2599 participants; moderate certainty) or unidirectional ATCS on breast cancer screening.Appointment reminders delivered through IVR or unidirectional ATCS may improve attendance rates compared with no calls (low certainty). For long-term management, medication or laboratory test adherence provided the most general evidence across conditions (25 studies, data not combined). Multimodal ATCS versus usual care showed conflicting effects (positive and uncertain) on medication adherence. ATCS Plus probably slightly (versus control; moderate certainty) or probably (versus usual care; moderate certainty) improves medication adherence but may have little effect on adherence to tests (versus control). IVR probably slightly improves medication adherence versus control (moderate certainty). Compared with usual care, IVR probably improves test adherence and slightly increases medication adherence up to six months but has little or no effect at longer time points (moderate certainty). Unidirectional ATCS, compared with control, may have little effect or slightly improve medication adherence (low certainty). The evidence suggested little or no consistent effect of any ATCS type on clinical outcomes (blood pressure control, blood lipids, asthma control, therapeutic coverage) related to adherence, but only a small number of studies contributed clinical outcome data.The above results focus on areas with the most general findings across conditions. In condition-specific areas, the effects of ATCS varied, including by the type of ATCS intervention in use.Multimodal ATCS probably decrease both cancer pain and chronic pain as well as depression (moderate certainty), but other ATCS types were less effective. Depending on the type of intervention, ATCS may have small effects on outcomes for physical activity, weight management, alcohol consumption, and diabetes mellitus. ATCS have little or no effect on outcomes related to heart failure, hypertension, mental health or smoking cessation, and there is insufficient evidence to determine their effects for preventing alcohol/substance misuse or managing illicit drug addiction, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, HIV/AIDS, hypercholesterolaemia, obstructive sleep apnoea, spinal cord dysfunction or psychological stress in carers.Only four trials (3%) reported adverse events, and it was unclear whether these were related to the interventions. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: ATCS interventions can change patients' health behaviours, improve clinical outcomes and increase healthcare uptake with positive effects in several important areas including immunisation, screening, appointment attendance, and adherence to medications or tests. The decision to integrate ATCS interventions in routine healthcare delivery should reflect variations in the certainty of the evidence available and the size of effects across different conditions, together with the varied nature of ATCS interventions assessed. Future research should investigate both the content of ATCS interventions and the mode of delivery; users' experiences, particularly with regard to acceptability; and clarify which ATCS types are most effective and cost-effective.
27960127	Management of hot flashes in women with breast cancer receiving ovarian function suppression.	Most breast cancers express estrogen and/or progesterone receptors, allowing the opportunity to use anti-estrogen therapies, which have demonstrated substantial efficacy in both the metastatic and adjuvant settings. Young premenopausal women with early-stage high-risk or with metastatic hormone-receptor positive breast cancer may benefit from ovarian function suppression in addition to anti-estrogen medications. While these endocrine manipulations have successfully improved breast cancer outcomes, they may lead to a significant proportion of women experiencing vasomotor symptoms. While not life-threatening, vasomotor symptoms adversely impact quality of life and can result in early treatment discontinuation. For these reasons, supportive management of this treatment-related toxicity is crucial, and clinicians caring for breast cancer patients and survivors should be familiar with the options available and the data behind them. This manuscript will review the pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, quality of life implications and non-estrogenic management options of vasomotor symptoms for women with breast cancer undergoing estrogen depletion.
27959613	Palbociclib and Letrozole in Advanced Breast Cancer.	BACKGROUND: A phase 2 study showed that progression-free survival was longer with palbociclib plus letrozole than with letrozole alone in the initial treatment of postmenopausal women with estrogen-receptor (ER)-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative advanced breast cancer. We performed a phase 3 study that was designed to confirm and expand the efficacy and safety data for palbociclib plus letrozole for this indication. METHODS: In this double-blind study, we randomly assigned, in a 2:1 ratio, 666 postmenopausal women with ER-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer, who had not had prior treatment for advanced disease, to receive palbociclib plus letrozole or placebo plus letrozole. The primary end point was progression-free survival, as assessed by the investigators; secondary end points were overall survival, objective response, clinical benefit response, patient-reported outcomes, pharmacokinetic effects, and safety. RESULTS: The median progression-free survival was 24.8 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 22.1 to not estimable) in the palbociclib-letrozole group, as compared with 14.5 months (95% CI, 12.9 to 17.1) in the placebo-letrozole group (hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.46 to 0.72; P<0.001). The most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events were neutropenia (occurring in 66.4% of the patients in the palbociclib-letrozole group vs. 1.4% in the placebo-letrozole group), leukopenia (24.8% vs. 0%), anemia (5.4% vs. 1.8%), and fatigue (1.8% vs. 0.5%). Febrile neutropenia was reported in 1.8% of patients in the palbociclib-letrozole group and in none of the patients in the placebo-letrozole group. Permanent discontinuation of any study treatment as a result of adverse events occurred in 43 patients (9.7%) in the palbociclib-letrozole group and in 13 patients (5.9%) in the placebo-letrozole group. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with previously untreated ER-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer, palbociclib combined with letrozole resulted in significantly longer progression-free survival than that with letrozole alone, although the rates of myelotoxic effects were higher with palbociclib-letrozole.

27959582	RAI1 Alternate Probe Identifies Additional Breast Cancer Cases as Amplified Following Equivocal HER2 Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization Testing: Experience From a National Reference Laboratory.	CONTEXT: -In 2013 the American Society of Clinical Oncology and College of American Pathologists updated the HER2 guidelines and changed the equivocal category for HER2 in situ hybridization testing to an average HER2 copy number of 4.0 to 5.9 with a HER2:CEP17 ratio of less than 2.0 and proposed retesting, with an option of using another control probe to avoid false-negative results. RAI1, located at band position 17p11.2, is a popular alternate probe locus for retesting equivocal changes. OBJECTIVE: -To review experience with the RAI1 alternate probe in HER2 fluorescence in situ hybridization equivocal breast cancers. DESIGN: -Primary and metastatic breast cancers with equivocal HER2 fluorescence in situ hybridization, retested with an alternate (RAI1) probe, were identified. HER2, RAI1, and CEP17 copy numbers, HER2 to control probe ratios, and genetic heterogeneity were recorded. Hematoxylin-eosin-stained slides were reviewed for type and grade of cancer. RESULTS: -Of 876 cases tested with CEP17 as the reference probe, 97 (11.1%) had equivocal HER2 fluorescence in situ hybridization results. Additional testing with the RAI1 probe classified 39.2% cases (38 of 97) as amplified with a HER2:RAI1 ratio ranging from 2.0 to 3.2 (mean, 2.37); 3.1% (3 of 97) were still unclassifiable because of a deletion of RAI1. CONCLUSIONS: -RAI1 identified close to 40% of original HER2 fluorescence in situ hybridization equivocal cases as amplified, making these patients eligible for targeted therapies. It is not known whether guidelines for US Food and Drug Administration-approved probes can be extrapolated to alternate probes when an alternate control probe shows losses or gains. Because of the lack of guidelines for reporting HER2 status with alternate probes, laboratories face challenges in interpreting results.
27959581	Quality Assurance in Breast Pathology: Lessons Learned From a Review of Amended Reports.	CONTEXT: -A review of amended pathology reports provides valuable information regarding defects in the surgical pathology process. OBJECTIVE: -To review amended breast pathology reports with emphasis placed on interpretative errors and their mechanisms of detection. DESIGN: -All amended pathology reports for breast surgical specimens for a 5-year period at a large academic medical center were retrospectively identified and classified based on an established taxonomy. RESULTS: -Of 12 228 breast pathology reports, 122 amended reports were identified. Most (88 cases; 72%) amendments were due to noninterpretative errors, including 58 report defects, 12 misidentifications, and 3 specimen defects. A few (34 cases; 27.9%) were classified as misinterpretations, including 14 major diagnostic changes (11.5% of all amendments). Among major changes, there were cases of missed microinvasion or small foci of invasion, missed micrometastasis, atypical ductal hyperplasia overcalled as ductal carcinoma in situ, ductal carcinoma in situ involving sclerosing adenosis mistaken for invasive carcinoma, lymphoma mistaken for invasive carcinoma, and amyloidosis misdiagnosed as fat necrosis. Nine major changes were detected at interpretation of receptor studies and were not associated with clinical consequences. Three cases were associated with clinical consequences, and of note, the same pathologist interpreted the corresponding receptor studies. CONCLUSIONS: -Review of amended reports was a useful method for identifying error frequencies, types, and methods of detection. Any time that a case is revisited for ancillary studies or other reasons, it is an opportunity for the surgical pathologist to reconsider one's own or another's diagnosis.
27959426	17beta-estradiol-induced growth of triple-negative breast cancer cells is prevented by the reduction of GPER expression after treatment with gefitinib.	Triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs) are neither susceptible to endocrine therapy due to a lack of estrogen receptor alpha expression nor trastuzumab. TNBCs frequently overexpress epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and membrane bound estrogen receptor, GPER. To a certain extent the growth of TNBCs is stimulated by 17beta-estradiol via GPER. We analyzed whether inhibition of EGFR by gefitinib reduces the expression of GPER and subsequent signal transduction in TNBC cells. Dependence of proliferation on 17beta-estradiol was determined using Alamar Blue assay. Expression of GPR30 and activation of c-src, EGFR and cAMP-responsive element binding (CREB) protein by 17beta-estradiol was analyzed by western blotting. Expression of c-fos, cyclin D1 and aromatase was determined using RT-PCR. Gefitinib reduced GPER expression concentration and timedependently. In HCC70 cells, GPER expression was reduced to 15+/-11% (p<0.05) after treatment with 200 nM gefitinib for four days, and in HCC1806 cells GPER expression was reduced to 39+/-5% (p<0.01) of the control. 17beta-estradiol significantly increased the percentage of HCC1806 cells within 7 days to 145+/-29% of the control (HCC70, 110+/-8%). This increase in cell growth was completely prevented in both TNBC cell lines after GPR30 expression was downregulated by treatment with 200 nM gefitinib. In HCC1806 cells, activation of c-src was increased by 17beta-estradiol to 350+/-50% (p<0.01), and gefitinib reduced src activation to 110%. Similar results were obtained in the HCC70 cells. Phosphorylation of EGFR increased to 240+/-40% (p<0.05) in the HCC1806 cells treated with 17beta-estradiol (HCC70, 147+/-25%). Gefitinib completely prevented this activation. Phosphorylation of CREB and induction of c-fos, cyclin D1 and aromatase expression by 17beta-estradiol were all prevented by gefitinib. These experiments conclusively show that reduction of GPER expression is a promising therapeutic approach for TNBC.
27959422	Luteolin suppresses the metastasis of triple-negative breast cancer by reversing epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition via downregulation of beta-catenin expression.	The metastasis of breast cancer is associated with dismal prognosis and high mortality due to the lack of effective treatment. Luteolin, a natural flavonoid compound, has been shown to exert antitumor activity in various types of cancers. However, the effects and mechanisms of luteolin on the metastasis of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) remain elusive. In the present study, we found that pretreatment of highly metastatic TNBC cell lines with luteolin dosedependently inhibited cell migration and invasion, and reversed epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) as determined by altered morphological characteristics, downregulated epithelial markers and upregulated mesenchymal markers, and inhibited EMT-related transcription factors. In an in vivo metastasis experiment using a xenograft model, luteolin markedly inhibited lung metastases of breast cancer and the expression of EMT molecules vimentin and Slug in primary tumor tissues. Notably, luteolin also suppressed the expression of beta-catenin mRNA and protein in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, overexpression of beta-catenin by adenoviruses blocked these benefits of luteolin on invasion and metastases of breast cancer. In conclusion, all these results indicated that luteolin effectively suppressed metastases of breast cancer by reversing EMT, which may be mediated by downregulation of beta-catenin.
27959418	CXCL7 promotes proliferation and invasion of cholangiocarcinoma cells.	CXCL7 is an important chemoattractant cytokine, which signals through binding to its receptor CXCR2. Recent studies have demonstrated that the CXCL7/CXCR2 signaling plays a promoting role in several common malignancies, including lung, renal, colon, and breast cancer. However, the regulatory role of CXCL7, in cholangiocarcinoma, as well as the underlying mechanism, has not been previously reported. Herein, we found more positive expression of CXCL7 in cholangiocarcinoma tissues compared to adjacent non-tumor tissues. High CXCL7 expression was significantly correlated with poor differentiation, lymph node metastasis, vascular invasion and advanced clinical stage, but was not associated with age, gender, or tumor size. Besides, the expression of CXCL7 was significantly associated with the Ki67 expression, but not associated with CA199, AFP, or P53 expression in cholangiocarcinoma. Moreover, the overall survival of cholangiocarcinoma patients with high CXCL7 expression was significantly shorter than those with low CXCL7 expression. In vitro study indicated that CXCL7 and CXCR2 were also positively expressed in several common cholangiocarcinoma cell lines, including HuCCT1, HuH28, QBC939, EGI-1, OZ and WITT. SiRNA-induced inhibition of CXCL7 significantly reduced the proliferation and invasion of QBC939 cells. On the contrary, overexpression of CXCL7 markedly promoted these malignant phenotypes of QBC939 cells. Of note, the conditioned medium of CXCL7-overexpresing human hepatic stellate cells could also promote the proliferation and invasion of QBC939 cells, suggesting that CXCL7 may also play an oncogenic role in cholangiocarcinoma in a paracrine-dependent manner, not only in an autocrine-dependent manner. Molecular assay data suggested that the AKT signaling pathway was involved in the CXCL7-mediated malignant phenotypes of QBC939 cells. In summary, our study suggests that CXCL7 plays a promoting role in regulating the growth and metastasis of cholangiocarcinoma.
27959407	Low-dose irradiation promotes proliferation of the human breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells through accumulation of mutant P53.	Low-dose irradiation (LDIR) has been proven to have differential biological effects on normal mammalian somatic cells and cancer cells. Our previous study showed that p53 gene status is a critical factor regulating the effect of LDIR on cancer cells. We investigated the effect of LDIR on the breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 that harbors a mutant p53 gene, and the normal breast fibroblast cell line Hs 578Bst. In the present study, we showed that 150 mGy LDIR pormoted growth of MDA-MB-231 cells but not Hs 578Bst cells. Through cell cycle analyses, we found that LDIR accelerated cell cycle into S phase in MDA-MB-231 cells, but did not affect the cell cycle of Hs 578Bst cells. Using western blotting, we demonstrated that the expression of CDK4, CDK6 and cyclin D1 was upregulated in MDA-MB-231 cells after LDIR. Although LDIR increased ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) level in both MDA-MB-231 cells and Hs 578Bst cells and activated ATM/p53/p21 pathway, only the mutant type of p53 (mtp53) protein in MDA-MB-231 cells was shown to be accumulated after LDIR. Using ATM inhibitor or lentivirus-mediated small interfering RNA (siRNA) to block the ATM/p53/p21 pathway in MDA-MB-231 cells, the LDIR-induced cell proliferation was abolished. When we introduced wild-type p53 (wtp53) protein into MDA-MB-231 cells, the LDIR-induced cell proliferation was also abolished. These findings suggest that normal p53 function is crucial in ATM/p53/p21 pathway activated by LDIR. The p53 status is the most probable reason leading to differential LDIR biological activities between breast tumor cells and normal breast cells.
27959398	Differential microRNA expression is associated with androgen receptor expression in breast cancer.	The androgen receptor (AR) is frequently expressed in breast cancer; however, its prognostic value remains unclear. AR expression in breast cancer has been associated with improved outcomes in estrogen receptor (ER)positive breast cancer compared with ERnegative disease. Eliminating AR function in breast cancer is critically important for breast cancer progression. However, the mechanism underlying AR regulation remains poorly understood. The study of microRNAs (miRNAs) has provided important insights into the pathogenesis of hormonedependent cancer. To determine whether miRNAs function in the AR regulation of breast cancer, the present study performed miRNA expression profiling in ARpositive and negative breast cancer cell lines. A total of 153 miRNAs were differentially expressed in ARpositive compared with ARnegative breast cancer cells; 52 were upregulated and 101 were downregulated. A number of these have been extensively associated with breast cancer cell functions, including proliferation, invasion and drugresistance. Furthermore, through pathway enrichment analysis, signaling pathways associated with the prediction targets of the miRNAs were characterized, including the vascular endothelial growth factor and mammalian target of rapamycin signaling pathways. In conclusion, the results of the present study indicated that the expression of miRNAs may be involved in the mechanism underlying AR regulation of breast cancer, and may improve understanding of the role of AR in breast cancer.
27959387	Long-term exposure of MCF-7 breast cancer cells to ethanol stimulates oncogenic features.	Alcohol consumption is a risk factor for breast cancer. Little is known regarding the mechanism, although it is assumed that acetaldehyde or estrogen mediated pathways play a role. We previously showed that long-term exposure to 2.5 mM ethanol (blood alcohol ~0.012%) of MCF-12A, a human normal epithelial breast cell line, induced epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) and oncogenic transformation. In this study, we investigated in the human breast cancer cell line MCF-7, whether a similar exposure to ethanol at concentrations ranging up to peak blood levels in heavy drinkers would increase malignant progression. Short-term (1-week) incubation to ethanol at as low as 1-5 mM (corresponding to blood alcohol concentration of ~0.0048-0.024%) upregulated the stem cell related proteins Oct4 and Nanog, but they were reduced after exposure at 25 mM. Long-term (4-week) exposure to 25 mM ethanol upregulated the Oct4 and Nanog proteins, as well as the malignancy marker Ceacam6. DNA microarray analysis in cells exposed for 1 week showed upregulated expression of metallothionein genes, particularly MT1X. Long-term exposure upregulated expression of some malignancy related genes (STEAP4, SERPINA3, SAMD9, GDF15, KRT15, ITGB6, TP63, and PGR, as well as the CEACAM, interferon related, and HLA gene families). Some of these findings were validated by RT-PCR. A similar treatment also modulated numerous microRNAs (miRs) including one regulator of Oct4 as well as miRs involved in oncogenesis and/or malignancy, with only a few estrogen-induced miRs. Long-term 25 mM ethanol also induced a 5.6-fold upregulation of anchorage-independent growth, an indicator of malignant-like features. Exposure to acetaldehyde resulted in little or no effect comparable to that of ethanol. The previously shown alcohol induction of oncogenic transformation of normal breast cells is now complemented by the current results suggesting alcohol's potential involvement in malignant progression of breast cancer.
27956098	Identification of natural allosteric inhibitor for Akt1 protein through computational approaches and in vitro evaluation.	Akt, a serine/threonine protein kinase, is often hyper activated in breast and prostate cancers, but with poor prognosis. Allosteric inhibitors regulate aberrant kinase activity by stabilizing the protein in inactive conformation. Several natural compounds have been reported as inhibitors for kinases. In this study, to identify potential natural allosteric inhibitor for Akt1, we generated a seven-point pharmacophore model and screened it through natural compound library. Quercetin-7-O-beta-d-glucopyranoside or Q7G was found to be the best among selected molecules based on its hydrogen bond occupancy with key allosteric residues, persistent polar contacts and salt bridges that stabilize Akt1 in inactive conformation and minimum binding free energy during molecular dynamics simulation. Q7G induced dose-dependent inhibition of breast cancer cells (MDA MB-231) and arrested them in G1 and sub-G phase. This was associated with down-regulation of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2, up-regulation of cleaved caspase-3 and PARP. Expression of p-Akt (Ser473) was also down-regulated which might be due to Akt1 inhibition in inactive conformation. We further confirmed the Akt1 and Q7G interaction which was observed to have a dissociation constant (Kd) of 0.246muM. With these computational, biological and thermodynamic studies, we suggest Q7G as a lead molecule and propose for its further optimization.
27955816	[Reappraisal role of locoregional radiation therapy in metastatic cancers].	Recent innovations in oncology area helped to improve the prognosis of certain cancers including metastatic ones with a decrease in mortality. Recommendations describe the treatment of metastatic cancer as systemic therapy or complementary care and the role of locoregional treatment in the treatment plan only occurs in a palliative context. Currently, in the clinical practice, out of "the evidence based medicine", an early locoregional therapy (surgery or radiation therapy) can be proposed in several cases of metastatic cancers. The aim of the present review is to describe the role of the primary tumor radiation therapy in metastatic disease. In metastatic breast, prostate, cervix, rectal or nasopharyngeal cancers, locoregional treatment including radiation therapy can, in some cases, be discussed and decided in MDT. Ongoing clinical trials in these locations should soon precise the benefit of this locoregional treatment. It will also be important to define the specific criteria in order to select patients who could benefit from this treatment.
27951629	Breast Density and Risk of Breast Cancer in Asian Women: A Meta-analysis of Observational Studies.	OBJECTIVES: The established theory that breast density is an independent predictor of breast cancer risk is based on studies targeting white women in the West. More Asian women than Western women have dense breasts, but the incidence of breast cancer is lower among Asian women. This meta-analysis investigated the association between breast density in mammography and breast cancer risk in Asian women. METHODS: PubMed and Scopus were searched, and the final date of publication was set as December 31, 2015. The effect size in each article was calculated using the interval-collapse method. Summary effect sizes (sESs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated by conducting a meta-analysis applying a random effect model. To investigate the dose-response relationship, random effect dose-response meta-regression (RE-DRMR) was conducted. RESULTS: Six analytical epidemiology studies in total were selected, including one cohort study and five case-control studies. A total of 17 datasets were constructed by type of breast density index and menopausal status. In analyzing the subgroups of premenopausal vs. postmenopausal women, the percent density (PD) index was confirmed to be associated with a significantly elevated risk for breast cancer (sES, 2.21; 95% CI, 1.52 to 3.21; I2=50.0%). The RE-DRMR results showed that the risk of breast cancer increased 1.73 times for each 25% increase in PD in postmenopausal women (95% CI, 1.20 to 2.47). CONCLUSIONS: In Asian women, breast cancer risk increased with breast density measured using the PD index, regardless of menopausal status. We propose the further development of a breast cancer risk prediction model based on the application of PD in Asian women.
27951628	The Effect of Breastfeeding Duration and Parity on the Risk of Epithelial Ovarian Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.	OBJECTIVES: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to summarize current evidence regarding the association of parity and duration of breastfeeding with the risk of epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). METHODS: A systematic search of relevant studies published by December 31, 2015 was performed in PubMed and EMBASE. A random-effect model was used to obtain the summary relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: Thirty-two studies had parity categories of 1, 2, and >/=3. The summary RRs for EOC were 0.72 (95% CI, 0.65 to 0.79), 0.57 (95% CI, 0.49 to 0.65), and 0.46 (95% CI, 0.41 to 0.52), respectively. Small to moderate heterogeneity was observed for one birth (p<0.01; Q=59.46; I2=47.9%). Fifteen studies had breastfeeding categories of <6 months, 6-12 months, and >13 months. The summary RRs were 0.79 (95% CI, 0.72 to 0.87), 0.72 (95% CI, 0.64 to 0.81), and 0.67 (95% CI, 0.56 to 0.79), respectively. Only small heterogeneity was observed for <6 months of breastfeeding (p=0.17; Q=18.79, I2=25.5%). Compared to nulliparous women with no history of breastfeeding, the joint effects of two births and <6 months of breastfeeding resulted in a 0.5-fold reduced risk for EOC. CONCLUSIONS: The first birth and breastfeeding for <6 months were associated with significant reductions in EOC risk.
27951487	Synthesis and antiproliferative activity of monocationic arylthiophene derivatives.	Eleven compounds of substituted 4-(5-arylthiophen-2-yl)benzamidines 4a-k were synthesized from their corresponding mononitriles via treatment with lithium trimethylsilylamide and subsequent de-protection with ethanol/hydrogen chloride. In vitro antiproliferative activities of the new monocationic arylthiophenes were evaluated against 60 human cell lines at NCI, USA. This class of compounds displayed promising submicromolar antiproliferative activities with the most potent compound being 4i (GI50 and TGI of 0.20 and 0.37 muM, respectively). On the other hand, most of the tested compounds exhibited LC50 at concentrations much higher than those they had GI50 at; approximately 10x (for 4b) up to 228x (for 4e) which indicates lower lethality and efficient growth inhibition. Cancer cell lines, HCC-2998 colon, SNB-75 CNS, MDA-MB-435 melanoma, and MCF-7 breast cancer were the most responsive, with GI50s of 0.156, 0.165, 0.163, and 0.168 muM, respectively. The p-chlorophenyl derivatives 4e and 4i discerned themselves with GI50 values at 0.36 and 0.20 muM, respectively, and LC50 values at approximately 83 and 36 muM, respectively, but safe to RBCs at 1000 muM. The cytotoxic activity data of these compounds in two normal cell lines; WI38 and WISH proved that they are very safe on normal cells. The plausible mechanism of action of the tested monocations was examined by evaluating their antioxidant power, nuclease-like DNA degradation aptitude and tyrosine kinase (TK) inhibition activities. The tested monocations showed potent activity in all assays. Compounds 4e and 4i caused 88 and 98%, respectively, inhibition in TK activity at 1 muM and the IC50 for 4i was 13 nM. The tested monocations have selective anticancer activity without insulting normal cells most probably due to inhibition of the key enzyme TK at nanomolar concentrations.
27951458	Clinical applicability and relevance of fibroglandular tissue segmentation on routine T1 weighted breast MRI.	PURPOSE: To evaluate clinical applicability of fibroglandular tissue (FGT) segmentation on routine T1 weighted breast MRI and compare FGT quantification with radiologist assessment. METHODS: FGT was segmented on 232 breasts and quantified, and was assessed qualitatively by four breast imagers. RESULTS: FGT segmentation was successful in all 232 breasts. Agreement between radiologists and quantified FGT was moderate to substantial (kappa=0.52-0.67); lower quantified FGT was associated with disagreement between radiologists and quantified FGT (P</=0.002). CONCLUSIONS: FGT segmentation was successful using routine T1 weighted breast MRI. Radiologists were less consistent with quantified results in breasts with lower quantified FGT.
27943450	Photobiomodulation therapy in breast cancer-related lymphedema: a randomized placebo-controlled trial.	BACKGROUND: The aim of our study was to examine the effects of photobiomodulation therapy (PBMT) in the treatment of breast cancer-related lymphedema using a compactly designed treatment regime consisting of eight therapy sessions in combination with a cluster laser device covering a total area size of 78.54 cm(2) over the axillary. METHODS: Forty patients with unilateral lymphedema were enrolled in this double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in order to evaluate effects of PBMT on lymphedema-related pain, quality of life, grip strength and limb volume difference. Subjects received irradiation for ten minutes per session using a cluster laser covering a beam area of 78.54 cm(2). The applied energy was 384 Joules resulting in an energy density of 4.89 J/cm(2). RESULTS: Post-treatment, a 50% reduction in median pain scores and an increase in mean quality of life were observed. Mean grip strength was persistently higher after eight sessions of PBMT compared with pretreatment; however, no statistically significant intergroup differences (P > 0.05) were found over the time course. CONCLUSION: PBMT using a compactly designed treatment regime in combination with a cluster laser device did not significantly improve quality of life, pain scores, grip strength and limb volume over the time course.
27943102	Clinicopathological evaluation of Sox10 expression in diffuse-type gastric adenocarcinoma.	Sox10, one of the transcription factors, regulates Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in diverse developmental processes in normal tissues. Sox10 is also expressed in variable solid tumors such as breast cancer, salivary tumor, hepatocellular carcinoma, ovarian tumor, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, prostate cancer, and digestive cancer. The role of Sox10 during tumorigenesis is still controversial, especially in digestive cancers; thus, we performed clinicopathological evaluation of Sox10 expression in 41 cases of diffuse-type gastric adenocarcinoma (DGA). We examined the expression of Sox10 by immunohistochemical staining and real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR and evaluated the correlation between Sox10 expression and clinicopathological factors. A low-level expression of Sox10 was significantly associated with high-level venous invasion by immunohistochemical evaluation, while it was significantly associated with high-level lymphatic permeation when analyzed by real-time PCR assay. Survival analysis of 41 cases indicated that high level of vascular permeation was a statistically poor prognostic factor, suggesting that derogation of Sox10 would lead to unfavorable patients' outcome through the acceleration of vascular invasion. In this study, we revealed the clinical benefit of evaluation of Sox10 expression to predict the risk of vascular permeation which yields patients' poor prognosis in DGA.
27940908	Polyurethane Implants in 2-Stage Breast Reconstruction: 9-Year Clinical Experience.	BACKGROUND: Capsular contracture (CC) is a major complication of breast surgery with smooth and textured implants. Polyurethane (PU) foam-coated breast implants were developed to decrease the incidence of CC. OBJECTIVES: The authors determined the incidence of CC following 2-stage breast reconstruction using PU foam-covered implants, with and without radiation therapy. METHODS: The records of 92 patients who received 115 PU implants were retrospectively reviewed. The rates of CC over time were compared for irradiated and nonirradiated groups with a Kaplan-Meier analysis and log-rank test. CC rates also were analyzed with respect to age. RESULTS: The median follow-up time for patients was 103.3 months. Nine patients experienced unilateral Baker grade III or IV fibrous CC, including 6 patients from the irradiated group and 3 patients from the nonirradiated group. The overall cumulative incidence of CC at 9 years was 8.1%. In the irradiated and nonirradiated groups, the 9-year cumulative incidence was 10.7% and 5.5%, respectively. CC occurred within 3 years in the irradiated group and within 7 years in the nonirradiated group. The incidence of CC appeared to be higher among younger patients. CONCLUSIONS: Radiation therapy increases the risk of high-grade CC with textured or smooth implants. PU implants are associated with a much lower cumulative incidence of CC following 2-stage breast reconstruction, even when radiotherapy is performed. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE 3.
27940401	DNA damage induced by NADPH cytochrome P450 reductase-activated idarubicin in sensitive and multidrug resistant MCF7 breast cancer cells.	BACKGROUND: Idarubicin (IDA) is one of clinically important anticancer drugs belonging to the anthracycline antibiotic family. The aim of this study was to examine DNA damage induced by NADPH cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR)-activated IDA in human sensitive MCF7 and multidrug resistant MCF7/DOX500 (overexpressing P-gp) breast adenocarcinoma cells. METHODS: The evaluation of DNA fragmentation caused by single strand breaks (SSB) and double strand breaks (DSB) was performed using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labelling (TUNEL) test. Additionally, DSB formation was examined using H2AX histone phosphorylation assays. RESULTS: It was found that IDA alone and CPR-activated used at IC90 caused a higher level of DNA strand breaks in sensitive MCF7 cells detected by TUNEL assessments (p=0.0011 for IDA alone and p=0.0109 for IDA reductively activated, Kruskal-Wallis test) and gamma-H2AX-positive staining (p=0.0003 for IDA alone and p=0.0193 for IDA reductively activated, Kruskal-Wallis test) than in multidrug resistant MCF7/DOX500 cells. However, no changes were observed in the percentage of TUNEL-positive and DSB-positive cells for MCF7 as well as MCF7/DOX500 cells in the case of IDA alone and the drug pretreated in the presence of the activating system. CONCLUSIONS: The obtained results suggest that CPR-activation of IDA does not significantly change the cellular DNA damage response of studied sensitive MCF7 and multidrug resistant MCF7/DOX500 breast cancer cells, even if the results concerning the interaction of IDA undergoing CPR activation with naked DNA showed the important differences in comparison with the drug alone (non-activated).
27939967	The effect of preoperative serum triglycerides and high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol levels on the prognosis of breast cancer.	OBJECTIVES: Although dyslipidemia has been documented to be associated with several types of cancer including breast cancer, it remains uncertainty the prognostic value of serum lipid in breast cancer. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the association between the preoperative plasma lipid profile and the prognostic of breast cancer patients. METHODS: The levels of preoperative serum lipid profile (including cholesterol [CHO], Triglycerides [TG], high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol [HDL-C], low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol [LDL-C], apolipoprotein A-I [ApoAI], and apolipoprotein B [ApoB]) and the clinical data were retrospectively collected and reviewed in 1044 breast cancer patients undergoing operation. Kaplan-Meier method and the Cox proportional hazards regression model were used in analyzing the overall survival [OS] and disease-free survival [DFS]. RESULTS: Combining the receiver-operating characteristic and Kaplan-Meier analysis, we found that preoperative lower TG and HDL-C level were risk factors of breast cancer patients. In multivariate analyses, a decreased HDL-C level showed significant association with worse OS (HR: 0.528; 95% CI: 0.302-0.923; P = 0.025), whereas a decreased TG level showed significant association with worse DFS (HR: 0.569; 95% CI: 0.370-0.873; P = 0.010). CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative serum levels of TG and HDL-C may be independent factor to predict outcome in breast cancer patient.
27939521	The clinical significance and biological function of olfactomedin 4 in triple negative breast cancer.	Olfactomedin 4 abnormal expression has been observed in several types of human cancer, but the status of olfactomedin 4 in triple negative breast cancer is still unknown. The aim of our study is to explore the clinical significance and biological function of olfactomedin 4 in triple negative breast cancer. The mRNA and protein expression of olfactomedin 4 in triple negative breast cancer tissues and cell lines was detected, and the correlation between olfactomedin 4 expression and clinicopathological factors was analyzed by immunohistochemistry. The biological function of olfactomedin 4 on tumor-metastasis was explored by Transwell migration assay and invasion assay in vitro. In our results, olfactomedin 4 mRNA and protein expression is decreased in triple-negative breast cancer tissues and cell lines. Olfactomedin 4 protein low-expression associated with lymph node metastasis, distant metastasis, clinical stage and poor prognosis of triple-negative breast cancer patients. Up-regulation of olfactomedin 4 suppresseed triple-negative breast cancer cells migration and invasion, and reduced cell metastasis-associated protein MMP 9 expression. In conclusion, olfactomedin 4 is a novel biomarker of triple-negative breast cancer for predicting prognosis and developing targeted molecular therapies.
27936888	The B3 conundrum-the radiologists' perspective.	The management of B3 lesions is both controversial and complicated. There have been recent publications regarding how best to manage this heterogeneous group particularly in light of the Marmot Review and with the advent of vacuum-assisted biopsy technique. It is recognized that B3 lesions on core biopsy can be upgraded to malignancy in up to one-third of cases, but this is predominantly to ductal carcinoma in situ or low-grade invasive tumours. The upgrade rate is mainly associated with B3 lesions with epithelial atypia. This review summarizes the current management and focuses on the proposed future management of these B3 lesions.
27936420	Myofibroblastoma of the male breast: a rare entity with radiologic-pathologic correlation.	A 73-year old man with a history of multiple genitourinary malignancies was found to have a left retroareolar soft tissue mass on CT assessment of disease, and dedicated breast imaging was recommended. Diagnostic mammography and ultrasonography confirmed a solid mass, for which biopsy was recommended. Pathologic analysis demonstrated a spindle cell neoplasm with an immunoreactivity pattern consistent with myofibroblastoma. While this entity is benign, nonspecific imaging features necessitate tissue sampling for pathologic diagnosis, and, given pathologic rarity, open communication between the radiologist and pathologist is important to establish the correct diagnosis and to recommend appropriate management.
27936316	Bioprospecting of Turbinaria Macroalgae as a Potential Source of Health Protective Compounds.	The present study aims to focus on the bioprospecting of marine macroalgae of Turbinaria species, plenteous biomass of the world ocean. Three types of solvents, i.e., H2 O, MeOH/H2 O (80:20, v/v) and hexane/i-PrOH (50:50, v/v), were used for extraction. Both the biological activity and the pattern of present chemicals were characterized. For the cell proliferation assay, the human embryonic kidney 293 cells, cervix/breast/pancreatic adenocarcinoma, and osteosarcoma cells were used. For the antioxidant activity determination, both intracellular assay with human embryonic kidney and cervix adenocarcinoma cells, as well as the biochemical DPPH test, were employed. To complete the information about macroalgae composition, organic compounds were characterized by the liquid chromatography coupled with high resolution tandem mass spectrometry. Attention was concentrated mainly on the lipidomic profile characterization. In spite the fact that any significant antiproliferative effect was not observed for cancer cells, both the Turbinaria species were shown to be good protectors against the oxidative stress of the non-cancer cells. Most of the antioxidants were determined in the hexane/i-PrOH extract. As regards the lipids identified, most of them belonged to the triacylglycerols followed by sphingomyelins, diacylglycerols, and polar (lyso)phospholipids. Additionally to fatty acids with 14, 16 and 18 carbons, also those with odd carbon numbers were frequently present.
27933394	Men and women show similar survival rates after breast cancer.	PURPOSE: To compare the disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) rates of men and women undergoing treatment for breast cancer. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of patients with breast cancer diagnosed and treated at the Cancer Hospital III of the National Cancer Institute of Brazil, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, between 1999 and 2013. Male breast cancer cases were matched for age, year of diagnosis, and clinical staging to three female cases (1:3). Patient characteristics were abstracted from hospital records and medical charts. Cases were analyzed using descriptive statistics, and comparisons between the genders were performed using Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox regression analysis with 95% confidence intervals. RESULTS: The study population comprised 98 men and 294 women. There were significant differences (p < 0.05) between the genders for marital status, alcohol consumption, smoking, presence of hypertension and other comorbidities, histological type of tumor, expression of estrogen receptors, progesterone receptors, human epidermal growth factor receptor-type 2, type of breast surgery, neoadjuvant chemotherapy, adjuvant radiotherapy, and use of palliative bisphosphonate therapy. Five- and 10-year DFS rates were, respectively, 80.0 and 51.4% for men and 71.4 and 63.5% for women (p = 0.245), and 5- and 10-year OS rates were, respectively, 65.0 and 47.5% for men and 56.5 and 41.4% for women (p = 0.221). CONCLUSION: There was no significant difference in prognosis (DFS and OS rates) between the genders, but significant differences in sociodemographic and clinical characteristics were detected between male and female breast cancer cases.
27932250	False-negative MRI breast screening in high-risk women.	AIM: To determine the frequency of and reasons for false-negative breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examinations in high-risk women undergoing annual screening. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The family history clinic database was interrogated and women at high risk of breast cancer who had undergone screening MRI and been diagnosed with breast cancer within 2 years of the MRI examination were identified. All available MRI examinations were reviewed and classified by two radiologists. RESULTS: Of 32 women diagnosed with breast cancer, 23 had MRI images available for review. Fourteen were diagnosed at MRI, four at interim mammography, two symptomatically, one incidentally on ultrasound, and two at risk-reducing mastectomy. Ten women (43%) had potentially avoidable delays in diagnosis. The preceding MRIs were classified as false-negative screens in five women (one prevalent, four incident), false-negative assessment in seven and minimal signs in three (three women were assigned dual classifications). Common reasons for diagnostic delay included small enhancing masses that were overlooked, areas of non-mass enhancement that showed little or no change between screens, false reassurance from normal conventional imaging at assessment, and overreliance on short-interval repeat MRI. CONCLUSION: Small enhancing foci, masses, and areas of segmental non-mass enhancement are common MRI features of early breast cancer. Lack of change of non-mass enhancement on serial examinations does not exclude malignancy. Double reading of both screening and assessment examinations is recommended. Ready access to MRI biopsy is essential. Short-interval repeat MRI should be limited to reassessing low suspicion areas likely to be benign glandular enhancement. Annual mammography remains important in these women.
27931843	PARP inhibitor combination therapy.	In 2014, olaparib (Lynparza) became the first PARP (Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase) inhibitor to be approved for the treatment of cancer. When used as single agents, PARP inhibitors can selectively target tumour cells with BRCA1 or BRCA2 tumour suppressor gene mutations through synthetic lethality. However, PARP inhibition also shows considerable promise when used together with other therapeutic agents. Here, we summarise both the pre-clinical and clinical evidence for the utility of such combinations and discuss the future prospects and challenges for PARP inhibitor combinatorial therapies.
27931838	Routine use of gene panel testing in hereditary breast cancer should be performed with caution.	Breast cancer is the most frequent cancer occurring in women. Ten percent of these cancers are considered hereditary. Among them, 30% are attributed to germline mutations in the tumor suppressor genes BRCA1 and BRCA2. Other genes of lower penetrance are also known, explaining together up to 40% of the hereditary risk of breast cancer. New techniques, such as next-generation sequencing, allow the simultaneous analysis of multiple genes in a cost-effective way. As a logical consequence, gene panel testing is entering clinical practice with the promise of personalized care. We however advocate that gene panel testing is not ready for non-specialist clinical use, as it generates many variants of unknown significance and includes more genes than are presently considered clinically useful. We hereby review the data for each gene that can change the risk management of patients carrying a pathogenic variant.
27931719	A potential pitfall in evaluating HER2 immunohistochemistry for gastric signet ring cell carcinomas.	Signet ring cell carcinoma (SRC) more commonly presents as metastatic disease and renders patients to be considered for chemotherapy. While treatment options are limited overall, trastuzumab has been shown to be effective for HER2 positive SRC cases. The current algorithm for HER2 evaluation heavily relies on positive membrane-specific staining by immunohistochemistry (IHC), but several anecdotal reports have suggested that SRCs may be susceptible to misinterpretation due to non-specific staining in the marginated cytoplasm with/without nucleus. Results of two FDA-approved IHC methods of HER2 evaluation, Pathway and HercepTest, along with silver in situ hybridisation were interpreted retrospectively and compared in 155 primary SRC cases. IHC results were discrepant between the two assays in SRC even at the strongest IHC scores. Discordance indeed occurred due to dark, non-specific staining obscured by the unique SRC morphology. True HER2 positive SRC was identified in three cases (3/155, 1.9%). In this study, we demonstrate the importance of recognising potential discrepancy in interpreting HER2 status depending on the assay used. Understanding this possible pitfall may prevent unnecessary trastuzumab in SRC patients.
27931517	Glut1 promotes cell proliferation, migration and invasion by regulating epidermal growth factor receptor and integrin signaling in triple-negative breast cancer cells.	Elevated glucose levels in cancer cells can be attributed to increased levels of glucose transporter (GLUT) proteins. Glut1 expression is increased in human malignant cells. To investigate alternative roles of Glut1 in breast cancer, we silenced Glut1 in triple-negative breast-cancer cell lines using a short hairpin RNA (shRNA) system. Glut1 silencing was verified by Western blotting and qRT-PCR. Knockdown of Glut1 resulted in decreased cell proliferation, glucose uptake, migration, and invasion through modulation of the EGFR/ MAPK signaling pathway and integrin beta1/Src/FAK signaling pathways. These results suggest that Glut1 not only plays a role as a glucose transporter, but also acts as a regulator of signaling cascades in the tumorigenesis of breast cancer. [BMB Reports 2017; 50(3): 132-137].
27931285	Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy in Triple Negative Breast Cancer: An Observational Study.	Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a phenotype of breast cancer with aggressive clinical behavior. Because of the absence of optimal treatment, the prognosis of this disease is poor. The main purpose of this study was to detect the response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) in a TNBC cohort and compare the long-term survival between patients with and without pathological complete response (pCR). A total of 53 patients diagnosed with TNBC from 2005 to 2013 who received NACT at the University Hospital Birmingham were enrolled in this study. Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were compared between the pCR group and non-pCR group. Demographic information and clinical or pathologic parameters were also analyzed to explore potential predictive and prognostic factors. Fourteen patients (26.4%) achieved pCR to NACT. In univariate analysis, patients with pCR had longer PFS time (p=0.013) and OS time (p=0.054) compared with their counterparts without pCR. In multivariate analysis, the existence of lymphovascular invasion (LVI) significantly reduced OS (HR=17.404, 95% CI=2.923103.644) and PFS (HR=7.776, 95% CI=1.64536.753). The achievement of pCR to NACT can significantly postpone the incidence of disease progression in patients with TNBC. There is not enough evidence showing its influence on ultimate survival. LVI may be a more potent prognostic factor than pCR in the TNBC cohort.
27931006	BRCA mutation genetic testing implications in the United States.	BRCA mutation carriers have a very high risk of breast and ovarian cancer by age 70, in the ranges 47%-66% and 40%-57%, respectively. Additionally, women with BRCA mutation-associated breast cancer also have an elevated risk of other or secondary malignancies. Fortunately, the breast and ovarian cancer outcome for BRCA1/2 mutation carriers is at least as good as for non-carriers with chemoprevention, prophylactic surgeries and appropriate use of therapies. Therefore, identification of those who might have a mutation is important so that genetic counseling, testing, screening and prevention strategies can be applied in a timely manner. This article reviews the impact of genetic testing in general, timing of genetic testing after diagnosis and prior knowledge of mutation status in BRCA carriers with newly diagnosed breast cancer. Additionally, risk-reducing surgeries including the prophylactic contralateral mastectomy, and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and the sensitivity of BRCA-defective breast cancer cell lines to differential chemotherapeutic agents will be discussed.
27930970	Astragaloside IV inhibits breast cancer cell invasion by suppressing Vav3 mediated Rac1/MAPK signaling.	BACKGROUND: Astragaloside IV (AS-IV), the major active triterpenoid in Radix Astragali, has shown anti-tumorigenic properties in certain cancers; however, its role in breast cancer remains unclear. The present study investigated the effects of AS-IV on breast cancer in vitro and in vivo and examined the underlying mechanisms. METHODS: The effects of AS-IV on MDA-MB-231 cell proliferation, migration, invasion and metastasis were investigated by MTT and Transwell assays, and western blotting. In addition, an orthotopic mouse tumor model was established for in vivo experiments. RESULTS: AS-IV inhibited the viability and invasive potential of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, suppressed the activation of the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) family members ERK1/2 and JNK, and downregulated matrix metalloproteases (MMP)-2 and -9. The effects of AS-IV were mediated by the downregulation of Vav3, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor, leading to decreased levels of activated Rac1, a Rho family GTPase. Vav3 overexpression promoted cell proliferation and invasion in vitro, whereas Vav3 silencing had the opposite effects. AS-IV suppressed orthotopic breast tumor growth and metastasis to the lungs, whereas ectopic expression of Vav3 reversed the inhibitory effect of AS-IV on cell viability, invasiveness, MAPK signaling and MMP expression. CONCLUSION: The present results provide a mechanistic explanation for the antitumor effects of AS-IV and suggest its potential in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer.
27930644	Immunotherapy for the treatment of breast cancer: checkpoint blockade, cancer vaccines, and future directions in combination immunotherapy.	Immunotherapy encompasses both vaccines that direct immune responses to tumor-associated antigens, and checkpoint blocking antibodies that inhibit immune system suppression by targeting key pathways mediated by cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4, programmed death 1 (PD-1), and programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1). Both of these approaches currently are being explored as potential strategies for the treatment of breast cancer. Recent studies suggest that immunotherapy is poised to change the therapeutic landscape for some breast cancers. Specifically, overall response rates of 19% with PD-1/PD-L1-directed antibodies have been reported in 2 small studies of women with PD-L1-positive, heavily pretreated advanced triple-negative breast cancer. In combination with nab-paclitaxel, confirmed response rates were 46% in a PD-L1-unselected population in the first-line metastatic triple-negative breast cancer setting. Checkpoint-blocking antibodies also have been evaluated in small studies of women with hormone receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer, and in women whose breast cancers lack PD-L1 expression, with more modest response rates. It has been hypothesized that some breast cancers are not inherently recognized by the immune system; however, preclinical and preliminary clinical data suggest that inherently modest immunogenicity may be overcome with novel vaccination strategies, as well as strategies that combine immune checkpoint blockade with methods of optimizing antigen presentation, such as tumor ablation, radiation, chemotherapy, or other approaches. If ongoing registrational trials support the use of immunotherapy, it could revolutionize the care of early-stage and metastatic breast cancer, and ideally improve cure rates.
27930630	Obesity and breast cancer: risk, outcomes, and future considerations.	The proportion of adults who are obese has increased dramatically in the United States over the last 30 years. Obesity has been linked to an increased risk of developing a number of malignancies, including postmenopausal breast cancer. Evidence also suggests that obesity at the time of breast cancer diagnosis is linked to an increased risk of breast cancer-specific and overall mortality in both premenopausal and postmenopausal women with early-stage breast cancer. Obesity is linked to an increased risk of secondary malignancies in women with early breast cancer, and studies suggest that weight gain after diagnosis increases overall mortality. Despite the data linking obesity to poor outcomes in women with early breast cancer, there are currently no data from randomized trials testing the impact of weight loss on breast cancer outcomes. A number of recent randomized controlled trials have shown that weight loss interventions are feasible in obese survivors of breast cancer, yielding loss of 5% to 6% of body weight, and several ongoing randomized phase 3 clinical trials are evaluating the effect of weight loss interventions on breast cancer outcomes. These studies will help define the role of weight loss in the management of obese women with early breast cancer.
27930584	Risk of infection is associated more with drain duration than daily drainage volume in prosthesis-based breast reconstruction: A cohort study.	In prosthesis-based breast reconstruction, drains are used to prevent seroma formation and to reduce the risk of infection. However, prolonged drainage increases the risk of ascending infection. Although the volume often accepted for drain removal is </=30 mL per day, the optimal timing to remove the drain for best clinical outcome remains controversial.We did a retrospective cohort study of 569 patients of prosthesis-based breast reconstruction with infection rate as the outcome variable; drain duration and last daily drainage volume as the main independent variables. Data on age, smoking history, diabetes mellitus history, body mass index, breast weight, tissue expander size, drain size, number of retrieved lymph nodes, tumor size, number of metastatic lymph nodes, tumor stage, mastectomy type, reconstruction type, submuscular implantation, skin defect, operative time, duration of antibiotics use, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy were collected as covariates. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to control for confounding.The total infection rate was 5.1% (29/569). The daily drainage volume >/=30 mL/d at the time of drain removal was not found associated with increased infection rate (P = 0.32). Of the various cutoff values of last daily drainage volume, none was found to be a determinant for drain removal where the risk of infection was concerned. By contrast, drain duration over 21 days significantly increased infection rate (P = 0.001). The multivariable logistic regression analysis showed an increase of 76.2% in the infection rate with each additional week of drain retention (P = 0.001). Breast weight also had a significant influence on risk of infection. Chemotherapy and drain size showed borderline effect on risk of infection whereas the last daily drainage volume was not associated with risk of infectionIn summary, our study revealed that drain duration, rather than the last daily drainage volume, significantly affects the infection rate in prosthesis-based breast reconstruction. We recommend that the drain is better removed no longer than 3 weeks postoperatively and can be removed as early as postoperative day 7, even when the drainage is over 30 mL in a 24-hour period.
27930583	Diabetes mellitus and prognosis in women with breast cancer: A systematic review and meta-analysis.	BACKGROUND: Diabetes mellitus is associated with an increased risk of breast cancer, but studies of the effects of diabetes on the prognosis of women with breast cancer have yielded inconsistent findings. The present meta-analysis aimed to investigate the impact of preexisting diabetes on the prognosis in terms of overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), and relapse-free period (RFP) in women with breast cancer. METHODS: We searched the Embase and PubMed databases until June 2016 for cohort or case-control studies assessing the impact of diabetes on the prognosis of women with breast cancer. The pooled multivariate adjusted hazard ratio (HR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for OS, DFS, and RFP were used to analyze the impact of diabetes on the prognosis of breast cancer patients. RESULTS: Seventeen studies involving 48,315 women with breast cancer met our predefined inclusion criteria. Meta-analysis showed that the pooled adjusted HR was 1.51 (95% CI 1.34-1.70) for OS and 1.28 (95% CI 1.09-1.50) for DFS in breast cancer patients with diabetes compared to those without diabetes. However, RFP did not differ significantly between patients with and without diabetes (HR 1.42; 95% CI 0.90-2.23). CONCLUSIONS: The present meta-analysis suggests that preexisting diabetes is independently associated with poor OS and DFS in female breast cancer patients. However, the impact of diabetes on RFP should be further verified. More prospective studies are warranted to investigate whether appropriate glycemic control with modification of antihyperglycemic agents can improve the prognosis of female breast cancer patients with diabetes.
27930567	Granulocytic sarcoma of the pancreas on 18F-FDG PET/CT: A case report.	RATIONALE: Granulocytic sarcoma (GS) is defined as leukemia infiltration in any organ other than the bone marrow. GS rarely occurs in the pancreas. Here, we present the first report of GS in the pancreas on F-fluorodexyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (F-FDG PET/CT). PATIENT CONCERNS: A 19-year-old male patient with acute myeloid leukemia received a human leukocyte antigen-haploidentical stem cell transplant as a second transplant while in second complete remission. INTERVENTIONS: After a second stem cell transplant, obstructive pancreatitis accompanied by a mass in the pancreatic head was observed. FDG-PET/CT revealed abnormal activity in the head of the pancreas and the skin in the patient's left breast area. DIAGNOSES: Pathological examination demonstrated relapsed acute myeloid leukemia in both the lesions. OUTCOMES: This is the first report showing the F-FDG PET/CT findings of GS in the pancreas. LESSONS: F-FDG PET/CT may help determine the stage of GS.
27930560	Risk of secondary cancers in women with breast cancer and the influence of radiotherapy: A national cohort study in Taiwan.	Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women worldwide; thus, the prolongation of survival, and the incidence and risk factors, including radiotherapy, for developing secondary malignancies are important. We compared the incidence of secondary and new primary cancers in women with breast cancer (CA) and well-matched for age, geographic region, and monthly income cancer-free controls (CA). The risk for secondary cancers with and without radiotherapy was also compared in CA women. We enrolled 2422 CA patients and CA 12,110 controls. In a 4-year follow-up, the secondary cancers risk was significant in the CA group (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR]: 1.59; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.17-2.18). Only the risk of uterine cancer was significant compared with the controls (AHR: 6.30; 95% CI: 2.28-17.38). CA patients and <50 years old had a higher risk for secondary cancers. Developing secondary cancers was significant in the first follow-up year (AHR: 1.51; 95% CI: 1.11-2.06). Radiotherapy had no significant effect on the CA group, but it was significant (P = 0.0298) in women >/=60 years old (elderly). We recommend monitoring secondary cancers in CA women, especially those <50 years old, and during the first year of follow-up. Radiotherapy should be used more carefully in elderly CA women.
27929664	Paradigm Shifts in Breast Care Delivery: Impact of Imaging in a Multidisciplinary Environment.	OBJECTIVE: The practice of breast imaging in a collaborative multidisciplinary environment adds significant value to outcomes in women's health care. In this article, we describe multidisciplinary considerations in breast cancer screening and early detection, the impact of imaging and histopathologic findings in the diagnostic evaluation and management of breast abnormalities, and the contribution of imaging to surgical and radiation therapy planning for the breast cancer patient. CONCLUSION: The multidisciplinary delivery of breast care for women that incorporates screening, diagnosis of borderline and high-risk lesions, and management of the breast cancer patient adds considerable value to outcomes in health care.
27929512	A survey on table tolerances and couch overrides in radiotherapy.	The purpose of this study was to survey current departmental policies on treatment couch overrides and the values of table tolerances used clinically. A 25-question electronic survey on couch overrides and tolerances was sent to full members of the American Association of Physicists in Medicine (AAPM). The first part of the survey asked participants if table overrides were allowed at their institution, who was allowed to perform these overrides, and if imaging was required with overrides. The second part of the survey asked individuals to provide table tolerance data for the following treatment sites: brain/head and neck (H&amp;N), lung, breast, abdo-men/pelvis and prostate. Each site was further divided into IMRT/VMAT and 3D conformal techniques. Spaces for free-text were provided, allowing respondents to enter any table tolerance data they were unable to specify under the treatment sites listed. A total of 361 individuals responded, of which approximately half partici-pated in the couch tolerances portion of the survey. Overall, 86% of respondents' institutions allow couch tolerance overrides at treatment. Therapists were the most common staff members permitted to perform overrides, followed by physicists, dosimetrists, and physicians, respectively. Of the institutions allowing overrides, 34% reported overriding daily. More than half of the centers document the over-ride and/or require a setup image to radiographically verify the treatment site. With respect to table tolerances, SRS/SBRT table tolerances were the tightest, while clinical setup table tolerances were the largest. There were minimal statistically significant differences between IMRT/VMAT and 3D conformal table tolerances. Our results demonstrated that table overrides are relatively common in radiotherapy despite being a potential safety concern. Institutions should review their override policy and table tolerance values in light of the practices of other institutions. Careful attention to these matters is crucial in ensuring the safe and accurate delivery of radiotherapy.
27929484	Dosimetric assessment of brass mesh bolus for postmastectomy photon radiotherapy.	Brass mesh bolus has been shown to be an acceptable substitute for tissue-equivalent bolus to increase superficial dose for chest wall tangent photon radiotherapy. This work investigated the increase in surface dose, the change in the dose at depth, and the safety implications of higher energy photon beams when using brass mesh bolus for postmastectomy chest wall radiotherapy. A photon tangent plan was delivered to a thorax phantom, and the superficial dose ranged from 40%-72% of prescription dose with no bolus. The surface dose increased to 75%-110% of prescription dose with brass mesh bolus and 85%-109% of prescription dose with tissue-equivalent bolus. It was also found that the dose at depth when using brass mesh bolus is comparable to that measured with no bolus for en face and oblique incidence. Monte Carlo calculations were used to assess the photoneutron production from brass mesh bolus used with 15 MV and 24 MV photon beams. The effective dose from photoneutrons was approximated and found to be relatively small, yet not negligible. Activation products generated by these photoneutrons, the surface dose rate due to the activation products, and the half-life of the activation products were also considered in this work. The authors conclude that brass mesh bolus is a reasonable alternative to tissue-equivalent bolus, and it may be used with high-energy beam; but one should be aware of the potential increased effective dose to staff and patients due to the activation products produced by photoneutrons.
27929483	A dosimetric evaluation of knowledge-based VMAT planning with simultaneous integrated boosting for rectal cancer patients.	RapidPlan, a commercial knowledge-based optimizer, has been tested on head and neck, lung, esophageal, breast, liver, and prostate cancer patients. To appraise its performance on VMAT planning with simultaneous integrated boosting (SIB) for rectal cancer, this study configured a DVH (dose-volume histogram) estimation model consisting 80 best-effort manual cases of this type. Using the model-generated objectives, the MLC (multileaf collimator) sequences of other 70 clinically approved plans were reoptimized, while the remaining parameters, such as field geometry and photon energy, were maintained. Dosimetric outcomes were assessed by comparing homogeneity index (HI), conformal index (CI), hot spots (volumes receiving over 107% of the prescribed dose, V107%), mean dose and dose to the 50% volume of femoral head (Dmean_FH and D50%_FH), and urinary bladder (Dmean_UB and D50%_UB), and the mean DVH plotting. Paired samples t-test or Wilcoxon signed-rank test suggested that comparable CI were achieved by RapidPlan (0.99+/- 0.04 for PTVboost, and 1.03 +/- 0.02 for PTV) and original plans (1.00 +/- 0.05 for PTVboost and 1.03 +/- 0.02 for PTV), respectively (p &gt; 0.05). Slightly improved HI of planning target volume (PTVboost) and PTV were observed in the RapidPlan cases (0.05 +/- 0.01 for PTVboost, and 0.26 +/- 0.01 for PTV) than the original plans (0.06 +/- 0.01 for PTVboost and 0.26 +/- 0.01 for PTV), p &lt; 0.05. More cases with positive V107% were found in the original (18 plans) than the RapidPlan group (none). RapidPlan significantly reduced the D50%_FH (by 1.53 Gy / 9.86% from 15.52 +/- 2.17 to 13.99+/- 1.16 Gy), Dmean_FH (by 1.29 Gy / 7.78% from 16.59+/- 2.07 to 15.30 +/- 0.70 G), D50%_UB (by 4.93 Gy / 17.50% from 28.17 +/- 3.07 to 23.24+/- 2.13 Gy), and Dmean_UB (by 3.94Gy / 13.43% from 29.34 +/- 2.34 to 25.40 +/- 1.36 Gy), respectively. The more concentrated distribution of RapidPlan data points indicated an enhanced consis-tency of plan quality.
27929481	How dose sparing of cardiac structures correlates with in-field heart volume and sternal displacement.	Cardiac irradiation increases the risk of coronary artery disease in patients with left-sided breast cancer. Techniques exist to reduce cardiac irradiation, but the optimum technique depends on individual patient anatomy and physiology. We investigated the correlation of delta heart volume in field (dHVIF) and sternal excursion with dose sparing in heart and left anterior descending artery (LAD) to develop quantitative predictive models for expected dose to heart and LAD. A treatment planning study was performed on 97 left-breast cancer patients who underwent whole breast radiotherapy (prescription dose = 50 Gy) under deep inspiratory breath hold (DIBH). Two CT datasets, free breathing (FB) and DIBH, were utilized for treatment planning and for determination of the internal anatomy-based DIBH amplitude. The mean heart and LAD dose were compared between FB and DIBH plans and dose to the heart and LAD as a function of dHVIF and sternal excursion were determined. The [Average (STD); Range] mean heart doses from free breathing and DIBH are [120.5(65.2); 28.9 ~ 393.8] cGy and [67.5(25.1); 19.7 ~ 145.6] cGy, respectively. The mean LAD doses from free breathing and DIBH are [571.0(582.2); 42.2 ~ 2332.2] cGy and [185.9(127.0); 41.2 ~ 898.4] cGy, respectively. The mean dose reductions with DIBH are [53.1(50.6); -15.4 ~ 295.1] cGy for the heart and [385.1(513.4); -0.6 ~ 2105.8] cGy for LAD. Percent mean dose reductions to the heart and LAD with DIBH are 44% (p &lt; 0.0001) and 67% (p &lt; 0.0001), respectively, compared to FB. The dHVIF mean dose reduction correlation is 8.1 cGy/cc for the heart and 81.6 cGy/cc for LAD (with linear trend and y intercept: 26.0 cGy for the heart, 109.1 cGy for LAD). DIBH amplitude using sternal position was [1.3(.48); .38 ~ 2.5] cm. The DIBH amplitude mean dose reduction correlation is 14 cGy/cm for the heart and 212cGy/cm for LAD (with linear trend with y intercept: 35.6 cGy for the heart, 102.4 cGy for LAD). The strong correlation of dose sparing to the heart and LAD with dHVIF and sternal excursion suggests that mean dose sparing to heart and LAD can be predicted with either dHVIF or sternal excursion equally well. The metrics proposed could be utilized to allow providers to determine the relative dosimetric benefits of different heart-sparing techniques as early as time of consultation.
27929271	Hormone Therapy and Other Treatments for Symptoms of Menopause.	The results of large clinical trials have led physicians and patients to question the safety of hormone therapy for menopause. In the past, physicians prescribed hormone therapy to improve overall health and prevent cardiac disease, as well as for symptoms of menopause. Combined estrogen/progestogen therapy, but not estrogen alone, increases the risk of breast cancer when used for more than three to five years. Therefore, in women with a uterus, it is recommended that physicians prescribe combination therapy only to treat menopausal symptoms such as vasomotor symptoms (hot flashes) and vaginal atrophy, using the smallest effective dosage for the shortest possible duration. Although estrogen is the most effective treatment for hot flashes, nonhormonal alternatives such as low-dose paroxetine, venlafaxine, and gabapentin are effective alternatives. Women with a uterus who are using estrogen should also take a progestogen to reduce the risk of endometrial cancer. Women who cannot tolerate adverse effects of progestogens may benefit from a combined formulation of estrogen and the selective estrogen receptor modulator bazedoxifene. There is no highquality, consistent evidence that yoga, paced respiration, acupuncture, exercise, stress reduction, relaxation therapy, and alternative therapies such as black cohosh, botanical products, omega-3 fatty acid supplements, and dietary Chinese herbs benefit patients more than placebo. One systematic review suggests modest improvement in hot flashes and vaginal dryness with soy products, and small studies suggest that clinical hypnosis significantly reduces hot flashes. Patients with genitourinary syndrome of menopause may benefit from vaginal estrogen, nonhormonal vaginal moisturizers, or ospemifene (the only nonhormonal treatment approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for dyspareunia due to menopausal atrophy). The decision to use hormone therapy depends on clinical presentation, a thorough evaluation of the risks and benefits, and an informed discussion with the patient.
27927830	Lesson of the month 2: Oncology, obstetrics and orthopaedics: an unusual partnership.	Breast cancer diagnosed during pregnancy is a relatively uncommon event. This challenging situation presents clinicians with difficult decisions, often requiring a multidisciplinary approach at a time of heightened anxiety for the patient and their family. This paper describes the case of a young woman with metastatic breast cancer diagnosed in early pregnancy, and outlines how this complex clinical situation was managed.
27927199	SH003 induces apoptosis of DU145 prostate cancer cells by inhibiting ERK-involved pathway.	BACKGROUND: Herbal medicines have been used in cancer treatment, with many exhibiting favorable side effect and toxicity profiles compared with conventional chemotherapeutic agents. SH003 is a novel extract from Astragalus membranaceus, Angelica gigas, and Trichosanthes Kirilowii Maximowicz combined at a 1:1:1 ratio that impairs the growth of breast cancer cells. This study investigates anti-cancer effects of SH003 in prostate cancer cells. METHODS: SH003 extract in 30% ethanol was used to treat the prostate cancer cell lines DU145, LNCaP, and PC-3. Cell viability was determined by MTT and BrdU incorporation assays. Next, apoptotic cell death was determined by Annexin V and 7-AAD double staining methods. Western blotting was conducted to measure protein expression levels of components of cell death and signaling pathways. Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were measured using H2DCF-DA. Plasmid-mediated ERK2 overexpression in DU145 cells was used to examine the effect of rescuing ERK2 function. Results were analyzed using the Student's t-test and P-values < 0.05 were considered to indicate statistically-significant differences. RESULTS: Our data demonstrate that SH003 induced apoptosis in DU145 prostate cancer cells by inhibiting ERK signaling. SH003 induced apoptosis of prostate cancer cells in dose-dependent manner, which was independent of androgen dependency. SH003 also increased intracellular ROS levels but this is not associated with its pro-apoptotic effects. SH003 inhibited phosphorylation of Ras/Raf1/MEK/ERK/p90RSK in androgen-independent DU145 cells, but not androgen-dependent LNCaP and PC-3 cells. Moreover, ERK2 overexpression rescued SH003-induced apoptosis in DU145 cells. CONCLUSIONS: SH003 induces apoptotic cell death of DU145 prostate cancer cells by inhibiting ERK2-mediated signaling.
27927046	Advances in chemical pharmacotherapy to manage advanced breast cancer.	INTRODUCTION: Advanced breast cancer is still incurable. However, patients diagnosed with this fatal disease live longer. The selection of systemic therapy is mainly based on molecular subtype. The aim of management in these patients is to not only improve outcome, but also to maintain quality of life. Areas covered: In this paper we focus on available treatments and drugs under late development in the three main subtypes of breast cancer: luminal (hormone receptor positive), HER2 positive and triple negative disease. Main advances during the last years have been made in the treatment of HER2 positive breast cancer with the approval of several new targeted agents. Luminal breast cancer is also a field of active clinical research. So far triple negative breast cancer remains the subtype with the worse prognosis, even though new discoveries have been made to better understand the huge heterogeneity of this type of breast cancer. Expert opinion: Several new treatment options have recently been established in metastatic breast cancer. Side effects are sometimes cumbersome for the patient and are difficult to manage easily. Thus, identification of patients who derive the most benefit is needed. In addition, collaborative efforts should integrate the genotypic fragmentation in the management and future clinical research strategies of metastatic breast cancer patients.
27925480	Evaluation of background parenchymal enhancement on breast MRI: a systematic review.	OBJECTIVE: To perform a systematic review of the methods used for background parenchymal enhancement (BPE) evaluation on breast MRI. METHODS: Studies dealing with BPE assessment on breast MRI were retrieved from major medical libraries independently by four reviewers up to 6 October 2015. The keywords used for database searching are "background parenchymal enhancement", "parenchymal enhancement", "MRI" and "breast". The studies were included if qualitative and/or quantitative methods for BPE assessment were described. RESULTS: Of the 420 studies identified, a total of 52 articles were included in the systematic review. 28 studies performed only a qualitative assessment of BPE, 13 studies performed only a quantitative assessment and 11 studies performed both qualitative and quantitative assessments. A wide heterogeneity was found in the MRI sequences and in the quantitative methods used for BPE assessment. CONCLUSION: A wide variability exists in the quantitative evaluation of BPE on breast MRI. More studies focused on a reliable and comparable method for quantitative BPE assessment are needed. Advances in knowledge: More studies focused on a quantitative BPE assessment are needed.

27923686	Photoactivated hypericin increases the expression of SOD-2 and makes MCF-7 cells resistant to photodynamic therapy.	Photoactivated hypericin increased production of reactive oxygen species in human breast adenocarcinoma MCF-7 as well as in MDA-MB-231 cells 1h after photodynamic therapy. On the other hand, reactive oxygen species dropped 3h after photodynamic therapy with hypericin, but only in MCF-7 cells, whereas in MDA-MB-231 cells remained elevated. The difference in the dynamics of reactive oxygen species after hypericin activation was related to increased activity of SOD-2 in MCF-7 cells compared to MDA-MB-231 cells. Indeed, photodynamic therapy with hypericin significantly increased SOD-2 activity in MCF-7 cells, but only slightly in MDA-MB-231 cells. In this regard, SOD-2 activity correlated well with enhanced both mRNA expression as well as SOD-2 protein level in MCF-7 cells. The role of SOD-2 in the resistance of MCF-7 cells to photodynamic therapy with hypericin was monitored using SOD-2 inhibitor - 2-methoxyestradiol. Interestingly, the combination of photodynamic therapy with hypericin and methoxyestradiol sensitized MCF-7 cells to photodynamic therapy and significantly reduced its clonogenic ability. Furthermore, methoxyestradiol potentiated the activation of caspase 3/7 and apoptosis induced by photodynamic therapy with hypericin.
27923403	Determinants for patient satisfaction regarding aesthetic outcome and skin sensitivity after breast-conserving surgery.	BACKGROUND: With the development of new surgical techniques in breast cancer, such as oncoplastic breast surgery, increased knowledge of risk factors for poor satisfaction with conventional breast-conserving surgery (BCS) is needed in order to determine which patients to offer these techniques to. The aim of this study was to investigate patient satisfaction regarding aesthetic result and skin sensitivity in relation to patient, tumour, and treatment factors, in a consecutive sample of patients undergoing conventional BCS. METHODS: Women eligible for BCS were recruited between February 1, 2008 and January 31, 2012 in a prospective setup. In all, 297 women completed a study-specific questionnaire 1 year after conventional BCS and radiotherapy. Potential risk factors for poor satisfaction were investigated using logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: The great majority of the women, 84%, were satisfied or very satisfied with the overall aesthetic result. The rate of satisfaction regarding symmetry between the breasts was 68% and for skin sensitivity in the operated breast it was 67%. Excision of more than 20% of the preoperative breast volume was associated with poor satisfaction regarding overall aesthetic outcome, as was axillary clearance. A high BMI (>/=30 kg/m2) seemed to affect satisfaction with symmetry negatively. Factors associated with less satisfied patients regarding skin sensitivity in the operated breast were an excision of >/=20% of preoperative breast volume, a BMI of 25-30 kg/m2, axillary clearance, and radiotherapy. Re-excision and postoperative infection were associated with lower rates of satisfaction regarding both overall aesthetic outcome and symmetry, as well as with skin sensitivity. CONCLUSIONS: Several factors affect patient satisfaction after BCS. A major determinant of poor satisfaction in this study was a large excision of breast volume. If the percentage of breast volume excised is estimated to exceed 20%, other techniques, such as oncoplastic breast surgery, with or without contralateral surgery, or mastectomy with reconstruction, may be considered.
27923186	Influence of surface passivation of 2-Methoxyestradiol loaded PLGA nanoparticles on cellular interactions, pharmacokinetics and tumour accumulation.	In the present work, 2-Methoxyestradiol [2ME2] loaded PLGA nanoparticles [NPs] were stabilized with Casein or poly(ethylene glycol) [PEG] and evaluated for its cellular interactions, pharmacokinetics and tumour accumulation. Surface stabilized PLGA nanoparticles prepared through a modified emulsion route possessed similar size, surface charge, drug loading and release characteristics. Particle-cell interactions as well as the anti-angiogenesis activity were similar for both nanoformulations in vitro. However, in vivo pharmacokinetics and tumour accumulation of the drug were substantially improved for the PEGylated nanoformulation. Reduced protein binding was observed for PEG stabilized PLGA NPs. Thus, it was demonstrated that nanoencapsulation of 2-ME2 within PEGylated PLGA nanocarrier could improve its half-life and plasma concentration and thereby increase the tumour accumulation.
27923159	Apoptotic effect of chalcone derivatives of 2-acetylthiophene in human breast cancer cells.	BACKGROUND: A variety of chalcones have demonstrated cytotoxic activity toward several cancer cell lines. This study aimed to investigate the cytotoxicity of four chalcones derivatives of 2-acetylthiophene in human breast cancer cell lines. METHODS: MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with synthesized chalcones and the cytotoxicity was evaluated by tetrazolium dye (MTT), live/dead, and DAPI assays. RESULTS: Chalcones significantly decreased MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells viability in vitro in a dose dependent manner. After 48h treatment, the IC50 values ranging from 5.52 to 34.23muM. Chalcone 3c displayed the highest cytotoxic activity from all the tested compounds. Cytotoxic effects of compounds were confirmed in the live/dead assay. In addition, DAPI staining revealed that these compounds induce death by apoptosis. CONCLUSION: The data speculate that chalcone derivatives of 2-acetylthiophene may represent a source of therapeutic agents for human breast cancer.
27923104	Development of a Sensitive Luciferase-Based Sandwich ELISA System for the Detection of Human Extracellular Matrix 1 Protein.	Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) has been one of the main methods for detecting an antigen in an aqueous sample for more than four decades. Nowadays, one of the biggest concerns for ELISA is still how to improve the sensitivity of the assay, and the luciferase-luciferin reaction system has been noticed as a new detection method with high sensitivity. In this study, a luciferin-luciferase reaction system was used as the detection method for a sandwich ELISA system. It was shown that this new system led to an increase in the detection sensitivity of at least two times when compared with the traditional horseradish peroxidase (HRP) detection method. Lastly, the serum levels of the human extracellular matrix 1 protein of breast cancer patients were determined by the new system, which were overall similar to the HRP chemiluminescent system. Furthermore, this new luciferase reporter can be implemented into other ELISA systems for the purpose of increasing the assay sensitivity.
27922769	See, Test & Treat: A 5-Year Experience of Pathologists Driving Cervical and Breast Cancer Screening to Underserved and Underinsured Populations.	CONTEXT: - See, Test & Treat is a pathologist-driven program to provide cervical and breast cancer screening to underserved and underinsured patient populations. This program is largely funded by the CAP Foundation (College of American Pathologists, Northfield, Illinois) and is a collaborative effort among several medical specialties united to address gaps in the current health care system. OBJECTIVE: - To provide an outline for administering a See, Test & Treat program, using an academic medical center as a model for providing care and collating the results of 5 years of data on the See, Test & Treat program's findings. DESIGN: - Sources include data from patients seen at Tufts Medical Center (Boston, Massachusetts) who presented to the See, Test & Treat program and institutional data between 2010 and 2014 detailing the outline of how to organize and operationalize a volunteer cancer-screening program. RESULTS: - During the 5-year course of the program, 203 women were provided free cervical and breast cancer screening. Of the 169 patients who obtained Papanicolaou screening, 36 (21.3%) had abnormal Papanicolaou tests. In addition, 16 of 130 patients (12.3%) who underwent mammography had abnormal findings. CONCLUSIONS: - In general, women from ethnic populations have barriers that prevent them from participating in cancer screening. However, the CAP Foundation's See, Test & Treat program is designed to reduce those barriers for these women by providing care that addresses cultural, financial, and practical issues. Although screening programs are helpful in identifying those who need further treatment, obtaining further treatment for these patients continues to be a challenge.
27922686	NecroX-5 prevents breast cancer metastasis by AKT inhibition via reducing intracellular calcium levels.	A major goal of breast cancer research is to prevent the molecular events that lead to tumour metastasis. It is well-established that both cytoplasmic and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) play important roles in cell migration and metastasis. Accordingly, this study examined the molecular mechanisms of the anti-metastatic effects of NecroX-5, a mitochondrial ROS scavenger. NecroX-5 inhibited lung cancer metastasis by ameliorating migration in a mouse model. In human cancer cells, the inhibition of migration by NecroX-5 is cell type-dependent. We observed that the effect of NecroX-5 correlated with a reduction in mitochondrial ROS, but mitochondrial ROS reduction by MitoQ did not inhibit cell migration. NecroX-5 decreased intracellular calcium concentration by blocking Ca2+ influx, which mediated the inhibition of cell migration, AKT downregulation and the reduction of mitochondrial ROS levels. However, the reduction of mitochondrial ROS was not associated with supressed migration and AKT downregulation. Our study demonstrates the potential of NecroX-5 as an inhibitor of breast cancer metastasis.
27922682	Gene expression profiles of CYP24A1 and CYP27B1 in malignant and normal breast tissues.	Active vitamin D has several antitumor effects, including prodifferentiative, antiproliferative and proapoptotic functions in a number of tissues via its binding to vitamin D receptor. The 24hydroxylase (CYP24A1) and 1hydroxylase (CYP27B1) enzymes are considered to be pivotal determinants of the local concentration of active vitamin D. The aim of the present study was to investigate the mRNA expression levels of the CYP24A1 and CYP27B1 genes in malignant and normal breast tissues. The tumor and adjacent normal tissue samples of 30 patients with breast cancer were acquired from the Iran National Tumor Bank, Imam Hospital (Tehran, Iran). RNA was extracted and, following cDNA synthesis, TaqMan quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis was performed for CYP24A1 and CYP27B1. The results demonstrated that the mRNA expression of CYP27B1 was downregulated in the tumor tissues, compared with the adjacent normal tissues (P<0.01), whereas the mRNA expression of CYP24A1 was significantly upregulated in the tumor tissues (P<0.01). This major difference revealed that the normal breast tissues transcriptionally expressed CYP24A1 slightly. These results are suggestive of dysregulation of the vitamin D signaling and metabolic pathways during tumorigenesis in breast cancer. Local alterations in the anabolism and catabolism of active vitamin D in breast cancer by the CYP27B1 and CYP24A1 may impair its anticancer functions.
27922666	Antimicrobial peptide LL-37 promotes YB-1 expression, and the viability, migration and invasion of malignant melanoma cells.	The cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide, LL-37, is a multifunctional peptide with a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activities, such as chemotaxis and neutralizing endotoxins. Previous studies have demonstrated that it LL37 serves a functional role in the development of numerous types of cancer including ovarian, breast, prostate and lung cancer. However, its role in the development of malignant melanoma (MM) remains unclear. To determine the role of LL37 and the potential interaction with Y-box binding protein 1 (YB1) in MM, RNA interference, western blot, reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction, MTT and Transwell assays were performed. The current study demonstrated that LL37 induced YB1 expression, and increased tumor cell proliferation, migration and invasion of A375 and A875 MM cell lines. In addition, inhibition of nuclear factorkappaB (NFkappaB) attenuated LL37induced YB1 expression. These results demonstrate that, through the upregulation of YB1 expression and the activation of the NFkappaB signaling pathway, LL37 may promote the malignant progression of MM cells in vitro.
27920520	Ligand-based targeted therapy: a novel strategy for hepatocellular carcinoma.	Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common primary liver cancer with high morbidity and mortality worldwide. Chemotherapy is recommended to patients with intermediate or advanced stage cancer. However, the conventional chemotherapy yields low desired response rates due to multidrug resistance, fast clearance rate, nonspecific delivery, severe side effects, low drug concentration in cancer cells, and so on. Nanoparticle-mediated targeted drug delivery system can surmount the aforementioned obstacles through enhanced permeability and retention effect and active targeting as a novel approach of therapeutics for HCC in recent years. The active targeting is triggered by ligands on the delivery system, which recognize with and internalize into hepatoma cells with high specificity and efficiency. This review focuses on the latest targeted delivery systems for HCC and summarizes the ligands that can enhance the capacity of active targeting, to provide some insight into future research in nanomedicine for HCC.
27920001	A Case Report of Pneumocystis Jiroveci Pneumonia in a Patient with Metastatic Breast Cancer.	We describe a 69-year-old woman with metastatic breast cancer who developed dyspnea on exertion, persistent cough, fever and fatigue while on everolimus and exemestane combination. The initial differentials included opportunistic infection such as pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PJP) vs. pneumonitis. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) from bronchoscopy revealed PJP. The patient recovered after appropriate treatment. We also correlated the progressive decrease in her absolute lymphocyte count with PJP infection and recovery. This is the second case that PJP has been described in patients with breast cancer receiving everolimus. Clinicians should be vigilant in their monitoring of patients on everolimus-based regimens and promptly institute appropriate therapy to reduce and prevent morbidity and mortality.
27919996	Prognostic Influence of Internal Mammary Node Drainage in Patients with Early-stage Breast Cancer.	BACKGROUND: The management of internal mammary nodes (IMNs) during multidisciplinary treatment of breast cancer has been debated for the last four decades without unequivocal conclusion. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed patients with breast cancer who underwent sentinel lymph node biopsy at our center from 2008 until 2012. IMN drainage was assessed as a potential risk factor for local and distant disease recurrence. RESULTS: We identified 712 patients, with incidence of drainage to IMNs of 18.4%. No detrimental effect of the pattern of drainage to IMNs was found after a median follow-up of 58 months. A similar outcome was observed when drainage to IMNs was evaluated as a risk factor for patient survival. The potential risk factors for drainage to IMNs during sentinel lymph node biopsy were younger age (p=0.002) and tumor location in lower-outer, lower-inner, and upper-inner versus upper-outer quadrant (p<0.0001). CONCLUSION: The drainage to IMNs is unlikely to have a detrimental effect on patient outcome.
27919986	Videoscopic Inguinal-iliac-obturator Lymph-node Dissection: New Videoscopic Technique for Regional Lymphadenectomy in Patients with Melanoma.	AIM: The feasibility of videoscopic inguinal-iliac-obturator lymphadenectomy (VIIOL) was assessed in 20 patients with melanoma and compared with a retrospective sample of 24 patients undergoing standard 'open' technique (IIOL). RESULTS: No postoperative death occurred; the mean operative time was lower in the IIOL series (190 min vs. 302 min) but the quality of life was greatly improved in the VIIOL group thanks to earlier bladder catheter removal, no nasogastric suction, less pain, earlier mobilization, lower in-hospital stay, and earlier resumption of daily activities (27.6 vs. 83.2 days, p<0.001). Six out of 20 patients in the IIOL series had wound complications (30%) as compared to one in the VIIOL series (4%) (p=0.035). CONCLUSION: Staging and therapeutic efficacy of VIIOL were similar to the standard technique; the longer operative time of VIIOL was greatly compensated by less pain, lower wound complication rate, and earlier discharge from hospital and recovery of daily activities.
27919976	Phase I Study of Triweekly Nab-Paclitaxel Combined with S-1 in Patients with HER2-negative Metastatic Breast Cancer.	AIM: We conducted a phase I study to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended dose (RD) of triweekly nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel (nab-paclitaxel) and S-1 combination therapy in patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative metastatic breast cancer (MBC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study was carried out with a 3+3 dose escalation design; patients with HER2-negative MBC received nab-paclitaxel at 180-260 mg/m2 on day 1 and S-1 at 65-80 mg/m2 daily on days 1-14, repeated every 3 weeks. RESULTS: The MTD was level 3 (260 mg/m2 nab-paclitaxel with 80 mg/m2 S-1) and the RD was level 2 (260 mg/m2 nab-paclitaxel with 65 mg/m2 S-1). Dose-limiting toxicity was observed in two patients at level 3, who had grade 4 neutropenia and grade 3 myalgia, respectively. CONCLUSION: The response rate was 66.7%. The clinical benefit rate was 77.8%. Our study shows the efficacy and the feasibility of this combination therapy.
27919974	A Phase II Study of Adjuvant Chemotherapy of Tegafur-Uracil for Patients with Breast Cancer with HER2-negative Pathologic Residual Invasive Disease After Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy.	BACKGROUND: There is no consensus on the need for adjuvant chemotherapy for patients with pathological residual invasive breast cancer (non-pCR) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). We evaluated the tolerability and safety of tegafur-uracil (UFT) as adjuvant chemotherapy for patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative breast cancer that resulted in non-pCR after NAC. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We treated patients with 270 mg/m2 UFT per day for 2 years after definitive surgery and radiotherapy, if necessary. In cases with hormone-sensitive cancer, patients received concurrent endocrine therapy. The primary end-point was the rate of completion of scheduled UFT therapy. Secondary end-points included safety and disease-free survival. RESULTS: Twenty-one out of 29 patients (72%) completed the scheduled therapy. Eight patients discontinued the study treatment because of disease recurrence, toxicities, and patients' wish. Excluding liver dysfunction, adverse events were quite mild. CONCLUSION: Adjuvant UFT therapy after NAC was feasible and safe.
27919965	Bevacizumab Combined with Docetaxel or Paclitaxel as First-line Treatment of HER2-negative Metastatic Breast Cancer.	AIM: The study evaluated the efficacy of bevacizumab combined with a taxane-based treatment for advanced breast cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this non-randomized phase II study 65 patients received 10 mg/kg bevacizumab i.v. (days 1 and 15, q4w) plus either 50 mg/m2 docetaxel (days 1 and 15, q4w) or 90 mg/m2 paclitaxel (days 1,8 and 15, q4w) i.v. until disease progression, maximal response, unacceptable toxicity or the withdrawal of consent. Patients without progression continued bevacizumab at 15 mg/kg i.v. (q3w) alone, or with endocrine therapy. (NCT00979641). RESULTS: Progression-free survival was 11.3 months (95% confidence interval=9.7-16.0 months) and overall survival was 35.1 months (95% confidence interval=22.2-50.3 months). More than half of the patients (62%) responded at least partially. Bevacizumab-related serious adverse events occurred in 10.8% patients and one patient died because of gastrointestinal perforation. CONCLUSION: Treating advanced breast cancer with a bevacizumab-containing regimen as the first-line cytotoxic treatment resulted in excellent response rates and long survival.
27919961	Effects of Spiro-bisheterocycles on Proliferation and Apoptosis in Human Breast Cancer Cell Lines.	Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death in women worldwide and a critical public health concern. Here we investigated the anticancer potential and effects of low-molecular-weight bridgehead oxygen and nitrogen-containing spiro-bisheterocycles on proliferation and apoptosis of the human breast cancer cell lines MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231. The compounds feature a hydantoin moiety attached to either diazole, isoxazole, diazepine, oxazepine or benzodiazepine via the privileged tetrahedral spiro-linkage. Treatment with compounds spiro [hydantoin-isoxazole] and spiro [hydantoin-oxazepine] resulted in a dose-dependent decrease of cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis in both breast cancer cell lines, whereas spiro [hydantoin-diazepine] was only active against MDA-MB 231. Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis showed up-regulation of murine double minute 2 (MDM2), strictly p53-dependent, and detected an increase in expression of pro-apoptotic caspase 3 and BCL2-associated X (BAX) genes in both breast cancer cell lines expressing wild-type and mutant p53. In summary, the results suggest that our compounds promote apoptosis of breast cancer cell lines via p53-dependent and -independent pathways.
27919948	Long Noncoding RNA snaR Regulates Proliferation, Migration and Invasion of Triple-negative Breast Cancer Cells.	AIM: We evaluated the role of long noncoding ribonucleic acid (lncRNA) in breast cancer cell lines by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase change reaction. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The effects of small NF90-associated RNA (snaR) with RNA interference on proliferation, migration and invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells were observed by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide, wound healing and transwell assay. RESULTS: Among 90 lncRNAs, E2F transcription factor 4, p107/p130-binding (E2F4) antisense, insulin-like growth factor 2 antisense (IGF2AS), snaR, and small nucleolar RNA host gene 5 (SNHG5) were up-regulated in MDA-MB-231 and 7SK, antisense noncoding RNA in the INK4 locus (ANRIL), IGF2AS, Nespas, p53 mRNA, and snaR were up-regulated in MCF-7 cells. Down-regulation of snaR inhibited the proliferation, migration, and invasion of MDA-MD-231 breast cancer cells. CONCLUSION: LncRNA snaR was found to be up-regulated in breast cancer cells, and the cancer progression of MDA-MB-231 cells was significantly suppressed by down-regulation of snaR. Therefore, snaR knockdown has potential as a treatment modality for triple-negative breast cancer.
27919946	In Vivo Selection of Intermediately- and Highly-Malignant Variants of Triple-negative Breast Cancer in Orthotopic Nude Mouse Models.	AIM: Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), defined by the absence of receptors for estrogen, progesterone and human epithelial receptor 2 (HER2), is a recalcitrant disease in need of effective therapy. We previously isolated very-highly metastatic variants of the TNBC cell line MDA-MB-231 using serial orthotopic implantation of MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells in nude mice. MATERIALS AND METHODS: MDA-MB-231 cells expressing red fluorescent protein (MDA-MB-231-RFP) (1x107 cells/site) were initially injected subcutaneously in the flank of nude mice. After the subcutaneous tumors grew, they were harvested and cut into small pieces for orthotopic implantation into the right lower mammary gland. After the orthotopic tumors grew, they were resected and cut into small pieces and orthotopically re-implanted into the mammary gland of nude mice. The tumors grew and metastasized to lymph nodes. The lymph node metastases were harvested and cut into small pieces and orthotopically re-implanted into the mammary gland of nude mice. After the orthotopic tumors grew, the tumor was removed leaving residual cancer cells, which grew and metastasized to lymph nodes. The lymph node metastases were harvested, cut into pieces and orthotopically re-implanted into the mammary gland of nude mice for three or seven cycles in order to isolate intermediately, or highly-metastatic variants, respectively. RESULTS: The degree of malignancy of isolated variants of MDA-MB-231 depends on the extent of orthotopic transplantation. Serial transplantation resulted in MDA-MB-231-RFP which significantly produced larger tumors compared with the parental MDA-MB-231-RFP. Serial orthotopic implantation for three cycles resulted in intermediately-metastatic variants of MDA-MB-231-RFP. MDA-MB-231-RFP serially orthotopically transplanted seven times significantly metastasized more to lymph nodes compared with parental MDA-MB-231-RFP cells and the intermediately-metastatic variant. The highly-metastatic variant MDA-MB-231-RFP cells significantly metastasized to the lung to a greater extent compared with parental MDA-MB-231-RFP and intermediate variants of MDA-MB-231-RFP. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the number of serial orthotopic transplantations of MDA-MB-231-RFP correlates positively with tumor aggressiveness, and the intermediately- and highly-metastatic variants can serve as models of metastatic progression of TNBC.
27919267	Targeted drug delivery of near IR fluorescent doxorubicin-conjugated poly(ethylene glycol) bisphosphonate nanoparticles for diagnosis and therapy of primary and metastatic bone cancer in a mouse model.	BACKGROUND: Most primary and metastatic bone tumors demonstrate increased osteoclast activity and bone resorption. Current treatment is based on a combination of surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Severe side effects are associated with chemotherapy due to use of high dosage and nonspecific uptake. Bisphosphonates have a strong affinity to Ca2+ ions and are widely used in the treatment of bone disorders. RESULTS: We have engineered a unique biodegradable bisphosphonate nanoparticle (NPs) bearing two functional surface groups: (1) primary amine groups for covalent attachment of a dye/drug (e.g. NIR dye Cy 7 or doxorubicin); (2) bisphosphonate groups for targeting and chelation to bone hydroxyapatite. In addition, these engineered NPs contain high polyethyleneglycol (PEG) concentration in order to increase their blood half life time. In vitro experiments on Saos-2 human osteosarcoma cell line, demonstrated that at a tenth of the concentration, doxorubicin-conjugated bisphosphonate NPs achieved a similar uptake to free doxorubicin. In vivo targeting experiments using the NIR fluorescence bisphosphonate NPs on both Soas-2 human osteosarcoma xenograft mouse model and orthotopic bone metastases mCherry-labeled 4T1 breast cancer mouse model confirmed specific targeting. In addition, therapeutic in vivo experiments using doxorubicin-conjugated bisphosphonate NPs demonstrated a 40% greater inhibition of tumor growth in Saos-2 human osteosarcoma xenograft mouse model when compared to free doxorubicin. CONCLUSIONS: In this research we have shown the potential use of doxorubicin-conjugated BP NPs for the targeting and treatment of primary and metastatic bone tumors. The targeted delivery of doxorubicin to the tumor significantly increased the efficacy of the anti-cancer drug, thus enabling the effective use of a lower concentration of doxorubicin. Furthermore, the targeting ability of the BP NPs in an orthotopic xenograft mouse model reinforced our findings that these BP NPs have the potential to be used for the treatment of primary and metastatic bone cancer.
27919198	Occupational sedentariness and breast cancer risk.	BACKGROUND: Epidemiological studies have indicated that physical activity reduces the risk of developing breast cancer. More recently, sedentary behavior has been suggested as a risk factor independent of physical activity level. The purpose of the present study was to investigate occupational sedentariness and breast cancer risk in pre- and postmenopausal women. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a population-based prospective cohort study (n = 29 524), working history was assessed by a questionnaire between 1990 and 1992. Participants were classified as having: (1) sedentary occupations only; (2) mixed occupations or (3) non-sedentary occupations only. The association between occupational sedentariness and breast cancer incidence was analyzed by Cox regression, adjusted for known risk factors and participation in competitive sports. RESULTS: Women with a working history of occupational sedentariness had a significantly increased risk of breast cancer (adjusted HR 1.20; 95% CI 1.05, 1.37) compared with those with mixed or non-sedentary occupations. The association was stronger among women younger than 55 years (adjusted HR 1.54; 95% CI 1.20, 1.96), whereas no association was seen in women 55 years or older. Adjustment for participation in competitive sports did not change the association. CONCLUSIONS: We found that occupational sedentariness was associated with increased breast cancer risk, especially in women younger than 55 years. This may be a modifiable risk factor by planning breaks during the working day. Whether this reduces the risk of breast cancer needs to be further studied.
27918780	Effect of a Proposed Trastuzumab Biosimilar Compared With Trastuzumab on Overall Response Rate in Patients With ERBB2 (HER2)-Positive Metastatic Breast Cancer: A Randomized Clinical Trial.	Importance: Treatment with the anti-ERBB2 humanized monoclonal antibody trastuzumab and chemotherapy significantly improves outcome in patients with ERBB2 (HER2)-positive metastatic breast cancer; a clinically effective biosimilar may help increase access to this therapy. Objective: To compare the overall response rate and assess the safety of a proposed trastuzumab biosimilar plus a taxane or trastuzumab plus a taxane in patients without prior treatment for ERBB2-positive metastatic breast cancer. Design, Setting, and Participants: Multicenter, double-blind, randomized, parallel-group, phase 3 equivalence study in patients with metastatic breast cancer. From December 2012 to August 2015, 500 patients were randomized 1:1 to receive a proposed biosimilar or trastuzumab plus a taxane. Chemotherapy was administered for at least 24 weeks followed by antibody alone until unacceptable toxic effects or disease progression occurred. Interventions: Proposed biosimilar (n = 230) or trastuzumab (n = 228) with a taxane. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was week 24 overall response rate (ORR) defined as complete or partial response. Equivalence boundaries were 0.81 to 1.24 with a 90% CI for ORR ratio (proposed biosimilar/trastuzumab) and -15% to 15% with a 95% CI for ORR difference. Secondary outcome measures included time to tumor progression, progression-free and overall survival at week 48, and adverse events. Results: Among 500 women randomized, the intention-to-treat population included 458 women (mean [SD] age, 53.6 [11.11] years) and the safety population included 493 women. The ORR was 69.6% (95% CI, 63.62%-75.51%) for the proposed biosimilar vs 64.0% (95% CI, 57.81%-70.26%) for trastuzumab. The ORR ratio (1.09; 90% CI, 0.974-1.211) and ORR difference (5.53; 95% CI, -3.08 to 14.04) were within the equivalence boundaries. At week 48, there was no statistically significant difference with the proposed biosimilar vs trastuzumab for time to tumor progression (41.3% vs 43.0%; -1.7%; 95% CI, -11.1% to 6.9%), progression-free survival (44.3% vs 44.7%; -0.4%; 95% CI, -9.4% to 8.7%), or overall survival (89.1% vs 85.1%; 4.0%; 95% CI, -2.1% to 10.3%). In the proposed biosimilar and trastuzumab groups, 239 (98.6%) and 233 (94.7%) had at least 1 adverse event, the most common including neutropenia (57.5% vs 53.3%), peripheral neuropathy (23.1% vs 24.8%), and diarrhea (20.6% vs 20.7%). Conclusions and Relevance: Among women with ERBB2-positive metastatic breast cancer receiving taxanes, the use of a proposed trastuzumab biosimilar compared with trastuzumab resulted in an equivalent overall response rate at 24 weeks. Further study is needed to assess safety and long-term clinical outcome. Trial Registration: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT02472964; EudraCT Identifier: 2011-001965-42.
27918777	Global, Regional, and National Cancer Incidence, Mortality, Years of Life Lost, Years Lived With Disability, and Disability-Adjusted Life-years for 32 Cancer Groups, 1990 to 2015: A Systematic Analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study.	Importance: Cancer is the second leading cause of death worldwide. Current estimates on the burden of cancer are needed for cancer control planning. Objective: To estimate mortality, incidence, years lived with disability (YLDs), years of life lost (YLLs), and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) for 32 cancers in 195 countries and territories from 1990 to 2015. Evidence Review: Cancer mortality was estimated using vital registration system data, cancer registry incidence data (transformed to mortality estimates using separately estimated mortality to incidence [MI] ratios), and verbal autopsy data. Cancer incidence was calculated by dividing mortality estimates through the modeled MI ratios. To calculate cancer prevalence, MI ratios were used to model survival. To calculate YLDs, prevalence estimates were multiplied by disability weights. The YLLs were estimated by multiplying age-specific cancer deaths by the reference life expectancy. DALYs were estimated as the sum of YLDs and YLLs. A sociodemographic index (SDI) was created for each location based on income per capita, educational attainment, and fertility. Countries were categorized by SDI quintiles to summarize results. Findings: In 2015, there were 17.5 million cancer cases worldwide and 8.7 million deaths. Between 2005 and 2015, cancer cases increased by 33%, with population aging contributing 16%, population growth 13%, and changes in age-specific rates contributing 4%. For men, the most common cancer globally was prostate cancer (1.6 million cases). Tracheal, bronchus, and lung cancer was the leading cause of cancer deaths and DALYs in men (1.2 million deaths and 25.9 million DALYs). For women, the most common cancer was breast cancer (2.4 million cases). Breast cancer was also the leading cause of cancer deaths and DALYs for women (523000 deaths and 15.1 million DALYs). Overall, cancer caused 208.3 million DALYs worldwide in 2015 for both sexes combined. Between 2005 and 2015, age-standardized incidence rates for all cancers combined increased in 174 of 195 countries or territories. Age-standardized death rates (ASDRs) for all cancers combined decreased within that timeframe in 140 of 195 countries or territories. Countries with an increase in the ASDR due to all cancers were largely located on the African continent. Of all cancers, deaths between 2005 and 2015 decreased significantly for Hodgkin lymphoma (-6.1% [95% uncertainty interval (UI), -10.6% to -1.3%]). The number of deaths also decreased for esophageal cancer, stomach cancer, and chronic myeloid leukemia, although these results were not statistically significant. Conclusion and Relevance: As part of the epidemiological transition, cancer incidence is expected to increase in the future, further straining limited health care resources. Appropriate allocation of resources for cancer prevention, early diagnosis, and curative and palliative care requires detailed knowledge of the local burden of cancer. The GBD 2015 study results demonstrate that progress is possible in the war against cancer. However, the major findings also highlight an unmet need for cancer prevention efforts, including tobacco control, vaccination, and the promotion of physical activity and a healthy diet.
27918753	Axillary Nodal Management Following Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy: A Review.	Importance: The increasing use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) for operable breast cancer has raised questions about optimal local therapy for the axilla. Observations: Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) after NAC in patients presenting with clinically negative nodes has an accuracy similar to upfront SLNB and reduces the need for axillary lymph node dissection compared with SLNB prior to NAC. In patients presenting with node-positive disease, clinical trials demonstrate that SLNB after NAC is accurate when 3 or more sentinel nodes are obtained, but long-term outcomes are lacking. The relative importance of pre- and post-NAC stage in predicting risk of locoregional recurrence remains an area of controversy. Conclusions and Relevance: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy reduces the need for axillary lymph node dissection, and SLNB is an accurate method of determining nodal status after NAC.
27917789	Stimulation of Protein Expression Through the Harmonic Resonance of Frequency-Specific Music.	PURPOSE: The use of specific frequencies for specific individual amino acids may increase the potential energy of protein molecules in the medium [1]. The resonance would also increase the movement of particles in the cytosol, increasing the collisions necessary for the conduction of protein expression. METHODS: The clash of two waves that share frequencies will exhibit an increase in energy through an increase in amplitude [2]. The increase in energy would in turn increase the number of collisions forming the tRNA-amino acid, increasing the amino acid acquiry for ribosomes to improve intracellular efficiency in gene expression. To test the hypothesis, Red Fluorescent Protein (RFP) in transformated BL-21 strains of E. coli and p53 protein of MCF-7 were examined after exposure to sounds of specific frequencies. RESULTS: Through the exposure of the experimental systems to a sequence of sounds that match the frequencies of specific amino acids, the levels of RFP exhibition respective to the control groups in the bacterial medium increased two-fold in terms of RFU. The experiments that targeted the p53 protein with the 'music' showed a decrease in the cell prevalence in the MCF-7 type breast cancer cells by 28%, by decreasing the speed of tumour formation. CONCLUSION: Exposure to 'music' that was designed through assigning a musical note for every single one of the twenty unique amino acids, produced both an analytical and a visible shift in protein synthesis, making it as potential tool for reducing procedural time uptake.
27916966	Alpha- and Beta-Cyclodextrin Inclusion Complexes with 5-Fluorouracil: Characterization and Cytotoxic Activity Evaluation.	Cyclodextrins are natural macrocyclic oligosaccharides able to form inclusion complexes with a wide variety of guests, affecting their physicochemical and pharmaceutical properties. In order to obtain an improvement of the bioavailability and solubility of 5-fluorouracil, a pyrimidine analogue used as chemotherapeutic agent in the treatment of the colon, liver, and stomac cancers, the drug was complexed with alpha- and beta-cyclodextrin. The inclusion complexes were prepared in the solid state by kneading method and characterized by Fourier transform-infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy and X-ray powder diffractometry. In solution, the 1:1 stoichiometry for all the inclusion complexes was established by the Job plot method and the binding constants were determined at different pHs by UV-VIS titration. Furthermore, the cytotoxic activity of 5-fluorouracil and its complexation products were evaluated using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay on MCF-7 (breast cancer cell line), Hep G2 (hepatocyte carcinoma cell line), Caco-2 (colon adenocarcinoma cell line), and A-549 (alveolar basal epithelial carcinoma cell line). The results showed that both inclusion complexes increased the 5-fluorouracil capability of inhibiting cell growth. In particular, 5-fluorouracil complexed with beta-cyclodextrin had the highest cytotoxic activity on MCF-7; with alpha-cyclodextrin the highest cytotoxic activity was observed on A-549. The IC50 values were equal to 31 and 73 microM at 72 h, respectively. Our results underline the possibility of using these inclusion complexes in pharmaceutical formulations for improving 5-fluorouracil therapeutic efficacy.
27916791	Different Phases of Breast Cancer Cells: Raman Study of Immortalized, Transformed, and Invasive Cells.	Breast cancer is the most prevalent cause of cancer-associated death in women the world over, but if detected early it can be treated successfully. Therefore, it is important to diagnose this disease at an early stage and to understand the biochemical changes associated with cellular transformation and cancer progression. Deregulated lipid metabolism has been shown to contribute to cell transformation as well as cancer progression. In this study, we monitored the biomolecular changes associated with the transformation of a normal cell into an invasive cell associated with breast cancer using Raman microspectroscopy. We have utilized primary normal breast cells, and immortalized, transformed, non-invasive, and invasive breast cancer cells. The Raman spectra were acquired from all these cell lines under physiological conditions. The higher wavenumber (2800-3000 cm-1) and lower wavenumber (700-1800 cm-1) range of the Raman spectrum were analyzed and we observed increased lipid levels for invasive cells. The Raman spectral data were analyzed by principal component-linear discriminant analysis (PC-LDA), which resulted in the formation of distinct clusters for different cell types with a high degree of sensitivity. The subsequent testing of the PC-LDA analysis via the leave-one-out cross validation approach (LOOCV) yielded relatively high identification sensitivity. Additionally, the Raman spectroscopic results were confirmed through fluorescence staining tests with BODIPY and Nile Red biochemical assays. Furthermore, Raman maps from the above mentioned cells under fixed conditions were also acquired to visualize the distribution of biomolecules throughout the cell. The present study shows the suitability of Raman spectroscopy as a non-invasive, label-free, microspectroscopic technique, having the potential of probing changes in the biomolecular composition of living cells as well as fixed cells.
27916718	Loss of the Opa interacting protein 5 inhibits breast cancer proliferation through miR-139-5p/NOTCH1 pathway.	Opa interacting protein 5 (OIP5) has been reported to be over-expressed in several kinds of human cancer. However, the biological function and clinical significance of OIP5 in human breast cancer remains unknown. In this study, we found that OIP5 was notably over-expressed in breast cancer tissues compared with their corresponding nontumorous tissues. Statistical analysis showed a significant correlation of OIP5 expression with advanced clinical stage. Ablation OIP5 inhibited the proliferation of breast cancer cells. OIP5 over-expression inhibited hsa-miR-139-5p expression, antagonized its functions and led to the de-repression of its endogenous target NOTCH1, which was a core oncogene in promoting breast cancer progression. Our results suggested that OIP5 is a potential diagnosis biomarker and therapeutic target for breast cancer.
27916642	Magnetic hyperthermia and pH-responsive effective drug delivery to the sub-cellular level of human breast cancer cells by modified CoFe2O4 nanoparticles.	Magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (MNPs) have been extensively utilized in a wide range of biomedical applications including magnetic hyperthermia agent. To improve the efficiency of the MNPs in therapeutic applications, in this study, we have synthesized CoFe2O4 nanoparticles and its surface was further functionalized with meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA). The anticancer agent, Doxorubucin (DOX) was conjugated with CoFe2O4@DMSA nanoparticle to evaluate the combined effects of thermotherapy and chemotherapy. The drug delivery efficiency of the DOX loaded CoFe2O4@DMSA nanoparticles were examined based on magnetically triggered delivery of DOX into the subcellular level of cancer cells by using MDA-MB-231 cell line. The amine part of the DOX molecules were effectively attached through an electrostatic interactions and/or hydrogen bonding interactions with the carboxylic acid groups of the DMSA functionalities present onto the surface of the CoFe2O4 nanoparticles. The DOX loaded CoFe2O4@DMSA nanoparticles can effectively uptake with cancer cells via typical endocytosis process. After endocytosis, DOX release from CoFe2O4 nanoparticles was triggered by intracellular endosomal/lysosomal acidic environments and the localized heat can be generated under an alternating magnetic field (AMF). In the presence of AMF, the released DOX molecules were accumulated with high concentrations into the subcellular level at a desired sites and exhibited a synergistic effect of an enhanced cell cytotoxicity by the combined effects of thermal-chemotherapy. Importantly, pH- and thermal-responsive Dox-loaded CoFe2O4 nanoparticles induced significant cellular apoptosis more efficiently mediated by active mitochondrial membrane and ROS generation than the free Dox. Thus, the Dox-loaded CoFe2O4@DMSA nanoparticles can be used as a potential therapeutic agent in cancer therapy by combining the thermo-chemotherapy techniques.
27916422	PGC-1 alpha interacts with microRNA-217 to functionally regulate breast cancer cell proliferation.	BACKGROUND: In this study, we explored the functional mechanism of PPARg co-activator 1-alpha (PGC-1alpha) in regulating miR-217-mediated breast cancer development in vitro. METHODS: Dual-luciferase activity assay was applied to examine the binding of miR-217 on PGC-1alpha gene. Breast cancer cell lines, MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 were infected by lentivirus to constitutively downregulate miR-217. Its regulation on PGC-1alpha expression was investigated by qRT-PCR and western blot. PGC-1alpha gene was subsequently downregulated by siRNA in miR-217-downregulated breast cancer cells to examine its effect on cancer proliferation and cell-cycle progression. In addition, another downstream target gene of miR-217, DACH1, was further downregulated in breast cancer cells to investigate the functional association of PGC-1alpha and DACH1 in miR-217-mediated breast cancer regulation. RESULTS: PGC-1alpha gene was directly bound by human miR-217. Downregulation of miR-217 in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells increased PGC-1alpha production at both mRNA and protein levels. SiRNA-mediated PGC-1alpha downregulation reversed the inhibition of miR-217-downregulaiton on breast cancer proliferation and cell-cycle progression. Moreover, siRNA-mediated DACH1 downregulation further reversed miR-217-downregulaiton induced inhibition on cancer proliferation and cell-cycle progression in PGC-1alpha downregulated MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. CONCLUSION: MiR-217 is the upstream regulator of PGC-1alpha in breast cancer regulation in vitro, possibly independent of DACH1 signaling pathway.
27916314	Intraoperative ultrasound guidance in breast-conserving surgery shows superiority in oncological outcome, long-term cosmetic and patient-reported outcomes: Final outcomes of a randomized controlled trial (COBALT).	BACKGROUND: The multicenter randomized controlled COBALT trial demonstrated that ultrasound-guided breast-conserving surgery (USS) results in a significant reduction of margin involvement (3.1% vs. 13%) and excision volumes compared to palpation-guided surgery (PGS). The aim of the present study was to determine long term oncological and patient-reported outcomes including quality of life (QoL), together with their progress over time. METHODS: 134 patients with T1-T2 breast cancer were randomized to USS (N = 65) or PGS (N = 69). Cosmetic outcomes were assessed with the Breast Cancer Conservative Treatment cosmetic results (BCCT.core) software, panel-evaluation and patient self-evaluation on a 4-point Likert-scale. QoL was measured using the EORTC QLQ-C30/-BR23 questionnaire. RESULTS: No locoregional recurrences were reported after mean follow-up of 41 months. Seven patients (5%) developed distant metastatic disease (USS 6.3%, PGS 4.4%, p = 0.466), of whom six died of disease (95.5% overall survival). USS achieved better cosmetic outcomes compared to PGS, with poor outcomes of 11% and 21% respectively, a result mainly attributable to mastectomies due to involved margins following PGS. There was no difference after 1 and 3 years in cosmetic outcome. Dissatisfied patients included those with larger excision volumes, additional local therapies and worse QoL. Patients with poor/fair cosmetic outcomes scored significantly lower on aspects of QoL, including breast-symptoms, body image and sexual enjoyment. CONCLUSION: By significantly reducing positive margin status and lowering resection volumes, USS improves the rate of good cosmetic outcomes and increases patient-satisfaction. Considering the large impact of cosmetic outcome on QoL, USS has great potential to improve QoL following breast-conserving therapy.
27915342	In Vitro Effects of HAS-2 Gene Silencing on the Proliferation and Apoptosis of the MCF-7 Human Breast Cancer Cell Line.	BACKGROUND: Breast cancer is characterized by a distinct metastatic pattern involving the regional lymph nodes, bone marrow, lung and liver. This study is aimed to investigate the effects of silencing the HAS-2 gene on the proliferation and apoptosis of human breast cancer cells. METHODS: MCF-7 cells were collected and assigned into control, scrambled siRNA and HAS-2- siRNA groups. After transfection, the morphological changes in the MCF-7 cells were observed using phase contrast microscopy. qRT-PCR and Western blot assays were used to detect the mRNA and protein expression of apoptosis-related proteins. CCK-8 and flow cytometry were performed to evaluate cell proliferation, the cell cycle and apoptosis. RESULTS: In the control and the scrambled siRNA groups, cells grew adhered to the wall and mainly showed a spindle shape with a clear nucleolus. Compared with the control and scrambled siRNA groups, increases in the number of cells in early apoptosis and metaphase cells in apoptosis were observed in the HAS-2-siRNA group. The HAS-2-siRNA group showed decreased expression of HAS-2 relative to that in the control and scrambled siRNA groups. No significant differences in cell proliferation, cell cycle distribution or apoptosis were noted between the control and scrambled siRNA groups. In the HAS-2-siRNA group, the cell proliferation ability decreased significantly, but the number of cells in the G0/G1 stage, the number of apoptotic cells and the expression of caspase-3 and caspase-9 increased significantly. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that HAS-2 gene silencing may inhibit proliferation and promote apoptosis in the MCF-7 human breast cancer cell line.
27915204	POWERPIINC (PreOperative Window of Endocrine TheRapy Provides Information to Increase Compliance) trial: Changes in tumor proliferation index and quality of life with 7 days of preoperative tamoxifen.	OBJECTIVES: A decrease in Ki67 during neoadjuvant therapy predicts response to tamoxifen. Previous trials have shown a decreased Ki67 in breast tumors with as little as two or more weeks of preoperative tamoxifen. Shortening the preoperative treatment time in window of opportunity clinical trials makes these trials more attractive to women. POWERPIINC examined the effect of 7 days of preoperative tamoxifen on breast tumor proliferation and patient symptoms. METHODS: Women with untreated stage I/II, ER-positive, invasive breast cancer with no contraindications to tamoxifen were enrolled. Women received 20 mg of tamoxifen for 7 days up to the day of surgery. Proliferation was assessed by Ki67 immunohistochemistry before and after 7 days of tamoxifen. Symptoms and QOL were assessed by the FACT-ES and MENQOL. Adherence was measured by pill counts. RESULTS: 52 women were enrolled, and 44 were evaluable for Ki67. The median age was 58.5 years, and the median tumor diameter was 1.2 cm. Most women (73%) were post-menopausal. Most tumors were PR positive (88%) and HER2-negative (92%). The Ki67 decreased by a geometric mean of 40% (95% CI 29%-63%), and 73% (95% CI 57%-85%) of women had tumors with decreased proliferation (p = 0.0001 by paired t-test). Adherence to taking tamoxifen during the preoperative period was 100%. Women reported minimal bother from psychosocial or physical symptoms at baseline or on the day of surgery. CONCLUSION: Seven days of tamoxifen showed a similar relative decrease in Ki67 as that reported for longer courses, was acceptable to women, and could be considered for window of opportunity studies.
27915203	Adjuvant radiation therapy and survival for adenoid cystic carcinoma of the breast.	PURPOSE: The assess the clinical value of different types of surgical procedures and further analyze the effect of adjuvant radiation therapy (RT) for adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) of the breast. METHODS: Patients with ACC of the breast were identified using a population-based national registration database (Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results, SEER). The Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression models were performed to determine the impact of the surgical procedures and adjuvant RT associated with cause-specific survival (CSS) and overall survival (OS). RESULTS: A total of 478 patients with ACC of the breast were identified. The median follow-up was 59 months. The 10-year CSS and OS were 87.5% and 75.3%, respectively. For the Kaplan-Meier analysis, the 5-year CSS were 96.1%, 91.8%, 90.2%, and 94.1% in patients that received lumpectomy + adjuvant RT, lumpectomy alone, mastectomy alone, and mastectomy + adjuvant RT, respectively (p = 0.026). In the multivariate Cox analyses, lumpectomy + adjuvant RT was an independent prognostic factor for CSS and OS. Patients that received lumpectomy + adjuvant RT had better survival rates than patients that underwent lumpectomy only (CSS, p = 0.018; OS, p = 0.031) and mastectomy only (CSS, p = 0.010; OS, p = 0.004). CONCLUSION: ACC of the breast has an excellent prognosis. Breast-conserving surgery is a reasonable alternative for patients with ACC of the breast, and adjuvant RT after lumpectomy improved survival rates.
27914780	A Monte Carlo analysis of breast screening randomized trials.	PURPOSE: To analyze breast screening randomized trials with a Monte Carlo simulation tool. METHODS: A simulation tool previously developed to simulate breast screening programmes was adapted for that purpose. The history of women participating in the trials was simulated, including a model for survival after local treatment of invasive cancers. Distributions of time gained due to screening detection against symptomatic detection and the overall screening sensitivity were used as inputs. Several randomized controlled trials were simulated. Except for the age range of women involved, all simulations used the same population characteristics and this permitted to analyze their external validity. The relative risks obtained were compared to those quoted for the trials, whose internal validity was addressed by further investigating the reasons of the disagreements observed. RESULTS: The Monte Carlo simulations produce results that are in good agreement with most of the randomized trials analyzed, thus indicating their methodological quality and external validity. A reduction of the breast cancer mortality around 20% appears to be a reasonable value according to the results of the trials that are methodologically correct. Discrepancies observed with Canada I and II trials may be attributed to a low mammography quality and some methodological problems. Kopparberg trial appears to show a low methodological quality. CONCLUSION: Monte Carlo simulations are a powerful tool to investigate breast screening controlled randomized trials, helping to establish those whose results are reliable enough to be extrapolated to other populations and to design the trial strategies and, eventually, adapting them during their development.
27914769	Clinicopathological and molecular characteristics of Ku 70/80 expression in Nigerian breast cancer and its potential therapeutic implications.	Ku 70/80 is a regulator of the Non-Homologous End Joining (NHEJ) roles in clinicopathological features, and has prognostic significance in breast cancer (BC) in Caucasian populations. However, its significance in the Nigerian BC population, which is characterized by a higher rate of the triple-negative and basal phenotype, p53 mutation rate and BRCA1 deficiency, still needs to be investigated. We hypothesize that Ku70/80 expression shows adverse expression in Nigerian BC and, furthermore, that it is likely to have a therapeutic implication for Black BC management. This study investigated the biological, clinicopathological and prognostic significance of Ku 70/80 expression in a BC cohort from a Nigerian population. Ku 70/80 expression was determined in 188 well-characterized formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) BC samples using tissue microarray and immunohistochemistry. Ku 70/80 expression was correlated with clinicopathological, molecular and prognostic characteristics of patients. Ku 70/80 was expressed in 113 (60.1%) tumors, and was positively associated with metastatic disease, triple-negative and basal phenotype, BRCA1 down regulators (MTA-1 and ID4), p-cadherin, PI3KCA and p53 expression. It inversely correlated with BRCA1, BRCA2, BARD1 and p27. Ku 70/80 was predictive of breast cancer-specific survival in multivariate analysis, but not of disease-free interval. This study demonstrated that Ku 70/80 expression is associated with triple negativity and down-regulation of the homologous recombination pathway of DNA repair. Therefore, the development of novel drugs to target KU70/80 may improve the patients' outcome in the treatment of Black BC.
27914571	Evaluating the anticancer activity and nanoparticulate nature of homeopathic preparations of Terminalia chebula.	BACKGROUND: Breast cancer is the most common cancer diagnosed among women and is the second leading cause of cancer death. Homeopathic medicines are part of the alternative medicines that are given as a supportive therapy in breast cancer. The objective of this study was to investigate the anticancer activity of commercially available homeopathic preparations of Terminalia chebula (TC) and evaluate their nanoparticulate nature. METHODS: Mother tincture (MT) and other homeopathic preparations (3X, 6C and 30C) of TC were tested for their effect on the viability of breast cancer (MDAMB231 and MCF7) and non-cancerous (HEK 293) cell lines by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Cell growth assay was performed to analyze the effect of the different potencies on the growth kinetics of breast cancer cells. MT and 6C were evaluated for the presence of nanoparticles by using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). RESULTS: MT decreased the viability of breast cancer (MDAMB231 and MCF7) and non-cancerous (HEK 293) cells. However, the other potencies (3X, 6C and 30C) decreased the viability of only breast cancer cells without affecting the viability of the non-cancerous cells. All the potencies, MT, 3X, 6C and 30C, reduced growth kinetics of breast cancer cells, more specifically at 1:10 dilution at 24, 48 and 72 h. Under SEM, MT appeared as a mesh-like structure whereas under TEM, it showed presence of nanoclusters. On the other hand, 6C potency contained 20 nm sized nanoparticles. CONCLUSION: The current study reports the anticancer activity of homeopathic preparations of TC against breast cancer and reveals their nanoparticulate nature. These preliminary results warrant further mechanistic studies at both in vitro and in vivo levels to evaluate the potential of TC as nanomedicine in breast cancer.
27914569	Treatment with Ruta graveolens 5CH and Rhus toxicodendron 9CH may reduce joint pain and stiffness linked to aromatase inhibitors in women with early breast cancer: results of a pilot observational study.	OBJECTIVE: To determine the possible effect of two homeopathic medicines, Ruta graveolens 5CH and Rhus toxicodendron 9CH, in the prevention of aromatase inhibitor (AI) associated joint pain and/or stiffness in women with early, hormone-receptor positive, breast cancer. METHODS: This prospective, unrandomized observational study was carried out between April and October 2014. Women were recruited in two groups, according to which of the two study centres they attended: one receiving homeopathy in addition to standard treatment (group H) and a control group, receiving standard treatment (group C). All women were treated with an AI. In addition, women in group H also took Ruta graveolens 5CH and Rhus toxicodendron 9CH (5 granules, twice a day) up to 7 days before starting AI treatment. The homeopathic medicines were continued for 3 months. Demographic and clinical data were recorded using a self-assessment questionnaire at inclusion (T0) and 3 months (T3). Primary evaluation criteria were the evolution of scores for joint pain and stiffness, the impact of pain on sleep and analgesic consumption in the two groups after 3 months of treatment. RESULTS: Forty patients (mean age 64.9+/-8.1 years) were recruited, 20 in each group. Two-thirds of the patients had joint pain before starting AI treatment. There was a significant difference in the evolution of mean composite pain score between T0 and T3 in the two groups (-1.3 in group H vs. +3.4 in group C; p=0.0001). The individual components of the pain score (frequency, intensity and number of sites of pain) also decreased significantly in group H. Nine patients in group C (45%) vs. 1 (5%) in group H increased their analgesic consumption between T0 and T3 (p=0.0076). After 3 months of treatment, joint pain had a worse impact on sleep in patients in group C (35% vs. 0% of patients; p=0.0083). The differences observed in the evolution of morning and daytime stiffness between the two groups were smaller (p=0.053 and p=0.33, respectively), with the exception of time necessary for the disappearance of morning stiffness which was greater in group C (37.7+/-23.0 vs. 17.9+/-20.1 min; p=0.0173). CONCLUSION: These preliminary results suggest that treatment with Ruta graveolens 5CH and Rhus toxicodendron 9CH may decrease joint pain/stiffness in breast cancer patients treated with AIs. A larger-scale randomized study is required to confirm these results.
27914467	Impact of the occurrence of a response shift on the determination of the minimal important difference in a health-related quality of life score over time.	BACKGROUND: An important challenge of the longitudinal analysis of health-related quality of life (HRQOL) is the potential occurrence of a Response Shift (RS) effect. While the impact of RS effect on the longitudinal analysis of HRQOL has already been studied, few studies have been conducted on its impact on the determination of the Minimal Important Difference (MID). This study aims to investigate the impact of the RS effect on the determination of the MID over time for each scale of both EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-BR23 questionnaires in breast cancer patients. METHODS: Patients with breast cancer completed the EORTC QLQ-C30 and the EORTC QLQ-BR23 questionnaires at baseline (time of diagnosis; T0), three months (T1) and six months after surgery (T2). Four hospitals and care centers participated in this study: cancer centers of Dijon and Nancy, the university hospitals of Reims and Strasbourg At T1 and T2, patients were asked to evaluate their HRQOL change during the last 3 months using the Jaeschke transition question. They were also asked to assess retrospectively their HRQOL level of three months ago. The occurrence of the RS effect was explored using the then-test method and its impact on the determination of the MID by using the Anchor-based method. RESULTS: Between February 2006 and February 2008, 381 patients were included of mean age 58 years old (SD = 11). For patients who reported a deterioration of their HRQOL level at each follow-up, an increase of RS effect has been detected between T1 and T2 in 13/15 dimensions of QLQ-C30 questionnaire, and 4/7 dimensions of QLQ-BR23 questionnaire. In contrast, a decrease of the RS effect was observed in 8/15 dimensions of QLQ-C30 questionnaire and in 5/7 dimensions of QLQ-BR23 questionnaire in case of improvement. At T2, the MID became >/= 5 points when taking into account the RS effect in 10/15 dimensions of QLQ-C30 questionnaire and in 5/7 dimensions of QLQ-BR23 questionnaire. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights that the RS effect increases over time in case of deterioration and decreases in case of improvement. Moreover, taking the RS into account produces a reliable and significant MID.
27914261	Reducing implant loss rates in immediate breast reconstructions.	UK best practice guidelines for oncoplastic breast reconstruction were published in 2012. Implant-based reconstruction quality indicator (QI) targets for readmission, return to theatre and implant loss rates were set at 5% by 3 months, along with guidance to achieve these targets. The aims of this study were to quantify complication rates following implant-based reconstruction before and after the implementation of the guidelines. A retrospective audit of 86 patients with 106 implants in the 12 months to June 2013 was performed, C1. Following institutional changes including reducing antibiotic usage, a prospective audit was performed on 89 patients with 105 implants to June 2014, C2. Extended follow-up of salvaged implants was also performed. Demographics were not significantly different between the two cohorts apart from smoking. Implant loss rates fell from 7.5%(C1) to 1.9%(C2), p = 0.054 but at the cost of an increase in the return to theatre rate (14.2%-18%, p > 0.05). The implant salvage rate increased from 47% in C1 to 89.5% in C2, however, 3 of the implants that were salvaged were lost in the long term giving an overall salvage rate of 82.4% in C2. While an implant loss rate of <5% at 3 months appears achievable with less antibiotic use, this was made possible by the institution of an aggressive readmission and salvage policy. We would question the QI standards for readmission and return to theatre for immediate implant-based breast reconstruction, given that our implant loss rate of 1.9% was achieved with a return to theatre rate of 18%.
27913862	Prognostic impact of HER3 based on protein and mRNA expression in high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma.	HER3 is a member of the epidermal growth factor family and was predominantly described as a negative prognostic factor in various solid tumors as well as in ovarian cancer. In this study, we investigated HER3 on protein and mRNA expression in histologically defined subtypes of ovarian cancer looking for an influence on patient's survival. Altogether, we examined HER3 in ovarian high-grade serous (HGSC, n = 320), low-grade serous (LGSC, n = 55), endometrioid (EC, n = 33), and clear cell (CCC, n = 48) carcinomas using immunohistochemistry (IHC) and quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR). Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to explore the association between HER3 and overall survival (OS) as well as progression-free survival (PFS). In HGSC, high HER3 mRNA expression was a favorable prognostic factor for PFS (P = 0.008) and OS (P = 0.052), while for high HER3 protein expression, a trend towards better survival was seen (OS P = 0.064; PFS P = 0.099). A subgroup of HGSC with negative HER3 staining and negative HER3 mRNA levels showed most unfavorable OS and PFS (P = 0.002 and P = 0.004, respectively). Using the multivariate Cox regression model, HER3 was predictive for prolonged PFS (HR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.26-0.88; P = 0.018). All in all, we cannot confirm the reported negative prognostic impact of HER3 expression in high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma and moreover find a rather positive prognostic implication of HER3 in this major ovarian cancer histological subtype.
27913286	Cytotoxic activity of soy phytoestrogen coumestrol against human breast cancer MCF-7 cells: Insights into the molecular mechanism.	Coumestrol is a phytoestrogen present in soybean products and recognized as potential cancer therapeutic agent against breast cancer. However, the clear molecular mechanism of anticancer-activity of coumestrol in breast carcinoma has not been reported. It is well established that copper levels are elevated in different malignancies. Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate the copper-dependent cytotoxic action of coumestrol in human breast cancer MCF-7 cells. Results showed that coumestrol inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis in MCF-7 cells, which was prevented by copper chelator neocuproine and ROS scavengers. Coumestrol treatment induced ROS generation coupled to DNA fragmentation, up-regulation of p53/p21, cell cycle arrest at G1/S phase, mitochondrial membrane depolarization and caspases 9/3 activation. All these effects were suppressed by ROS scavengers and neocuproine. These results suggest that coumestrol targets elevated copper for redox cycling to generate ROS leading to DNA fragmentation. DNA damage leads to p53 up-regulation which directs the cell cycle arrest at G1/S phase and promotes caspase-dependent apoptosis of MCF-7 cells. In conclusion, copper targeted ROS-mediated p53-dependent mechanism better explains the cytotoxic action of coumestrol in MCF-7 cells. Thus, targeting elevated copper levels might be a potential therapeutic strategy for selective cytotoxic action against malignant cells.
27913185	MiR-346 promotes the biological function of breast cancer cells by targeting SRCIN1 and reduces chemosensitivity to docetaxel.	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of highly conserved small noncoding RNAs that play pivotal roles at the post-transcriptional level in the biological function of various cancers, including breast cancer. In our study, miR-346 mimic, inhibitor, negative control or si-SRCIN1 were transfected into MCF-7 and MCF-7/Doc cells, respectively. Quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR) was used to measure miR-346 and SRCIN1 mRNA expressions and western blot was used to detect the expression of SRCIN1 in protein level. CCK-8 and colony formation were employed to verify cell viability and proliferation. Flow cytometry showed the apoptosis. Transwell was performed to detect migration and invasion. The luciferase reporter assay data showed the target correlation of miR-346 and SRCIN1. Firstly, we found that the expression of miR-346 was higher in breast cancer tissues than in their paired corresponding non-cancerous tissues and there was significant inversed correlation between miR-346 and SRCIN1. Overexpression of miR-346 promoted cell proliferation, colony formation, migration and invasion, and reduced apoptosis, sensitivity to Docetaxel (Doc). SRCIN1 was identified as a direct target of miR-346, whose silencing promoted cell proliferation and the IC50 of Doc. Moreover, SRCIN1 silencing reduced the effect of miR-346 down-expression. Taken together, miR-346 may function as an oncogenic miRNA and mediate chemosensitivity to docetaxel through targeting SRCIN1 in breast cancer, targeted modulation of miR-346 expression may became a potential strategy for the treatment.
27913041	Impact of lymph node evaluation in adjuvant and neoadjuvant chemotherapy settings on survival outcomes in Wilms tumour: a review of 185 cases from a single institution.	It is unclear if lymph node sampling in Wilms tumour, though critical for staging purposes, affects survival outcomes. The value of lymph node sampling in patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is even more uncertain. We reviewed our institutional data to determine the impact of lymph node sampling on survival, as well as its role in the context of NAC. A total of 185 patients with Wilms tumour treated at our institution were included in this analysis. The number of nodes sampled (</=7, or >7), lymph node status (unknown, negative, or positive), pathological stage, and use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy were analysed for survival outcomes. Covariates were evaluated with chi-square test or Fisher's exact test where appropriate. All analyses were performed using SAS 9.3 and R package version 2.15.2 with a significant level of 0.05. Median follow-up for all patients was 7.1 years. The number of lymph nodes sampled was significantly related to lymph node status (p<0.001). Lymph node involvement portended worse overall survival after controlling for stage and histology. Patients treated with NAC had higher rates of 'unknown' lymph node status (p<0.001) and worse overall survival than their counterparts (p=0.002); within this group, patients with 'unknown' lymph node status had significantly worse survival than those with negative or positive lymph node. Our data support the available evidence that sampling of more than seven lymph nodes is necessary for adequate staging of Wilms tumour. This is especially critical in patients treated with NAC, who had worse overall survival, likely due to understaging and undertreatment. These findings should be confirmed prospectively to provide proper guidelines to physicians caring for patients with Wilms tumour.
27912979	Measuring performance in the interpretation of chest radiographs: a pilot study.	AIM: To develop a system to assess the image interpretation performance of radiologists in identifying signs of malignancy on chest radiographs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A test set of 30 chest radiographs was chosen by an experienced radiologist consisting of 11 normal and 19 abnormal cases. The malignant cases all had biopsy-proven pathology; the normal and benign cases all had at least 2 years of imaging follow-up. Fourteen radiologists with a range of experiences were recruited. Participants individually read the test set displayed on a standard reporting workstation, with their findings entered directly into a laptop running specially designed reporting software. For each case, relevant clinical information was given and the reader was asked to mark any perceived abnormality and rate their level of suspicion on a five-point scale (normal, benign, indeterminate, suspicious, or malignant). On completion, participants were given instant feedback with performance parameters including sensitivity and specificity automatically calculated. An opportunity was then given to review the cases together with an expert opinion and pathology. The time each participant took to complete the test was recorded. RESULTS: Six consultant radiologists who took part showed significantly better performance as determined by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis compared to eight specialist registrars (area under the ROC curve [AUC]=0.9297 and 0.7648 respectively, p=0.003). There was a significant correlation with years of experience in the interpretation of chest radiographs and performance on the test set (r=0.573, p=0.032). Consultant radiologists completed the test significantly more quickly that the specialist registrars: mean time 19.65 minutes compared to 26.51 minutes (p=0.033). CONCLUSION: It is possible to use a test set to measure individual differences in the interpretation of chest radiographs. This has the potential to be a useful tool in performance testing.
27912947	Exploratory outcome assessment of Qigong/Tai Chi Easy on breast cancer survivors.	OBJECTIVE: Breast cancer survivors (BCSs) experience symptoms affecting overall quality of life (QOL), often for a prolonged period post-treatment. Meditative Movement (MM), including Qigong and Tai Chi Easy (QG/TCE), has demonstrated benefit for improving QOL issues such as fatigue and sleep, but there is limited evidence of its impact on cognitive function, overall physical activity, and body weight for BCSs. DESIGN: This double-blind, randomized controlled pilot study with 87 female BCSs explored effects of QG/TCE on mental and physical QOL (Medical Outcomes Survey, Short Form), cognitive function (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Cognitive Function and two cognitive performance tests from the WAIS III), overall levels of physical activity (PA)(Brief Physical Activity Questionnaire) and body mass index (BMI). INTERVENTIONS: Twelve weekly sessions of QG/TCE were compared to sham Qigong (SQG), a gentle movement control intervention similar to QG/TCE but without the focus on breathing and meditative state. RESULTS: Both groups demonstrated pre-to-post-intervention improvements in physical and mental health, level of PA, self-reported cognitive function, and cognitive performance tests, though without significant differences between QG/TCE and SQG. For a subset of women enrolled later in the study, a significant reduction in BMI [-0.66 (p=0.048)] was found for QG/TCE compared to SQG. CONCLUSIONS: Practices that include gentle movement (such as QG/TCE or our sham protocol) among women with a history of breast cancer may improve many facets of the cancer experience, including QOL, cognitive function, and PA patterns. Practicing QG/TCE may show some advantage for BMI reduction compared to non-meditative gentle exercise.
27912145	Chloroquine (CQ) exerts anti-breast cancer through modulating microenvironment and inducing apoptosis.	CQ is an anti-malaria drug, which has been used for years. However, there are published articles about its activity in anti-cancers. The aim of this approach was to look at possibility and related mechanisms of anti-breast cancer (mouse breast cancer cell line 4T1) by CQ alone. The studies of anti 4T1 in vitro and in vivo by CQ were performed. The growth of 4T1 in vitro and in vivo, survival of mice post treatment with CQ, changes of immune parameters and microenvironment in mice were evaluated. Our results demonstrate that CQ could markedly inhibit growth of 4T1 in vitro through inducing apoptosis of cells, inhibiting secretion of TGF-beta and prolong the mice survival in vivo through boosting immune system by upregulating CD8+ T cell, and through down-regulating tumor associated macrophages (TAM), myeloid derived suppressing cells (MDSC) and Tregs, in microenvironment of mice bearing tumor. This provides a new mode of action for CQ and it is therefore concluded that CQ could be with potential in breast cancer therapy.
27910791	Effects of Ethyl Acetate Extracts from the Polycephalomyces nipponicus Isolate Cod-MK1201 (Ascomycetes) against Human Pathogenic Bacteria and a Breast Cancer Cell Line.	This study aimed to identify a suitable organic solvent for extracting bioactive compounds from Polycephalomyces nipponicus and to evaluate the antibacterial and anticancer activities of the extracts obtained. Only extracts obtained with ethyl acetate exhibited antibacterial activity, so ethyl acetate was chosen for large-scale extraction. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) against Gram-positive and Gram-negative human pathogenic bacteria of the 3 ethyl acetate-derived extracts-ethyl acetate extract from P. nipponicus (PN-ME), ethyl acetate extract after defatting (PN-ME*), and ethyl acetate extract after refluxation (PN-ME')-were determined. PN-ME' exhibited the most potent activity, inhibiting 12 of the 18 test bacteria, especially Bacillus cereus ATCC 11778 and Vibrio cholera (O1) DMST 9700, with low MIC and MBC values. PN-ME* showed greater inhibitory activity than PN-ME. The effects of the extracts on bacterial cell morphology were also determined. After 120 minutes of treatment with PN-ME* or PN-ME', B. cereus ATCC 11778 exhibited an abnormal rod-shaped cell structure, with some cells elongated to multiple times their original size and others appearing collapsed. V cholera (O1) DMST 9700 cells showed shrinkage and the formed subsurface cavities. PN-ME* and PN-ME' also inhibited the growth of MCF-7 breast cancer cells. In conclusion, the fungal isolate P. nipponicus Cod-MK1201 represents a source of antibacterial and anti-breast cancer compounds.
27910741	Topotecan Liposomes: A Visit from a Molecular to a Therapeutic Platform.	Topotecan (TPT), a potent anticancer camptothecin analog, is well described for the treatment of ovarian cancer, but has also anticancer activity against small-cell and non-small-cell lung cancer, breast cancer, and acute leukemia. Various nanocarriers, including liposomes, have been exploited for targeted delivery of TPT. However, there are a number of challenges with TPT delivery using TPT liposomes (TLs), such as low encapsulation efficiency, physiological pH labile E ring (hydrolysis), accelerated blood clearance, multidrug resistance, and cancer metastases. This review discusses these problems and the means to overcome them, including modification of TLs using zwitterionic poly(carboxybetaine), prolongation in dosing interval (long-term therapy), and modified liposomal encapsulation techniques including active loading methods. We also explore engineered TLs (surface and integral modifications) such as PEGylated TLs, ligand-anchored TLs, and stimuli-sensitive TLs. Further, potential applications, manifestations at the molecular level, patents granted, and preclinical and clinical outlook for TLs are discussed.
27909812	In phyllodes tumors of the breast expression of SPARC (osteonectin/BM40) mRNA by in situ hybridization correlates with protein expression by immunohistochemistry and is associated with tumor progression.	Secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC) plays an essential role in tumor invasion and metastasis. The present work was undertaken to detect expression of SPARC mRNA in phyllodes tumors (PTs) and its association with SPARC protein expression. This study also evaluated expression of SPARC mRNA and its correlation between grade and clinical behavior of PTs. In addition, we assessed in PTs the association of expression of SPARC with that of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and of MMP-9. SPARC mRNA expression was determined by RNAscope in situ hybridization (ISH) in 50 benign, 22 borderline, and 10 malignant PTs using a tissue microarray. Furthermore, we applied immunohistochemistry (IHC) to examine expression of SPARC, MMP-2, and MMP-9. SPARC mRNA appeared to be concentrated mainly in the stromal compartment of PTs. IHC staining patterns of SPARC protein showed concordance with SPARC mRNA ISH results. Stromal SPARC expression increased continuously as PTs progress from benign through borderline to malignant PTs, both at mRNA (using ISH) (P = 0.044) and protein level (using IHC) (P = 0.000). The recurrence percentage was higher in the stromal SPARC mRNA or protein-positive group than in the SPARC-negative group but this difference was not statistically significant. Stromal SPARC mRNA and protein expression was associated with PT grade and correlated with MMP-2 expression. These results indicate that SPARC-mediated degradation of the extracellular matrix, and its possible association with MMPs, might contribute to progression of PTs.
27908767	Should we routinely analyze reduction mammaplasty specimens?	BACKGROUND: Reduction mammaplasty is one of the most common plastic surgery procedures. Preoperative imaging and histopathology protocols vary among countries and institutions. We aimed to analyze the incidence of occult breast cancer and high-risk lesions in reduction mammaplasty specimens. We also analyzed whether patients with abnormal histopathology differed from the study population in terms of demographics. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In total, 918 women who underwent reduction mammaplasty from January 2007 to December 2011 were retrospectively reviewed for demographics, preoperative imaging, further preoperative examinations, pathology reports, and postoperative follow-up. RESULTS: Abnormal histopathological findings were revealed in 88 (10%) patients with a mean age of 49.5 +/- 10.2 years. The incidence of breast cancer was 1.2%, and the incidence of high-risk lesions (atypical ductal and lobular hyperplasia and lobular carcinoma in situ) was 5.5%. Age and specimen weights were significantly higher in patients with abnormal histopathology. Eighty-one percent of patients with abnormal histopathology had normal preoperative imaging revealing two high-risk and two cancer findings. Two patients developed breast cancer in the same breast in which the high-risk lesion was originally detected. CONCLUSION: Women with abnormal histopathology cannot be sufficiently detected preoperatively. Therefore, histopathological analysis of reduction mammaplasty specimens seems mandatory. Reduction mammaplasty combined with subsequent histopathological examination offers a sufficient chance of detecting cancer and risk-increasing lesions that merits the cost of histopathology.
27908586	Standard wide local excision or bilateral reduction mammoplasty in large-breasted women with small tumours: Surgical and patient-reported outcomes.	INTRODUCTION: Oncoplastic breast surgery is used to extend the role of breast-conserving surgery (BCS) to women with an unfavourable tumour to breast volume ratio. However, large-breasted women with a relatively small breast cancer may be offered bilateral reduction mammoplasty (BRM) despite being suitable for standard BCS as the more complex surgery may have advantages in terms of patient satisfaction and reduced adverse effects of radiotherapy. PATIENT AND METHODS: This retrospective study evaluated surgical and patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) in large-breasted women with early (<3 cm) breast cancer, who have undergone unilateral standard BCS or BRM. RESULTS: This series included 157 women, 87 in the unilateral BCS group and 70 in the BRM group. Median age was 60.2 years (range: 33-83.9). Median follow-up was 36 months (range: 9.8-76). Tumour size, rates of axillary dissection, adjuvant chemotherapy and tumour bed irradiation boost were significantly greater in the BRM group (p < 0.05). The surgical complication rate was not significantly different (43.7% vs. 34.3%, p = 0.253). Re-excision rates were higher in the standard BCS group (p < 0.05). Time to chemotherapy was similar, but time to radiotherapy was longer after BRM surgery (p = 0.025). Despite worse prognostic factors, more complex surgery and more aggressive adjuvant treatment, patients report better satisfaction and physical functioning and fewer adverse effects of radiotherapy after BRM than standard unilateral BCS. This difference was not statistically different in this small study (p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Limitations of this study mean it can only be regarded as hypothesis-generating. Nonetheless, the trends merit a prospective study to investigate the optimal management of smaller breast cancers in larger-breasted women.
27908419	Selenium levels in human breast carcinoma tissue are associated with a common polymorphism in the gene for SELENOP (Selenoprotein P).	Selenium supplementation of the diets of rodents has consistently been shown to suppress mammary carcinogenesis and some, albeit not all, human epidemiological studies have indicated an inverse association between selenium and breast cancer risk. In order to better understand the role selenium plays in breast cancer, 30 samples of tumor tissue were obtained from women with breast cancer and analyzed for selenium concentration, the levels of several selenium-containing proteins and the levels of the MnSOD anti-oxidant protein. Polymorphisms within the genes for these same proteins were determined from DNA isolated from the tissue samples. There was a wide range of selenium in these tissues, ranging from 24 to 854ng/gm. The selenium levels in the tissues were correlated to the genotype of the SELENOP selenium carrier protein, but not to other proteins whose levels have been reported to be responsive to selenium availability, including GPX1, SELENOF and SBP1. There was an association between a polymorphism in the gene for MnSOD and the levels of the encoded protein. These studies were the first to examine the relationship between selenium levels, genotypes and protein levels in human tissues. Furthermore, the obtained data provide evidence for the need to obtain data about the effects of selenium in breast cancer by examining samples from that particular tissue type.
27908206	The role of mesenchymal stem cells in oncology and regenerative medicine.	Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have long been used as therapeutic agents in disease affecting various organ systems. However, MSCs are fast emerging as promising anticancer agents which have the potential to treat a number of different cancer types, including glioblastoma and metastatic breast, ovarian and hepatic carcinoma. The ability of MSC to migrate directly into the tumor microenvironment and to produce IFN-alpha and -beta makes this possible. However, the possibility of MSC undergoing either malignant transformation or transformation into protumorigenic fibroblasts currently limits their role in clinical use. It is hoped that future research can overcome these limitations and facilitate the use of MSC clinically.
27908181	Defining and assessing an anisotropic delineation margin for modern radiotherapy.	PURPOSE: Uncertainty in target volume delineation for modern radiotherapy impacts dosimetry and patient outcomes. Delineation uncertainty is generally overlooked in practice as a source of error, potentially since historically, other uncertainties have been the main focus. This work defined and assessed an anisotropic delineation margin in both polar and spherical coordinate systems in order to account for the spatially varying nature of this uncertainty using a whole breast radiotherapy cohort as a proof of concept. METHODS: A cohort of 21 whole breast radiotherapy patient datasets with clinical target volumes delineated by eight independent observers was utilized. Patients were divided into categories based on target volume and laterality. An anisotropic delineation margin for each category was determined by multiplying the average standard deviation in observer contours in each category by a factor of two. Standard deviation was determined in both polar and spherical coordinates at angular increments. This anisotropic approach was compared to a conventional clinical approach, where the delineation margin was applied in the cardinal directions only. The assessment of the delineation margin was undertaken by comparing the encompassment of the observer volumes by the target volume with added margin. The extra, presumed healthy tissue included in the margin and the malignant tissue missed by the margin were determined. RESULTS: The proposed delineation margin is effective at accounting for inter-observer variation, producing >95% coverage of all CTVs for polar, spherical, and Cartesian margins in 82%, 79%, and 92% of cases, respectively. Additionally, <1% malignant tissue was missed for 65%, 70%, and 91% of cases and <37% healthy tissue was included in 95%, 89%, and 97% of cases. A conventional delineation margin approach is most appropriate for small and gold standard target volumes. However, for large target volumes, an anisotropic margin is necessary, producing significantly greater coverage of CTVs, including significantly less presumed healthy tissue and missing significantly less malignant tissue. CONCLUSIONS: All delineation margin methods that account for target volume and laterality proved to be adequate, with appropriate encompassment of interobserver variation and minimal inclusion of extra excess healthy tissue and exclusion of possible malignant tissue. The anisotropic approach was found to be superior to a conventional approach for target volumes >1400 cm3 only with significantly greater encompassment of interobserver variation, less missed malignant tissue and less included healthy tissue. This methodology has been validated for a whole breast radiotherapy cohort as a proof of concept, however could be applied to other anatomical sites.
27908180	A novel approach to evaluate spatial resolution of MRI clinical images for optimization and standardization of breast screening protocols.	PURPOSE: Stringent quality assurance is required in MRI breast screening to ensure that different scanners and imaging protocols reach similar diagnostic performance. The authors propose a methodology, based on power spectrum analysis (PSA), to evaluate spatial resolution in clinical images. To demonstrate this approach, the authors have retrospectively compared two MRI sequences commonly employed in breast screening. METHODS: In a novel approach to PSA, spatial frequency response curves (SFRCs) were extracted from the images. The SFRC characterizes spatial resolution describing the spatial frequency content of an image over a range of frequencies. Verification of the SFRCs was performed on MRI images of Eurospin agarose gel tubes acquired with different resolution settings. SFRCs of volunteer and patient images obtained with two clinical MRI sequences were then compared. The two sequences differed primarily in k-space coverage pattern, which was either radial (RAD) or linear (LIN). RESULTS: The computed SFRCs were able to demonstrate the differences between RAD and LIN sequences in relatively small groups of subjects. The curves showed a similar pattern of decay in both volunteer and patient images, indicating that the spatial frequency response is mainly determined by the imaging protocol and not by intersubject anatomical differences. The LIN protocol produced images with increased sharpness; this was reflected in the corresponding SFRCs, which showed a higher content of spatial frequencies associated with image details. CONCLUSIONS: The SFRC can provide an objective assessment of the presence of spatial details in the image and represent a useful quality assurance tool in the evaluation of different breast screening protocols. With a reference image, a comparative analysis of the SFRCs could ensure that equivalent image quality is achieved across different scanners and sites.
27907874	Synthesis of copper and zinc 2-(pyridin-2-yl)imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine complexes and their potential anticancer activity.	A small library of novel copper and zinc imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine complexes have been synthesized. Their structures were confirmed by X-ray diffraction crystallography and a selection of these compounds was tested against five cancer cell lines originating from breast cancer (MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231), leukemia (K562 and HL-60) and colorectal cancer (HT-29). The imidazo[1,2-a]pyridines and their zinc complexes showed poor anticancer activity, while the copper complexes were active against the cancer cell lines with IC50 values comparable to and lower than camptothecin. For example, copper 6-bromo-N-cyclohexyl-2-(pyridin-2-yl)imidazo[1,2-a]pyridin-3-amine acetate 21 had an IC50 value lower than 1 muM against the HT-29 cells. Fluorescence microscopy with acridine orange, Hoechst 33342 and ethidium bromide, used in a preliminary investigation to evaluate morphological changes showed that copper 6-bromo-N-cyclohexyl-2-(pyridin-2-yl)imidazo[1,2-a]pyridin-3-amine acetate 21 caused both apoptosis, necrosis and paraptosis in the MCF-7 and HL-60 cells. A select group of copper N-cyclohexyl-2-(pyridin-2-yl)imidazo[1,2-a]pyridin-3-amines (26, 27, 29 and 31) induced apoptosis, paraptosis and deformed nuclei in MCF-7 cells.
27907837	Metastatic carcinoid tumor to the breast: report of two cases and review of the literature.	The breast is an unusual site for carcinoid metastasis. Due to increasing survival rates for carcinoid tumors, however, awareness of their rare complications is important. Carcinoid metastasis to the breast typically presents as a palpable breast mass or a mass on screening mammogram. Because imaging findings are nonspecific, the diagnosis is established through histological findings of neuroendocrine features corresponding with the known primary carcinoid pathology. Correctly distinguishing metastatic carcinoid from primary breast carcinoma is crucial to avoid more invasive procedures required for the latter. Two cases of metastatic carcinoid to the breast are presented with review of the literature.
27905950	Use of indocyanine green and the HyperEye system for detecting sentinel lymph nodes in breast cancer within a population of European patients: a pilot study.	BACKGROUND: Certain studies suggest that using indocyanine green (ICG) could be comparable with using radioisotopes (RI) in detecting sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) in breast cancer. A number of these studies were performed in Asia. The objective of our pilot study was to evaluate within a European population of breast cancer patients the detection rate of SLNs using ICG and the HyperEye system and the concordance in SLNs detected using this method and the standard method involving RI and a gamma probe. METHODS: Ten female patients with early-stage breast cancer (Czech Republic) indicated for partial mastectomy and SLN biopsy were subjected to standard application of RI. Before surgery, ICG was administered periareolarly in the amount of 1 ml of 0.5% solution. Sentinel lymph nodes were first detected perioperatively exclusively using ICG fluorescence and the HyperEye device (Mizuho, Japan). Only after removal of all SLNs found in this way was the standard hand-held gamma probe used to detect RI, and any potential additional SLNs not found with ICG were then extirpated. RESULTS: In all 10 cases, at least one SLN was successfully detected using ICG. Nevertheless, in five patients, 1-4 additional SLNs were found using the gamma probe. Complete concordance in detecting SLNs therefore occurred in only one half of the cases. Metastases in SLNs were found in a total of two cases. Had we used only ICG for detection, one of these two cases would have been incorrectly evaluated as N0 (ICG false negativity). CONCLUSIONS: The study did not confirm the hypothesis that the use of ICG with the HyperEye system can currently be considered a method fully comparable with using RI and a gamma probe in a population of European patients. Although the detection rate is high, a significantly lower number of SLNs were detected using ICG than using RI (p = 0.03). Thus, there would be a higher probability for false negatives to occur in using SLN biopsy. This is caused mainly by the limited permeability of tissues to fluorescent radiation and the difficulty therefore of detecting nodes located deeper beneath the body's surface.
27904654	Augmentation of histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) epigenetic signature at the interface of proinflammation and insulin resistance in patients with type 2 diabetes.	BACKGROUND: A role of proinflammation has been implicated in the pathogenesis of diabetes, but the up-stream regulatory signals and molecular signatures are poorly understood. While histone modifications such as changes in histone deacetylase (HDAC) are emerging as novel epigenetic biomarkers, there is lack of studies to demonstrate their clinical relevance in diabetes. Therefore, we investigated the extent of HDAC machinery and inflammatory signals in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) compared to control subjects. RESULTS: HDAC3 activity was significantly (p < 0.05) increased in patients with T2DM compared to control subjects. While subtypes of HDACs were differentially expressed at their transcriptional levels in patients with type 2 diabetes, the most prominent observation is the significantly (p < 0.05) elevated messenger RNA (mRNA) levels of HDAC3. Expression levels of Sirt1 which represents the class III HDAC were decreased significantly in T2DM (p < 0.05). Plasma levels of both TNF-alpha and IL-6 were significantly higher (p < 0.05) in patients with type 2 diabetes compared to control subjects. Among the proinflammatory mediators, the mRNA expression of MCP-1, IL1-beta, NFkappaB, TLR2, and TLR4 were also significantly (p < 0.05) increased in T2DM. Transcriptional levels of DBC1 (deleted in breast cancer 1, which is a negative regulator of HDAC3) were seen significantly reduced in PBMCs from T2DM. Interestingly, HDAC3 activity/HDAC3 mRNA levels positively correlated to proinflammation, poor glycemic control, and insulin resistance. CONCLUSIONS: Striking message from this study is that while looking for anti-inflammatory strategies and drugs with novel mode of action for T2DM, discovering and designing specific inhibitors targeted to HDAC3 appears promising.
27904039	Role of Rac1/WAVE2 Signaling in Mediating the Inhibitory Effects of gamma-Tocotrienol on Mammary Cancer Cell Migration and Invasion.	The majority of breast cancer deaths result from the progression of this disease to a metastatic phenotype. Rac1 and Cdc42 are Rho family members that together with their downstream effectors, Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome protein-family verprolin-homologous protein 2 (WAVE2) and Arp2/3, play an important role in cytoskeletal reorganization and the formation of membrane protrusions that promote cancer cell migration and invasion. gamma-Tocotrienol, is a natural isoform within the vitamin E family of compounds that inhibits breast cancer cell growth and progression by suppressing various signaling pathways involved in mitogenic signaling and metastatic progression. Studies were conducted to examine the effects of gamma-tocotrienol on Rac1/WAVE2 signaling dependent migration and invasion in highly metastatic mouse +SA and human MDA-MB-231 mammary cancer cells. Exposure to gamma-tocotrienol resulted in a dose-responsive decrease in Rac1/WAVE2 signaling as characterized by a suppression in the levels of Rac1/Cdc42, phospho-Rac1/Cdc42, WAVE2, Arp2, and Arp3 expression. Additional studies also demonstrated that similar treatment with gamma-tocotrienol resulted in a significant reduction in tumor cell migration and invasion. Taken together, these findings indicate that gamma-tocotrienol treatment effectively inhibits Rac1/WAVE2 signaling and reduces metastatic phenotypic expression in mammary cancer cells, suggesting that gamma-tocotrienol may provide some benefit as a novel therapeutic approach in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer.
27903423	Cytotoxicity of trans-chalcone and licochalcone A against breast cancer cells is due to apoptosis induction and cell cycle arrest.	Chalcones are precursors of flavonoids that exhibit structural heterogeneity and potential antitumor activity. The objective of this study was to characterize the cytotoxicity of trans-chalcone and licochalcone A (LicoA1) against a breast cancer cell line (MCF-7) and normal murine fibroblasts (3T3). Also the mechanisms of the anti-cancer activity of these two compounds were studied. The alkaline comet assay revealed dose-dependent genotoxicity, which was more responsive against the tumor cell line, compared to the 3T3 mouse fibroblast cell line. Flow cytometry showed that the two chalcones caused the cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase and induced apoptosis in MCF-7 cells. Using PCR Array, we found that trans-chalcone and LicoA trigger apoptosis mediated by the intrinsic pathway as demonstrated by the inhibition of Bcl-2 and induction of Bax. In western blot assay, the two chalcones reduced the expression of cell death-related proteins such as Bcl-2 and cyclin D1 and promoted the cleavage of PARP. However, only trans-chalcone induced the expression of the CIDEA gene and protein in these two experiments. Furthermore, transient transfections of MCF-7 using a construction of a promoter-luciferase vector showed that trans-chalcone induced the expression of the CIDEA promoter activity in 24 and 48h. In conclusion, the results showed that trans-chalcone promoted high induction of the CIDEA promoter gene and protein, which is related to DNA fragmentation during apoptosis.
27902959	Kaempferol, a phytoestrogen, suppressed triclosan-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition and metastatic-related behaviors of MCF-7 breast cancer cells.	As a phytoestrogen, kaempferol is known to play a chemopreventive role inhibiting carcinogenesis and cancer progression. In this study, the influences of triclosan, an anti-bacterial agent recently known for an endocrine disrupting chemical (EDC), and kaempferol on breast cancer progression were examined by measuring their effects on epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and metastatic-related behaviors of MCF-7 breast cancer cells. Morphological changes of MCF-7 cells were observed, and a wound-healing assay was performed after the treatment of triclosan and kaempferol. The effects of triclosan and kaempferol on protein expression of EMT-related markers such as E-cadherin, N-cadherin, Snail, and Slug and metastasis-related markers such as cathepsin B, D, MMP-2 and -9 were investigated by Western blot assay. In microscopic observations, triclosan (10-6M) or E2 (10-9M) induced transition to mesenchymal phenotype of MCF-7 cells compared with the control. Co-treatment of ICI 182,780 (10-8M), an ER antagonist, or kaempferol (25muM) with E2 or triclosan restored the cellular morphology to an epithelial phenotype. In a wound-healing scratch and a transwell migration assay, triclosan enhanced migration and invasion of MCF-7 cells, but co-treatment of kaempferol or ICI 182,780 reduced the migration and invasion ability of MCF-7 cells to the control level. In addition, kaempferol effectively suppressed E2 or triclosan-induced protein expressions of EMT and metastasis promoting markers. Taken together, triclosan may be a distinct xenoestrogenic EDC to promote EMT, migration, and invasion of MCF-7 breast cancer cells through ER. On the other hand, kaempferol can be an alternative chemopreventive agent to effectively suppress the metastatic behavior of breast cancer induced by an endogenous estrogen as well as exogenous xenoestrogenic compounds including triclosan.
27902592	Dynamic contrast-enhanced breast magnetic resonance imaging for the prediction of early and late recurrences in breast cancer.	The aim of the study was to evaluate dynamic contrast-enhanced breast magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) features for the prediction of early and late recurrences in patients with breast cancer.Of 1030 breast cancer patients who underwent surgery at our hospital from January 2007 to July 2011, 83 recurrent breast cancer patients were enrolled in this study. We compared MRI features (background parenchymal enhancement [BPE], internal enhancement, adjacent vessel sign, whole-breast vascularity, initial enhancement pattern, kinetic curve types, and quantitative kinetic parameters) and clinico-pathologic variables (age, stage, histologic grade, nuclear grade, existence of lymphovascular invasion and extensive intraductal carcinoma component, and immunohistochemical profiles) between patients with early (</=2.5 years after surgery) and late recurrence (>2.5 years after surgery). Cox proportional hazard regression analysis was performed to evaluate independent risk factors for early and late recurrence.On breast MRI, prominent ipsilateral whole-breast vascularity was independently associated with early recurrence (hazard ratio [HR], 2.86; 95% confidence intervals [CI], 1.39-5.88) and moderate or marked BPE (HR, 2.08; 95% CI, 1.04-4.18) and rim enhancement (HR, 2.14; 95% CI, 1.00-4.59) were independently associated with late recurrence. Clinico-pathologic variables independently associated with early recurrence included negative estrogen receptor (HR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.29-0.96), whereas T2 stage (HR, 2.08; 95% CI, 1.04-4.16) and nuclear grade III (HR, 2.54; 95% CI, 1.29-4.98) were associated with late recurrence.In DCE-MRI, prominent ipsilateral whole-breast vascularity, moderate or marked BPE, and rim enhancement could be useful for predicting recurrence timing in patients with breast cancer.
27901596	Magnetic Resonance Imaging in the Pre-Surgical Staging of Breast Cancer: Our Experience.	PURPOSE: To investigate the clinical impact of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the detection of multifocal-multicentric breast cancers, already identified by mammography and ultrasound, and analyzed histologically, to evaluate its role in preoperative staging. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From January 2012 to February 2014, 188 patients, aged 28 to 74 years, newly diagnosed with breast cancer on conventional imaging (mammography and ultrasound) were enrolled. They underwent preoperative contrast-enhanced 3T MRI. Patients underwent surgery according to international guidelines. Results of all diagnostic procedures were compared. RESULTS: Among the 188 patients, 163 (87%) had a unilateral and unifocal tumor at both conventional imaging; MRI diagnosed 22/22 (100%) of multifocal and multicentric tumors, the combination of mammography and ultrasound diagnosed 12/22 (54%), and mammography alone diagnosed 8/22 (36%) multifocal and multicentric tumors. MRI prompted a change in surgical strategy in 10/188 (5%) patients. This change comprised mastectomy instead of conservative surgery (n = 7) and more extensive conservative surgery (n = 3). CONCLUSIONS: MRI was confirmed to show higher sensitivity than conventional imaging in detecting multifocal and multicentric breast cancers.
27901576	The High Frequency of PIK3CA Mutations in Iranian Breast Cancer Patients.	In breast cancer, somatic mutations of PIK3CA oncogene are common. We investigated the mutational status of exons 9 and 20 of the PIK3CA gene by polymerase chain reaction and direct sequencing in 80 breast tumors, and observed that 45% of these contained PIK3CA mutations in the mentioned exons. These mutations were found more in progesterone receptor positive and Her2- tumors, but this association did not reach a statistically significant level. Also, we observed a significant association between PIK3CA mutations and low-grade tumors. In our study, PIK3CA mutations were related to good and moderate prognosis in breast cancer patients.
27900757	Unsuspected axillary lymph node metastasis of nasopharyngeal and cervical cancer on 18FDG PET/CT: a case report.	Axillary lymph node metastasis (ALNM) from cancer except breast cancer is rare. Whole body 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) that simultaneously offers anatomic and metabolic information is widely used and has become an effective modality in many clinical fields, especially oncology, and also may detect an unexpected metastasis. We report two cases of ALMN of nasopharyngeal and cervical cancer that was detected on whole body PET/CT.
27900756	A rare case of medullary carcinoma thyroid metastasizing to bilateral breast parenchyma.	Medullary carcinoma of the thyroid (MTC) commonly spreads through the lymphatics to distant sites such as lung, liver and bone. Spread to the breast is rare. We report a case of metastatic MTC which progressed to develop nodal metastases to cer-vical and mediastinal regions, visceral metastases to the liver, lung and ultimately to bilateral breasts. Clinically it is important to distinguish metastatic breast lesions from primary breast cancer as each is managed differently. Both cytological and radio-logical investigations were done followed by excision biopsy. Histopathological examination of post excision breast specimen revealed metastatic medullary carcinoma, with positive immunohistochemical staining for calcitonin. A brief review of literature and differential diagnosis is also presented.
27900755	Incidental 18F-FDG PET/CT bilateral breast uptake due to carcinoma.	We report a case of 71-year-old female patient, previously treated with chemotherapy and surgical resection of sigmoid tract of the large bowel for adenocarcinoma (pT3N1M0), who underwent a 18F-FDG PET/CT for a suspicious hepatic lesion detected at CT scan during follow-up. 18F-FDG PET/CT showed no abnormal uptake in the liver both at 60 minutes and 120 minutes after injection but revealed a pathological uptake in two breast nodules, (one localized in upper-internal-quadrant of the right breast and the other in the upper-external-quadrant of the left breast). The patient underwent breast MRI, which confirmed the suspicious nature of both lesions; subsequently she underwent a trucut biopsy of both lesions witch demonstrated a bilateral localization of papillary carcinoma (both lesion were classified as pT1c). The patient underwent bilateral mastectomy and the final biopsy confirmed the presence of breast cancer, while bilateral sentinel nodes biopsy showed no lymph-nodes metastases.
27900589	Intrinsic HER2 V777L mutation mediates resistance to trastuzumab in a breast cancer patient.	HER2 (ERBB2) is an oncogene and 20% of breast cancers display HER2 amplification. The HER2 monoclonal antibody, trastuzumab, is used to treat breast cancers that display HER2 amplification, with good responses in 80-90% of cases; however, 10% of tumours develop resistance to trastuzumab. In this study, we collected data of primary breast cancer patients who treated at hospital during 2004-2014. In our cohort, 205 of 1497 primary breast cancer patients showed HER2-amplification, and 20 experienced recurrence after trastuzumab therapy. Of the 20 recurrent cases, only six patients had metastatic sites, excluding brain metastases, which were resistant to trastuzumab. To examine trastuzumab resistance in HER2-amplified breast cancer, we analysed clinical specimens before and after trastuzumab therapy. The results indicated that an intrinsic activating mutation leads to a valine-to-leucine substitution at codon 777 within the HER2 kinase domain (HER2 V777L). This was identified in one of six cases of a HER2-amplified breast cancer, both pre- and post-treatment; however, HER2 V777L was not identified in 14 responders who were treated with trastuzumab. These results suggest that HER2 V777L mutation is responsible for, and a predictive marker of, trastuzumab resistance. This is the first report to show that HER2 V777L is coincident with HER2-amplification in breast cancers that have developed trastuzumab resistance.
27899783	[A Case of Recurrent Breast Cancer with Carcinomatous Pleurisy Successfully Treated with Biweekly Paclitaxel and Bevacizumab].	A 72-year-old woman underwent mastectomy with axillary lymph node dissection for left breast cancer at the age of 43 years, and was diagnosed with breast cancer metastasis to the pleura at the age of 68 years. She had been sequentially treated with hormonal therapies, but complained of a cough and dyspnea after 4 years. Chest radiography showed right pleural effusion, and cytological examination of the pleural effusion revealed adenocarcinoma cells. Biweekly paclitaxel and bevacizumab therapy was administered. Two months later, the pleural effusion had disappeared. Biweekly paclitaxel and bevacizumab therapy was continued without any severe adverse events. After 30 months, the patient has remained free of carcinomatous pleurisy recurrence. Therefore, biweekly paclitaxel and bevacizumab therapy can be safely and effectively administered to elderly patients with carcinomatous pleurisy.
27899774	[A Review Multigene Assays for Clinical Utility in Breast Cancer].	Multigene assays that simultaneously measure the expression of various breast cancer genes have been developed to guide the use of adjuvant chemotherapy in early breast cancer. The efficacy of adjuvant therapies depends on the recurrence risk for an individual patient. As a result, accurate prediction of the recurrence risk is vital for precise adjuvant chemotherapy in individual breast cancer patients. The recurrence risk as typically assessed by conventional examination of histological data of immuno-histological biomarkers(ER, PR, HER2, and Ki-67)is not sufficient to select subsets of patients. Therefore, validated gene expression signatures are useful, in addition to well-established clinico-pathological factors. Available gene expression assay systems, such as MammaPrint(R), Oncotype DX(R), PAM50 ROR, GGI, EndoPredict(R)(EP), Breast Cancer IndexSM(BCI), and Curebest(R)95GC Breast, are recommended. While MammaPrint(R)and Oncotype DX(R)are the most predictive of the recurrence risk within the first 5 years of diagnosis, BCI and EPclin have demonstrated utility in predicting late recurrence. In addition, PAM50 provides further biological insights by classifying breast cancers into intrinsic molecular subtypes. These gene expression signatures have become important tools in clinical practice for the identification of low-risk endocrine-positive patients in whom chemotherapy could be avoided. However, there is much work left in the development of a molecular classification considering the biology and novel therapeutic targets in high-risk recurrent disease because chemotherapy has only modest benefits in this population. The recognition of genomic mutations and their relationship to a patient's responsiveness to various therapies will provide important breakthroughs toward precision medicine.
27899257	Juglanin induces apoptosis and autophagy in human breast cancer progression via ROS/JNK promotion.	Breast cancer is one of the most common primary malignant tumors of among women, the long-term survival of which has stagnated in the past decades. Juglanin as a natural production mainly extracted from green walnut husks of Juglans mandshurica has been defined as the functional composition among a series of compounds. It showed powerful protective effect in various diseases by inhibiting inflammation and tumor cells growth. However, the effect of juglanin on human breast cancer and the underlying mechanisms remains to be elucidated. We reported here that juglanin could inhibit cell proliferation by leading to G2/M phase arrest. Exposure to juglanin resulted in the activation of cleaved caspase -3, -8, and -9, indicating that juglanin induced apoptosis. Autophagy occurred in juglanin-treated cells as evidenced by formation of autophagosome and up-regulation of LC3B-II. The juglanin-induced cell death was significantly restored by the combination of autophagy and apoptosis. Further, juglanin also induced JNK activation and ROS production. The JNK inhibitor attenuated juglanin-caused apoptosis and autophagy significantly while ROS scavenger could reverse them. In addition, the ROS scavenger also inhibited G2/M phase arrest and phosphorylated JNK. Of note, we found that juglanin had the similar effects on breast cancer cells. Finally, juglanin inhibited tumor growth in the mouse xenograft model in vivo. Together, our results suggested that juglanin led to G2/M phase arrest, induced apoptosis as well as autophagy through the ROS/JNK signaling pathway in human breast cancer cells. Hence, juglanin might be a promising candidate for development of anti-tumor drugs targeting breast cancer.
27899251	Improved breast cancer cell-specific intracellular drug delivery and therapeutic efficacy by coupling decoration with cell penetrating peptide and SP90 peptide.	Lack of satisfactory specificity towards tumor cells and poor intracellular delivery efficacy are the major drawbacks with conventional cancer chemotherapy. Conjugated anticancer drugs to targeting moieties e.g. to peptides with the ability to recognize cancer cells and to cell penetrating peptide can improve these characteristics, respectively. Combining a tumor homing peptide with an appropriate cell-penetrating peptide can enhance the tumor-selective internalization efficacy of the carrying cargo molecules. In the present study, the breast cancer homing ability of SP90 peptide and the synergistic effect of SP90 with a cell-penetrating peptide(C peptide) were evaluated. SP90 and chimeric peptide SP90-C specifically targeted cargo molecule into breast cancer cells, especially triple negative MDA-MB-231 cell, in a dose- and time-dependent manner, but not normal breast cells and other cancer cells, while C peptide alone had no cell-selectivity. SP90-C increased the intracellular delivery efficiency by 12-fold or 10-fold compared to SP90 or C peptide alone, respectively. SP90 and SP90-C conjugation increased the anti-proliferative and apoptosis-inducing activity of HIV-1 Vpr, a potential novel anticancer protein drug, to breast cancer cell but not normal breast cell by arresting cells in G2/M phase. With excellent breast cancer cell-selective penetrating efficacy, SP90-C appears as a promising candidate vector for targeted anti-cancer drug delivery. SP90-VPR-C is a potential novel breast cancer-targeted anticancer agent for its high anti-tumor activity and low toxicity.
27898991	Nipple- and areola-sparing mastectomy for the treatment of breast cancer.	BACKGROUND: The efficacy and safety of nipple-sparing mastectomy and areola-sparing mastectomy for the treatment of breast cancer are still questionable. It is estimated that the local recurrence rates following nipple-sparing mastectomy are very similar to breast-conserving surgery followed by radiotherapy. OBJECTIVES: To assess the efficacy and safety of nipple-sparing mastectomy and areola-sparing mastectomy for the treatment of ductal carcinoma in situ and invasive breast cancer in women. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Breast Cancer Group's Specialized Register, the Cochrane Center Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (via PubMed), Embase (via OVID) and LILACS (via Biblioteca Virtual em Saude [BVS]) using the search terms "nipple sparing mastectomy" and "areola-sparing mastectomy". Also, we searched the World Health Organization's International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov. All searches were conducted on 30th September 2014 and we did not apply any language restrictions. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) however if there were no RCTs, we expanded our criteria to include non-randomised comparative studies (cohort and case-control studies). Studies evaluated nipple-sparing and areola-sparing mastectomy compared to modified radical mastectomy or skin-sparing mastectomy for the treatment of ductal carcinoma in situ or invasive breast cancer. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors (BS and RR) performed data extraction and resolved disagreements. We performed descriptive analyses and meta-analyses of the data using Review Manager software. We used Cochrane's risk of bias tool to assess studies, and adapted it for non-randomised studies, and we evaluated the quality of the evidence using GRADE criteria. MAIN RESULTS: We included 11 cohort studies, evaluating a total of 6502 participants undergoing 7018 procedures: 2529 underwent a nipple-sparing mastectomy (NSM), 818 underwent skin-sparing mastectomy (SSM) and 3671 underwent traditional mastectomy, also known as modified radical mastectomy (MRM). No participants underwent areola-sparing mastectomy. There was a high risk of confounding for all reported outcomes. For overall survival, the hazard ratio (HR) for NSM compared to SSM was 0.70 (95% CI 0.28 to 1.73; 2 studies; 781 participants) and the HR for NSM compared to MRM was 0.72 (95% CI 0.46 to 1.13; 2 studies, 1202 participants). Local recurrence was evaluated in two studies, the HR for NSM compared to MRM was 0.28 (95% CI 0.12 to 0.68; 2 studies, 1303 participants). The overall risk of complications was different in NSM when compared to other types of mastectomy in general (RR 0.10, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.82, 2 studies, P = 0.03; 1067 participants). With respect to skin necrosis, there was no evidence of a difference with NSM compared to other types of mastectomy, but the confidence interval was wide (RR 4.22, 95% CI 0.59 to 30.03, P = 0.15; 4 studies, 1948 participants). We observed no difference among the three types of mastectomy with respect to the risk of local infection (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.44 to 2.09, P = 0.91, 2 studies; 496 participants). Meta-analysis was not possible when assessing cosmetic outcomes and quality of life, but in general the NSM studies reported a favourable aesthetic result and a gain in quality of life compared with the other types of mastectomy. The quality of evidence was considered very low for all outcomes due to the high risk of selection bias and wide confidence intervals. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The findings from these observational studies of very low-quality evidence were inconclusive for all outcomes due to the high risk of selection bias.
27898429	Dosimetric Improvements with a Novel Breast Stereotactic Radiotherapy Device for Delivery of Preoperative Partial-Breast Irradiation.	OBJECTIVE: Partial-breast irradiation (PBI) with external-beam radiotherapy has produced higher than expected rates of fair-to-poor cosmesis. Worsened outcomes have been correlated with larger volumes of breast tissue exposed to radiation. A novel breast-specific stereotactic radiotherapy (BSRT) device (BSRTD) has been developed at our institution and has shown promise in delivering highly conformal dose distributions. We compared normal tissue sparing with this device with that achieved with intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT)-PBI. METHODS: Fifteen women previously treated with breast conservation therapy were enrolled on an institutional review board-approved protocol. Each of them underwent CT simulation in the prone position using the BSRTD-specific immobilization system. Simulated postoperative and preoperative treatment volumes were generated based on surgical bed/clip position. Blinded planners generated IMRT-PBI plans and BSRT plans for each set of volumes. These plans were compared based on clinically validated markers for cosmetic outcome and toxicity using a Wilcoxon rank-sum test. RESULTS: The BSRT plans consistently reduced the volumes receiving each of several dose levels (Vx) to breast tissue, the chest wall, the lung, the heart, and the skin in both preoperative and postoperative settings (p < 0.05). Preoperative BSRT yielded particularly dramatic improvements. CONCLUSION: The novel BSRTD has demonstrated significant dosimetric benefits over IMRT-PBI. Further investigation is currently proceeding through initial clinical trials.
27898360	Novel oral administrated paclitaxel micelles with enhanced bioavailability and antitumor efficacy for resistant breast cancer.	Paclitaxel (PTX) is a widely used antineoplastic drug in clinic. Due to poor aqueous solubility, it is administrated by intravenous infusion of cremophor EL containing formulation with serious adverse effects. The low oral bioavailability is a great challenge for oral formulation development. In addition, P-gp mediated multidrug resistance limit its clinical use in various resistant cancers. In this study, a novel super-antiresistant PTX micelle formulation for oral administration was developed. A P-gp inhibitor, bromotetrandrine (W198) was co-encapsulated in the micelle. The micelles were composed of Solutol HS 15 and d-a-tocopheryl polyethylene glycol succinate to avoid Cremophor EL induced toxicity. The micelles were round with a mean particle size of approximately 13nm and an encapsulation efficiency of approximately 90%. A series of in vitro evaluations were performed in non-resistant MCF-7 cells and resistant MCF-7/Adr cells. The super-antiresistant PTX micelles showed higher cell uptake efficiency, significantly increased cytotoxicity and antimitotic effect in drug resistant MCF-7/Adr cells when compared with Taxol and other PTX micelle formulations. Compared with Taxol, the super-antiresistant PTX micelles significantly improved bioavailability after oral administration in rats, and inhibited tumor growth in multidrug resistance xenografted MCF-7/Adr nude mice. In summary, the noval super-antiresistant PTX micelles showed a great potential for oral delivery of PTX against resistant breast cancer.
27896639	SEOM Clinical Guideline for bone metastases from solid tumours (2016).	Bone metastases are common in many advanced solid tumours, being breast, prostate, thyroid, lung, and renal cancer the most prevalent. Bone metastases can produce skeletal-related events (SREs), defined as pathological fracture, spinal cord compression, need of bone irradiation or need of bone surgery, and hypercalcaemia. Patients with bone metastases experience pain, functional impairment and have a negative impact on their quality of life. Several imaging techniques are available for diagnosis of this disease. Bone-targeted therapies include zoledronic acid, a potent biphosfonate, and denosumab, an anti-RANKL monoclonal antibody. Both reduce the risk and/or delay the development of SREs in several types of tumours. Radium 233, an alpha-particle emitter, increases overall survival in patients with bone metastases from resistant castration prostate cancer. Multidisciplinary approach is essential and bone surgery and radiotherapy should be integrated in the treatment of bone metastases when necessary. This SEOM Guideline reviews bone metastases pathogenesis, clinical presentations, lab tests, imaging techniques for diagnosis and response assessment, bone-targeted agents, and local therapies, as radiation and surgery, and establishes recommendations for the management of patients with metastases to bone.
27895805	Blood-based DNA methylation as biomarker for breast cancer: a systematic review.	Multiple studies have investigated global DNA methylation profiles and gene-specific DNA methylation in blood-based DNA to develop powerful screening markers for cancer. This systematic review summarizes the current evidence on methylation studies that investigated methylation level of blood-derived DNA of breast cancer (BC) patients in comparison to healthy controls by conducting a systematic literature review in PubMed and Web of Science. Essential results, such as methylation levels of BC cases and healthy controls, p values, and odds ratios, were extracted from these studies by two investigators independently. Overall, 45 publications met the inclusion criteria for this review. DNA from whole blood, as well as cell-free DNA (cfDNA) from serum or plasma, was used in these studies. The most common method used for measuring global DNA methylation was the investigation of repetitive elements as surrogates and the application of array-based genome-wide methylation analysis. For measuring gene-specific methylation level, methylation-specific PCR and pyrosequencing were the most frequently used methods. Epigenome-wide blood DNA hypomethylation in BC patients were reported in several studies; however, the evidence is still not conclusive. The most frequently investigated gene in whole blood was BRCA1, which was found more frequently methylated in patients compared to controls. RASSF1A was the most widely investigated gene in cfDNA of serum or plasma, which was also found more frequently methylated in patients compared to controls. Several of the eligible studies reported the associations of global hypomethylation and increased BC risk. Studies investigated associations between gene-specific methylation and BC risk, while got heterogeneous results. But two studies reported that hypermethylation of ATM gene was associated with increased BC risk, which suggest the potential use of this gene for BC risk stratification. Overall, our review suggests the possibility of using blood-based DNA methylation marker as promising marker for BC risk stratification, as several studies found associations between certain methylation level in blood and BC risk. However, so far, the evidence is still quite limited. Optimal markers are yet to be developed and promising results needed to be validated in prospective study cohorts and tested in large screening populations.
27895461	Sildenafil potentiates the antitumor activity of cisplatin by induction of apoptosis and inhibition of proliferation and angiogenesis.	Sildenafil is the first phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor used for the treatment of erectile dysfunction. However, recent studies have been suggesting an antitumor effect of sildenafil. The current study assessed the aforementioned activity of sildenafil in vivo and in vitro in solid-tumor-bearing mice and in a human cell line MCF-7, respectively. Moreover, we investigated the impact of sildenafil on cisplatin antitumor activity. The solid tumor was induced by inoculation of Ehrlich ascites carcinoma cells in female mice. The tumor-bearing mice were assigned randomly to control (saline), sildenafil (sildenafil 5 mg/kg/d, PO daily for 15 days), cisplatin (cisplatin 7.5 mg/kg, IP once on the 12th day of Ehrlich ascites carcinoma inoculation), and combination therapy (cisplatin and sildenafil) groups. The tumor volume was measured at the end of the treatment period along with the following parameters: angiogenin, vascular endothelial growth factor, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, Ki-67, caspase-3, DNA-flow cytometry analysis, and histopathological examination. The study results showed that sildenafil has significantly decreased the tumor volume by 30.4%, angiogenin and tumor necrosis factor-alpha contents, as well as vascular endothelial growth factor expression. Additionally, caspase-3 level significantly increased with sildenafil treatment, whereas Ki-67 expression failed to show any significant changes. Furthermore, the cell cycle analysis revealed that sildenafil was capable of improving the category of tumor activity from moderate to low proliferative. Sildenafil induced necrosis in the tumor. Moreover, the drug of interest showed cytotoxic activity against MCF-7 in vitro as well as potentiated cisplatin antitumor activity in vivo and in vitro. These findings shed light on the antitumor activity of sildenafil and its possible impact on potentiating the antitumor effect of conventional chemotherapeutic agents such as cisplatin. These effects might be related to antiangiogenic, antiproliferative, and apoptotic activities of sildenafil.
27895163	G-Protein-Coupled Receptor Kinase 2 as a Potential Modulator of the Hallmarks of Cancer.	Malignant features-such as sustained proliferation, refractoriness to growth suppressors, resistance to cell death or aberrant motility, and metastasis-can be triggered by a variety of mutations and signaling adaptations. Signaling nodes can act as cancer-associated factors by cooperating with oncogene-governed pathways or participating in compensatory transduction networks to strengthen tumor properties. G-protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2) is arising as one of such nodes. Via its complex network of connections with other cellular proteins, GRK2 contributes to the modulation of basic cellular functions-such as cell proliferation, survival, or motility-and is involved in metabolic homeostasis, inflammation, or angiogenic processes. Moreover, altered GRK2 levels are starting to be reported in different tumoral contexts and shown to promote breast tumorigenesis or to trigger the tumoral angiogenic switch. The ability to modulate several of the hallmarks of cancer puts forward GRK2 as an oncomodifier, able to modulate carcinogenesis in a cell-type specific way.
27894703	Over surgery in breast cancer.	Breast surgery remains the original and most effective 'targeted' therapy: excision of early cancer is curative and for more advanced disease surgery improves local disease control. However in well intentioned pursuit of cure and local disease control, some cancers are over-treated resulting in major physical and emotional morbidity. Less breast surgery is safe, as evidenced by steady reductions in mortality and local recurrence; earlier diagnosis and widespread use of systemic therapies and radiotherapy have allowed more conservative surgery. As tumour biology dictates cancer outcomes not surgery extent, surgery can safely be 'minimum required' rather than 'more is better' with the focus on removal of disease rather than healthy tissue. Surgeons can reduce the burden of surgery further but it is important that less surgery is not over-compensated by more radical or unnecessary systemic therapies and/or radiotherapy with their own toxicities and morbidity. We all need to be alert to the potential drivers of over treatment and over surgery such as failure to work within a multidisciplinary team, failure to design a multimodality treatment plan at diagnosis or overuse of novel assessment technologies of uncertain clinical utility. Pursuit of wide margins and the removal of the contra-lateral healthy breast for marginal risk-reduction gains are also to be discouraged as is routine local/regional surgery in stage 4 disease. The surgeon has a pivotal role in minimizing breast surgery to what is required to achieve the best oncological, functional and aesthetic outcomes.
27894412	The most common genes involved in epigenetics modifications among Iranian patients with breast cancer: A systematic review.	Breast cancer, with a lifelong risk of one in nine, is the most common cancer among women. In Iran, breast cancer is one of the growing and important women's health problems. Several environmental, genetic and epigenetics factors have been suggested to have a role in breast cancer development. Epigenetics alterations are heritable changes in gene expression that occur without causing any change in DNA sequence. DNA methylation as a main epigenetics modification in human cancer is found as a promising biomarker in early detection of breast cancer. Association between epigenetics changes of many gene promoters with the risk of breast cancer has been investigated worldwide. This aberrant methylation may be occur in specific genes related to cell cycle, cell adhesion, apoptosis and DNA repairing mechanisms and results in silencing of these important genes. In this review study, we have gathered all the data until December 2015 about epigenetics modifications among Iranian population with breast cancer. We searched international web databases such as: PubMed, Scopus, and Persian web databases; IranMedex and Magiran to investigate the association of epigenetics change and incidence of breast cancer among Iranian population. Using "methylation" or "epigenetics" key words and "Iran" as affiliation, all the published data were 31. After arbitrary limitation in search keywords the result have been 20 articles. Data analysis show that "ER-alpha" and "E-Cadherin" are most common studied genes in epigenetics modifications. Also, maximum studies were done in Tehran and Tabriz. We thought that more studies will be helpful to reveal the relation of methylation status in candidate genes with the breast cancer risk in Iranian populations.
27894335	Everolimus and exemestane in long survival hormone receptor positive male breast cancer: case report.	BACKGROUND: Male breast cancer is a rare event, accounting for approximately 1% of all breast carcinomas. Although men with breast cancer had poorer survival when compared with women, data on prognosis principally derive from retrospective studies and from extrapolation of female breast cancer series. We reported the case of a very long survival patient. CASE PRESENTATION: A caucasian 42-year-old man underwent radical mastectomy with axillary dissection for breast cancer in 1993. Pathologic stage was pT4pN0M0 infiltrating ductal carcinoma of right breast without lymph nodes metastases. Biological characterization was not available. He received adjuvant treatment with chemotherapy, six cycles of cyclophosphamide, methotrexate and fluorouracil, then endocrine therapy with tamoxifen for 5 years and complementary radiotherapy. Then he began clinical-instrumental follow up. In May 1996, a computed tomography scan showed multiple lung metastases. Hereafter he received several oncologic treatment including seven chemotherapy and five endocrine therapy lines with two re-challenge of endocrine therapy. In October 2007 further lung progression was showed and a biopsy was performed to characterize the disease. Histological examination confirmed breast cancer metastases, immunohistochemistry showed positive staining for estrogen receptor, negative for progesterone receptor and human epithelial growth factor receptor 2, proliferative index was 21%. In April 2013, bone disease progression was evident and he received radiant treatment to sacral spine. In May 2014 an off-label treatment with exemestane and everolimus combination was approved by Ethics Committee of the Marche Region. The patient received treatment for 3 months with evident clinical benefit to subcutaneous lesions of the chest wall that were not visible nor palpable on physical examination after 1 month of treatment. CONCLUSION: That is the case of long survival male breast cancer patient with luminal B subtype and no BRCA mutations. He achieved higher progression free survival with endocrine therapy creating the rationale for last line treatment with everolimus and exemestane combination. Attending conclusive results from ongoing studies, everolimus and exemestane should not be used routinely in male metastatic breast cancer patients, but taking into account for selected cases. At the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of male beast cancer treated with exemestane and everolimus combination.
27894246	Therapy-Related Changes in the Serum Proteome Patterns of Early Stage Breast Cancer Patients with Different Outcomes.	Adjuvant chemo- and/or radiotherapy is applied in a majority of patients treated for early stage breast cancer, although only a small percentage of these individuals are at high risk of metastasis or recurrence. Hence, knowledge of the biomarkers associated with the risk of disease progression might facilitate the planning of an optimal therapy and protect many patients from the toxicity of unnecessary treatment. In this study, we characterized the serum proteome of patients diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer, exhibiting either no evidence of disease five years after the end of therapy or suffering from metastasis, relapse or a second cancer during the corresponding follow-up. Samples collected before treatment and one year after the end of therapy, when no clinical symptoms of a treatment failure was evidenced, were analyzed using two classical proteomics approaches: LC-MS/MS and 2D-PAGE. A total of 42 proteins with relative quantities that were significantly different between pre- and post-treatment samples were identified in either group of patients; however, the observed changes were more frequent in the treatment-failure group. Among the posttreatment samples, 30 proteins were upregulated, and 10 proteins were downregulated, while 11 proteins were upregulated, and eight proteins were downregulated in the control group. Moreover, several proteins exhibited different patterns of changes in both groups of patients. For example, haptoglobin expression increased in the treatment-failure group but decreased in the control group (this pattern of changes was confirmed using an immunoassay). Notably, proteins affected in posttreatment samples in either group of patients could be associated with different molecular and cellular functions, including angiogenesis, blood coagulation and wound healing in the treatment-failure group and cell adhesion and cell death in the control group.
27894048	Real world patterns of care in HER2-overexpressing breast cancer: Results of a survey of TEACH clinical trial investigators in 2011.	BACKGROUND: HER2-overexpressing breast cancer (BC) is common among young patients and poses a public health burden. Adjuvant anti-HER2/neu therapy with trastuzumab reduces the risk of recurrence and improves survival. METHODS: A web-based survey was sent to 386 physicians of the "TEACH" trial in 2011 to determine access to HER2/neu testing and treatment patterns for HER2-overexpressing BC. RESULTS: There were 151 responders (39%) from 28 countries. Ninety-seven percent reported HER2/neu expression is routinely measured in their institutions by immunohistochemistry (85%), FISH (80%) and other methods (16%). Twenty percent of responders from Asia reported that the test was not routinely available. Forty-eight percent of participants reported instances when adjuvant HER2-directed therapy was recommended to a patient who eventually did not receive it. Reasons for not receiving trastuzumab was cost (73%, p < 0.0001) in low- and middle-income countries and co-morbidities in high-income countries (43%, p = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS: This survey reflects the availability of HER2/neu testing and anti-HER2/neu therapy among physicians who participated in TEACH. A high proportion of women with HER2-overexpressing BC may not receive standard adjuvant therapy due to unavailability of the test and cost of therapy. Despite having some limitations, such as a possible selection bias of participating physicians, variable definitions of access to healthcare among respondents, and changes in trastuzumab availability since 2011, our results demonstrate that access to care and region of practice impact the implementation of cancer treatments.
27893280	Establishment of a Human Breast Cancer Model by Fusion PCR for In Vivo and In Vitro Fluorescence Imaging of Human Breast Cancer.	This study aimed to construct a breast cancer model that could continuously express the genes of luciferase and green fluorescent protein. The genes luciferase, EGFP, and Neo were obtained by fusion polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and inserted into pAAV-MCS. The pAAV-Luciferase-EGFP-Neo vector was transfected into MDA-MB-231 cells. After antibiotic resistance gene screening and limiting dilution assay, we constructed a monoclonal stable cell line that expresses the fusion protein Luciferase-EGFP. In comparison with the polyclonal stable cell line, the monoclonal cell line had good genetic stability and was not different from the parental cell line MDA-MB-231. The monoclonal stable cell line would be ideal for a breast cancer model. Indices of fluorescence imaging can be applied to fluorescence imaging in vitro and in vivo, providing a straightforward and reliable system for breast cancer and drug discovery research.
27893038	Targeting the PI3K/AKT/mTOR Pathway for the Treatment of Mesenchymal Triple-Negative Breast Cancer: Evidence From a Phase 1 Trial of mTOR Inhibition in Combination With Liposomal Doxorubicin and Bevacizumab.	Importance: Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) classified by transcriptional profiling as the mesenchymal subtype frequently harbors aberrations in the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway, raising the possibility of targeting this pathway to enhance chemotherapy response. Up to 30% of mesenchymal TNBC can be classified histologically as metaplastic breast cancer, a chemorefractory group of tumors with a mixture of epithelial and mesenchymal components identifiable by light microscopy. While assays to identify mesenchymal TNBC are under development, metaplastic breast cancer serves as a clinically identifiable surrogate to evaluate potential regimens for mesenchymal TNBC. Objective: To assess safety and efficacy of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibition in combination with liposomal doxorubicin and bevacizumab in patients with advanced metaplastic TNBC. Design, Setting, and Participants: Phase 1 study with dose escalation and dose expansion at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center of patients with advanced metaplastic TNBC. Patients were enrolled from April 16, 2009, to November 4, 2014, and followed for outcomes with a cutoff date of November 1, 2015, for data analysis. Interventions: Liposomal doxorubicin, bevacizumab, and the mTOR inhibitors temsirolimus or everolimus using 21-day cycles. Main Outcomes and Measures: Safety and response. When available, archived tissue was evaluated for aberrations in the PI3K pathway. Results: Fifty-two women with metaplastic TNBC (median age, 58 years; range, 37-79 years) were treated with liposomal doxorubicin, bevacizumab, and temsirolimus (DAT) (N = 39) or liposomal doxorubicin, bevacizumab, and everolimus (DAE) (N = 13). The objective response rate was 21% (complete response = 4 [8%]; partial response = 7 [13%]) and 10 (19%) patients had stable disease for at least 6 months, for a clinical benefit rate of 40%. Tissue was available for testing in 43 patients, and 32 (74%) had a PI3K pathway aberration. Presence of PI3K pathway aberration was associated with a significant improvement in objective response rate (31% vs 0%; P = .04) but not clinical benefit rate (44% vs 45%; P > .99). Conclusions and Relevance: Using metaplastic TNBC as a surrogate for mesenchymal TNBC, DAT and DAE had notable activity in mesenchymal TNBC. Objective response was limited to patients with PI3K pathway aberration. A randomized trial should be performed to test DAT and DAE for metaplastic TNBC, as well as nonmetaplastic, mesenchymal TNBC, especially when PI3K pathway aberrations are identified.
27892991	Surveillance Mammography in Older Patients With Breast Cancer-Can We Ever Stop?: A Review.	Importance: Approximately 4% to 5% of breast cancer survivors will develop a new ipsilateral or contralateral cancer (in-breast event) over the 5 years following diagnosis, and annual surveillance mammography is recommended for those with residual breast tissue. The risk for such in-breast events persists over time, though increasing age at cancer diagnosis and treatment with hormonal therapy are associated with lower risk, and most older survivors of breast cancer will ultimately die from nonbreast cancer-related causes. Specific guidelines for surveillance strategies in older patients are limited. Prospective data on the benefits and harms of surveillance mammography in this population are lacking, and most of the evidence is derived from observational, retrospective data, often in the general population. Observations: We review the current recommendations for breast cancer screening and surveillance for older patients, the current evidence for ipsilateral and contralateral breast cancer risks in older survivors of breast cancer, and suggested approaches for discussions about surveillance mammography with older patients. We recommend individualized decision making for surveillance breast imaging in older survivors of breast cancer, with consideration of the following strategy for women 70 years or older: 1-time imaging 6 to 12 months after completion of local therapy followed by annual or biennial surveillance mammography for healthy women and cessation of mammography in patients whose life expectancy is less than 5 years to 10 years, regardless of age. Decisions on mammographic surveillance should also incorporate whether hormonal therapy is being administered, whether a patient's anticipated life expectancy is extraordinary, and whether a patient's individual risk for in-breast events is higher (or lower) than average risk for breast cancer survivors. Conclusions and Relevance: We propose reframing discussions around surveillance mammography in older breast cancer survivors and to consider cessation while taking into account life expectancy, the estimated risk for subsequent in-breast events, and patient preferences.
27891193	In epithelial cancers, aberrant COL17A1 promoter methylation predicts its misexpression and increased invasion.	BACKGROUND: Metastasis is a leading cause of death among cancer patients. In the tumor microenvironment, altered levels of extracellular matrix proteins, such as collagens, can facilitate the first steps of cancer cell metastasis, including invasion into surrounding tissue and intravasation into the blood stream. However, the degree of misexpression of collagen genes in tumors remains understudied, even though this knowledge could greatly facilitate the development of cancer treatment options aimed at preventing metastasis. METHODS: We systematically evaluate the expression of all 44 collagen genes in breast cancer and assess whether their misexpression provides clinical prognostic significance. We use immunohistochemistry on 150 ductal breast cancers and 361 cervical cancers and study DNA methylation in various epithelial cancers. RESULTS: In breast cancer, various tests show that COL4A1 and COL4A2 overexpression and COL17A1 (BP180, BPAG2) underexpression provide independent prognostic strength (HR = 1.25, 95% CI = 1.17-1.34, p = 3.03 x 10-10; HR = 1.18, 95% CI = 1.11-1.25, p = 8.11 x 10-10; HR = 0.86, 95% CI = 0.81-0.92, p = 4.57 x 10-6; respectively). Immunohistochemistry on ductal breast cancers confirmed that the COL17A1 protein product, collagen XVII, is underexpressed. This strongly correlates with advanced stage, increased invasion, and postmenopausal status. In contrast, immunohistochemistry on cervical tumors showed that collagen XVII is overexpressed in cervical cancer and this is associated with increased local dissemination. Interestingly, consistent with the opposed direction of misexpression in these cancers, the COL17A1 promoter is hypermethylated in breast cancer and hypomethylated in cervical cancer. We also find that the COL17A1 promoter is hypomethylated in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, lung squamous cell carcinoma, and lung adenocarcinoma, in all of which collagen XVII overexpression has previously been shown. CONCLUSIONS: Paradoxically, collagen XVII is underexpressed in breast cancer and overexpressed in cervical and other epithelial cancers. However, the COL17A1 promoter methylation status accurately predicts both the direction of misexpression and the increased invasive nature for five out of five epithelial cancers. This implies that aberrant epigenetic control is a key driver of COL17A1 gene misexpression and tumor cell invasion. These findings have significant clinical implications, suggesting that the COL17A1 promoter methylation status can be used to predict patient outcome. Moreover, epigenetic targeting of COL17A1 could represent a novel strategy to prevent metastasis in patients.
27890807	Diosmin-induced senescence, apoptosis and autophagy in breast cancer cells of different p53 status and ERK activity.	Relatively low bioavailability of plant-derived nutraceuticals with anticancer properties may limit their usefulness for prevention and therapy of cancer. In the present study, we have screened for nutraceuticals (n=30) that would act at low micromolar range against phenotypically distinct breast cancer cell lines, namely MCF-7 (ER+, PR+/-, HER2-), MDA-MB-231 (ER-, PR-, HER2-) and SK-BR-3 (ER-, PR-, HER2+), and diosmin, a citrus fruit flavonoid belonging to a flavone subclass, was selected. MCF-7 cell line was found to be the most sensitive to diosmin treatment. Diosmin caused G2/M cell cycle arrest, elevation in p53, p21 and p27 levels and stress-induced premature senescence when used at lower concentrations (5 and 10muM). Diosmin (20muM) also promoted apoptosis that was not observed in normal human mammary epithelial cells (HMEC). Diosmin stimulated oxidative and nitrosative stress, DNA damage and changes in global DNA methylation patterns. The status of p53 (wild type versus mutant) and the levels of phosphorylated ERK1/2 in a steady state, and diosmin-induced autophagy may reflect diverse response to diosmin treatment in MCF-7, MDA-MB-231 and SK-BR-3 cells, which in turn results in different cell fates. Taken together, diosmin that acts at low micromolar range against breast cancer cells may be considered as a promising candidate for anticancer therapy.
27890149	Assessing the effectiveness of five process elicitation methods: A case study of chemotherapy treatment plan review.	To reduce the probability of failures and to improve outcomes of safety-critical human-intensive processes, such as health care processes, it is important to be able to rigorously analyze such processes. The quality of that analysis often depends on having an accurate, detailed, and sufficiently complete understanding of the process being analyzed, where this understanding is typically represented as a formal process model that could then drive various rigorous analysis approaches. Developing this understanding and the corresponding formal process model may be difficult and, thus, a variety of process elicitation methods are often used. The work presented in this paper evaluates the effectiveness of five common elicitation methods in terms of their ability to elicit detailed process information necessary to support rigorous process analysis. These methods are employed to elicit typical steps and steps for responding to exceptional situations in a safety-critical health care process, the chemotherapy treatment plan review process. The results indicate strengths and weaknesses of each of the elicitation methods and suggest that it is preferable to apply multiple elicitation methods.
27889946	Combined fibrinogen and neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio as a prognostic marker of advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.	Patients with advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is received chemoradiotherapy or chemotherapy for clinical management. However, it is difficult to predict tumor response and prognosis using blood markers before starting treatments. The purpose of this study was to investigate the pre-treatment plasma fibrinogen and neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) in patients with advanced ESCC treated with chemoradiotherapy or chemotherapy, and to assess the clinical utility of a combined score using these blood markers, named as the F-NLR (fibrinogen and NLR) score, as a predictor of tumor response and prognosis. A total of 98 advanced ESCC patients, treated with chemoradiotherapy or chemotherapy, were classified into three groups: F-NLR score of 2, having both hyperfibrinogenemia (>400 mg/dL) and high NLR (>3.0), score of 1, one of these hematological abnormalities, and score of 0, having neither hyperfibrinogenemia nor high NLR. Fibrinogen and NLR were significantly higher in the progressive disease (PD) group than the non-PD group (P = 0.0419, and P = 0.0001, respectively). A significantly higher F-NLR score was found in the PD group than the non-PD group (P = 0.0140). Overall survival was significantly lower in patients with an F-NLR score of 2 than in those with an F-NLR score of 0 or 1 (P < 0.0001). Multivariate analysis showed that the F-NLR score was one of the independent prognostic factors (P = 0.0081). Our study demonstrates that the F-NLR score is promising as a predictive marker for therapeutic effects and prognosis in patients with advanced ESCC.
27889782	Molecular Pathology: A Requirement for Precision Medicine in Cancer.	The increasing importance of targeting drugs and check-point inhibitors in the treatment of several tumor entities (breast, colon, lung, malignant melanoma, lymphoma, etc.) and the necessity of a companion diagnostic (HER2, (pan)RAS, EGFR, ALK, BRAF, ROS1, MET, PD-L1, etc.) is leading to new challenges for surgical pathology. Since almost all the biomarkers to be specifically detected are tissue based, a precise and reliable diagnostic is absolutely crucial. To meet this challenge surgical pathology has adapted a number of molecular methods (semi-quantitative immunohistochemistry, fluorescence in situ hybridization, PCR and its multiple variants, (pyro/Sanger) sequencing, next generation sequencing (amplicon, whole exome, whole genome), DNA arrays, methylation analyses, etc.) to be applicable for formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue. Reading a patient's tissue as 'deeply' as possible and obtaining information on the morphological, genetic, proteomic and epigenetic background are the tasks of pathologists and molecular biologists and provide the clinicians with information relevant for precision medicine. Intensified cooperation between clinicians and pathologists will provide the basis of improved clinical drug selection and guide development of new cancer gene therapies and molecularly targeted drugs by research units and the pharmaceutical industry.
27889762	Evaluation of Isolation Methods for Circulating Tumor Cells (CTCs).	BACKGROUND: Detection of CTCs is a poor prognostic factor for many cancer types; however, their very low frequency represents an obstacle for their detection. The objective of the current study was to compare the performance of commonly used methods for CTCs isolation. METHODS: The evaluated methods using spiking experiments of MCF7, SKBR3 and MDA MB-231 breast cancer cell lines were (i) ficoll density gradient separation (DGS), (ii) red blood cell lysis (Erythrolysis) isolation, (iii) positive immunomagnetic selection (EpCAM Dynal beads), (iv) two different negative immunomagnetic separation systems (Dynal vs Miltenyi CD45 beads) as well as (v) the Cell Search platform and (vi) the ISET system. RESULTS: The recovery rates of Erythrolysis and DGS were 39% and 24%, respectively. Magnetic isolations are ranked from the worse to the best recovery rate as follows:, Myltenyi-anti-CD45 microbeads (24%); Dynal-anti-EpCAM beads (75%); Dynabeads-anti-CD45 (97%). CTCs isolation from blood samples using the CellSearch and ISET systems revealed that the recovery rate for Cell Search and ISET was 52% and 95%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Dynal-anti-CD45 beads have the best recovery rate compared to other magnetic methods. Furthermore the recovery rate of ISET was higher compared to Cell Search, especially for the more aggressive MDA-MB 231 cell line.
27889631	Design, synthesis and cytotoxicity studies of novel pyrazolo[1, 5-a]pyridine derivatives.	Copper-mediated synthesis of various pyrazolo[1, 5-a]pyridine-3-carboxylates has been described. The biological activities of these molecules have been evaluated against various human cancer cell lines A549 (Lung adenocarcinoma cell line), MCF-7 (Breast carcinoma cell line), HCT-116 (Colon cancer cell line), and PC-3 (Prostate cancer cell line) through SRB assay. Compound 247 led to accumulation MCF-7 cells in G1-phase and revealed its important role in mitotic cell cycle progression.
27889618	Cell death mechanistic study of photodynamic therapy against breast cancer cells utilizing liposomal delivery of 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(benzo[b]thiophene) porphyrin.	5,10,15,20-Tetrakis(benzo[b]thiophene) porphyrin (BTP) is a newly synthesized hydrophobic photosensitizer with fluorescence quantum yield in toluene: PhiF=0.062. Previously, its limitations in solubility had hindered scientific experimentation regarding its photodynamic effects on cancer cells. By utilizing various compositions of liposomes in order to alter the solubility of BTP, the photocytotoxicity, reactive oxygen species generation, and subcellular localization of the liposomal BTP were identified in this work. DNA fragmentation and high content screening assays were performed in order to shed light on the tumoricidal mechanism of the liposomal photosensitizer. The MTT assay results showed promising results in the irradiation specific PDT activity against MCF-7 cells in all liposomal compositions. Production of ROS was confirmed in the liposomal BTP treated MCF-7 cells after irradiation in a concentration dependent manner. The subcellular localization assays revealed that the localization of BTP was dependent on both the photosensitizer's chemical properties and the properties of the delivery agent encapsulating aforesaid substance. Significant DNA fragmentation was observed in both nucleus localizing liposomal BTP, BTP encapsulated DOPC and DOPE (DOPC-BTP and DOPE-BTP), treated MCF-7 cells. All liposomal-BTPs were successful in inducing mitochondrial permeability transition, an increase in the permeability of the mitochondrial membrane, and activating caspase-3/7. ER localizing BTP were able to significantly increase the cytosolic calcium levels by photodynamic therapy, confirming the photodynamic ability of ER localized BTP to damage the ER membrane. The application of liposomes in delivering a novel hydrophobic photosensitizer, BTP, and photodynamic therapy treatment against MCF-7 cells were successful. It was confirmed that the MCF-7 cell death pathway via photodynamic therapy was altered in a controlled manner by controlling the intracellular localization of the photosensitizer through lipid composition adjustment.
27889596	Using ultrasound and palpation for predicting axillary lymph node status following neoadjuvant chemotherapy - Results from the multi-center SENTINA trial.	BACKGROUND: With the growing importance of neoadjuvant systemic therapy (NST) the assessment of post neoadjuvant axillary status is of increasing importance especially in patients who presented initially with suspicious nodes (cN1). This study aims to investigate the predictive value of palpation and axillary ultrasound of formerly cN1 patients following NST. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The SENTINA trial (SENTinel NeoAdjuvant) is a 4-arm prospective multicenter study designed to evaluate the role of sentinel node biopsy (SLNB) in the context of neoadjuvant systemic treatment (NST) of breast cancer patients. RESULTS: 1240 patients from 103 institutions entered the trial. 715 (arm C n = 592; arm D n = 123) patients, who presented initially cN1 underwent clinical evaluation of lymph node status following NST. Palpation alone demonstrated a sensitivity of 8.3%, specifity of 94.8% and a negative predictive value (NPV) of 46.6%. Ultrasound alone revealed a sensitivity of 23.9%, specificity 91.7%, and a NPV of 50.3%.The investigators combined classification (palpation and ultrasound) resulted in a sensitivity of 24.4%, specificity 91.4%, and a NPV of 50.3%. Investigators classified the axilla nodes as being unsuspicious (cN0) following NST in 592/715 patients; of them 298 (50.3%) were pN0, 151 (25.5%) had 1-2 histologically involved nodes and 143 (24.2%) had >2 histologically involved nodes. CONCLUSION: The diagnostic accuracy of ultrasound and palpation following NST is unacceptably low and additional tools for evaluation of the axillary lymph node status following NST are urgently needed.
27889595	Is there a role for salvage radiotherapy in locally advanced breast cancer refractory to neoadjuvant chemotherapy?	INTRODUCTION: Locally advanced breast cancer (LABC) is a major problem, especially in developing countries. The standard treatment for LABC is neoadjuvant chemotherapy, with or without anti-Her2 therapy, followed by surgery, radiotherapy, and adjuvant systemic treatment if appropriate. However, there are few data in the literature addressing alternatives when neoadjuvant chemotherapy fails to reduce the tumour for surgery. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study including all patients who had non-metastatic LABC treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy and who were not eligible for surgical resection; these patients were submitted to salvage radiotherapy (RTX) between January 2000 and December 2012 at the Brazilian National Cancer Institute. RESULTS: Fifty-seven patients were included, with a median age of 51 (23-72) years. The most frequent clinical stages were IIIA and IIIB, corresponding to 19.3% and 70.2%, respectively; mean tumour size was 8.74 (3-18) cm, and 44 patients (77.2%) had nodal involvement. Chemotherapeutic regimens containing anthracyclines were prescribed to 98.2% of the patients. Fifteen patients (26.3%) received taxanes and anthracyclines. Radiation dose was 50 Gy divided into 25 fractions; 43 patients (75.4%) had their tumours downsized by RTX and underwent mastectomy. Overall survival (OS) was 38 (23-52) months. Patients who were submitted to surgery had an OS of 49 (28-70) months and those who were not eligible for mastectomy after radiotherapy had an OS of 18 (9-27) months. CONCLUSION: This retrospective study confirms that RTX is an effective treatment to downsize LABC tumours with low or no response to chemotherapy, thereby enabling surgical resection which may improve overall patient outcome.
27889541	New monoterpenoid oxindole alkaloid derivatives from the stems of Uncaria hirsuta Havil. and their cytotoxicity and tandem mass spectrometric fragmentation.	Four new alkaloids, comprising three 3-oxo-3,7-seco-oxindole alkaloids (hirsutanine D-F, 1-3) and one oxindole alkaloid N-oxide (uncarine B N-oxide, 4), together with four known heteroyohimbine-type oxindole alkaloids, were isolated from the stems of Uncaria hirsuta Havil. Structures of 1-4 were elucidated by extensive NMR and HR-ESIMS data analyses. Compound 3 is the first 3-oxo-3,7-seco-oxindole alkaloid with ring B opened and degraded isolated from the Uncaria genus. Compounds 1-3 exhibited slight inhibition effect on the proliferation of the breast cancer cell MDA-MB-231. The positive mode collision-induced dissociation of the 3-oxo-3,7-seco-oxindole alkaloids (1-3) was featured by the beta-cleavage and alpha-cleavage of the amido bond, while the N-oxide (4) showed characteristic neutral eliminations of OH and H2O.
27889234	In-silico and in-vitro anti-cancer potential of a curcumin analogue (1E, 6E)-1, 7-di (1H-indol-3-yl) hepta-1, 6-diene-3, 5-dione.	PURPOSE: Previously we showed that BDMC, an analogue of curcumin suppresses growth of human breast and laryngeal cancer cell line by causing apoptosis. Here, we demonstrate the enhanced anti-cancer activity of a heterocyclic ring (indole) incorporated curcumin analogue ((1E, 6E)-1, 7-di (1H-indol-3-yl) hepta-1, 6-diene-3, 5-Dione), ICA in short, in comparison to curcumin. METHOD: ICA was synthesized by a one pot condensation reaction. Anti-cancer potential of ICA was assessed in three human cancer cell lines of different origin (Lung adenocarcinoma (A549), leukemia (K562) and colon cancer (SW480)) by MTT assay. Mode of cell death was determined by acridine orange-ethidium bromide (Ao-Eb) staining. Putative cellular targets of ICA were investigated by molecular docking studies. Cell cycle analysis following curcumin or ICA treatment in SW480 cell line was carried out by flow cytometry. Expression levels of Cyclin D1 and apoptotic markers, such as Caspase 3, 8 and 9 were studied by western blot analysis in SW480 cell line treated with or without ICA and curcumin. RESULTS: The yield of ICA synthesis was found to be 69% with a purity of 98%. ICA demonstrated promising anti-cancer activity compared to curcumin alone, as discerned by MTT assay. ICA was non-toxic to the cell line of normal origin. We further observed that ICA is approximately 2 fold more potent than curcumin in inhibiting the growth of SW480 cells. Ao-Eb staining revealed that ICA could induce apoptosis in all the cell lines tested. Molecular docking studies suggest that ICA may possibly exhibit its anticancer effect by inhibiting EGFR in A549, Bcr-Abl in K562 and GSK-3beta kinase in SW480 cell line. Moreover, ICA showed strong binding avidity for Bcl-2 protein in silico, which could result in induction of apoptosis. Cell cycle analysis revealed that both curcumin and ICA induced concomitant cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 and G2/M phase. Western blot shows that ICA could effectively down regulate the expression of cell cycle protein cyclin D1, while promoting the activation of Caspase 3, 8 and 9 when compared to curcumin in human colon cancer cell line SW480. CONCLUSION: The result of this study indicates that ICA could hold promise to be a potential anti-cancer agent. Since ICA has shown encouraging results in terms of its anti-cancer activity compared to curcumin, further research is necessary to fully delineate the underlying molecular mechanism of its anticancer potential.
27889196	Impact of molecular subtypes classification concordance between preoperative core needle biopsy and surgical specimen on early breast cancer management: Single-institution experience and review of published literature.	BACKGROUND: Core needle biopsy (CNB) plays a crucial role as diagnostic tool for breast cancer (BC). The characterization of biomarkers status before surgical treatment is crucial when primary systemic therapy is a therapeutic option. The aim of this analysis was to report concordance between preoperative CNB and surgical specimen (SS) in evaluating biomarkers and molecular subtypes. METHODS: Data have been collected from a cohort of 101 patients affected by early BC treated at Careggi Florence University Hospital, between January 2014 and March 2015. The conformity between molecular subtype classification was tested using kappa (kappa) test. RESULTS: Mean age was 57.5 years (range 29-86). There was concordance between the estrogen receptor (ER) assessment on CNB and SS in 95 cases (94.1%). Concordance of the progesterone receptor (PgR) assessment was observed in 89 cases (88.1%). Concordance for detecting immunohistochemistry-assessed BC molecular subtypes was 87.1% (kappa = 0.78). Concerning Ki-67 evaluation, we report a concordance rate of 88.1% (kappa = 0.68). The evaluation of luminal A plus luminal B/HER negative subgroup showed a kappa-value of 0.65. CONCLUSIONS: CNB showed good accuracy in evaluating hormonal receptors status, HER2, and BC molecular subtypes. Evaluation of Ki67 status was less accurate than other biomarkers; therefore, we recommend that it should be detected both on CNB and SS samples, especially in hormonal positive HER2 negative tumors, in order to avoid a misclassification of tumor subtypes that could lead to an omission of potential effective systemic therapy.
27889052	Types of oral contraceptives and breast cancer survival among women enrolled in Medicaid: A competing-risk model.	INTRODUCTION: Oral contraceptive pills have been implicated in the pathophysiology of breast cancer. Although many studies have examined the relationship between combined oral contraceptives (COCs) and breast cancer, there is a paucity of literature that discusses progestin-only oral contraceptives (POCs) and breast cancer. The purpose of this investigation is to examine potential associations between different types of oral contraceptives and breast cancer mortality in the South Carolina Medicaid population among different racial/ethnic groups. METHODS: Subjects included 4816 women diagnosed with breast cancer between 2000 and 2013. Kaplan-Meier curves were calculated to determine time-to-mortality rates among users of oral contraceptives. Competing-risks models and Cox multivariate survival models were used to estimate the hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of breast cancer and other-cause mortality, as well as all-cause mortality. RESULTS: POCs were associated with a significantly decreased risk of breast cancer mortality (HR: 0.07; 95% CI: 0.01, 0.52) and a non-significant increased risk of all-cause mortality (HR: 1.04; 95% CI: 0.52, 2.07). COCs increased the risk of breast cancer mortality (HR: 1.61; 95% CI: 1.14, 2.28) and all-cause mortality (HR: 1.83; 95% CI: 1.30, 2.57). CONCLUSION: Use of POCs may be associated with a decreased risk of breast cancer mortality. Due to the small sample size of POC users in the current study, additional research is needed to confirm these findings.
27889048	The use of high-dose estrogens for the treatment of breast cancer.	Estrogens are known to stimulate the growth of breast cancer but they are also an effective treatment for this disease (this has been termed the 'estrogen paradox'). The fact that estrogens can be an effective treatment for breast cancer is something that has almost been forgotten, whereas the fear for estrogens remains. This paper reviews the use of estrogens for the treatment of breast cancer and identifies possible applications. The data summarised in this review demonstrate that high-dose estrogens are effective for the treatment of advanced breast cancer, both as first-line treatment as well as for treatment after occurrence of endocrine resistance to TAM and AIs. Essential for efficacy is an extended period of estrogen deprivation before the tumour is subject to estrogen treatment (the gap hypothesis). Research on the mechanism of action has shown that apoptosis induced by estrogens is regulated via the estrogen receptor and growth factor signalling pathways. High-dose estrogens have a negative safety image, especially in terms of side-effects and increased rates of cardiovascular disease, but the safety data reviewed in this paper do not give rise to major concerns. Taking into account their side-effect profile together with their observed clinical efficacy, high-dose estrogens should be considered a valuable alternative to chemotherapy in selected patients.
27886719	A dual stage adaptive thresholding (DuSAT) for automatic mass detection in mammograms.	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Early detection and diagnosis of breast cancer through mammography screening reduces breast cancer mortality by around 20%. However it is often a complex process to differentiate abnormalities due to the ill-defined margins and subtle appearances. METHOD: This paper investigates a new computer aided approach to detect the abnormalities in the digital mammograms using a Dual Stage Adaptive Thresholding (DuSAT). The suspicious mass region is identified using global histogram and local window thresholding method. The global thresholding is done based on the Histogram Peak Analysis (HPA) of the entire image and the threshold is obtained by maximizing the proposed threshold selection criteria. The local thresholding is carried out for each pixel in a defined neighborhood window that provides precise segmentation results. RESULTS: The algorithm is verified with 300 images in the DDSM database and 170 images in the mini-MIAS database. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm achieves an average sensitivity of 92.5% with 1.06 FP/image for DDSM database and an average sensitivity of 93.5% with 0.62 FP/image for mini-MIAS database. CONCLUSION: The achieved results depict that the proposed approach provides better results compared to other state-of-art methods for mass detection that helps the radiologists in diagnosis of breast cancer at early stage.
27886643	Cardiac safety of adjuvant non-pegylated liposomal doxorubicin combined with cyclophosphamide and followed by paclitaxel in older breast cancer patients.	PURPOSE: To investigate the cardiac safety of adjuvant Non-Pegylated Liposomal Doxorubicin (NPL-DOX) combined to Cyclophosphamide (CTX) and followed by weekly Paclitaxel, in older patients (>/=65 years) with diagnosis of high risk breast cancer. The main end point of this prospective study was the detection of early episodes of symptomatic congestive heart failure (CHF). METHODS: The cardiac function was evaluated by left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) measurements with repeated echocardiograms, performed 2 weeks before the beginning of chemotherapy and every 6 months, until 30 months after the study entry; then yearly for at least 5 years. RESULTS: Forty-seven patients were enrolled from two Italian Divisions of Medical Oncology. Final results revealed no early episodes of symptomatic CHF within the first 12 months from the enrolment. Only two cardiac events were observed: an episode of atrial flutter after the first cycle of NPL-DOX and CTX, with a quick return to normal rhythm, and a grade 3 (scored to NCI-CTCAE, version 3.0) CHF episode, 18 months later chemotherapy start. No other relevant toxicities were reported. CONCLUSIONS: This adjuvant combination including NPL-DOX in elderly patients, resulted in a low rate of cardiac toxic effects. Comparative trials should be encouraged to confirm these findings.
27886589	ESR1 mutations: Moving towards guiding treatment decision-making in metastatic breast cancer patients.	Mutations in the gene coding for the estrogen receptor (ER), ESR1, have been associated with acquired endocrine resistance in patients with ER-positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC). Functional studies revealed that these ESR1 mutations lead to constitutive activity of the ER, meaning that the receptor is active in absence of its ligand estrogen, conferring resistance against several endocrine agents. While recent clinical studies reported that the occurrence of ESR1 mutations is rare in primary breast cancer tumors, these mutations are more frequently observed in metastatic tissue and circulating cell-free DNA of MBC patients pretreated with endocrine therapy. Given the assumed impact that the presence of ESR1 mutations has on outcome to endocrine therapy, assessing ESR1 mutations in MBC patients is likely to be of significant interest to further individualize treatment for MBC patients. Here, ESR1 mutation detection methods and the most relevant pre-clinical and clinical studies on ESR1 mutations regarding endocrine resistance are reviewed, with particular interest in the ultimate goal of guiding treatment decision-making based on ESR1 mutations.
27886135	Soy and Health Update: Evaluation of the Clinical and Epidemiologic Literature.	Soyfoods have long been recognized as sources of high-quality protein and healthful fat, but over the past 25 years these foods have been rigorously investigated for their role in chronic disease prevention and treatment. There is evidence, for example, that they reduce risk of coronary heart disease and breast and prostate cancer. In addition, soy alleviates hot flashes and may favorably affect renal function, alleviate depressive symptoms and improve skin health. Much of the focus on soyfoods is because they are uniquely-rich sources of isoflavones. Isoflavones are classified as both phytoestrogens and selective estrogen receptor modulators. Despite the many proposed benefits, the presence of isoflavones has led to concerns that soy may exert untoward effects in some individuals. However, these concerns are based primarily on animal studies, whereas the human research supports the safety and benefits of soyfoods. In support of safety is the recent conclusion of the European Food Safety Authority that isoflavones do not adversely affect the breast, thyroid or uterus of postmenopausal women. This review covers each of the major research areas involving soy focusing primarily on the clinical and epidemiologic research. Background information on Asian soy intake, isoflavones, and nutrient content is also provided.
27885857	Dosimetric trade-offs in breast treatment with VMAT technique.	OBJECTIVE: Breast planning with volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) has been explored, especially for left-sided breast treatments, with the primary intent of lowering the heart dose and improving target dose homogeneity. As a trade-off, larger healthy tissue volumes would receive low dose levels, with the potential risk of increasing late toxicities and secondary cancer induction, although no clinical data are available today to confirm the risk level. The scope of this work is to explore the dosimetric trade-offs using two different VMAT plans. METHODS: Two planning strategies for dual-partial-arc VMAT, RA_avoid and RA_full, with and without avoidance sectors, were explored in a cohort of 20 patients, for whole left breast irradiation for 40.05 Gy to the mean target dose in 15 fractions. Common dose objectives included a stringent dose homogeneity, mean dose to the heart <5 Gy, ipsilateral lung (Ilung) <8 Gy, contralateral lung (Clung) <2 Gy and contralateral breast (Cbreast) <3 Gy. RESULTS: RA_full showed a better dose conformity, lower high-dose spillage in the healthy tissue and lower skin dose. RA_avoid presented a reduction of the mean doses for all critical structures: 51% to the heart, 12% to the Ilung, 81% to the Clung and 73% to the Cbreast. All differences were significant with p < 0.0001. CONCLUSION: The adaptation of VMAT options to planning objectives reduced significantly the healthy tissue dose levels at the price of some high-dose spillage. Evaluation of the trade-offs for application to the different critical structures should drive in improving the usage of the VMAT technique for breast cancer treatment. Advances in knowledge: Different planning strategies in the same VMAT technique could give significant variations in dose distributions. The choice of the trade-offs would affect the possible future late toxicity and secondary cancer induction risk.
27885679	Clinical auditing as an instrument for quality improvement in breast cancer care in the Netherlands: The national NABON Breast Cancer Audit.	BACKGROUND: In 2011, the NABON Breast Cancer Audit (NBCA) was instituted as a nation-wide audit to address quality of breast cancer care and guideline adherence in the Netherlands. The development of the NBCA and the results of 4 years of auditing are described. METHODS: Clinical and pathological characteristics of patients diagnosed with invasive breast cancer or in situ carcinoma (DCIS) and information regarding diagnosis and treatment are collected in all hospitals (n = 92) in the Netherlands. Thirty-two quality indicators measuring care structure, processes and outcomes were evaluated over time and compared between hospitals. RESULTS: The NBCA contains data of 56,927 patients (7,649 DCIS and 49,073 invasive cancers). Patients being discussed in pre- and post-operative multidisciplinary team meetings improved (2011: 83% and 91%; 2014: 98% and 99%, respectively) over the years. Tumour margin positivity rates after breast-conserving surgery for invasive cancer requiring re-operation were consistently low ( approximately 5%). Other indicators, for example, the use of an MRI-scan prior to surgery or immediate breast reconstruction following mastectomy showed considerable hospital variation. CONCLUSIONS: Results shown an overall high quality of breast cancer care in all hospitals in the Netherlands. For most quality indicators improvement was seen over time, while some indicators showed yet unexplained variation. J. Surg. Oncol. 2017;115:243-249. (c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
27885675	Intratissue lymphovenous communications in the mechanism of action of vascularized lymph node transfer.	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Vascularized lymph node transfer (VLNT) as a surgical treatment for cancer-related lymphedema has shown beneficial effects. The mechanism of action of this procedure involves lymphangiogenesis and lymphovenous communications (LVC) within the lymph nodes. We propose intratissue LVC as an additional element responsible for drainage of lymph to blood in the flap and examine this hypothesis in the current study. METHODS: This prospective study determined the passage of lymph to the venous system via intratissue LVC in 26 free flaps used for breast reconstruction. We evaluated whether fluorescence was positive in the pedicle vein after increasing time intervals following intradermal injection of indocyanine green (ICG) dye into the flaps using near infra-red fluorescence lymphography. RESULTS: We studied 26 free flaps, 22 deep inferior epigastric perforator (DIEP) flaps (84.6%), and 4 superior gluteal artery perforator (SGAP) flaps (15.4%). Fluorescence in the pedicle vein was positive in 22 of the 26 flaps (P = 0.000). The median time for fluorescence evaluation in the pedicle vein was 120 min. CONCLUSIONS: Fluorescence in the pedicle vein after ICG intradermal injection indicates functional intratissue LVC in free flaps. J. Surg. Oncol. 2017;115:27-31. (c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
27885435	Comparison of immunophenotypes of primary breast carcinomas and multiple corresponding distant metastases: an autopsy study of 25 patients.	Phenotypical change in metastatic breast carcinoma has widely been accepted as an inherent biological feature rather than technical fault. We analyzed the immunohistochemical phenotype and histopathological features of 25 primary breast carcinomas and 90 corresponding distant metastases in 23 organs retrospectively. Histological slides were reviewed for prognostic and predictive factors. Overall, metastases were more similar to each other and often differed from the primary tumor. We created a 3-step grouping system based on the localization of metastases. Regions: tumors metastasizing to the abdominal region were likely to lose ER (p = 0.002); we detected loss of PR in metastases to the thorax (p = 0.039) and abdomen (p < 0.001). Organ systems: loss of ER and PR was observed in metastases to the gastrointestinal system (p = 0.026 and p = 0.001, respectively), in the respiratory system only the loss of PR was significant (p = 0.05). Individual organs: the primaries were likely to lose the hormone receptors in liver metastases (ER p = 0.026; PR p = 0.004). In lung metastases only loss of PR was apparent (p = 0.049). We did not observe significant change in HER2 status, regarding Ki67 change occurred only in bone metastases compared to the primary (p = 0.048). 7/25 patients' distant metastases had heterogeneous immunoprofiles. The later the metastasis was discovered the more likely it had a differing IHC profile compared to the primary tumor, patients who had longer OS had a higher chance to develop a discordant metastasis. Immunoprofile of metastases may differ from primary breast cancer and from each other, probably resulting in different response to therapy.
27885422	CD44 induces FOXP3 expression and is related with favorable outcome in breast carcinoma.	We studied the relationship between CD44 and Forkhead box P3 (FOXP3) gene expression in cell lines and breast carcinomas and their association with clinicopathological variables and patient outcome. We assessed messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of CD44 and FOXP3 by quantitative real-time PCR and determined the number of FOXP3+ Tregs by immunohistochemistry in 264 breast cancer specimens. CD44 was stimulated with hyaluronan treatment, and the accompanying changes in FOXP3 mRNA expression in breast cancer cell lines representing breast cancer subtype were assessed. We found that lower CD44 expression correlated with the presence of necrosis, lymph-vascular invasion, grade 3 tumors, and aggressive phenotype (HER2 and basal-like). FOXP3 mRNA correlated positively with CD44 mRNA expression and Treg content. Moreover, stimulation of CD44 expression by hyaluronan in cell lines increased FOXP3 expression, which supports that their regulation is associated. Survival analysis revealed that low CD44 expression is associated with higher frequency of recurrence. Our findings indicate that CD44 has a regulatory role in FOXP3 expression and is associated with good prognostic factors in breast cancer.
27885248	Rs3842530 Polymorphism in MicroRNA-205 Host Gene in Lung and Breast Cancer Patients.	BACKGROUND The expression of miR-205 is closely related to the occurrence, development, and prognosis of lung cancer and breast cancer. However, studies show that it plays opposite roles in different tumor types. Because the expression and regulation of miR-205 are primarily confined to epigenetic areas, whether genetic variation of miR-205 is related to the occurrence or to the development of tumors has not been reported. The aim of this study was to screen genetic variation of miR-205 gene and to investigate its association with the risk and development of lung and breast cancer. MATERIAL AND METHODS Genomic DNA was extracted from cultured tumor cell lines and formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded lung and breast tissue samples. Bisulfite Clone Sequencing (BCS) and qRT-PCR were employed to detect the DNA methylation status and gene expression of the miR-205 gene, respectively. Genetic variation of miR-205 and miR-205HG were genotyped with PCR-sequencing method. Immunohistochemical analysis for ER, PR, and HER2 was performed on breast tissue samples. RESULTS These results indicate that the functional association of rs3842530 in miR-205HG and lung cancer might provide a possible explanation for the tissue-dependent function of miR-205 in different tumors. CONCLUSIONS These results indicate that the functional association of rs3842530 in miR-205HG and lung cancer might provide a possible explanation for the tissue-dependent function of miR-205 in different tumors.
27883280	Phase I study of irinotecan for previously treated lung cancer patients with the UGT1A1*28 or *6 polymorphism: Results of the Lung Oncology Group in Kyushu (LOGIK1004A).	BACKGROUND: Various polymorphisms have been detected in the UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1A ( UGT1A ) gene, and UGT1A1 *28 and UGT1A1 *6 have important effects on the pharmacokinetics of irinotecan and the risk of severe toxicities during irinotecan therapy. This study was conducted to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of irinotecan chemotherapy according to the UGT1A1 genotype in previously treated lung cancer patients with the UGT1A1 *28 or UGT1A1 *6 polymorphism. METHODS: The eligibility criteria were as follows: lung cancer patients that had previously been treated with anticancer agents other than irinotecan, possessed the UGT1A1 *28 or UGT1A1 *6 polymorphism (group A included *28/*28, *6/*6, and *28/*6, and group B included *28 /- and *6 /-), were aged </=75 years old, had a performance score of 0-1, and exhibited adequate bone marrow function. The patients were scheduled to receive irinotecan on days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, and 36. RESULTS: Four patients were enrolled in this trial. Two patients were determined to be ineligible. The remaining two patients, who belonged to group B, received an initial irinotecan dose of 60 mg/m2 , but did not complete the planned treatment because of diarrhea and leukopenia. Thus, in group B patients, 60 mg/m2 was considered to be the MTD of irinotecan. The study was terminated in group A because of poor case recruitment. CONCLUSIONS: The MTD of irinotecan for previously treated lung cancer patients that are heterozygous for the UGT1A1 * 28 or UGT1A1 * 6 gene polymorphism is 60 mg/m2 .
27882634	Attachment and couple satisfaction as predictors of expressed emotion in women facing breast cancer and their partners in the immediate post-surgery period.	OBJECTIVES: To investigate expressed emotion (EE) in couples facing breast cancer in the immediate post-surgery period. EE may be predictive of psychological disturbances that hinder both partners' capacities to cope with the stress of the disease. Severity of the disease, attachment tendencies, and couple satisfaction were tested as predictors of EE. DESIGN: The design was cross-sectional. Couples (N = 61) were interviewed 2 weeks after the women's breast surgery. METHODS: Expressed emotion was assessed in women and in partners with the Five-Minute Speech Sample, with a focus on overt and covert criticisms. Self-reported EE, attachment tendencies, and couple satisfaction were assessed with questionnaires. Hierarchical regression analyses were performed to test the predictors and possible interactions between them. RESULTS: Both partners expressed overt and covert criticisms; women expressed more overt criticisms than did their partners. Cancer stage was inversely related to the number of overt criticisms in women and to the number of covert criticisms in partners. Regression analyses showed that in women, higher attachment anxiety and lower couple satisfaction were positive predictors of overt criticisms; in partners, a higher cancer stage was a negative predictor of overt and covert criticisms. CONCLUSIONS: Practitioners should pay attention to the couple relationship in breast cancer. EE is most likely to appear when the cancer stage is low, showing that even when the medical prognosis is optimal, relational and emotional disturbances may occur. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject? The couple relationship is of paramount importance in breast cancer. Expressed emotion (EE) is related to negative individual and relational psychological outcomes in psychiatric and somatic diseases. Expressed emotion has not yet been studied in the context of breast cancer. What does this study add? Expressed emotion is present in breast cancer situations, especially when the cancer stage is low. There was more EE in women than in their partners. Cancer stage, attachment tendencies, and couple satisfaction are predictors of EE.
27882441	Regioselective synthesis and biological studies of novel 1-aryl-3, 5-bis (het) aryl pyrazole derivatives as potential antiproliferative agents.	Pyrazole moiety represents an important category of heterocyclic compound in pharmaceutical and medicinal chemistry. The novel 1-aryl-3, 5-bis (het) aryl pyrazole derivatives were synthesized with complementary regioselectivity. The chemical structures were confirmed by IR, 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and mass spectral analysis. The chemical entities were screened in various cancer cell lines to assess their cell viability activity. Results showed that the compound 3-(1-(4-bromophenyl)-5-phenyl-1H-pyrazol-3-yl) pyridine (5d) possessed maximum cytotoxic effect against breast cancer and leukemic cells. The cytotoxicity was confirmed by live-dead cell assay and cell cycle analysis. Mitochondrial membrane potential, Annexin V-FITC staining, DNA fragmentation, Hoechst staining, and western blot assays revealed the ability of compound 5d to induce cell death by activating apoptosis in cancer cells. Thus, the present study demonstrates that compound 5d could be an attractive chemical entity for the development of small molecule inhibitors for treatment of leukemia and breast cancer.
27882334	Crosstalk between Innate Lymphoid Cells and Other Immune Cells in the Tumor Microenvironment.	Our knowledge and understanding of the tumor microenvironment (TME) have been recently expanded with the recognition of the important role of innate lymphoid cells (ILC). Three different groups of ILC have been described based on their ability to produce cytokines that mediate the interactions between innate and adaptive immune cells in a variety of immune responses in infection, allergy, and autoimmunity. However, recent evidence from experimental models and clinical studies has demonstrated that ILC contribute to the mechanisms that generate suppressive or tolerant environments that allow tumor regression or progression. Defining the complex network of interactions and crosstalk of ILC with other immune cells and understanding the specific contributions of each type of ILC leading to tumor development will allow the manipulation of their function and will be important to develop new interventions and therapeutic strategies.
27882074	Survival Prediction and Feature Selection in Patients with Breast Cancer Using Support Vector Regression.	The Support Vector Regression (SVR) model has been broadly used for response prediction. However, few researchers have used SVR for survival analysis. In this study, a new SVR model is proposed and SVR with different kernels and the traditional Cox model are trained. The models are compared based on different performance measures. We also select the best subset of features using three feature selection methods: combination of SVR and statistical tests, univariate feature selection based on concordance index, and recursive feature elimination. The evaluations are performed using available medical datasets and also a Breast Cancer (BC) dataset consisting of 573 patients who visited the Oncology Clinic of Hamadan province in Iran. Results show that, for the BC dataset, survival time can be predicted more accurately by linear SVR than nonlinear SVR. Based on the three feature selection methods, metastasis status, progesterone receptor status, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 status are the best features associated to survival. Also, according to the obtained results, performance of linear and nonlinear kernels is comparable. The proposed SVR model performs similar to or slightly better than other models. Also, SVR performs similar to or better than Cox when all features are included in model.
27881889	Expression of CAF-Related Proteins Is Associated with Histologic Grade of Breast Phyllodes Tumor.	Purpose. The purpose of this study was to investigate the expression of cancer-associated fibroblast- (CAF-) related proteins and the implications in breast phyllodes tumor (PT). Methods. Tissue microarrays of 194 PT cases (151 benign PT, 27 borderline PT, and 16 malignant PT) were constructed. We performed immunohistochemical staining for CAF-related proteins (podoplanin, prolyl 4-hydroxylase, FAPalpha, S100A4, PDGFR alpha/beta, and NG2) and analyzed the results according to clinicopathologic parameters. Results. Expression of PDGFRalpha and PDGFRbeta in the stromal component increased with increasing histologic grade of PT (p = 0.003 and p = 0.034, resp.). Among clinicopathologic parameters, only expression of FAPalpha in stroma was associated with distant metastasis (p = 0.002). In univariate analysis, stromal expression of PDGFRalpha was associated with shorter overall survival (p = 0.002). In Cox multivariate analysis, stromal overgrowth and PDGFRalpha stromal positivity were associated with shorter overall survival (p = 0.006 and p = 0.050, resp.). Furthermore, expression of PDGFRbeta in stroma was associated with shorter overall survival in patients with malignant PT (p = 0.041). Conclusion. Stromal expression of PDGFRalpha and PDGFRbeta increased with increasing histologic grade of PT. In addition, PDGFR stromal positivity was associated with shorter overall survival. These results suggest that CAFs are associated with breast PT progression.
27881234	DENSpm overcame Bcl-2 mediated resistance against Paclitaxel treatment in MCF-7 breast cancer cells via activating polyamine catabolic machinery.	PURPOSE: The Bcl-2 mediated resistance is one of the most critical obstacle in cancer therapy. Conventional chemotherapeutics such as Paclitaxel, a commonly used in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer, is not sufficient to overcome Bcl-2 mediated drug resistance mechanism. Thus, combinational drug regimes are favored by researchers to overcome resistance phenotype against drugs. N1,N11-diethylnorspermine (DENSpm), a polyamine analogue, which is a promising drug candidate induced-cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in various cancer cells such as prostate, melanoma, colon and breast cancer cells via activated polyamine catabolism and reactive oxygen generation. Recent studies indicated the potential therapeutic role of DENSpm in phase I and II trials in breast cancer cases. Although the molecular targets of Paclitaxel in apoptotic cell death mechanism is well documented, the therapeutic effect of DENSpm and Paclitaxel in breast cancer cells has not been investigated yet. In this study, our aim was to determine the time dependent effect of DENSpm and Paclitaxel on apoptotic cell death via determination of polyamine metabolism related targets in wt and Bcl-2 overexpressing MCF-7 breast cancer cells. RESULTS: In our experimental study, Paclitaxel decreased cell viability in dose-dependent manner within 24h. Co-treatment of Paclitaxel (30nM) with DENSpm (20muM) further increased the cytoxicity of Paclitaxel (30nM) compared to alone Paclitaxel (30nM) treatment in MCF-7 Bcl-2+ breast cancer cells. In addition, we determined that resistance against Paclitaxel-induced apoptotic cell death in Bcl-2 overexpressed MCF-7 cells was overcome due to activation of polyamine catabolic pathway, which caused depletion of polyamines. CONCLUSIONS: DENSpm combinational treatment might increase the effect of low cytotoxic paclitaxel in drug-resistant breast cancer cases.
27881057	Recent Patents on Heat Shock Proteins Targeting Antibodies.	BACKGROUND: Heat shock proteins (Hsp) are major chaperone molecules that have recently emerged as cancer therapeutic targets owing to their involvement in tumor cell proliferation, differentiation, invasion and metastasis. High levels of extracellular Hsp90 and Hsp70 have been closely associated with a wide range of human cancers. Accumulating evidence suggests that the pharmacological inhibition of these molecules can play a pivotal role in non-surgical cancer treatment. Efforts have been taken to develop monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and antibody fragments targeting extracellular Hsp90 and Hsp70, alone or conjugated with standard anticancer agents, to control several types of cancer, such as breast, colon, prostate or melanoma. OBJECTIVE: To provide an overview on the development of monoclonal antibodies and antibody fragments with capacity to bind Hsp90 and Hsp70, aiming at being used for cancer treatment. METHODS: A systematic review was performed using European Patent Office and Google patents databases. RESULTS: Based on the available literature and patents, we report the potential anticancer strategies based on these biological molecules. CONCLUSIONS: Supported by the recent developments in this field, Hsp targeting antibodies therapy may emerge for clinical use in the future for cancer patients, namely as antibody-drug conjugates combining the specificity of these antibodies with the potency of cytotoxic drugs.
27880919	Activation of G protein-coupled receptor 30 by thiodiphenol promotes proliferation of estrogen receptor alpha-positive breast cancer cells.	Many studies have been shown that environmental estrogen bisphenol A (BPA) can activate nuclear receptor (estrogen receptor alpha, ERalpha) or membrane receptor (G-protein-coupled receptor, GPR30) in breast cancer cells and exerts genomic or nongenomic actions inducing cell proliferation. 4,4'-thiodiphenol (TDP) as one of BPA derivatives exhibits more potent estrogenic activity than BPA does. However, comparatively little is known about the ways in which TDP interferes with these signaling pathways and produces cell biological changes. This study evaluated the effect of TDP on cell viability, reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation, and intercellular calcium (Ca2+) fluctuation in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. The underlying molecular mechanism of cell proliferation induced by TDP was analyzed by examining the activation of ERalpha and GPR30-mediated phosphatidylinotidol 3-kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/AKT) and extracellular-signa1regulated kinase (ERK1/2) signaling pathways. The results showed that exposure to 0.1-10 muM TDP for 24, 48, and 72 h significantly increased viability of MCF-7 cells. At the same concentration range, TDP exposure for 3 and 24 h markedly elevated ROS production and intracellular Ca2+ levels. In addition, 0.01-1 muM TDP significantly increased the expression of ERalpha, GPR30, p-AKT and p-ERK1/2 protein. Specific protein inhibitors blocked phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and AKT and decreased TDP-induced cell proliferation. These findings show that TDP activated the GPR30-PI3K/AKT and ERK1/2 pathways, and the resulting interaction with ERalpha stimulated MCF-7 cell proliferation. Our results indicate a novel mechanism through which TDP may exert relevant estrogenic action in ERalpha positive cancer cells.
27880748	CDC Grand Rounds: Family History and Genomics as Tools for Cancer Prevention and Control.	Although many efforts in cancer prevention and control have routinely focused on behavioral risk factors, such as tobacco use, or on the early detection of cancer, such as colorectal cancer screening, advances in genetic testing have created new opportunities for cancer prevention through evaluation of family history and identification of cancer-causing inherited mutations. Through the collection and evaluation of a family cancer history by a trained health care provider, patients and families at increased risk for a hereditary cancer syndrome can be identified, referred for genetic counseling and testing, and make informed decisions about options for cancer risk reduction (1). Although hereditary cancers make up a small proportion of all cancers, the number of affected persons can be large, and the level of risk among affected persons is high. Two hereditary cancer syndromes for which public health professionals have worked to reduce the burden of morbidity and mortality are hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome (HBOC) and Lynch syndrome.
27879682	Ziyuglycoside I Inhibits the Proliferation of MDA-MB-231 Breast Carcinoma Cells through Inducing p53-Mediated G2/M Cell Cycle Arrest and Intrinsic/Extrinsic Apoptosis.	BACKGROUND: Due to the aggressive clinical behavior, poor outcome, and lack of effective specific targeted therapies, triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) has currently been recognized as one of the most malignant types of tumors. In the present study, we investigated the cytotoxic effect of ziyuglycoside I, one of the major components extracted from Chinese anti-tumor herbal Radix Sanguisorbae, on the TNBC cell line MDA-MB-231. METHODS: The underlying molecular mechanism of the cytotoxic effect ziyuglycoside I on MDA-MB-231 cells was investigated with cell viability assay, flow cytometric analysis and Western blot. RESULTS: Compared to normal mammary gland Hs 578Bst cells, treatment of ziyuglycoside I resulted in a significant growth inhibitory effect on MDA-MB-231 cells. Ziyuglycoside I induced the G2/M phase arrest and apoptosis of MDA-MB-231 cells in a dose-dependent manner. These effects were found to be partially mediated through the up-regulation of p53 and p21WAF1, elevated Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, and the activation of both intrinsic (mitochondrial-initiated) and extrinsic (Fas/FasL-initiated) apoptotic pathways. Furthermore, the p53 specific siRNA attenuated these effects. CONCLUSION: Our study suggested that ziyuglycoside I-triggered MDA-MB-231 cell cycle arrest and apoptosis were probably mediated by p53. This suggests that ziyuglycoside I might be a potential drug candidate for treating TNBC.
27879489	Breast Fibroadenoma With Increased Activity on 68Ga DOTATATE PET/CT.	Fibroadenoma is the most common benign breast tumor in women of reproductive age, carrying little to no risk of breast cancer development. We report on a case of a woman with history of neuroendocrine tumor who on follow-up imaging tests underwent whole-body PET/CT study using Ga DOTATATE. The scan showed increased focal activity in the right breast, which was biopsied revealing a fibroadenoma. The presented data suggests cell surface overexpression of somatostatin receptors by this benign breast tumor. Moreover, this finding emphasizes the need for cautious interpretation of Ga DOTATATE-avid breast lesions that could mimic malignancy in neuroendocrine tumor patients.
27878432	Histopathologic diagnosis of brain metastases: current trends in management and future considerations.	Confronted with brain metastases (BM), pathologists aim to rule out a primary central nervous system (CNS) tumor and to identify or verify the primary tumor site to guide the clinician to specific therapies. Apart from morphological features, ancillary immunohistochemical analysis is the most effective tool for characterizing a metastatic neoplasm of unknown origin. A limited array of antibodies is used, taking into account relevant clinical information and the known brain tropism of lung cancer, breast cancer and melanoma. Recently, targeted therapies have enriched the therapeutic arsenal, in particular for patients with non-small cell lung cancer or melanoma and for patients carrying molecular anomalies. These therapies can lead to a substantial tumor response, brain metastases included, which justifies rapid determination of a molecular profile. To combine different tools and provide timely results, good tumor sample management and careful attention at the pre-analytical phase are critical. Appropriate strategies for molecular and immunohistochemical analysis are needed to identify theranostic markers. This article aims to review the anatomopathological diagnostic approach for BM in the age of targeted therapies.
27878304	Upregulation of MEK5 by Stat3 promotes breast cancer cell invasion and metastasis.	Mitogen extracellular-signal-regulated kinase kinase 5 (MEK5) plays an important role in promoting cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. The aberrant expression of MEK5 has been reported in various malignant diseases including cancers of breast, prostate, lung, colorectal and brain. However, the function and regulation of MEK5 signaling pathway are ambiguous and remain elusive with respect to its oncogenic roles in various cancers, especially in the regulation of the initiation and progression of cancer invasion and metastasis. Ectopic expression of MEK5 or knockdown of MEK5 by shRNA with in vitro cell based models demonstrated the role of MEK5 in regulation of epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) and breast cancer invasion and metastasis. Here, we show that MEK5 upregulated by Stat3 promotes breast cancer cell invasion through EMT. Further study demonstrated that Stat3 could bind to promoter region of MEK5 and enhanced MEK5 transcription and expression. In addition, the phosphorylation of MEK5 significantly increased in breast cancer cells corresponding to metastatic capability of breast cancer cells. The depletion of MEK5 by shRNA significantly decreased breast cancer invasion. Ectopic expression of MEK5 could confer non-invasive breast cancer cells to become invasion capable cells. Moreover, the phosphorylation of Erk5, a MEK5-regulated downstream kinase, was also upregulated consistent with the increased level of active MEK5. Our studies provide insights into a molecular mechanism by which MEK5 transcriptionally upregulated by Stat3 augments breast cancer cell EMT, which subsequently enhances cancer cell invasion and metastasis. This finding may suggest that Stat3 and MEK5/Erk5 pathways could be an effective therapeutic target for inhibition of breast cancer invasion and metastasis.
27878294	Arctigenin, a lignan from Arctium lappa L., inhibits metastasis of human breast cancer cells through the downregulation of MMP-2/-9 and heparanase in MDA-MB-231 cells.	Arctigenin is a bioactive lignan isolated from the seeds of Arctium lappa L. which has been widely used as a diuretic and a diaphoretic in Traditional Chinese Medicine. In the present study, the authors investigated the effects of arctigenin on tumor migration and invasion in aggressive human breast cancer cells. The MTT assay results showed that arctigenin did not show a significant cytotoxic effect on the cell viability of MDA-MB-231 cells. However, wound healing migration and Boyden chamber invasion assays demonstrated that arctigenin significantly inhibited in vitro migration and invasion of the MDA-MB-231 cells. Furthermore, gelatin zymography results showed that arctigenin reduced the activity of MMP-2 and MMP-9. Western blot analysis results demonstrated that the expression of MMP-2, MMP-9 and heparanase proteins was significantly downregulated following the treatment of arctigenin. Finally, the antiangiogenic activity of arctigenin was also examined by the chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay. Arctigenin treatment significantly inhibited angiogenesis in the CAM. In conclusion, the results revealed that arctigenin significantly inhibited the migration and invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells by downregulating MMP-2, MMP-9 and heparanase expression. However, further studies are still necessary to investigate the exact mechanisms involved and to explore signal transduction pathways to better understand the biological mechanisms.
27878288	MicroRNA-6826 and -6875 in plasma are valuable noninvasive biomarkers that predict the efficacy of vaccine treatment against metastatic colorectal cancer.	Various vaccine treatments against metastatic colorectal cancer have been developed and applied. However, to improve the efficacy of immunotherapy, biomarkers that can predict the effects are needed. It has been reported that various microRNAs (miRNAs) in peripheral blood may be useful as non-invasive biomarkers. In this study, miRNAs influencing the efficacy of vaccine treatment were screened for in a microarray analysis of 13 plasma samples that were obtained from patients prior to vaccine treatment. To validate the screening results, real-time RT-PCR was performed using 93 plasma samples obtained from patients prior to vaccine treatment. Four candidate miRNAs were selected according to the results of the comprehensive analysis of miRNA expression, which were ranked using the Fisher criterion and the absolute value of the log2 ratio in the screening analysis. The validation analysis showed that in the HLA-A*2402matched patient group (vaccine-treated group), patients with a high expression of plasma miR-6826 had a poorer prognosis than those with a low expression (P=0.048). In contrast, in the HLA-A*2402-unmatched patient group (control group), there was no difference between the patients with high or low plasma miR-6826 expression (P=0.168). Similar results were obtained in the analysis of miR-6875 (P=0.029 and P=0.754, respectively). Moreover, multivariate analysis of the Cox regression model indicated that the expression of miR-6826 was the most significant predictor for overall survival (P=0.003, hazard ratio, 3.670). In conclusion, plasma miR-6826 and miR-6875 may be predictive biomarkers for a poor response to vaccine treatment. Although further clarification is needed regarding the functions of miR-6826 and miR-6875 and their relationship to immunerelated molecules, plasma miR-6826 and miR-6875 may be useful negative biomarkers for predicting the efficacy of vaccine treatment.
27878264	Silencing of ANXA3 expression by RNA interference inhibits the proliferation and invasion of breast cancer cells.	The present study aimed to explore the expression of Annexin A3 (ANXA3) in breast cancer cells and the mechanisms involved in the regulatory effects of ANXA3 on proliferation, invasion and migration of breast cancer cells. Fluorescence quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and western blotting were used to measure the expression of ANXA3 mRNA and protein in two breast cancer cell lines (MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7). Three ANXA3 silencing shRNA plasmids (ANXA3-sh1-3) and one negative control plasmid were constructed, and the Lipofectamine transfection method was used for transfecting human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231. Flow cytometry was used to measure the transfection efficiency. The expression of ANXA3 protein was measured by western blotting. Cell cycle distribution and apoptosis were assessed by flow cytometry. Migration and invasion of the transfected cells were evaluated using wound healing and Transwell assays, respectively. The expression levels of ANXA3 mRNA and protein were significantly higher in the MDA-MB-231 cells than levels in the MCF-7 cells. Western blotting showed that the ANXA3 protein level was significantly lower in the MDA-MB-231-Sh cells than that in the MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-231-NC cells. In addition, the percentage of G0/1 cells and the apoptosis rate were significantly higher, while the cell proliferation rate was significantly lower, in the MDA-MB-231-Sh cells when compared with the MDA-MB-231-NC and MDA-MB-231 cells. The cell migration and invasion abilities were also lower in the MDA-MB-231-Sh cells than these abilities in the MDA-MB-231-NC and MDA-MB-231 cells. The present study investigated the relationships between ANXA3 and proliferation, apoptosis, migration and invasion of breast cancer cells to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the development, progression, invasion and metastasis of breast cancer.
27878233	Benzoquinone from Fusarium pigment inhibits the proliferation of estrogen receptor-positive MCF-7 cells through the NF-kappaB pathway via estrogen receptor signaling.	Natural pigments are known for possessing a wide range of pharmacological and health-promoting properties. The pigments, produced by a new strain Fusarium (Fusarium sp. JN158) previously identified in our laboratory, were found to have 6 peaks (representing 6 compounds) by high-performance liquid chromatography with a diode-array detector (HPLC-DAD) separation. The 6th peak compound (compound VI) is a benzoquinone compound. In this study, we examined the effects of compound VI on the proliferation of breast cancer cells and aimed to elucidate the underlying mechamisms. Compound VI exerted anti-proliferative effects on MCF7 estrogen receptor (ER)+ cells in a dose-dependent manner (IC25, 7 microM; IC50, 11 microM), whereas it had no effect on MDAMB231 ER- cells and normal cells. The cell index (CI) began to decrease at 24 h following treatment with benzoquinone. Mechanistically, the results from molecular analysis revealed that compound VI inhibited the expression of ERalpha, progesterone receptor (PR), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), Bcl-2, cyclin D1 and nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) p65, while it increased the expression of cleaved caspase-3 and Bax in the MCF7 cells. Taken together, our findings indicate that compound VI exerts anti-proliferative effects on MCF7 cells through the NF-kappaB pathway via the regulation of ER signaling. Our data may indicate that benzoquinone from Fusarium pigment may have potential for use as an anti-proliferative agent in the treatment of breast cancer.
27878232	Involvement of bleomycin hydrolase and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 in Ubc9-mediated resistance to chemotherapy agents.	Ubiquitin-conjugating protein 9 (Ubc9), the sole enzyme for sumoylation, plays critical roles in many physiological functions, such as DNA damage repair and genome integrity. Its overexpression led to poor prognosis and drug resistance in tumor chemotherapy. However, the underlying mechanism by which Ubc9 promotes tumor progress and influences the susceptibility to antitumor agents remains elusive. In this study, we used nine antitumor agents with distinct actions to explore Ubc9-mediated resistance in human breast carcinoma MCF-7 cells. Increase of susceptibility, respectively, to boningmycin, hydroxycamptothecine, cis-dichlorodiamineplatinum, 5-fluorouracil, vepeside and gemcitabine, but not for doxorubicin, vincristine and norcantharidin, was observed after the knockdown of Ubc9 protein level with RNA interference. Reduction of bleomycin hydrolase and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 levels after knockdown of Ubc9 suggests their contribution to Ubc9-mediated drug resistance. This is the first report on the sensitivity to hydroxycamptothecine, cis-dichlorodiamineplatinum and gemcitabine that increased after knockdown of bleomycin hydrolase at protein level. In conclusion, Ubc9 plays different roles of action in antitumor agents in chemotherapy. The process requires bleomycin hydrolase and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1. The results are beneficial to deeply understanding of Ubc9 functions and for precise prediction of chemotherapy outcomes in tumors.
27877077	Amelioration of estrogen deficiency-induced obesity by collagen hydrolysate.	Objectives: Menopausal transition with declining estrogen levels significantly affects the physiological properties of women and consequently contributes to a series of medical conditions, including obesity. Obesity is a crucial risk factor associated with cardiovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus, and breast cancer. Increasing dietary protein content improves satiety and energy expenditure. Thus, we hypothesize that supplementing with collagen, a common dietary protein, may alleviate menopause-induced obesity. Methods: We used ovariectomized (OVX) rats to mimic a menopausal human. The body weight of OVX rats significantly increased compared with that of sham-operated rats (P<0.05), but uterus weight was decreased. Adipocyte size in perigonadal adipose tissue also increased (P<0.05). Results: By contrast, OVX rats supplemented with aqueous collagen hydrolysate (2.5 mg/mL) exhibited significant attenuation in body weight gain and adipocyte enlargement (P<0.05), but insignificant change in uterus weight. Further investigation indicated that collagen hydrolysate supplementation insignificantly affected the levels of dorsal fat, serum total cholesterol, and serum triacylglycerol. Levels of serum biochemical factors, calcium, phosphorus, and glucose were also insignificantly altered by collagen hydrolysate supplementation. Conclusion: Collagen hydrolysate supplementation reduced body weight gain and adipocyte enlargement in response to ovariectomy but slightly affected blood lipids, calcium, and glucose in both sham-operated and OVX rats. Collagen hydrolysate supplementation is beneficial in ameliorating estrogen deficiency-induced obesity and its associated risk factors.
27877037	Acute and subacute toxicity profiles of thymoquinone-loaded nanostructured lipid carrier in BALB/c mice.	BACKGROUND: Thymoquinone (TQ), the predominant active lipophilic component in Nigella sativa seed oil, has a variety of pharmacological properties such as anticancer activities. However, translation of TQ to clinical phase is still not possible due to its hydrophobic properties. This problem can be solved by encapsulating it in nanoformulations to enhance its pharmacological properties. In our previous study, TQ has been successfully encapsulated in a nanostructured lipid carrier (hereinafter referred to as TQNLC) with excellent physiochemical properties such as high encapsulation efficiency, high drug-loading capacity, particle diameter less than 100 nm, and stability up to 2 years. In vitro studies also proved that TQNLC exhibited antiproliferative activity toward breast and cervical cancer cell lines. However, no toxicity profile related to this formulation has been reported. In this study, we determine and compare the in vivo toxicity of both TQNLC and TQ. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The in vivo toxicity (acute and subacute toxicity) study was carried out by oral administration of TQNLC and TQ to BALB/c mice. Animal survival, body weight, organ weight-to-body weight ratio, hematological profile, biochemistry profile, and histopathological changes were analyzed. RESULTS: In acute toxicity, TQ that is loaded in nanostructured lipid carrier (NLC) was found to be less toxic than pure TQ. It can be concluded that encapsulation of TQ in lipid carrier minimizes the toxicity of the compound. In the subacute toxicity study, oral administration of 100 mg/kg of TQNLC and TQ did not cause mortality to either male or female but resulted in toxicity to the liver. It is postulated that long-term consumption of TQNLC and TQ may cause toxicity to the liver but not to the extent of altering the functions of the organ. For both treatments, the no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) was found to be 10 mg/kg/d for mice in both sexes. CONCLUSION: For long-term oral consumption, TQ and TQNLC at a dose of 10 mg/kg is safe in mice and does not exert any toxic effect. The results provide safety information of TQNLC, which would further help researchers in clinical use.
27876429	Can polyacrylic acid treat sexual dysfunction in women with breast cancer receiving tamoxifen?	OBJECTIVE: There is a lack of safety data supporting the use of hormone therapy in women who have had breast cancer and who have complained of genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM). The objective was to test the efficacy of two non-hormonal therapies for vaginal dryness. METHODS: This was a randomized trial with 52 women with breast cancer who were being treated with tamoxifen and who complained of vaginal dryness. The volunteers answered two questionnaires to evaluate sexual function (Female Sexual Function Index, FSFI) and a customized GSM questionnaire. The women were randomized into two groups: 25 (48.1%) in the polyacrylic acid group and 27 (51.9%) in the lubricant group, using either one of the treatments for 30 days, and after they were invited to answer the questionnaires again. RESULTS: There was improvement in the FSFI after both treatments. The polyacrylic acid group showed a decrease in sexual dysfunction from 96% to 24% (p < 0.0001) and the lubricant group showed a decrease from 88.9% to 55.6% (p = 0.0027). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study showed that both treatments improved sexual function; however, polyacrylic acid was superior to the lubricant in treating sexual dysfunction.
27876309	Vertical breast measurement in East Asian women: A guide for mastopexy and reduction to form nonptotic breasts in unilateral prosthetic breast reconstruction.	BACKGROUND: Following unilateral breast cancer surgery, mastopexy and reduction of the unaffected breast are often performed to obtain symmetrical breasts. The use of implants in breast reconstruction results in a nonptotic breast. To achieve symmetry following the procedure, the unaffected side should be nonptotic too. However, no study has yet reported any indices for the design of mastopexy and reduction in this direction. We present a new method of preoperative design that uses vertical breast measurements to form nonptotic breasts according to individual breast shapes. METHODS: We performed vertical breast measurements of the unaffected breasts of 193 patients scheduled to undergo surgery for unilateral breast cancer. The vertical base dimension (VBD) and vertical surface dimension (VSD) of the ptotic and nonptotic breasts and the height of the nipple in the nonptotic breast were measured in centimeters. RESULTS: The borderline between ptotic and nonptotic breasts was expressed using the formula VSD = 1.13 x VBD + 1.86. The height of the nipple in nonptotic breasts was 0.8 times the distance between the sternal notch and lowest point of the inframammary fold on the midline. From these findings, we formulated a new method for forming a nonptotic breast from a ptotic breast using an inverted T design. CONCLUSION: These results can be used for the design of mastopexy and reduction when forming a nonptotic breast on the unaffected side. These procedures can be performed without significantly lifting the nipple-areolar complex if required during unilateral prosthetic breast reconstruction.
27876207	Aglycone rich extracts of phytoestrogens cause ROS-mediated DNA damage in breast carcinoma cells.	Phytoestrogens are known for their physiological role in lowering risk of osteoporosis, heart disease, breast cancer and menopausal symptoms. They are plant derived potent anti-oxidants, but tend to show pro-oxidant effect at higher concentrations. This study has been undertaken to exploit their pro-oxidant effect in the management of cancer. Cancer cells inherently possess high intracellular ROS levels, however, these levels do not cause harm to the cancer cells because of the anti-oxidant enzyme system. So, there is a need for a treatment strategy which could modulate the ROS levels. Breast cancer cell lines MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 are treated with various concentrations of soyabean aglycone rich extracts (SARE) and flaxseed aglycone rich extracts (FSARE). The treatment brings about a significant decrease in super oxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity, thereby leading to accumulation of superoxide ion and peroxide in the cells. The catalase (CAT) activity however, did not show a dose dependent change. The intra-cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels increased and a marked change in mitochondrial membrane potential was detected. Cell cycle arrest was seen at S and G2/M phase in MCF-7 cells and high accumulation of cells in Sub G1 phase was seen in MDA-MB-231 cells. Microscopic evaluation indicated apoptotic morphology and DNA damage. This study suggests an important role of soyabean and flaxseed aglycones in modulating intracellular ROS in breast carcinoma.
27876192	Synthesis and biological evaluation of salinomycin triazole analogues as anticancer agents.	Salinomycin, a polyether antibiotic used for treatment of coccidial disease in animal husbandry, has demonstrated promising efficacy for treating different cancers. To enrich structure-activity relationship of salinomycin in tumours, we prepared a series of new triazole derivatives in specific site of salinomycin by click cycloaddition reactions, and assessed their antiproliferative activities on breast cancer cell lines. The screening results indicated that most derivatives modified at the C20 hydroxyl group have potent antitumour activity. Notably, salinomycin triazole dimers were 3.27-4.97 times more toxic than the natural substance in ERalpha-positive breast cancer cells (MCF-7), and had moderately improved toxicity in triple-negative breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231).
27875762	Review of clinical studies and first clinical experiences with a commercially available cone-beam breast CT in Europe.	The dedicated cone-beam breast computed tomography (CBBCT) is a new and promising imaging modality which provides isotropic, 3D images of the breast with high spatial and contrast resolution. Non-contrast and contrast-enhanced CBBCT (CE-CBBCT) was superior to mammography for the visualization of breast masses, especially in patients with dense breast tissue. CE-CBBCT accurately detects DCIS and distinguishes it from benign causes of microcalcifications when compared with non-contrast CBBCT and mammography. The purpose of this report is to describe the technology and its possible indications, and to present the first results from recent clinical studies, illustrating these with our own image examples.
27875760	Comparing cancer detection rates of patients undergoing short term follow-up vs routine follow-up after benign breast biopsies, is follow-up needed?	PURPOSE: To compare cancer rates after benign breast biopsies between patients with short term imaging follow-up (STFU) and those with routine follow-up (RFU). MATERIALS & METHODS: Retrospective review of benign stereotactic, US or DCE-MRI breast biopsies. RESULTS: Of 580 lesions, 192 (33%) had STFU, and 388 (67%) had RFU. For US and mammographic detected lesions, there is no difference in cancer rates between the STFU (1 cancer, n=148) and the RFU group (0 cancer, n=365) (p=0.29). There were 2 cancers in the STFU group versus 0 in the RFU DCE-MRI group (p=0.54). CONCLUSION: Our results support RFU after benign ultrasound and stereotactic breast biopsies.
27875751	All-in-one dual-aptasensor capable of rapidly quantifying carcinoembryonic antigen.	Using a dual DNA aptamer (CEA aptamer linked to hemin aptamer), capable of rapidly capturing carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and hemin, an all-in-one dual-aptasensor with 1,1'-oxalyldiimidazole (ODI) chemiluminescence detection was developed for the early diagnosis of human cancer. CEA and hemin competitively bound with the dual DNA aptamer while the mixture in a detection cell was incubated for 30min at room temperature. When Amplex Red and H2O2 were added in the detection cell after the incubation, the yield of resorufin formed from the reaction Amplex Red and H2O2 depended on the concentration of HRP-mimicking G-quardruplex DNAzyme formed from the binding interaction between hemin and the dual DNA aptamer. Bright red light was observed with the addition of ODI and H2O2 in the detection cell containing resorufin. Relative CL intensity of all-in-one dual-aptasensor, operated with the competitive reaction of CEA and hemin in the presence of the dual aptamer, was exponentially decreased with the increase of CEA concentration in human serum. The limit of detection (LOD=3sigma) of the all-in-one dual-aptasensor which operated with excellent accuracy, precision, and reproducibility was as low as 0.58ng/ml. The good correlation between the easy to use all-in-one dual-aptasensor and conventional enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), operated with time consuming procedures (e.g., long incubations and multiple washings), indicates that the rapid all-in-one dual-aptasensor can be applied as a novel clinical tool for the early diagnosis of breast cancer.
27873491	Detection of Circulating Tumor Cells in Breast Cancer Patients Using Cytokeratin-19 Real-Time RT-PCR.	PURPOSE: The roles of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) as predictive and prognostic factors, as well as key mediators in the metastatic cascade, have been investigated. This study aimed to validate a method to quantify CTCs in peripheral blood using a real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay for cytokeratin (CK)-19 and to evaluate the utility of this assay in detecting CTCs in breast cancer patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Real-time monitoring PCR of fluorescently labeled specific hybridization probes for CK-19 mRNA was established. Peripheral blood samples from 30 healthy donors, 69 patients with early breast cancer, 47 patients with locally advanced breast cancer, and 126 patients with metastatic breast cancer were prospectively obtained and analyzed for CTC detection. RESULTS: CK-19 mRNA was not detectable in healthy subjects using the real-time RT-PCR method. The detection rates of CK-19 mRNA in breast cancer patients were 47.8% for early breast cancer (33/69), 46.8% for locally advanced breast cancer (22/47), and 61.1% for metastatic breast cancer (77/129). The detection rate of CK-19-positive CTCs in metastatic disease was slightly higher than early or locally advanced breast cancer; however, the detection rate according to disease burden was not statistically different (p=0.097). The detection rate was higher in patients with pleural metastasis (p=0.045). CTC detection was associated with poor survival (p=0.014). CONCLUSION: A highly specific and sensitive CK-19 mRNA-based method to detect CTCs in peripheral blood in breast cancer patients can be used in further prospective studies to evaluate the predictive and prognostic importance of CTCs.
27872957	Utility of 18F-fluoroestradiol (18F-FES) PET/CT imaging as a pharmacodynamic marker in patients with refractory estrogen receptor-positive solid tumors receiving Z-endoxifen therapy.	BACKGROUND: Z-endoxifen is the most potent of the metabolites of tamoxifen, and has the potential to be more effective than tamoxifen because it bypasses potential drug resistance mechanisms attributable to patient variability in the expression of the hepatic microsomal enzyme CYP2D6. 18F-FES is a positron emission tomography (PET) imaging agent which selectively binds to estrogen receptor alpha (ER-alpha) and has been used for non-invasive in vivo assessment of ER activity in tumors. This study utilizes 18F-FES PET imaging as a pharmacodynamic biomarker in patients with ER+ tumors treated with Z-endoxifen. METHODS: Fifteen patients were recruited from a parent therapeutic trial of Z-endoxifen and underwent imaging with 18F-FES PET at baseline. Eight had positive lesions on the baseline scan and underwent follow-up imaging with 18F-FES 1-5 days post administration of Z-endoxifen. RESULTS: Statistically significant changes (p = 0.0078) in standard uptake value (SUV)-Max were observed between the baseline and follow-up scans as early as 1 day post drug administration. CONCLUSION: F-FES PET imaging could serve as a pharmacodynamic biomarker for patients treated with ER-directed therapy.
27872946	Implementation of image-guided intensity-modulated accelerated partial breast irradiation : Three-year results of a phase II clinical study.	PURPOSE: To report 3year results of accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) using image-guided intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IG-IMRT) following breast conserving surgery (BCS) for low-risk early invasive breast cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between July 2011 and March 2014, 60 patients with low-risk early invasive breast cancer underwent BCS and were enrolled in this phase II prospective study. The total dose was 36.9 Gy (9 fractions of 4.1 Gy, two fractions/day). Patient setup errors were detected in LAT, LONG and VERT directions. Local tumour control, survival results, early and late side effects and cosmetic outcome were assessed. RESULTS: At a median follow-up of 39 months, all patients were alive and neither locoregional nor distant failure occurred. One contralateral breast cancer and two new primary malignancies outside the breast were observed. No grade (G) 3-4 acute toxicity was detected. G1 and G2 erythema occurred in 21 (35%) and 2 (3.3%) patients, respectively; while G1 oedema was observed in 23 (38.8%) cases. G1 and G2 pain was reported by 6 (10%) and 2 (3.3%) patients, respectively. Among the late radiation side effects, G1 pigmentation or telangiectasia, G1 fibrosis and G1 asymptomatic fat necrosis occurred in 10 (16.7%), 7 (11.7%) and 3 (5%) patients, respectively. No >/= G2 late toxicity was detected. Cosmetic outcome was excellent in 43 (71.7%) and good in 17 (28.3%) patients. CONCLUSION: IG-IMRT is a reproducible and feasible technique for delivery of external beam APBI following BCS for treatment of low-risk, early-stage invasive breast carcinoma. In order to avoid toxicity, image guidance performed before each radiation fraction is necessary to minimize the PTV. Three-year results are promising, early and late radiation side-effects are minimal, and cosmetic results are excellent to good.
27872134	Metastatic trichilemmal carcinoma in a patient with breast cancer.	Trichilemmal carcinoma (TC) is described as a very rare cancer of the skin adnexa.1 2 Ninety per cent of the lesions present on the scalp. Prognostic factors in TC are limited to lymph node status and surgical margins, with no statistical significance observed for age or gender of the patient, size of tumour or locoregional recurrence. We present a 46-year-old black patient who developed TC during treatment for breast cancer. Postoperative histology of the scalp lesion excision confirmed no involved margins. At the three monthly appointment, the patient was reviewed and multiple, new scalp lesions were noted. A CT scan of the head, neck found multiple lesions on the scalp, limited to the soft tissue, not involving the outer table of the skull. There was bilateral invasion of the parotid glands. To the best of our knowledge, no syndromes or associations between breast cancer and adnexal skin tumours exist.
27871329	High expression of EPB41L5, an integral component of the Arf6-driven mesenchymal program, correlates with poor prognosis of squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue.	BACKGROUND: Squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue (tongue SCC) is a major subtype of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), which is an intractable cancer under current therapeutics. ARF6 and its effector AMAP1 are often overexpressed in different types of cancers, such as breast cancer and renal cancer, and in these cancers, AMAP1 binds to EPB41L5 to promote invasion, metastasis, and drug resistance. EPB41L5 is a mesenchymal-specific protein, normally induced during epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) to promote focal adhesion dynamics. Similarly to breast cancer and renal cancer, the acquisition of mesenchymal phenotypes is the key process that drives the malignancy of HNSCC. We previously showed that the overexpression of AMAP1 in tongue SCC is statistically correlated with the poor outcome of patients. In this study, we examined whether tongue SCC also expresses EPB41L5 at high levels. RESULTS: Immunohistochemical staining of clinical specimens of tongue SCC demonstrated that high expression levels of EPB41L5 statistically correlate with poor disease-free survival and poor overall survival rates of patients. The tongue SCC cell line SCC-9, which overexpress Arf6 and AMAP1, also expressed EPB41L5 at high levels to promote invasiveness, whereas the weakly invasive SCC-25 cells did not express EPB41L5 at notable levels. Among the different EMT-associated transcriptional factors, ZEB1 was previously found to be most crucial in inducing EPB41L5 in breast cancer and renal cancer. In contrast, expression levels of ZEB1 did not correlate with the expression levels of EPB41L5 in tongue SCC, whereas KLF8 and FOXO3 levels showed positive correlations with EPB41L5 levels. Moreover, silencing of EPB41L5 only marginally improved the drug resistance of SCC-9 cells, even when coupled with ionizing radiation. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that activation of the cancer mesenchymal program in tongue SCC, which leads to EPB41L5 expression, closely correlates with the poor prognosis of patients. However, ZEB1 was not the major inducer of EPB41L5 in tongue SCC, unlike in breast cancer and renal cancer. Thus, processes that trigger the mesenchymal program of tongue SCC, which drives their malignancies, seem to be substantially different from those of other cancers.
27871025	Factors influencing local control in patients undergoing breast conservation surgery for ductal carcinoma in situ.	BACKGROUND: The aim of our study was to assess various predictors for local recurrence (LR) in patients undergoing breast conservation surgery (BCS) for ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). MATERIALS AND METHODS: An audit was performed of 582 consecutive patients with DCIS between Jan 1975 to June 2008. In patients undergoing BCS, local guidelines reported a margin of >/=10 mm during the above period. Guideline with regard to margin of excision changes soon after this period. We retrospectively analysed clinical and pathological risk factors for local recurrence in patients undergoing BCS. Statistical analysis was carried out using SPSS version 19, and a cox regression model for multivariate analysis of local recurrence was used. RESULTS: Overall 239 women had BCS for DCIS during the above period. The actuarial 5-year recurrence rate was 9.6%. The overall LR rate was 17% (40/239. LR was more common in patients </=50 years: (10/31 patients, 32%) compared to patients > 50 years (30/208, 14%, P = 0.02). Forty three per cent of patients (6/14) with <5 mm margin developed LR which was significantly higher compared to patients with 5-9 mm margin (12%, 3/25) and with >/=10 mm margin (14%, 27/188, P = 0.01). On multivariate analysis age </=50 years, <5 mm pathological margin were independent prognostic factors for local recurrence. CONCLUSION: Our study shows that younger age (</=50 years) and a margin < 5 mm are poor prognostic factors for LR in patients undergoing breast conservation surgery for DCIS.
27871024	Is it time to address survivorship in advanced breast cancer? A review article.	The outcome of advanced breast cancer has significantly improved over recent decades. As a consequence, the complex needs of patients living with the disease and their care-givers should be addressed not only in terms of supportive and palliative care but also of "survivorship" requirements. The multidisciplinary approach to advanced breast cancer should encompass - early in the history of the disease - not only physical but also functional, social, psychological and spiritual domains. It is important to clearly define the disease context with patients and families ("chronic" preferred to "incurable"), addressing the concept of uncertainty, and tailoring the treatment strategy according to both disease status and individual priorities. Specific psychosocial needs of young and elderly women and male patients - i.e. social security, job flexibility, rehabilitation (including sexuality), home and child care - should be recognized and supported. This review will address the key questions associated with survivorship in this disease context, recognizing the dearth of specific data and the urgent need for targeted clinical research and tailored interventions.
27870726	Melanocytic Nevi of Special Sites.	Melanocytic nevi located on specific regions of the body can demonstrate unusual histopathological features such as asymmetry, irregular nesting patterns, pagetoid spread, cytologic atypia, and rarely, mitotic activity. However, despite these features that may raise concern for malignant melanoma, these lesions follow a benign clinical course and do not require intervention. Also known as nevi of special sites or nevi with site-related atypia, these melanocytic nevi were initially described on acral sites and genitalia. Now, additional anatomical sites with known site-related atypia include the ear, conjunctivae, scalp, breast, flexural skin, legs, and back and shoulder. This continuing medical education article presents a review of the histopathological characteristics of special site nevi based on anatomic location. It is imperative for dermatologists, pathologists, and dermatopathologists to distinguish benign melanocytic nevi with site-related atypia from malignant melanoma to avoid unnecessary surgical intervention or treatment.
27870337	Breast Cancers Found with Digital Breast Tomosynthesis: A Comparison of Pathology and Histologic Grade.	To compare the pathology and histologic grading of breast cancers detected with digital breast tomosynthesis to those found with conventional digital mammography. The institutional review board approved this study. A database search for all breast cancers diagnosed from June 2012 through December 2013 was performed. Imaging records for these cancers were reviewed and patients who had screening mammography with tomosynthesis as their initial examination were selected. Five dedicated breast imaging radiologists reviewed each of these screening mammograms to determine whether the cancer was visible on conventional digital mammography or whether tomosynthesis was needed to identify the cancer. A cancer was considered mammographically occult if all five radiologists agreed that the cancer could not be seen on conventional digital mammography. The size, pathology and histologic grading for all diagnosed breast cancers were then reviewed. The Mann-Whitney U and Fisher exact tests were utilized to determine any association between imaging findings and cancer size, pathologic type and histologic grade. Sixty-five cancers in 63 patients were identified. Ten of these cancers were considered occult on conventional digital mammography and detected with the addition of tomosynthesis. These mammographically occult cancers were significantly associated with Nottingham grade 1 histologic pathology (p = 0.02), were smaller (median size: 6 mm versus 10 mm, p = 0.07) and none demonstrated axillary nodal metastases. Breast cancers identified through the addition of tomosynthesis are associated with Nottingham grade 1 histologic pathology and prognostically more favorable than cancers identified with conventional digital mammography alone.
27870265	Antizyme inhibitor 1: a potential carcinogenic molecule.	Polyamines are multivalent and organic cations essential for cellular growth, proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. Increased levels of polyamines are closely associated with numerous forms of cancer. An autoregulatory circuit composed of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), antizyme (AZ) and antizyme inhibitor (AZI) govern the intracellular level of polyamines. Antizyme binds with ODC to inhibit ODC activity and to promote the ubiquitin-independent degradation of ODC. Antizyme inhibitor binds to AZ with a higher affinity than ODC. Consequently, ODC is released from the ODC-AZ complex to rescue its activity. Antizyme inhibitor increases the ODC activity to accelerate the formation of intracellular polyamines, triggering gastric and breast carcinogenesis as well as hepatocellular carcinoma and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma development. Antizyme inhibitor 1 (AZIN1), a primary member of the AZI family, has aroused more attention because of its contribution to cancer. Even though its conformation is changed by adenosine-to-inosine (A-->I) RNA editing, it plays an important role in tumorigenesis through regulating intracellular polyamines. Encouragingly, AZIN1 has been revealed to have an additional function outside the polyamine pathway so as to bypass the deficiency of targeting the polyamine biosynthetic pathway, promising to become a critical target for cancer therapy. Here, we review the latest research advances into AZIN1 and its potential contribution to carcinogenesis.
27869663	Dietary Protein Sources and Incidence of Breast Cancer: A Dose-Response Meta-Analysis of Prospective Studies.	Protein is important to the human body, and different sources of protein may have different effects on the risk of breast cancer. Thus, we conducted a meta-analysis to investigate the association between different dietary protein sources and breast cancer risk. PubMed and several databases were searched until December 2015. Relevant articles were retrieved according to specific searching criteria. Forty-six prospective studies were included. The summary relative risk (RR) for highest versus lowest intake was 1.07 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.01-1.14, I(2) = 34.6%) for processed meat, 0.92 (95% CI 0.84-1.00, I(2) = 0%) for soy food, 0.93 (95% CI 0.85-1.00, I(2) = 40.1%) for skim milk, and 0.90 (95% CI 0.82-1.00, I(2) = 0%) for yogurt. Similar conclusions were obtained in dose-response association for each serving increase: total red meat (RR: 1.07; 95% CI 1.01-1.14, I(2) = 7.1%), fresh red meat (RR: 1.13; 95% CI 1.01-1.26, I(2) = 56.4%), processed meat (RR: 1.09; 95% CI 1.02-1.17, I(2) = 11.8%), soy food (RR: 0.91; 95% CI 0.84-1.00, I(2) = 0%), and skim milk (RR: 0.96; 95% CI 0.92-1.00, I(2) = 11.9%). There was a null association between poultry, fish, egg, nuts, total milk, and whole milk intake and breast cancer risk. Higher total red meat, fresh red meat, and processed meat intake may be risk factors for breast cancer, whereas higher soy food and skim milk intake may reduce the risk of breast cancer.
27869171	Epigenetic activation of the prostaglandin receptor EP4 promotes resistance to endocrine therapy for breast cancer.	Approximately 75% of breast cancers express estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) and depend on estrogen signals for continued growth. Aromatase inhibitors (AIs) prevent estrogen production and inhibit ER signaling, resulting in decreased cancer recurrence and mortality. Advanced tumors treated with AIs almost always develop resistance to these drugs via the upregulation of alternative growth signals. The mechanisms that drive this resistance-especially epigenetic events that alter gene expression-are, however, not well understood. Genome-wide DNA methylation and expression analysis of cell line models of acquired AI resistance indicated that prostaglandin E2 receptor 4 (PTGER4) is upregulated after demethylation in resistant cells. Knockdown and inhibitor studies demonstrate that PTGER4 is essential for estrogen-independent growth. Our exploratory analysis of downstream signaling indicates that PTGER4 likely promotes AI resistance via ligand-independent activation of the ERalpha-cofactor CARM1. We believe that we have discovered a novel epigenetic mechanism for altering cell signaling and acquiring endocrine therapy resistance. Our findings indicate that PTGER4 is a potential drug target in AI-resistant cancers. In addition, the epigenetic component of PTGER4 regulation suggests that further study of PTGER4 may yield valuable insights into how DNA methylation-targeted diagnoses and treatments can improve AI-resistant breast cancer treatment.
27869163	Wwox-Brca1 interaction: role in DNA repair pathway choice.	In this study, loss of expression of the fragile site-encoded Wwox protein was found to contribute to radiation and cisplatin resistance of cells, responses that could be associated with cancer recurrence and poor outcome. WWOX gene deletions occur in a variety of human cancer types, and reduced Wwox protein expression can be detected early during cancer development. We found that Wwox loss is followed by mild chromosome instability in genomes of mouse embryo fibroblast cells from Wwox-knockout mice. Human and mouse cells deficient for Wwox also exhibit significantly enhanced survival of ionizing radiation and bleomycin treatment, agents that induce double-strand breaks (DSBs). Cancer cells that survive radiation recur more rapidly in a xenograft model of irradiated breast cancer cells; Wwox-deficient cells exhibited significantly shorter tumor latencies vs Wwox-expressing cells. This Wwox effect has important consequences in human disease: in a cohort of cancer patients treated with radiation, Wwox deficiency significantly correlated with shorter overall survival times. In examining mechanisms underlying Wwox-dependent survival differences, we found that Wwox-deficient cells exhibit enhanced homology directed repair (HDR) and decreased non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) repair, suggesting that Wwox contributes to DNA DSB repair pathway choice. Upon silencing of Rad51, a protein critical for HDR, Wwox-deficient cells were resensitized to radiation. We also demonstrated interaction of Wwox with Brca1, a driver of HDR, and show via immunofluorescent detection of repair proteins at ionizing radiation-induced DNA damage foci that Wwox expression suppresses DSB repair at the end-resection step of HDR. We propose a genome caretaker function for WWOX, in which Brca1-Wwox interaction supports NHEJ as the dominant DSB repair pathway in Wwox-sufficient cells. Taken together, the experimental results suggest that reduced Wwox expression, a common occurrence in cancers, dysregulates DSB repair, enhancing efficiency of likely mutagenic repair, and enabling radiation and cisplatin treatment resistance.
27866865	Accelerated Partial Breast Irradiation: Executive summary for the update of an ASTRO Evidence-Based Consensus Statement.	PURPOSE: To update the accelerated partial breast irradiation Consensus Statement published in 2009 and provide guidance on use of intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT) for partial breast irradiation in early-stage breast cancer, based on published evidence complemented by expert opinion. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A systematic PubMed search using the same terms as the original Consensus Statement yielded 419 articles; 44 articles were selected. The authors synthesized the published evidence and, through a series of conference calls and e-mails, reached consensus regarding the recommendations. RESULTS: The new recommendations include lowering the age in the "suitability group" from 60 to 50 years and in the "cautionary group" to 40 years for patients who meet all other elements of suitability (Table 1). Patients with low-risk ductal carcinoma in situ, as per Radiation Therapy Oncology Group 9804 criteria, were categorized in the "suitable" group. The task force agreed to maintain the current criteria based on margin status. Recommendations for the use of IORT for breast cancer patients include: counseling patients regarding the higher risk of ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence with IORT compared with whole breast irradiation; the need for prospective monitoring of long-term local control and toxicity with low-energy radiograph IORT given limited follow-up; and restriction of IORT to women with invasive cancer considered "suitable." CONCLUSION: These recommendations will provide updated clinical guidance regarding use of accelerated partial breast irradiation for radiation oncologists and other specialists participating in the care of breast cancer patients.
27866835	Over-using chemotherapy in the adjuvant setting.	Avoidance of unnecessary or ineffective treatment should be one of the main goals in adjuvant breast oncology today. Unfortunately, both patients and doctors hunt for tiny statistical differences in survival curves. This search could not only lead to an oncological approach of unlimited addition that we will not be able to afford, but would also end inevitably in indeterminate overtreatment with substantial risks of unexpected toxic effects eating away whatever progress we might make. "Do not harm" remains the main principle in medicine. To be able to follow this rule, we need to better understand the biology of breast cancer. The mistake of "one treatment fits all" can only be changed when we critically review trial designs of adjuvant breast oncology. The risk of overtreatment is there and selection of precisely defined cohorts for phase 3 trials is necessary, despite pressure of scientific ambition, pragmatism, and demands of industry. The "add on" clinical trial design model accepts the inability to confirm that standard therapy is still necessary if a positive result from the addition of the new therapy is obtained. The same model can be applied to "extended" adjuvant treatments in breast cancer subtypes. Addition of "miraculin" to the standard of care should generate a new standard. Such trials that show a modest benefit on average at a population level take us a step away from refining care for the individual, and might support the use of multiple and costly interventions with potential short and long term side effects. It is essential to escalate treatment when necessary and to de-escalate when un-necessary.
27866726	Trends in mastectomy and reconstruction for breast cancer; a twelve year experience from a tertiary care center.	BACKGROUND: Many surgical options exist for breast cancer, including breast conserving therapy (BCT), mastectomy with reconstruction (MAST+RECON) or without reconstruction (MAST). Long-term results regarding oncologic outcomes are few and primarily retrospective studies. METHODS: A retrospective review of a prospectively collected database of patients undergoing breast surgery for breast cancer from 2002 to 2014 was performed. Patients were separated into 3 time periods for analysis: 2002 to 2005, 2006 to 2009, and 2010 to 2014. Recurrence outcomes were compared at 4 years between MAST+RECON patients. RESULTS: Two thousand seventy-six patients were identified: 61.2% underwent BCT, 19.7% had MAST, and 19.1% had MAST+RECON. BCT patients were older and had smaller tumors. MAST+RECON increased in prevalence, whereas BCT decreased. Implant-based reconstruction and conservative mastectomy rates increased over the study period. Four-year local recurrence-free rates were similar in nipple-sparing and skin-sparing mastectomy groups. CONCLUSIONS: BCT usage has decreased, trending toward immediate, nipple-sparing mastectomy, implant-based reconstruction. Surgeons should be aware of trends to optimally offer patients their surgical options.
27866680	ARLTS1, potential candidate gene in familial aggregation of hematological malignancies.	INTRODUCTION: Genetic predisposition to familial hematological malignancies was previously described through several epidemiological analyses, but the genetic basis remains unclear. The tumor-suppressor ARLTS1 gene was previously described in sporadic hematological malignancies and familial cancer context. METHODS: In this study, we sequence the ARLTS1 gene in 100 patients belonging to 88 independent Tunisian and French families. RESULTS: After gene sequencing, we report 8 genetic variations, most of which were previously reported in several cancer forms. The most common variants were W149X and C148R and were previously associated to B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia and to high-risk of familial breast cancer. CONCLUSIONS: These results emphasize the fact that ARLTS1 gene mutations can be considered as a potential predisposing factor in familial hematological malignancies and other several cancer forms.
27866212	Expression of IL-1alpha and IL-6 is Associated with Progression and Prognosis of Human Cervical Cancer.	BACKGROUND IL-1alpha and IL-6 are associated with the prognosis of a wide range of cancers, but their value in cervical cancer remains controversial. The aim of this study was to investigate the expression of IL-1alpha and IL-6 in cervical cancer and their significance in clinical prognosis. MATERIAL AND METHODS The expression of IL-1alpha and IL-6 in 105 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded cervical cancer tissues and adjacent non-tumor tissues was examined by immunohistochemistry. The results were semi-quantitatively scored and analyzed by chi-square test. Patient overall survival (OS) data was collected by follow-up and analyzed by Kaplan-Meier analysis. RESULTS The expression level of both IL-1alpha and IL-6 in cervical cancer tissue was higher than in adjacent non-tumor tissues (p<0.05). IL-1alpha expression was shown to be correlated with tumor size, FIGO histology grade, lymph node metastasis, stromal invasion, and tumor differentiation (p<0.05). IL-6 expression was shown to be correlated with tumor size, FIGO histology grade, and tumor differentiation (p<0.05). Patients with positive expression of IL-1alpha or IL-6 tended to have much shorter survival times than patients with negative expression. In addition, a multivariate Cox regression analysis demonstrated that IL-1alpha expression and lymph node metastasis were independent predictors of OS in cervical cancer patients. CONCLUSIONS The expression of IL-1alpha was significantly associated with tumor size, FIGO histology grade, lymph node metastasis, stromal invasion, and tumor differentiation. The expression of IL-6 was significantly associated with tumor size, FIGO histology grade, and tumor differentiation. Positive IL-1alpha and IL-6 expression was significantly correlated with poor prognosis. They may be considered valuable biomarkers for prognosis and potential therapeutic targets for cervical cancer.
27866092	Identify high risk estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer patients for extended endocrine therapy.	PURPOSE: To demonstrate the patterns of breast cancer-specific mortality (BCSM) in estrogen receptor (ER)-positive diseases and to identify high-risk candidates for extended endocrine therapy. METHODS: Using the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results database, we identified ER-positive patients diagnosed between 1990 and 2000 (cohort 1 [C1]) and between 2001 and 2005 (cohort 2 [C2]). The patterns of BCSM were calculated using Cox proportional hazard regression models. A risk classification model was developed, and X-tile software was used to divide patients with high BCSM rates into 3 risk groups. RESULTS: The annual BCSM rate of C2 was decreased by one-third and was maintained at 10-15 (per 1000 persons per year) from year 2 to year 10. Long-term mortality risks still persisted in C2, especially in patients with node-positive, grade 3 or T3 disease, who should be considered as "clinical-high-risk". These patients were further divided into 3 risk groups through our model: for C1, 42.2% were in the low-risk group, 38.9% in the medium-risk group, and 18.9% in the high-risk group; and for C2, 45.5% were in the low-risk group, 38.2% in the medium-risk group and 16.2% in the high-risk group (p < 0.001). The BCSM rates of the patients in each group within C2 decreased, and fewer patients in C2 were classified into the clinical high-risk group. CONCLUSION: ER-positive patients with node-positive, grade 3 or T3 diseases had sustained risks of death throughout the 10-year time frame, and our model is helpful to identify patients with high risk who are candidates for extended endocrine therapy.
27866091	A sensitivity and specificity comparison of fine needle aspiration cytology and core needle biopsy in evaluation of suspicious breast lesions: A systematic review and meta-analysis.	PURPOSE: Breast cancer detections for women with suspicious lesions mainly depend on two non-operative pathological tests-fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) and core needle biopsy (CNB). The aim of this systematic review was to compare the sensitivity and specificity of CNB and FNAC in this setting. METHODS: The data sources included MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) till February 2016. We included prospective series of studies which directly compared the accuracy of FNAC and CNB. We used forest plots to display the sensitivity and specificity of FNAC and CNB respectively. Pre-specified subgroup analyses and sensitivity analysis were conducted. RESULTS: Ultimately, 12 articles (1802 patients) were included in the final analysis. The pooled analysis shows that the sensitivity of CNB is better than that of FNAC [87% (95% CI, 84%-88%, I2 = 88.5%) versus 74% (95% CI, 72%-77%, I2 = 88.3%)] and the specificity of CNB is similar to that of FNAC [98% (95% CI, 96%-99%, I2 = 76.2%) versus 96% (95% CI, 94%-98%, I2 = 39.0%)]. For subgroup analysis, the sensitivities of both tests are better for palpable lesions than that of non-palpable lesions. Sensitivity analysis shows the robustness of the primary analysis. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that both of FNAC and CNB have good clinical performance. In similar circumstances, the sensitivity of CNB is better than that of FNAC, while their specificities are similar. FNAC could be still considered the first choice to evaluate suspicious nonpalpable breast lesions.
27866090	Relationship between anxiety disorders and domains of health related quality of life among Nigerians with breast cancer.	PURPOSE: Health Related Quality of life (HRQoL) is increasingly recognised as an important indicator of outcome and well-being in oncology care. We set out in this study to evaluate whether significant association exists between anxiety disorders (ADs) and HRQoL in breast cancer, such that any intervention addressing ADs would potentially improve HRQoL. METHODS: A cross sectional evaluation of 200 attendees of an oncology clinic was done using designed questionnaire to gather socio-demographic and clinical data. Subsequently, the Schedule for clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry was used to ascertain ADs and the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer QOL Questionnaire (THE EORTC QLQ-C30) Version 3 with its breast specific supplement (QLQ-BR-23) was used to profile HRQoL in participants. RESULTS: The mean age of participants was 49.6(+/-11.2) years, and 54% of participants had stage III and IV breast cancer. Findings on EORTC QLQ-C30 following univariate analyses showed association between ADs and poorer mean scores on global health status, functional domains including physical, emotional, social, and cognitive functions (p < 0.05). On the symptom scale, those with ADs had higher symptom load including fatigue, pain, insomnia, appetite loss, diarrhoea and financial difficulties (p < 0.05). Similarly, the QLQ-BR-23 showed correlation between ADs and poorer mean scores on breast cancer specific issues like body image, future perspectives, sexual functioning, sexual enjoyment, systemic therapy side-effects, upset by hair loss and breast symptoms (p < 0.05). Findings after controlling for age, treatment, cancer duration, recurrence and stage showed the same pattern of relationship between ADs and HRQoL; however, the global health status, cognition, sexual functioning, and higher symptom load with respect to appetite loss and financial difficulties were not independently related with ADs. CONCLUSIONS: Scaling up of oncological services, supportive care and targeted psychosocial interventions are indicated for optimal outcome of breast cancer. Longitudinal research with focus on the complex relationship between HRQoL and ADs along with their modifiable determinants across the trajectories of breast cancer is warranted.
27866089	Absence of epithelial atypia in B3-lesions of the breast is associated with decreased risk for malignancy.	INTRODUCTION: Lesions of uncertain malignant potential (B3) represent a heterogeneous group with an overall risk for malignancy of 9.85-35.1% after total resection. Positive predictive values (PPV) for malignancy vary depending on B3 subtype. The aim of this study was to evaluate the PPV for malignancy in B3 lesions and to determine the clinical significance of atypia-dependent sub-classification (a = without epithelial atypia; b = with epithelial atypia) of B3 into B3a and B3b and papillary lesions (PL) in PLa and PLb. METHODS: 219 patients with histopathologically proven B3 lesions on core needle/vacuum-assisted biopsy who subsequently underwent diagnostic excision biopsy were included in this study. PPVs for malignancy were reported for B3 in general and all B3 sub-categories. Logistic regression analysis identified associations between B3-subgroups and outcome after excision biopsy as well as the impact of clinical and diagnostic findings on excision diagnosis. RESULTS: The overall PPV rate was 10.0% (22/219). Excision histology exhibited a higher malignancy rate in PLb (2/7; PPV: 28.6%) than in PLa (6/127; PPV: 4.7%) (p = 0.057) and in B3b (12/50; PPV: 24.0%) compared to B3a category (8/165; PPV: 4.8%) (p < 0.001). DISCUSSION: These findings support the necessity of B3 lesion sub-classification into B3a and B3b and of PL into PLa and PLb when considering epithelial atypia. The determination of atypia status represents a relevant factor in risk-stratification for clinical management of B3 lesions. Should future studies using the sub-classification of PL confirm these results, observation may be a safe option for the clinical management of patients with asymptomatic PLa lesions.
27866067	Escalating and de-escalating treatment in HER2-positive early breast cancer.	The current standard adjuvant systemic treatment of early HER2-positive breast cancer consists of chemotherapy plus 12months of trastuzumab, with or without endocrine therapy. Several trials have investigated modifications of the standard treatment that are shorter and less resource-demanding (de-escalation) or regimens that aim at dual HER2 inhibition or include longer than 12months of HER2-targeted treatment (escalation). Seven randomized trials investigate shorter than 12months of trastuzumab treatment duration. The shorter durations were not statistically inferior to the 1-year duration in the 3 trials with survival results available, but 2 of the trials were small and 1 had a relatively short follow-up time of the patients at the time of reporting. The pathological complete response (pCR) rates were numerically higher in all 9 randomized trials that compared chemotherapy plus dual HER2 inhibition consisting of trastuzumab plus either lapatinib, neratinib, or pertuzumab with chemotherapy plus trastuzumab as neoadjuvant treatments, but the superiority of chemotherapy plus dual HER2-inhibition over chemotherapy plus trastuzumab remains to be demonstrated in the adjuvant setting. One year of adjuvant trastuzumab was as effective as 2years of trastuzumab in the HERA trial, and was associated with fewer side-effects. Extending 1-year adjuvant trastuzumab treatment with 1year of neratinib improved disease-free survival in the ExteNET trial, but the patient follow-up times are still short, and no overall survival benefit was reported. Several important trials are expected to report results in the near future and may modify the current standard.
27865259	Web based survivorship interventions for women with breast cancer: An integrative review.	PURPOSE: Breast cancer survivors' experience a range of negative sequelae post-treatment including depression, anxiety, physical side effects from treatment, sexuality concerns and decreased quality of life. Survivorship care is recommended by the IOM to meet the post treatment needs of survivors but implementation is variable and barriers to delivery such as time and resource restraints have been identified. Web-based interventions may be a way to overcome some barriers to providing quality survivorship care that is efficacious, cost efficient and convenient. The purpose of this integrative review is to summarize and synthesize the current research on web-based interventions for breast cancer survivorship care and evaluate the data to determine potential implications for practice. METHODS: The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were used to guide this integrative review. Key search terms included breast cancer, survivor, intervention, web, internet and technology. Articles evaluating web-based survivorship interventions (n = 405) for early stage breast cancer patients who completed active therapy were included. RESULTS: Fifteen studies met inclusion criteria: six randomized controlled trials, six survey based studies, one qualitative study, one retrospective chart review and one mixed methods study. Studies evaluating cognitive behavioral therapy provided the strongest data. Other studies evaluated exercise and lifestyle interventions, symptom management programs and pilot/exploratory work. Findings suggest that web-based survivorship interventions are feasible and acceptable to breast cancer survivors. CONCLUSIONS: Web-based survivorship interventions have the potential to meet the needs of breast cancer survivors while possibly overcoming some of the documented barriers to survivorship care implementation.
27865258	Preparing young people for future decision-making about cancer risk in families affected or at risk from hereditary breast cancer: A qualitative interview study.	PURPOSE: Women carrying the mutated BRCA gene, have approximately an 80% life-time risk of developing breast cancer with 50% risk of their children inheriting the gene mutation. Many parents find it difficult to know when and how to disclose this information to their children and how such disclosure might affect their child's future decision-making. METHOD: This study explored the communication of genetic risk information in families using qualitative semi-structured interviews conducted with parents, children (7-11years) and young people (12-18years) affected or at risk from a BRCA gene mutation. Thematic analysis was applied to coded transcripts producing four themes; family communication, perception of cancer risks, risk management strategies and impact of genetic risk communication in children and young people's decision making. RESULTS: Twenty-seven individuals from 11 families took part, recruited through purposive sampling techniques. Cancer risk caused by a BRCA gene mutation induced a sense of fear in parents about their children's future. As a result, parents with hereditary breast cancer disclosed limited information about the risks associated with prophylactic surgery and/or the psychological and emotional impacts of surgery on body image. This had implications to children and young people's perceptions of prophylactic procedures, which were already influenced by cultural understandings of the 'desirable body' and increasing acceptance and proliferation cosmetic surgery. CONCLUSION: Lack of risk management information and the acculturation of cosmetic surgery combined to limit children and young people's understanding of the impact of hereditary breast cancer; reducing their ability to actualise the physiological, psychological and emotional consequences of surgery.
27865255	Recommendations for symptom management in women with vulvar neoplasms after surgical treatment: An evidence-based guideline.	PURPOSE: To develop an evidence-based guideline for nurses and other health care professionals involved in pre- and postsurgical care of women with vulvar cancer (VC) or vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN). METHODS: This evidence-based guideline was developed according to six domains of the methodological framework AGREE II. Literature research with focus on cancer care, symptom management and self-management/counselling was conducted from April to August 2013 in the databases CINAHL, Cochrane Library, PsycINFO, PubMed as well as in 14 international guideline databases. Interdisciplinary experts (n = 14) were involved in the development of the guideline from December 2013 to January 2014. This guideline is currently tested in the WOMAN-PRO II RCT (Clinical Trial No: NCT01986725). RESULTS: For the definition of recommendations, five guidelines, one meta-analysis, two systematic reviews and two randomized controlled trials were included. In total, 24 recommendations were formulated to answer 22 clinical questions based on patients' perspective and experts' opinion. Evidence ranged from 3.5 to 5 (3.5 = weak evidence and/or clinical relevance, 5 = best evidence and/or clinical relevance). The recommendations were subsumed under different themes regarding physical, psychological and psychosocial aspects. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical practice guideline developed in this study firstly provides recommendations for symptom management issues focusing on self-management interventions for women with VC or VIN. As an interdisciplinary guideline it should be used in addition to the existing medical guideline in the German speaking context.
27865134	Polychromatic light (480-3400nm) similar to the terrestrial solar spectrum without its UV component in post-surgical immunorehabilitation of breast cancer patients.	To this day, two methods of phototherapy (PT) have been successfully used in post-surgical immunorehabilitation of patients with breast cancer (BC): intravenous laser irradiation of the patients' blood and reinfusion of lympholeukosuspension of BC patients after single irradiation with HeNe laser. The objective of this pilot experimental study was to verify the effectiveness of the percutaneous use of polychromatic visible light combined with polychromatic infrared (pVIS+pIR) radiation similar to the major components of natural solar spectrum in post-surgical management of BC patients. Patients with BC (adenocarcinoma) of I-II stages, n=19 who had undergone mastectomy, were divided into 2 groups. The control group of patients (n=8) underwent a conventional course of post-surgical rehabilitation and sham irradiation. Patients of the PT group (n=11) additionally received 7days of daily treatment with polychromatic light on the sacral area, D=15cm. The PT course began on the day after mastectomy (Bioptron-2 device; Switzerland, 480-3400nm, 95% polarization, 40mW/cm2, 24J/cm2). Mastectomy produced many changes in cellular and humoral immunity, which was recorded on the 1st and 8th post-surgical days. The PT course resulted in a faster normalization of post-surgical leukocytosis and activation of cytotoxic CD8+ T-lymphocytes (Lym), reduced the elevated concentration in blood of immune complexes and in parallel promoted cytotoxic activity of CD16+/CD56+ NK-cells. The PT up-regulated the number of NK-cells in patients with its decrease on the 1st post-surgical day and prevented the decrease in the amount of monocytes, CD19+ B-Lym, CD3+ T-Lym, CD4+ T-helpers, activated CD3+/HLADR+ T-Lym, and the decrease of the phagocytotic capability of neutrophils. PT blocked the down-regulation of the IgM, IgA concentration and abnormally sharp increase of the proinflammatory cytokine IFN-gamma content. Therefore, a 7-day course with polychromatic light prevented the development of immunosupression in the BC patients at the early post-mastectomy period.
27864890	Anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies enhance sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents in BRCA1-mutated and PTEN-wild-type triple-negative breast cancer cells.	Increased epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is recognized as a promising therapeutic target, specifically through the use of selective EGFR inhibitors combined with chemotherapies. TNBC is characterized by genetic instability that leads to increased sensitivity to cytotoxic agents. We analyzed the effect of anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies (mAbs; cetuximab and panitumumab) in combination with chemotherapeutic agents (docetaxel, cisplatin, and epirubicin) on EGFR-expressing TNBC cell lines that have different mutation statuses for one oncogene (KRAS) and two tumor suppressor genes (PTEN and BRCA1). Both mAbs failed to improve the cytotoxic effect of chemotherapies in the KRAS mutant cell line (MDA-MB-231) and PTEN-null cell lines (HCC-1937 and MDA-MB-468). In contrast, mAbs combined with DNA-damaging agents (cisplatin or epirubicin) had a synergistic effect in the BRCA1-mutant cell line SUM-1315 (wild-type KRAS and PTEN). The reintroduction of wild-type BRCA1 into SUM-1315 cells abolished this synergism. The improved effect of combination therapy was associated with cell cycle arrest at G1 phase and inhibition of the phosphorylation of EGFR and ERK1/2 proteins. These results suggest that patients with BRCA1-associated TNBC without genetic alterations in the PTEN and KRAS genes may have improved therapeutic responses to anti-EGFR mAbs combined with DNA-damaging agents.

27864624	Sentinel lymph node biopsy using indocyanine green fluorescence in early-stage breast cancer: a meta-analysis.	Sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy using indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence is safe and has a high detection rate for SLNs. However, the results of this novel technique are heterogeneous. The objective of this meta-analysis was to evaluate the diagnostic performance of the ICG fluorescence method compared with the standard radioisotope (RI) method. All eligible studies were identified from 2005 through 2015. A proportion meta-analysis was performed using a fixed effects and/or random effects model based on the study heterogeneity. A total of 12 studies met the inclusion criteria and included 1736 women. There was no significant difference between ICG fluorescence and RI for SLN detection using either the fixed effects model [odds ratio (OR) 1.29, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.87-1.90] or the random effects model (OR 1.32, 95% CI 0.54-3.18). There were seven studies reporting the detection rate for tumor-positive SLN. The ICG fluorescence method was significantly better than the RI method in the fixed effects model (OR 1.87, 95% CI 1.00-3.49) for staging axilla. However, there was no difference in the random effects model (OR 1.90, 95% CI 0.74-4.86). There was study outcome heterogeneity for the detection of SLN but not for tumor-positive SLN. There was no publication bias observed in the studies included. The ICG fluorescence method has valid diagnostic performance for SLN detection and shows a trend toward better axilla staging compared with the RI method. ICG fluorescence is a useful alternative to RI for SLN biopsy.
27864602	Beyond bread and beer: whole cell protein extracts from baker's yeast as a bulk source for 3D cell culture matrices.	Here, we present a novel approach to form hydrogels from yeast whole cell protein. Countless hydrogels are available for sophisticated research, but their fabrication is often difficult to reproduce, with the gels being complicated to handle or simply too expensive. The yeast hydrogels presented here are polymerized using a four-armed, amine reactive crosslinker and show a high chemical and thermal resistance. The free water content was determined by measuring swelling ratios for different protein concentrations, and in a freeze-drying approach, pore sizes of up to 100 mum in the gel could be created without destabilizing the 3D network. Elasticity was proofed to be adjustable with the help of atomic force microscopy by merely changing the amount of used protein. Furthermore, the material was tested for possible cell culture applications; diffusion rates in the network are high enough for sufficient supply of human breast cancer cells and adenocarcinomic human alveolar basal epithelial cells with nutrition, and cells showed high viabilities when tested for compatibility with the material. Furthermore, hydrogels could be functionalized with RGD peptide and the optimal concentration for sufficient cell adhesion was determined to be 150 muM. Given that yeast protein is one of the cheapest and easiest available protein sources and that hydrogels are extremely easy to handle, the developed material has highly promising potential for both sophisticated cell culture techniques as well as for larger scale industrial applications.
27864452	Identifying progression predictors of breast ductal carcinoma in situ.	Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) refers to neoplastic epithelial cells proliferating within the mammary ducts of the breast, which have not breached the basement membrane nor invaded surrounding tissues. Traditional thinking holds that DCIS represents an early step in a linear progression towards invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC). However, as only approximately half of DCIS cases progress to IDC, important questions around the key determinants of malignant progression need to be answered. Recent studies have revealed that molecular differences between DCIS and IDC cells are not found at the genomic level; instead, altered patterns of gene expression and post-translational regulation lead to distinct transcriptomic and proteomic profiles. Therefore, understanding malignant progression will require a different approach that takes into account the diverse tumour cell extrinsic factors driving changes in tumour cell gene expression necessary for the invasive phenotype. Here, we review the roles of the tumour stroma (including mesenchymal cells, immune cells and the extracellular matrix) and myoepithelial cells in malignant progression and make a case for a more integrated approach to the study and assessment of DCIS and its progression, or lack thereof, to invasive disease.
27863838	Resveratrol enhances the efficacy of sorafenib mediated apoptosis in human breast cancer MCF7 cells through ROS, cell cycle inhibition, caspase 3 and PARP cleavage.	Despite advances in diagnosis and treatment options, breast cancer is one of the main causes of cancer related death among women worldwide. Present study is aimed to preliminarily evaluate our hypothesis that the combination of resveratrol (RSV), a natural antioxidant, and lower dose of sorafenib (SF), a multi-kinase inhibitor and a component of ERK1/2 (extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2) pathway, would augment apoptosis in human breast cancer MCF7 cells. MCF7 cellexpressions s were treated with RSV, SF and their combination. MTT (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl] -2, 5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide) assay, DNA fragmentation assay, Hoechst33342, H2DCFDA (2', 7'-Dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate), Rhodamine123 staining, and Western Blot to detect different signaling protein expressions, were conducted to test the hypothesis. Combination of RSV and SF showed higher cytotoxicity on MCF7 cells than their individual treatment. Results from morphology change, Hoechst33342 staining, and DNA fragmentation suggested higher apoptosis data in the combinational treatment. Intracellular ROS (reactive oxygen species) levels, p53 and Bax/Bcl2 expressions, and decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential were also higher in the combinational treatment. Up-regulation of apaf-1, cl. caspase 9, cl. caspase 3 and cl. PARP (poly (ADP-Ribose) polymerase) were also noticed, while the expressions of cyclinD1 and cyclinB1 were decreased in the combinational group. The increase in apoptosis and signaling protein expressions with RSV and SF combinational treatment were increased over time. The combination of RSV and lower dose of SF at 6muM showed enhanced apoptotic activity than SF alone. Therefore, RSV can be considered as a neo-adjuvant to improve SF efficacy in breast cancer treatment.
27863726	[MET receptor inhibition: Hope against resistance to targeted therapies?]	Overcoming the drug resistance remains a crucial issue in cancer treatment. For refractory patients, the use of MET receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors seems to be hopeful. Indeed, important mechanisms underlying drug resistance argue for association of MET inhibitors with targeted therapies, both on first-line to prevent a primary resistance and on the second line to overcoming acquired resistance. Indeed, met gene amplification is the second most common alteration involved in acquired resistance to anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) therapies in non-small cells lung cancer (NSCLC). Hypoxia, for its part, can activate MET transcription and amplifies HGF signaling resulting in MET activation, which could be involved in vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitors escape. In HER2 positive breast cancers, MET amplification may also induce tumor cells a hatch escape, resulting in secondary resistance. Finally, some patients with BRAF mutated melanoma exhibit primary resistance to BRAF inhibition by stromal HGF (ligand of MET) secretion resulting in MET receptor activation. Experimental data highlight the role of MET in primary and secondary resistance and encourage combined treatments including MET inhibitors. In this context, several promising clinical trials are in progress in numerous cancers (NSCLC, melanoma, breast cancer, glioblastoma...) using combination of anti-MET and other specific therapies targeting EGFR, BRAF, VEGF or HER2. This review summarizes the potential benefits that MET inhibition should provide to patients with cancer refractory to targeted therapies.
27863718	The impact of immediate breast reconstruction after mastectomy on time to first adjuvant treatment in women with breast cancer in a community setting.	BACKGROUND: The impact of immediate breast reconstruction on the time to first adjuvant therapy is controversial. METHODS: Retrospective study design comparing time to first treatment in women undergoing mastectomy with and without immediate reconstruction in a community cancer center. RESULTS: Seventy-six cases fit inclusion criteria of which 44 (58%) underwent mastectomy with immediate reconstruction. Women undergoing immediate reconstruction were younger, had more bilateral mastectomies and had fewer prior breast procedures. The median time to first adjuvant therapy was longer in the immediate reconstruction group [80.5days (36-343) versus 53.5 days (18-96), p = 0.003]. Fifteen of 44 patients had the start of adjuvant treatment over 90 days after resection, 14 of whom (93%) had immediate reconstruction versus 1 (7%) who did not (p = 0.01). CONCLUSION: In this study immediate breast reconstruction was associated with a longer time to first adjuvant treatment, with adjuvant therapies being more likely delayed over 90 days.
27863565	Molecular Imaging and Precision Medicine in Breast Cancer.	Precision medicine, basing treatment approaches on patient traits and specific molecular features of disease processes, has an important role in the management of patients with breast cancer as targeted therapies continue to improve. PET imaging offers noninvasive information that is complementary to traditional tissue biomarkers, including information about tumor burden, tumor metabolism, receptor status, and proliferation. Several PET agents that image breast cancer receptors can visually demonstrate the extent and heterogeneity of receptor-positive disease and help predict which tumors are likely to respond to targeted treatments. This review presents applications of PET imaging in the targeted treatment of breast cancer.
27863287	Bone health in the elderly cancer patient: A SIOG position paper.	More than a third of cancers are diagnosed in people over the age of 75. Androgen deprivation for prostate cancer and aromatase inhibitors in breast cancer accelerate age-related bone loss and increase fracture rates. BMD should be checked by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry at baseline and, dependent on risk, every 12-24months. Sufficient calcium, vitamin D and exercise are part of primary fracture prevention. Resistance exercise in particular may improve functional activity and bone density. In men at increased fracture risk and women with postmenopausal early breast cancer, antiresorptive treatment is warranted to reduce fracture rate and to increase overall survival in breast cancer. Bone metastases (BM) are common in breast and prostate cancer and lytic bone lesions typical of multiple myeloma. They can cause fractures, pain and spinal cord compression, require surgery or radiation for symptom relief, and lead to hypercalcaemia. Multidisciplinary working with patients and carers can improve quality of life for elderly patients with BM and mitigate the adverse consequences of therapy. Bisphosphonates and other osteoclast inhibitors such as denosumab reduce this morbidity, improve quality of life and reduce pain. Especially in the elderly, attention should be paid to renal function and to risk factors for osteonecrosis with bone-modifying agents. Attention should also be paid to hypocalcaemia risk, which can be considerable in elderly men with metastatic prostate cancer and vitamin D deficiency. We urgently need further research specifically directed at assessing risks and benefits of bone targeted treatments in the growing population of elderly cancer patients.
27862697	ZFP36L2 promotes cancer cell aggressiveness and is regulated by antitumor microRNA-375 in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.	Due to its aggressive nature, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the most lethal and hard-to-treat malignancies. Recently developed targeted molecular strategies have contributed to remarkable improvements in the treatment of several cancers. However, such therapies have not been applied to PDAC. Therefore, new treatment options are needed for PDAC based on current genomic approaches. Expression of microRNA-375 (miR-375) was significantly reduced in miRNA expression signatures of several types of cancers, including PDAC. The aim of the present study was to investigate the functional roles of miR-375 in PDAC cells and to identify miR-375-regulated molecular networks involved in PDAC aggressiveness. The expression levels of miR-375 were markedly downregulated in PDAC clinical specimens and cell lines (PANC-1 and SW1990). Ectopic expression of miR-375 significantly suppressed cancer cell proliferation, migration and invasion. Our in silico and gene expression analyses and luciferase reporter assay showed that zinc finger protein 36 ring finger protein-like 2 (ZFP36L2) was a direct target of miR-375 in PDAC cells. Silencing ZFP36L2 inhibited cancer cell aggressiveness in PDAC cell lines, and overexpression of ZFP36L2 was confirmed in PDAC clinical specimens. Interestingly, Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed that high expression of ZFP36L2 predicted shorter survival in patients with PDAC. Moreover, we investigated the downstream molecular networks of the miR-375/ZFP36L2 axis in PDAC cells. Elucidation of tumor-suppressive miR-375-mediated PDAC molecular networks may provide new insights into the potential mechanisms of PDAC pathogenesis.
27862328	Primary giant cell tumor of the female breast: a diagnostic red herring with therapeutic implications.	Primary giant cell tumor of the female breast is extremely rare. Major diagnostic difficulty is encountered not only by the surgeon but also by the radiologist and pathologist. Pathologically, it is similar to the bone and soft tissue counterparts. However, this is not always true. We describe a patient presenting clinically as cystosarcoma phyllodes and histopathological examination revealed a primary giant cell tumor which was confirmed by immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy. Interestingly, an intimate relationship between the mononuclear component of the tumor cells with eosinophils and mast cells was observed electron microscopically.
27862063	Comparative expression analysis of hypoxia-inducible factor-alpha and its natural occurring antisense in breast cancer tissues and adjacent noncancerous tissues.	Hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) have been shown to be upregulated in tumor tissues and linked with tumor progression and metastasis in breast cancer. Among regulatory mechanisms for HIF expression is a natural occurring antisense named aHIF, which has been shown to be overexpressed in breast cancer and influence the level of the HIF-1alpha transcript. In the present study, we analyzed the expression of HIF-1alpha and aHIF in breast cancer tissues versus adjacent noncancer tissues (ANCTs) in relation with the clinical and biological behavior of the tumors. aHIF has been shown to be expressed in 67.4% of invasive ductal carcinoma samples, while none of ANCTs showed its expression. HIF-1alpha has been expressed in all of tumors and 90% of ANCTs. Comparison of HIF-1alpha expression level between tumor and ANCT tissues showed a total upregulation in tumor samples. No statistically significant association has been found between the level of HIF-1alpha expression in tumor samples and clinicopathologic and demographic characteristics such as age, tumor size, estrogen receptor status, progesterone receptor status, HER2/neu expression level, lymph node status, histological grade, and stage except for a weak correlation between HIF-1alpha expression and Ki-67 status. Besides, we could not detect any significant correlation between relative expression of HIF-1alpha and aHIF in tumor samples. Collectively, these data suggest that aHIF overexpression can be used as a potential biomarker in breast cancer. However, further studies are needed for the evaluation of its mechanism of action in regulation of HIF-1alpha expression in different pathological conditions. HIF-1alpha overexpression results in the upregulation of several genes that participated in cancer-associated pathways such as proliferation, angiogenesis, and glucose metabolism. We showed that HIF-1alpha is upregulated in breast tumor samples compared with adjacent noncancerous tissues. Its expression has been associated with Ki-67 status. Its natural occurring antisense is only expressed in tumor tissues. Thus, it can be used as a potential biomarker in breast cancer.
27861907	Factors predictive of failure to complete planned intraoperative breast radiation using the intrabeam(R) system.	PURPOSE: Intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT) is a form of breast irradiation that is delivered in a single session at the time of partial mastectomy. In up to 10% of patients, planned IORT is not completed; this leads to wasted resources and decreased patient satisfaction. Our objective was to evaluate factors associated with failure to complete planned IORT. METHODS AND MATERIALS: An IRB-approved review of planned IORT cases from 2011 to 2015 was conducted. Eligibility criteria included: age >/=60, invasive ductal or mammary carcinoma, tumor <3.0 cm, ER positive, and clinically node negative. Discontinuation of planned IORT was at the discretion of the breast surgical and radiation oncologists. RESULTS: Twenty-one (15%) of one hundred and forty-five planned IORT cases were not completed. Reasons for failure to complete IORT included inadequate applicator to skin distance (n = 15, 71%), altered wire localization findings the day of surgery (n = 4, 19%), equipment failure (n = 1, 5%), and hemodynamic instability (n = 1, 5%). Significant surgeon variability was associated with failure to complete planned IORT (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Insufficient skin-to-applicator spacing is the most common reason for failure to complete IORT. In this series, higher volume surgeons completed a greater proportion of IORT cases, suggesting a learning curve to patient selection or intraoperative technique. J. Surg. Oncol. 2016;114:930-932.

27861385	Novel technique for laparoscopic harvesting of latissimus dorsi flap with prosthesis implantation for breast reconstruction: A preliminary study with 2 case reports.	BACKGROUD: An important drawback of the traditional technique for harvesting latissimus dorsi (LD) myocutaneous flap is a long, posterior donor-site incision. Current techniques involve endoscopic or robotic harvesting via a combined approach of open and closed surgery, which necessitates an open axillary incision and the use of special retractors. In this paper, we introduce a fully enclosed laparoscopic technique for harvesting LD flap (LDF) using only 3 small trocar ports. This technique eliminates the need for axillary and donor-site incisions and specialized retractors and considerably reduces the incision size. METHODS: We performed laparoscopic harvesting of LDF with prosthesis implantation for immediate breast reconstruction (IBR) after nipple-sparing mastectomy in 2 patients with malignant breast neoplasm who wished to avoid a long scar on the back. RESULTS: IBR using this technique was uneventful in both cases, without any donor-site complications or flap failure. Both patients were satisfied with the esthetic results of the procedure, especially the absence of a visible scar on the back. CONCLUSION: Enclosed laparoscopic harvesting of LDF is simpler and less invasive than the traditional methods. These preliminary results warrant further evaluation in a larger population to validate the benefits of this technique.
27861384	Trends of triple negative breast cancer research (2007-2015): A bibliometric study.	BACKGROUND: Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive breast cancer subtype. However, there have been limited data to evaluate the trend of TNBC research. This study aims to investigate the trend of TNBC research and compare the contribution of research from different regions, organizations, and authors. METHODS: TNBC-related publications from 2007 to 2015 were retrieved from the Web of Science database. Excel 2013 (Redmond, Washington, USA), GraphPad Prism 5 (GraphPad Prism Software Inc., San Diego, CA), and VOSviewer (Leiden University, Leiden, Netherlands) software were used to analyze the trend of TNBC research. This article does not contain any studies with human participants or animals performed by any of the authors. RESULTS: A total of 1695 papers were identified and were cited 34,078 times with a time limit of May 27, 2016. The United States accounted for 43.10% of the articles, 57.59% of the citations, and the highest H-index (64). China ranked second in total number of articles, but seventh in citation frequency (1998) and ninth in H-index (21). The journal Breast Cancer Research and Treatment had the highest number of publications. The author, Narod SA, has published the most papers in this field (30). The keyword "receptor" was mentioned the most, 1489 times, and the word "myeloid cell leukemia-1 (MCL-1)" was the latest hot spot by 2015. CONCLUSION: Literature growth related to TNBC is expanding rapidly in recent years. The quality of the articles from China still requires improvement. Newest progress of the TNBC research may be released by the journal Breast Cancer Research and Treatment first. Narod SA, Gonzalez-Angulo AM, and Hortobagyi GN may be good candidates for collaborative research in this field. MCL-1 is an emerging topic that should be closely observed.
27860535	Is There an Association Between Bone Mineral Density and Mammographic Density? A Systematic Review.	INTRODUCTION: Both bone mineral density (BMD) and breast density are related to reproductive hormone levels. This suggests that BMD and breast density could be meaningfully associated, and serve as surrogate markers for breast cancer risk. However, few studies have investigated the association of BMD with percent mammographic density, making it difficult to draw meaningful conclusions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of studies published in electronic databases till April 2016 using the following search terms: "bone density," "bone mineral density," "mammographic breast density," "breast density," and "mammographic density." We identified 203 articles, of which 8 met the inclusion criteria for this review. RESULTS: BMD does not appear to be associated with percent mammographic density. BMD at the spine was weakly positively associated with percent mammographic density among postmenopausal women who were not hormone users, while BMD at the hip and legs was positively associated with percent mammographic density among premenopausal women. On the other hand, one study reported an inverse association of BMD at the spine and hip with percent mammographic density among perimenopausal women. CONCLUSION: In this review, we found no evidence of an association between BMD and percent mammographic density.
27859969	FOXP1 enhances tumor cell migration by repression of NFAT1 transcriptional activity in MDA-MB-231 cells.	Until now, forkhead box P1 (FOXP1) has been identified as a tumor suppressor in several correlation studies in breast cancer. Although FOXP1 is defined as a transcriptional repressor that interacts with other transcription factors in various mechanistic studies, there is no study that explains its repressor functions in breast cancer biology. This study demonstrated the repressor function of FOXP1 on nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT1) and the migratory effect of this repression in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed for the investigation of protein-protein interaction between two transcription factors. Protein-protein interaction on DNA was investigated with EMSA and transcriptional effects of FOXP1 on NFAT1, luciferase reporter assay was performed. Wound healing assay was used to analyze the effects of overexpression of FOXP1 on tumor cell migration. This study showed that FOXP1 has protein-protein interaction with NFAT1 on DNA and enhances breast cancer cell migration by repressing NFAT1 transcriptional activity and FOXP1 shows oncogenic function by regulating breast cancer cell motility.
27859423	From obesity to cancer: a review on proposed mechanisms.	Nowadays, obesity is considered as a serious and growing global health problem. It is documented that the overweight and obesity are major risk factors for a series of noncommunicable diseases, and in recent years, the obesity-cancer link has received much attention. Numerous epidemiological studies have shown that obesity is associated with increased risk of several cancer types, including colon, breast, endometrium, liver, kidney, esophagus, gastric, pancreatic, gallbladder, and leukemia, and can also lead to poorer treatment. We review here the epidemiological and experimental evidences for the association between obesity and cancer. Specifically, we discuss potential mechanisms focusing how dysfunctional angiogenesis, chronic inflammation, interaction of proinflammatory cytokines, endocrine hormones, and adipokines including leptin, adiponectin insulin, growth factors, estrogen, and progesterone and strikingly, cell metabolism alteration in obesity participate in tumor development and progression, resistance to chemotherapy, and targeted therapies such as antiangiogenic and immune therapies.
27859312	Nomogram for predicting central node metastasis in papillary thyroid carcinoma.	BACKGROUND: There was a difficulty for detecting Central lymph node metastasis (CLNM) in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) patients. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to design a nomogram for predicting CLNM. METHODS: A total of 10,763 PTC patients who underwent total thyroidectomy with central neck dissection (CND) in Samsung Medical Center were randomly assigned to the training set (n = 7,535) and to the internal validation set (n = 3,228). And, a total of 2,514 PTC patients who underwent total thyroidectomy with CND at Seoul National University Hospital were assigned to the external validation set. RESULTS: The values of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve in the training set, internal validation set, and external validation set were 0.721 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.709-0.732), 0.706 (95%CI, 0.688-0.724), and 0.706 (95%CI, 0.685-0.727), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: We recommend the use of our nomogram to enable clinicians and patients to easily personalize and quantify the probability of CLNM during the both pre- and postoperative period. Clinicians may consider the prophylactic CND and meticulous postoperative evaluation in PTC patients with a high nomogram score. J. Surg. Oncol. 2017;115:266-272. (c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
27858906	Combination of 125I brachytherapy and chemotherapy for unresectable recurrent breast cancer: A retrospective control study.	Recurrent breast cancer remains an incurable malignancy and cannot be removed by surgery in the majority of cases. This study aimed to explore the feasibility and efficacy of the combination of I brachytherapy and chemotherapy for the treatment of unresectable recurrent breast cancer. Patients with unresectable recurrent breast cancer treated between January 2011 and December 2014 with a combination of I brachytherapy and capecitabine or gemcitabine were evaluated and outcomes were compared with those of women treated with capecitabine or gemcitabine in conventional dose as a monotherapy. Of 61 patients evaluated, 28 received the combination treatment and 33 received capecitabine or gemcitabine monotherapy. The combination of I brachytherapy and chemotherapy resulted in a significant improvement in progression-free survival versus capecitabine or gemcitabine monotherapy (median, 17.8 vs 11.4 months; hazard ratio [HR], 0.44; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.23-0.84; P = 0.013). The objective response rate (ORR) was significantly higher with the combination (82.1%) than with monotherapy (54.5%; P = 0.022), and the rate of pain relief was higher in the combination arm (100% vs 73.6%; P = 0.038). There was no significant improvement for overall survival (median, 30.1 vs 27.2 months; HR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.47-1.44; P = 0.496). There were no serious complications detected during the follow-up period, any grade toxicities were comparable between treatment arms. In conclusion, the combination of I brachytherapy and second-line chemotherapy is superior to chemotherapy alone and is an effective and safe therapy for unresectable recurrent breast cancer. However, further investigation and much larger scale randomized controlled trials with long-term follow-up are needed.
27858896	Application of the downgrade criteria to supplemental screening ultrasound for women with negative mammography but dense breasts.	We investigated whether the application of the downgrade criteria to supplemental screening ultrasound (US) for women with negative mammography but dense breasts can reduce the rate of Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) categories 3 to 4a without a loss of cancer detection.This retrospective study was approved by the Institutional Review Board, and the need to obtain informed consent was waived. A total of 3171 consecutive women (978 women, 1173 women, and 1020 women in the first, second, and third year, respectively) with negative mammography but dense breast who underwent radiologist-performed, hand-held supplemental screening US from March 2010 to February 2013 were included. Downgrade criteria for BI-RADS category 2 were complicated cysts </=5 mm observed as circumscribed, homogeneous, and hypoechoic lesions and circumscribed oval-shaped solid masses </=5 mm. Changes in the distribution of BI-RADS category, biopsy rate, and cancer detection yield over 3 years were analyzed. Performances of less-experienced (12 fellows with <2 years of experience) and experienced (3 staffs with >12 years of experience) radiologists were compared. Outcomes of initial examinations (prevalence screening) and noninitial examinations (incidence screening) were compared.Application of the downgrade criteria reduced BI-RADS categories 3 to 4a in both less-experienced (from 39.4% to 16.0%, P < 0.001) and experienced radiologists (from 22.6% to 11.1%, P < 0.001) over 3 years. Biopsy rates also significantly decreased from 6.5% to 2.4% (P < 0.001). Cancer detection yield of supplemental screening US was 2.8 per 1000 examinations (9 of 3171: 2 ductal carcinoma in situ and 7 invasive cancers). There were no differences in cancer detection yield per each year (P = 0.539). There was no interval cancer. In noninitial examinations, BI-RADS categories 3 to 4a rates, biopsy rates, and cancer detection rates were lower compared to initial examinations.Application of the downgrade criteria reduced BI-RADS categories 3 to 4a without a loss of cancer detection. We suggest that our downgrade criteria can be used to reduce the false positive rate in the supplemental screening US. Further large-scale, multicenter, prospective studies are needed to validate the effectiveness of the downgrade criteria.
27858895	Awareness of primary spontaneous hemorrhagic angiosarcoma of the breast associated with Kasabach-Merritt syndrome in a pregnant woman by enhanced magnetic resonance imaging: A CARE-compliant case report.	INTRODUCTION: Primary breast angiosarcoma with spontaneous intratumoral bleeding associating with Kasabach-Merritt Syndrome is rarely reported. CASE FINDINGS/PATIENT CONCERNS: We herein present such a case in a 30-year-old pregnant woman who was initially diagnosed to hemangioma at her early gestation. However, the sudden rapid tumor growth was aware of the attention and intended for receiving the breast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging. DIAGNOSES AND INTERVENTIONS: The dynamic MRI enhancement showed inhomogenous enhancement at the periphery of the lobulated tumor on both early and delayed scans, otherwise a large hematoma was revealed at the center. Surgical resection was performed after baby delivery by Caeserean section, and histopathologic study confirmed breast angiosarcoma. CONCLUSION: Despite its rarity, clinicians should recognize the association of breast angiosacroma with Kasabach-Merritt Syndrome with suggestive finding of enhanced MRI in order to decide the surgical approach.
27858873	Dexrazoxane improves cardiac autonomic function in epirubicin-treated breast cancer patients with type 2 diabetes.	OBJECTIVE: The study objective was to investigate the protective effects of dexrazoxane (DRZ) on the cardiac autonomic nervous system (ANS) activity in anthracycline-treated breast cancer patients with diabetes. METHODS: A total of 110 early stage breast cancer patients with type 2 diabetes were divided randomly into 2 even groups: chemotherapy alone (Chemo) and chemotherapy + DRZ (Chemo + DRZ). All patients underwent adjuvant chemotherapy (80 mg/m epirubicin and 500 mg/m cyclophosphamide) for a total of 6 cycles with 21 days/cycle. The Chemo + DRZ group patients were treated intravenously with 800 mg/m DRZ 30 minutes prior to the administration of epirubicin, while the Chemo group patients were given saline. The cardiac ANS function was evaluated for each patient before and after 6 cycles of chemotherapy by resting heart rate (RHR) and heart rate variability (HRV), which was evaluated by both time and frequency domains. RESULTS: Before and after chemotherapy, patients in both groups showed significant decreases in HRV indices and increases in RHR and the low-frequency/high-frequency ratio. There were no significant differences between Chemo and Chemo + DRZ groups in terms of RHR and HRV indices before chemotherapy; however, after chemotherapy, patients in the Chemo group had a higher average RHR and lower HRV indices compared with patients in the Chemo + DRZ group. CONCLUSION: DRZ protects the cardiac ANS in epirubicin-treated early stage breast cancer patients with diabetes.
27858859	Risk factors of trastuzumab-induced cardiotoxicity in breast cancer: A meta-analysis.	BACKGROUND: Trastuzumab targets the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 oncogene and in combination with first-line therapy results in significantly improved survival outcomes and has thus become standard of care in both adjuvant and metastatic settings. While it is estimated that 1% to 4% of patients treated with trastuzumab will develop heart failure and approximately 10% will experience a reduction in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), the patient risk factors associated with trastuzumab-induced cardiotoxicity (TIC) are unclear. This meta-analysis aims to consolidate previously published data to identify the risk factors most likely leading to TIC. METHODS: A search of the MEDLINE literature database using the keywords trastuzumab/Herceptin, risk factors, outcomes, cardiac, cardiotoxicity, cardiomyopathy, LVEF, and chemotherapy was performed. Only prospective/retrospective human studies were included, with additional studies excluded if they reported baseline LVEF > 68%, a cohort of <50 patients, or results that were not stratified based on cardiotoxic events. Pooled odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for each potential risk factor were calculated, with heterogeneity of data and samples explored using random-effects modeling. RESULTS: Data were collected from 17 articles, capturing 6527 patients. Hypertension (OR 1.61, 95% CI 1.14-2.26; P < 0.01), diabetes (OR 1.62; 95% CI 1.10-2.38; P < 0.02), previous anthracycline use (OR 2.14; 95% CI 1.17-3.92; P < 0.02), and older age (P = 0.013) were all shown to be associated with TIC. CONCLUSION: Cardiac performance should be closely monitored in women treated with trastuzumab. Recognizing potential risk factors along with careful attention to symptoms/LVEF measurements could minimize the occurrence of TIC in this population.
27858847	Drug-related genetic polymorphisms affecting severe chemotherapy-induced neutropenia in breast cancer patients: A hospital-based observational study.	Chemotherapy-induced neutropenia (CIN) is one of the major adverse events that necessitate chemotherapy dose reduction. This study aimed to evaluate the association between grade 4 neutropenia and genetic polymorphisms in breast cancer patients. In this genetic polymorphism association study, peripheral blood samples from 100 consecutive breast cancer outpatients, between August 2012 and September 2014, treated with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (AC) combination chemotherapy were genotyped for polymorphisms in adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette subfamily B member 1 (ABCB1), cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme-coding genes (CYP2B6 and CYP3A5), glutathione S-transferase (GST), and excision repair cross-complementing 1 (ERCC1). Associations between grade 4 neutropenia and genotypes as well as risk factors were examined using multivariate logistic regression. From 100 patients, 32.0% had grade 4 neutropenia. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that ERCC1 118C > T (odds ratio [OR], 3.43; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.22-9.69; P = 0.020), CYP2B6*6 (OR, 4.51; 95% CI, 1.21-16.95; P = 0.025), body mass index (BMI) (OR, 6.94; 95% CI, 1.15-41.67; P = 0.035), and baseline white blood cell (WBC) count (OR, 2.99; 95% CI, 1.06-8.40; P = 0.038) were significant predictors of grade 4 neutropenia. ERCC1 and CYP2B6 gene polymorphisms were associated with the extent of grade 4 neutropenia in patients receiving AC chemotherapy. In addition to previously known risk factors, BMI and WBC counts, ERCC1 and CYP2B6 gene polymorphisms were also identified as independent strong predictors of grade 4 neutropenia.
27858093	Targeted intraoperative radiotherapy tumour bed boost during breast-conserving surgery after neoadjuvant chemotherapy.	INTRODUCTION: The use of targeted intraoperative radiotherapy (TARGIT-IORT) as a tumour bed boost during breast-conserving surgery (BCS) for breast cancer has been reported since 1998. We present its use in patients undergoing breast conservation following neoadjuvant therapy (NACT). METHOD: In this retrospective study involving 116 patients after NACT we compared outcomes of 61 patients who received a tumour bed boost with IORT during lumpectomy versus 55 patients treated in the previous 13 months with external (EBRT) boost. All patients received whole breast radiotherapy. Local recurrence-free survival (LRFS), disease-free survival (DFS), distant disease-free survival (DDFS), breast cancer mortality (BCM), non-breast cancer mortality (NBCM) and overall mortality (OS) were compared. RESULTS: Median follow up was 49 months. The differences in LRFS, DFS and BCM were not statistically significant. The 5year Kaplan-Meier estimate of OS was significantly better by 15% with IORT: IORT 2 events (96.7%, 95%CI 87.5-99.2), EBRT 9 events (81.7%, 95%CI 67.6-90.1), hazard ratio (HR) 0.19 (0.04-0.87), log rank p = 0.016, mainly due to a reduction of 10.1% in NBCM: IORT 100%, EBRT 89.9% (77.3-95.7), HR (not calculable), log rank p = 0.015. The DDFS was as follows: IORT 3 events (95.1%, 85.5-98.4), EBRT 12 events (69.0%, 49.1-82.4), HR 0.23 (0.06-0.80), log rank p = 0.012. CONCLUSION: IORT during lumpectomy after neoadjuvant chemotherapy as a tumour bed boost appears to give results that are not worse than external beam radiotherapy boost. These data give further support to the inclusion of such patients in the TARGIT-B (boost) randomised trial that is testing whether IORT boost is superior to EBRT boost.
27856352	Internal mammary sentinel lymph node biopsy in clinical practice.	Almost all recent studies confirmed internal mammary sentinel lymph node biopsy (IM-SLNB) as an accurate and valuable technique to determine stage, prognosis, and best treatment option in breast cancer patients. Decision about local treatment of internal mammary lymph nodes (IMLN) is still being made based on Axillary lymph node (ALN) status. According to study results, there will be patients in positive ALN subgroup who just face complications of an unnecessary radiation to IMLNs and there will be patients in negative ALN subgroup who do not receive adjuvant radiation therapy they really need, if we insist to continue planning IMLN treatment based on ALN status. It seems that patients with bonafide drainage to IMLNs will benefit from IM-SLNB regardless of their ALN status.
27856279	The ROS-mediated activation of STAT-3/VEGF signaling is involved in the 27-hydroxycholesterol-induced angiogenesis in human breast cancer cells.	Breast cancer (BC) is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality among females worldwide, and angiogenesis plays a crucial role in BC progression. 27-Hydroxycholesterol (27HC) is an endogenous selective estrogen receptor modulator, which promotes the growth and metastasis of BC. Here, we further found that, 27HC improved the angiogenic ability of BC in a VEGF-dependent manner. For the molecular mechanisms, on one hand, as an estrogen-like factor, 27HC enhanced the expression of VEGF by the classical ERalpha/VEGF signaling in ER-positive BC cells; on the other hand, in both ER-positive and ER-negative BC cells, 27HC enhanced the generation of ROS, which in turn activated the STAT-3/VEGF signaling in an ER independent manner. Either blocking the generation of ROS or knockdown of STAT-3 attenuated the 27HC-induced autocrine of VEGF and angiogenesis. These findings not only suggested a mechanism whereby 27HC enhanced the angiogenesis, but also helped to recognize the 27HC as a novel potential harmful factor in BC, especially in the menopause patients.
27855392	The Emerging Roles of Long Noncoding RNA ROR (lincRNA-ROR) and its Possible Mechanisms in Human Cancers.	To date, there is only up to 2% of protein-coding genes that are stably transcribed, whereas the vast majority are non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs). These ncRNAs, also known as non-messenger RNAs (nmRNAs) or functional RNAs (fRNAs), include transfer RNAs, ribosomal RNAs, microRNAs and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). With the advance of high-resolution microarrays and massively parallel sequencing technology, lncRNAs have gained extended attentions nowadays and are found to play important roles in tumorigenesis and progression of human cancers. Long intergenic non-protein coding RNA, regulator of reprogramming (linc-ROR), was first discovered in induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), where it was controlled by the key pluripotency factors Oct4, Sox2 and Nanog. Linc-ROR has been shown to be dysregulated in many types of cancers, including breast cancer (BC), pancreatic cancer (PC), hepatocellular cancer (HCC), endometrial cancer (EC), and nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Also, linc-ROR functions as regulatory molecule in a large amount of biological processes. However, the underlying mechanisms of its contribution to carcinogenesis remain to be elucidated. In this review, we will emphasize on the characteristics of linc-ROR and their roles in different types of human cancers.
27855345	Overexpression and enhanced specific activity of aldoketo reductases (AKR1B1 & AKR1B10) in human breast cancers.	The incidence of breast cancer in India is on the rise and is rapidly becoming the primary cancer in Indian women. The aldoketo reductase (AKR) family has more than 190 proteins including aldose reductase (AKR1B1) and aldose reductase like protein (AKR1B10). Apart from liver cancer, the status of AKR1B1 and AKR1B10 with respect to their expression and activity has not been reported in other human cancers. We studied the specific activity and expression of AKR1B1 and AKR1B10 in breast non tumor and tumor tissues and in the blood. Fresh post-surgical breast cancer and non-cancer tissues and blood were collected from the subjects who were admitted for surgical therapy. Malignant, benign and pre-surgical chemotherapy samples were evaluated by histopathology scoring. Expression of AKR1B1 and AKR1B10 was carried out by immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry (IHC) while specific activity was determined spectrophotometrically. The specific activity of AKR1B1 was significantly higher in red blood cells (RBC) in all three grades of primary surgical and post-chemotherapy samples. Specific activity of both AKR1B1 and AKR1B10 increased in tumor samples compared to their corresponding non tumor samples (primary surgical and post-chemotherapy). Immunoblotting and IHC data also indicated overexpression of AKR1B1 in all grades of tumors compared to their corresponding non tumor samples. There was no change in the specific activity of AKR1B1 in benign samples compared to all grades of tumor and non-tumors.
27854300	One Pot Single Step Synthesis and Biological Evaluation of Some Novel Bis(1,3,4-thiadiazole) Derivatives as Potential Cytotoxic Agents.	A novel series of bis(1,3,4-thiadiazole) derivatives were synthesized in one step methodology with good yields by condensation reaction between bis-hydrazonoyl chloride 1 and various reagents. The structures of the prepared compounds were confirmed by spectral data (IR, NMR, and MS), and elemental analysis. The anticancer activity against human breast carcinoma (MCF-7) cancer cell lines was evaluated in MTT assay. The results revealed that the bis-thiadiazole derivatives 5c,d, 7b,c and 9c had higher antitumor activity than the standard drug Imatinib.
27854074	Resveratrol and its methoxy derivatives modulate the expression of estrogen metabolism enzymes in breast epithelial cells by AhR down-regulation.	Our earlier studies have shown that compared to resveratrol, its analogs with ortho-methoxy substituents exert stronger antiproliferative and proapoptotic activity. Since estrogens are considered the major risk factors of breast carcinogenesis, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of 3,4,2'-trimethoxy (3MS), 3,4,2',4'-tetramethoxy (4MS), and 3,4,2',4',6'-pentamethoxy (5MS) trans-stilbenes on the constitutive expression of the enzymes involved in estrogen metabolism, as well as receptors: AhR and HER2 in breast epithelial cell line MCF10A. The results showed different effect of resveratrol and its methoxy derivatives on the expression of genes encoding key enzymes of estrogen synthesis and catabolism. Resveratrol at the doses of 1 and 5 micromol/L increased the level of CYP19 transcript and protein level, while 5MS reduced mRNA transcript of both CYP19 and STS genes. Resveratrol and all its derivatives reduced also SULT1E1 mRNA transcript level. The reduced expression of AhR, CYP1A1, and 1B1 was also found as a result of treatment with these compounds. The most significant changes were found in the case of AhR. The most potent inhibitor of CYP1A1 and 1B1 genes expression was 5MS, which reduced the levels of mRNA transcript and protein of both CYPs from 31 to 89% of the initial levels. These results indicate that methoxy derivatives of resveratrol might be efficient modulators of estrogen metabolism. Moreover, the number of methoxy groups introduced to stilbene structure may play a certain role in this effect.
27854072	SH003 enhances paclitaxel chemosensitivity in MCF-7/PAX breast cancer cells through inhibition of MDR1 activity.	Paclitaxel is an anti-cancer drug for treating cancer, but paclitaxel resistance is reported in cancer cells. Multidrug resistance (MDR) is related with the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) mechanism, which plays a key role in cancer metastasis. Moreover, EMT mechanism is connected to tamoxifen resistance in breast cancer cells. Consequently, oncologists are interested in finding new MDR1 inhibitors originating from herbal medicines to have less side-effect. Here, we investigated an inhibition effect of SH003 on MDR1 activity in paclitaxel-resistant MCF-7/PAX breast cancer cells. Our results showed that paclitaxel did not inhibit a proliferation in paclitaxel-resistant MCF-7 breast cancer cells. Paclitaxel-resistant MCF-7 cells showed an increase of MDR1 activity, which was confirmed by measuring an amount of accumulated rhodamine 123 in the cells. Also, qRT-PCR and Western blot assays confirmed that paclitaxel-resistant MCF-7 cells exhibited high MDR1 expression level. Furthermore, paclitaxel-resistant MCF-7 cells showed mesenchymal morphology with alterations of EMT markers, and acquired tamoxifen resistance with a decrease of ERalpha expression. We also found that a combinatorial treatment of SH003 and paclitaxel in paclitaxel-resistant MCF-7 cells caused apoptosis in synergistic manner, which was due to SH003 inhibition of MDR1 expression. Therefore, SH003 could be a potential agent for overcoming MDR in drug-resistant cancer cells.
27854030	Simple oxygraphic analysis for the presence of adenylate kinase 1 and 2 in normal and tumor cells.	The adenylate kinase (AK) isoforms network plays an important role in the intracellular energy transfer processes, the maintenance of energy homeostasis, and it is a major player in AMP metabolic signaling circuits in some highly-differentiated cells. For this purpose, a rapid and sensitive method was developed that enables to estimate directly and semi-quantitatively the distribution between cytosolic AK1 and mitochondrial AK2 localized in the intermembrane space, both in isolated cells and tissue samples (biopsy material). Experiments were performed on isolated rat mitochondria or permeabilized material, including undifferentiated and differentiated neuroblastoma Neuro-2a cells, HL-1 cells, isolated rat heart cardiomyocytes as well as on human breast cancer postoperative samples. In these samples, the presence of AK1 and AK2 could be detected by high-resolution respirometry due to the functional coupling of these enzymes with ATP synthesis. By eliminating extra-mitochondrial ADP with an excess of pyruvate kinase and its substrate phosphoenolpyruvate, the coupling of the AK reaction with mitochondrial ATP synthesis could be quantified for total AK and mitochondrial AK2 as a specific AK index. In contrast to the creatine kinase pathway, the AK phosphotransfer pathway is up-regulated in murine neuroblastoma and HL-1 sarcoma cells and in these malignant cells expression of AK2 is higher than AK1. Differentiated Neuro-2a neuroblastoma cells exhibited considerably higher OXPHOS capacity than undifferentiated cells, and this was associated with a remarkable decrease in their AK activity. The respirometric method also revealed a considerable difference in mitochondrial affinity for AMP between non-transformed cells and tumor cells.
27853869	Survival of de novo stage IV breast cancer patients over three decades.	BACKGROUND: De novo stage IV breast cancer patients (BCIV) depict a clinical picture not influenced by adjuvant therapy. Therefore, the time-dependent impact of changes in diagnostics and treatments on progression and survival can best be evaluated in this subgroup. METHODS: BCIV patients from 1978 to 2013 registered in the Munich Cancer Registry were divided into four periods, and the trends were analysed. Survival was estimated by Kaplan-Meier methods, and prognostic factors were fitted with Cox proportional hazard models. RESULTS: Between 1978 and 2013, 88,759 patients were diagnosed with 92,807 cases of invasive and non-invasive BC. Of these patients, 4756 patients had distant metastases (MET) at diagnosis. The 5-year survival rate improved from 17.4 to 24.7%, while the pattern of metastases did not change. Improved staging diagnostics, a screening programme and primary systemic therapy changed the composition of prognostic strata. Patients with a similar composition as the 1978-1987 cohort exhibited a median survival difference of 13 months; however, neither univariate nor multivariate analysis showed a survival effect for the four periods as a surrogate indicator for changing treatments. HER2+ patients have with 27.6 months a slightly longer survival than all other BCIV patients. CONCLUSIONS: Survival of de novo BCIV has only modestly improved since the late 1970s, partially masked by changing distributions of prognostic factors due to changes in diagnostics.
27853365	Gene-silencing effects of anti-survivin siRNA delivered by RGDV-functionalized nanodiamond carrier in the breast carcinoma cell line MCF-7.	Nanodiamond (ND) is a renowned material in nonviral small interfering RNA (siRNA) carrier field due to its unique physical, chemical, and biological properties. In our previous work, it was proven that ND could deliver siRNA into cells efficiently and downregulate the expression of desired protein. However, synthesizing a high-efficient tumor-targeting carrier using ND is still a challenge. In this study, a novel carrier, NDCONH(CH2)2NH-VDGR, was synthesized for siRNA delivery, and its properties were characterized with methods including Fourier transform infrared spectrometry, transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, gel retardation assay, differential scanning calorimetry, confocal microscopy, releasing test, real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), flow cytometry, cytotoxicity assay, and gene-silencing efficacy assay in vitro and in vivo. The mechanism of NDCONH(CH2)2NH-VDGR/survivin-siRNA-induced tumor apoptosis was evaluated via flow cytometer assay using Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate/propidium iodide staining method. The NDCONH(CH2)2NH-VDGR/survivin-siRNA nanoparticle with 60-110 nm diameter and 35.65+/-3.90 mV zeta potential was prepared. For real-time PCR assay, the results showed that the expression of survivin mRNA was reduced to 46.77%+/-6.3%. The expression of survivin protein was downregulated to 48.49%+/-2.25%, as evaluated by ELISA assay. MTT assay showed that NDCONH(CH2)2NH-VDGR/survivin-siRNA had an inhibitory effect on MCF-7 cell proliferation. According to these results, the survivin-siRNA could be delivered, transported, and released stably, which benefits in increasing the gene-silencing effect. Therefore, as an siRNA carrier, NDCONH(CH2)2NH-VDGR was suggested to be used in siRNA delivery system and in cancer treatments.
27852524	Targeting DNA Flap Endonuclease 1 to Impede Breast Cancer Progression.	DNA flap endonuclease 1 (FEN1) plays critical roles in maintaining genome stability and integrity by participating in both DNA replication and repair. Suppression of FEN1 in cells leads to the retardation of DNA replication and accumulation of unrepaired DNA intermediates, resulting in DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) and apoptosis. Therefore, targeting FEN1 could serve as a potent strategy for cancer therapy. In this study, we demonstrated that FEN1 is overexpressed in breast cancers and is essential for rapid proliferation of cancer cells. We showed that manipulating FEN1 levels in cells alters the response of cancer cells to chemotherapeutic drugs. Furthermore, we identified a small molecular compound, SC13 that specifically inhibits FEN1 activity, thereby interfering with DNA replication and repair in vitro and in cells. SC13 suppresses cancer cell proliferation and induces chromosome instability and cytotoxicity in cells. Importantly, SC13 sensitizes cancer cells to DNA damage-inducing therapeutic modalities and impedes cancer progression in a mouse model. These findings could establish a paradigm for the treatment of breast cancer and other cancers as well.
27852288	The clinical association of programmed cell death protein 4 (PDCD4) with solid tumors and its prognostic significance: a meta-analysis.	BACKGROUND: Programmed cell death protein 4 (PDCD4) is a novel tumor suppressor protein involved in programmed cell death. Its association with cancer progression has been observed in multiple tumor models, but evidence supporting its association with solid tumors in humans remains controversial. This study aimed to determine the clinical significance and prognostic value of PDCD4 in solid tumors. METHODS: A systematic literature review was performed to retrieve publications with available clinical information and survival data. The eligibility of the selected articles was based on the criteria of the Dutch Cochrane Centre proposed by the Meta-analysis Of Observational Studies in Epidemiology group. Pooled odds ratios (ORs), hazard ratios (HRs), and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for survival analysis were calculated. Publication bias was examined by Begg's and Egger's tests. RESULTS: Clinical data of 2227 cancer patients with solid tumors from 23 studies were evaluated. PDCD4 expression was significantly associated with the differentiation status of head and neck cancer (OR 4.25, 95% CI 1.87-9.66) and digestive system cancer (OR 2.87, 95% CI 1.84-4.48). Down-regulation of PDCD4 was significantly associated with short overall survival of patients with head and neck (HR: 3.44, 95% CI 2.38-4.98), breast (HR: 1.86, 95% CI 1.36-2.54), digestive system (HR: 2.12, 95% CI 1.75-2.56), and urinary system cancers (HR: 3.16, 95% CI 1.06-9.41). CONCLUSIONS: The current evidence suggests that PDCD4 down-regulation is involved in the progression of several types of solid tumor and is a potential marker for solid tumor prognoses. Its clinical usefulness should be confirmed by large-scale prospective studies.
27852187	Prevention of breast cancer.	Modifiable lifestyle factors may reduce the risk of developing breast cancer. Obesity is associated particularly with post-menopausal breast cancer. Diet is important, and exercise equivalent to running for up to 8 hours each week reduces the risk of breast cancer, both in its own right and through reducing obesity. Alcohol consumption may be responsible for 5.8% of breast cancers in Australia and it is recommended to reduce this to two standard drinks per day. Drinking alcohol and smoking increases the risk for breast cancer and, therefore, it is important to quit tobacco smoking. Prolonged use of combined oestrogen and progesterone hormone replacement therapy and oral contraceptives may increase breast cancer risk and this must be factored into individual decisions about their use. Ionising radiation, either from diagnostic or therapeutic radiation or through occupational exposure, is associated with a high incidence of breast cancer and exposure may be reduced in some cases. Tamoxifen chemoprevention may reduce the incidence of oestrogen receptor positive cancer in 51% of women with high risk of breast cancer. Uncommon but serious side effects include thromboembolism and uterine cancer. Raloxifene, which can also reduce osteoporosis, can be used in post-menopausal women and is not associated with the development of uterine cancer. Surgical prophylaxis with bilateral mastectomy and salpingo-oophorectomy can reduce the risk of breast cancer in patients carrying BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations. For preventive treatments, mammographic screening can identify other women at high risk.
27852186	Supportive care of women with breast cancer: key concerns and practical solutions.	Patients diagnosed with breast cancer may have supportive care needs for many years after diagnosis. High quality multidisciplinary care can help address these needs and reduce the physical and psychological effects of breast cancer and its treatment. Ovarian suppression and extended endocrine therapy benefits are associated with vasomotor, musculoskeletal, sexual and bone density-related side effects. Aromatase inhibitor musculoskeletal syndrome is a common reason for treatment discontinuation. Treatment strategies include education, exercise, simple analgesia and a change to tamoxifen or another aromatase inhibitor. Chemotherapy-induced alopecia may be a constant reminder of breast cancer to the patient, family, friends, acquaintances and even strangers. Alopecia can be prevented in some patients using scalp-cooling technology applied at the time of chemotherapy infusion. The adverse impact of breast cancer diagnosis and treatment on sexual wellbeing is under-reported. Identification of physical and psychological impacts is needed for implementation of treatment strategies. Fear of cancer recurrence reduces quality of life and increases distress, with subsequent impact on role functioning. Identification and multidisciplinary management are key, with referral to psychosocial services recommended where indicated. The benefits of exercise include reduced fatigue, better mental health and reduced musculoskeletal symptoms, and may also include reduced incidence of breast cancer recurrence. Identification and management of unmet supportive care needs are key aspects of breast cancer care, to maximise quality of life and minimise breast cancer recurrence.
27852183	Trends in cancer incidence and survival for Indigenous and non-Indigenous people in the Northern Territory.	OBJECTIVE: To assess trends in cancer incidence and survival for Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians in the Northern Territory. DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of population-based cancer registration data. SETTING: New cancer diagnoses in the NT, 1991-2012. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Age-adjusted incidence rates; rate ratios comparing incidence in NT Indigenous and non-Indigenous populations with that for other Australians; 5-year survival; multivariable Poisson regression of excess mortality. RESULTS: The incidence of most cancers in the NT non-Indigenous population was similar to that for other Australians. For the NT Indigenous population, the incidence of cancer at several sites was much higher (v other Australians: lung, 84% higher; head and neck, 325% higher; liver, 366% higher; cervix, 120% higher). With the exception of cervical cancer (65% decrease), incidence rates in the Indigenous population did not fall between 1991-1996 and 2007-2012. The incidence of several other cancers (breast, bowel, prostate, melanoma) was much lower in 1991-1996 than for other Australians, but had increased markedly by 2007-2012 (breast, 274% increase; bowel, 120% increase; prostate, 116% increase). Five-year survival was lower for NT Indigenous than for NT non-Indigenous patients, but had increased for both populations between 1991-2000 and 2001-2010. CONCLUSION: The incidence of several cancers that were formerly less common in NT Indigenous people has increased, without a concomitant reduction in the incidence of higher incidence cancers (several of which are smoking-related). The excess burden of cancer in this population will persist until lifestyle risks are mitigated, particularly by reducing the extraordinarily high prevalence of smoking.
27852125	Standardized Extract from Caesalpinia spinosa is Cytotoxic Over Cancer Stem Cells and Enhance Anticancer Activity of Doxorubicin.	Cancer stem cells (CSC) are the primary cell type responsible for metastasis and relapse. ABC-transporters are integral membrane proteins involved in the translocation of substrates across membranes protecting CSC from chemotherapeutic agents. A plant extract derived from C. spinosa (P2Et) previously investigated for its antitumor activity has been shown to reduce lung and spleen metastasis in mice that have been transplanted with breast cancer cells, suggesting that P2Et has a significant activity against cancer stem cells (CSC). P2Et extract was thoroughly characterized by HPLC/MS. The cytotoxicity of P2Et extract was evaluated using a MTT assay in human and murine cell lines with different profiles of resistance, by Pgp overexpression or by enrichment in cancer stem cells. The synergistic effect of P2Et with doxorubicin was evaluated in vitro in several cell lines and in vivo in mice transplanted with TS/A cells, a highly resistant cell line and enriched in CD44[Formula: see text]CD24[Formula: see text]CSC. The chromatographic fingerprint of P2Et extract revealed 13 gallotannins. We also found that P2Et extract was cytotoxic to cells regardless of their resistant phenotype. Similarly, complementary activities were observed as drug efflux reversion and antioxidant activity. Short-treatment with P2Et extract, revealed a synergistic effect with doxorubicin in resistant cell lines. In vivo the P2Et increases mice survival in a TS/A breast cancer model associated with augmentation of calreticulin expression. Our results suggest that P2Et treatment could be used as adjuvant along with conventional chemotherapy to treat tumors with a MDR phenotype or with high frequency of CSC.
27848916	Tumoral heterogeneity of breast cancer.	The objective of this literature review is to describe the types of tumor heterogeneity in breast cancer and their clinical implication. Two kinds of tumor heterogeneity are described: intertumor heterogeneity and intra-tumor heterogeneity. In breast cancer, inter-tumor heterogeneity was best characterized in the 2000s thanks to high throughput analyses. These analyzes resulted in a molecular classification of breast cancers distinguishing four subtypes: Luminal A, Luminal B, HER 2+ and basal like. This variability may be observed between the primary tumor and metastases, namely the temporal intratumor heterogeneity. The average discrepancy for the progesterone receptor, estrogen, and between HER2 status appears to be 33%, 20% and 8%, respectively. It is then interesting to study the heterogeneity within the primary tumor: this spatial intra-tumor heterogeneity is poorly known. Physiopathology of intra-tumor heterogeneity light be deciphered by studies on cancer stem cells and clonal evolution model. In addition, the tumor microenvironment seems to actively contribute to this heterogeneity. The major interest to study this heterogeneity is the clinical implication that could result. While precision medicine is emerging, it is important to capture the heterogeneity of each specific tumor type. These new biological knowledge will allow us to anticipate such heterogeneity and individualize the management of breast cancer.
27847817	Automatic Detection of Pectoral Muscle Region for Computer-Aided Diagnosis Using MIAS Mammograms.	The computer-aided detection (CAD) systems have been developed to help radiologists with the early detection of breast cancer. This system provides objective and accurate information to reduce the misdiagnosis of the disease. In mammography, the pectoral muscle region is used as an index to compare the symmetry between the left and right images in the mediolateral oblique (MLO) view. The pectoral muscle segmentation is necessary for the detection of microcalcification or mass because the pectoral muscle has a similar pixel intensity as that of lesions, which affects the results of automatic detection. In this study, the mammographic image analysis society database (MIAS, 322 cases) was used for detecting the pectoral muscle segmentation. The pectoral muscle was detected by using the morphological method and the random sample consensus (RANSAC) algorithm. We evaluated the detected pectoral muscle region and compared the manual segmentation with the automatic segmentation. The results showed 92.2% accuracy. We expect that the proposed method improves the detection accuracy of breast cancer lesions using a CAD system.
27847402	Autoantibody Response to ZRF1 and KRR1 SEREX Antigens in Patients with Breast Tumors of Different Histological Types and Grades.	Purpose. To investigate a frequency of antibody response to SEREX-identified medullary breast carcinoma autoantigens ZRF1 and KRR1 in sera of breast cancer patients taking into account clinical and molecular characteristics of tumors for opening of new perspectives in creation of minimally invasive immunological tests for cancer diagnostics. Methods. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and bioinformatics analysis. Results. Increased frequency of antibody response was found in sera of breast cancer patients to ZRF and KRR1 antigens. The antibody response to these antigens was higher in sera of patients with invasive ductal carcinoma than in sera of patients with other histological types of breast tumors. Moreover, more frequent antibody response to ZRF antigen was found in sera of patients with less aggressive tumors. The sequence analysis of ZRF1 antigen SEREX clones obtained from cDNA libraries of different tumors demonstrates that they encode different protein isoforms. Conclusion. Tumor-associated antigens KRR1 and ZRF1 and their cognate autoantibodies could be considered as potential molecular markers of breast cancer which need to be further investigated.
27847287	PET/CT with 18F-FDG predicts short-term outcome in stage II/III breast cancer patients upstaged to N2/3 nodal disease.	INTRODUCTION: 18F-FDG PET/CT has high positive predictive value for the detection of avid lymph node metastases in breast cancer patients. We analysed the effect of upstaging lymph nodes by PET/CT on short-term outcome in stage II/III breast cancer patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 278 stage II/III primary breast cancer patients (mean age 48.9 years, range 19-75 years) were re-staged with 18F-FDG PET/CT before start of pre-operative systemic treatment (PST). Patients were divided in three groups based on risk for local recurrence: a low - (T2N0), intermediate - (T0-2N1 and T3N0) and a high-risk group (T0-3N2-3, T3N1 and T4). Within these groups we looked at local recurrence-free survival (LRFS), recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) within the first 3 years of follow-up. RESULTS: With a median follow-up (FU) of 50 months the RFS, LRFS and OS were 87%, 88% and 92% respectively for the whole group. PET/CT upstaged 43 patients from the low- and intermediate risk group to the high-risk group, based on detection of >/=4 avid axillary nodes or occult N2/3-disease. Patients upstaged with PET/CT had more events for all three analyses compared to the original risk groups, which resulted in a significantly worse RFS (69.8%; p = 0.03) a nearly significantly worse LRFS (p = 0.052) and no effect in OS (p = 0.433). DISCUSSION: Additional PET/CT staging allows breast cancer patients to be treated according to the true stage, still stage II/III breast cancer patients upstaged to N2/3 by PET/CT have worse short-term outcome, despite adjustment of treatment, than patients staged high-risk with conventional imaging.
27847208	Synthesis and Characterization of Chrysin-loaded PCL-PEG-PCL nanoparticle and its effect on breast cancer cell line.	BACKGROUND: Nano-therapy exhibit the potential of revolutionizing cancer therapy. This field introduces nanovectors/nanocarriers for anticancer drugs targeted delivery, and also finds application in imaging. Chrysin, a natural flavonoid, was recently studied as having important biological roles in chemical defenses, nitrogen fixation, anti-inflammatory, and anti-oxidant properties. We aim at studying the effect of nano-chrysin on breast cancer cell line. METHODS: The effect of chrysin loaded PCL-PEG-PCL was studied on T47D breast cancer cell line. The structure and drug-loading of chrysin were characterized using 1H NMR, FT-IR and SEM. The in vitro cytotoxicity of pure and nano-chrysin was tested by the MTT assay. Gene expression of FTO, hTERT, and BRCA1 were evaluated using Real-time PCR. RESULTS: Data analysis from MTT assay showed that chrysin has a time-dependent cytotoxic effect on T47D cell line. Furthermore, the results of Real-time PCR suggested that encapsulated chrysin have higher antitumor effect on gene expression of FTO, BRCA1 and hTERT than free chrysin. CONCLUSION: Combined nano-chrysin therapy will not only improve cancer cell cytotoxicity, but also be a complementary and potential complex in breast cancer therapy.
