28420331	Arsenic treatment increase Aurora-A overexpression through E2F1 activation in bladder cells.	BACKGROUND: Arsenic is a widely distributed metalloid compound that has biphasic effects on cultured cells. In large doses, arsenic can be toxic enough to trigger cell death. In smaller amounts, non-toxic doses may promote cell proliferation and induces carcinogenesis. Aberration of chromosome is frequently detected in epithelial cells and lymphocytes of individuals from arsenic contaminated areas. Overexpression of Aurora-A, a mitotic kinase, results in chromosomal instability and cell transformation. We have reported that low concentration (<==1 muM) of arsenic treatment increases Aurora-A expression in immortalized bladder urothelial E7 cells. However, how arsenic induces carcinogenesis through Aurora-A activation remaining unclear. METHODS: Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) staining, MTT assay, and flow cytometry assay were conducted to determine cell proliferation. Messenger RNA and protein expression levels of Aurora-A were detected by reverse transcriptional-PCR and Western blotting, respectively. Centrosome of cells was observed by immunofluorescent staining. The transcription factor of Aurora-A was investigated by promoter activity, chromosome immunoprecipitation (ChIP), and small interfering RNA (shRNA) assays. Mouse model was utilized to confirm the relationship between arsenic and Aurora-A. RESULTS: We reveal that low dosage of arsenic treatment increased cell proliferation is associated with accumulated cell population at S phase. We also detected increased Aurora-A expression at mRNA and protein levels in immortalized bladder urothelial E7 cells exposed to low doses of arsenic. Arsenic-treated cells displayed increased multiple centrosome which is resulted from overexpressed Aurora-A. Furthermore, the transcription factor, E2F1, is responsible for Aurora-A overexpression after arsenic treatment. We further disclosed that Aurora-A expression and cell proliferation were increased in bladder and uterus tissues of the BALB/c mice after long-term arsenic (1 mg/L) exposure for 2 months. CONCLUSION: We reveal that low dose of arsenic induced cell proliferation is through Aurora-A overexpression, which is transcriptionally regulated by E2F1 both in vitro and in vivo. Our findings disclose a new possibility that arsenic at low concentration activates Aurora-A to induce carcinogenesis.
28410686	Relations between doses cumulated in bone marrow and dose delivery techniques during radiation therapy of cervical and endometrial cancer.	PURPOSE: To compare normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) and average doses in the bone marrow (BM), obtained for five different radiotherapy delivery and planning strategies of cervical and endometrial cancer. MATERIAL/METHODS: 50 patients were taken to analysis. For each case, 3 different dose delivery techniques were used: 4-field, X15MV, 3DCRT; 7-field, X6MV, IMRT; and 2-arc, X6MV, VMAT. Two optimization scenarios were used for the IMRT and VMAT plans generation: with (+) and without (-) the inclusion of the BM as an optimized structure. Average doses and dose-volume histogram parameters for the PTV, BM, bladder, rectum, bowels and femoral heads were compared. In addition, the BM doses were analyzed with respect to the PTV and/or volume of the BM, and NTCP for the BM were computed. RESULTS: The dose in PTV for evaluated plans was similar. The worst doses in organs at risk were obtained for 3DCRT. Using the BM during the optimization of IMRT and VMAT reduces an average dose in BM without increasing the doses in the bladder, rectum and bowels. Differences between doses in BM for IMRT(+) and VMAT(+) plans were similar while NTCP was lower for VMAT(+). A correlation between average dose in BM and the volume ratio of BM and PTV was found for each technique. CONCLUSION: Using the BM during the optimization of the IMRT and VMAT plans effectively reduces the dose in BM without increasing the dose in the bladder, rectum and bowels. The VMAT(+) plans were characterized by the lowest NTCP.
28410684	Knowledge-based treatment planning: An inter-technique and inter-system feasibility study for prostate cancer.	PURPOSE: Helical Tomotherapy (HT) plans were used to create two RapidPlan knowledge-based (KB) models to generate plans with different techniques and to guide the optimization in a different treatment planning system for prostate plans. Feasibility and performance of these models were evaluated. MATERIAL AND METHODS: two sets of 35 low risk (LR) and 30 intermediate risk (IR) prostate cancer cases who underwent HT treatments were selected to train RapidPlan models. The KB predicted constraints were used to perform new 20KB plans using RapidArc technique (KB-RA) (inter-technique validation), and to optimise 20 new HT (KB-HT) plans in the Tomoplan (inter-system validation). For each validation modality, KB plans were benchmarked with the manual plans created by an expert planner (EP). RESULTS: RapidPlan was successfully configured using HT plans. The KB-RA plans fulfilled the clinical dose-volume requirements in 100% and 92% of cases for planning target volumes (PTVs) and organs at risk (OARs), respectively. For KB-HT plans these percentages were found to be a bit lower: 90% for PTVs and 86% for OARs. In comparison to EP plans, the KB-RA plans produced higher bladder doses for both LR and IR, and higher rectum doses for LR. KB-HT and EP plans produced similar results. CONCLUSION: RapidPlan can be trained to create models by using plans of a different treatment modality. These models were suitable for generating clinically acceptable plans for inter-technique and inter-system applications. The use of KB models based on plans of consolidated technique could be useful with a new treatment modality.
28409437	Prognostic significance of PD-L1 expression on tumor cells and tumor-infiltrating mononuclear cells in upper tract urothelial carcinoma.	Immunotherapy targeting the programmed death-1 (PD-1) receptor/PD-1 ligand (PD-L1) pathway has shown promising results in several malignancies. However, the prognostic significance of PD-L1 expression remains unknown in patients with upper tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC). This study aimed to evaluate PD-L1 expression and its association with clinicopathological characteristics and oncological outcomes in UTUC patients. PD-L1 expression on tumor cells and tumor-infiltrating mononuclear cells (TIMCs), and E-cadherin and N-cadherin expression on tumor cells were assessed by immunohistochemistry in a cohort of 162 patients with UTUC. Associations of PD-L1 expression on tumor cells and TIMCs with clinicopathological characteristics and cancer-specific survival (CSS) were evaluated. Out of 162 patients, 20 (12.3%) and 35 (21.6%) had positive PD-L1 expression on tumor cells and TIMCs, respectively. Decreased E-cadherin expression was associated with PD-L1 positivity on tumor cells (P = 0.048) and PD-L1 negativity on TIMCs (P = 0.033). PD-L1 expression on tumor cells was higher in patients with preoperative chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 4-5 than in those with no CKD or CKD stage 1-3 (P = 0.011). PD-L1 was differentially expressed in tumor cells and TIMCs in UTUC. Multivariate analyses revealed that PD-L1 expression on tumor cells independently predicted shorter CSS (P = 0.012), whereas PD-L1 expression on TIMCs independently predicted longer CSS (P = 0.034).
28406993	Topical and systemic immunoreaction triggered by intravesical chemotherapy in an N-butyl-N-(4-hydroxybutyl) nitorosamine induced bladder cancer mouse model.	Intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) treatment is the most common therapy to prevent progression and recurrence of non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). Although the immunoreaction elicited by BCG treatment is well documented, those induced by intravesical treatment with chemotherapeutic agents are much less known. We investigated the immunological profiles caused by mitomycin C, gemcitabine, adriamycin and docetaxel in the N-butyl-N-(4-hydroxybutyl) nitrosamine (BBN)-induced orthotopic bladder cancer mouse model. Ninety mice bearing orthotopic bladder cancer induced by BBN were randomly divided into six groups and treated with chemotherapeutic agents once a week for four weeks. After last treatment, bladder and serum samples were analyzed for cell surface and immunological markers (CD4, CD8, CD56, CD204, Foxp3, and PD-L1) using immunohistochemistry staining. Serum and urine cytokine levels were evaluated by ELISA. All chemotherapeutic agents presented anti-tumor properties similar to those of BCG. These included changes in immune cells that resulted in fewer M2 macrophages and regulatory T cells around tumors. This result was compatible with those in human samples. Intravesical chemotherapy also induced systemic changes in cytokines, especially urinary interleukin (IL)-17A and granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), as well as in the distribution of blood neutrophils, lymphocytes, and monocytes. Our findings suggest that intravesical treatment with mitomycin C and adriamycin suppresses protumoral immunity while enhancing anti-tumor immunity, possibly through the action of specific cytokines. A better understanding of the immunoreaction induced by chemotherapeutic agents can lead to improved outcomes and fewer side effects in intravesical chemotherapy against NMIBC.
28398953	S100P as a Marker for Urothelial Histogenesis: A Critical Review and Comparison With Novel and Traditional Urothelial Immunohistochemical Markers.	S100P, or placental S100, is a member of a large family of S100 proteins and considered to be a promising immunohistochemical marker to support urothelial differentiation. This review synthesizes published data regarding the expression of S100P in urothelial carcinoma across histological grade and variant patterns, and in other malignancies, in an effort to summarize the state of understanding of this marker and evaluate its potential. We provide also a broad comparison of S100P with other contemporary and traditional urothelial markers and outline the potential utility of S100P in various diagnostically challenging scenarios. Taken in context, we recommend that to provide immunohistochemical support for consideration of urothelial differentiation, S100P may be included in a panel of markers (due to its high sensitivity), with better established (GATA3) and more specific (uroplakin 2) markers, for comparison with corresponding markers of other primary sites under consideration, depending on the clinical context. We emphasize that the overall most appropriate panel for any given case depends on the differential diagnosis engendered by the morphology encountered, and the constellation of clinical findings. As always with immunohistochemical panels, expected positive and negative markers for each diagnostic consideration should be included. Finally, since as of date there are no optimally sensitive or specific markers of urothelial differentiation, all final diagnoses relying on immunohistochemical support should be made in the appropriate clinical and histological context.
28398951	Challenges in Pathologic Staging of Bladder Cancer: Proposals for Fresh Approaches of Assessing Pathologic Stage in Light of Recent Studies and Observations Pertaining to Bladder Histoanatomic Variances.	The paradigm of pathologic stage (pT) categorization in bladder cancer remains the depth of invasion into the different histologic layers of the bladder wall. However, the approaches to assigning pT stage category toward an enhanced outcome stratification have been marked by challenges and innovations, due in part to our growing appreciation of the surprisingly perplexing bladder histoanatomy. Upstaging of pT1 tumors after radical cystectomy is substantial and underscores the potential value of pT1 substaging in transurethral resection (TUR) specimens. The 2017 American Joint Committee on Cancer tumor-node-metastasis system recommends pT1 substaging but recognizes the need to optimize the approach. Over the years, the cut-off for microinvasion has been significantly lowered to 0.5 mm and is now a promising scheme for pT1 (micrometric) substaging. Unlike the micrometric approach, histoanatomic substaging using muscularis mucosae (MM) and vascular plexus as landmarks is less feasible in TUR specimens and inconsistent in stratifying the outcome of pT1 tumors. The lamina propria possesses inherent variations in depth, MM, and vascular plexus dispositions that should be factored in future pT1 substaging proposals. Histoanatomic variations among the bladder regions also occur, and studies suggest that trigone and bladder neck cancers may have more adverse outcomes. The muscularis propria (MP), besides being the essential histologic landmark for assigning pT2 stage category, is also considered a surrogate for the adequacy of TUR, furthering the importance of identifying its presence in TUR specimens. MP, however, may be mimicked by hyperplastic or isolated MP-like MM muscle bundles in the lamina propria with overstaging implications, and caution should be exercised in distinguishing these 2 muscle types morphologically and immunohistochemically. Presence of additional superficial MP unique from the detrusor muscle proper may also complicate staging at the trigone and ureter insertion sites. With regard to the depth of MP invasion, large and multicenter studies have reaffirmed the prognostic significance of pT2a/b subcategories. It is revealed that there are at least 3 ways used to demarcate the irregular MP to perivesical soft tissue junction, and use of a common criterion indicates improvement in pT2b/pT3a staging reproducibility. Although studies have shown significantly poorer outcome in pT3b compared with pT3a tumors, this designation has a substantial reliance on the prosector's gross assessment of perivesical soft tissue invasion which if performed incorrectly may lead to staging inaccuracy of pT3 tumors. The 8th edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer has updated the staging schema for bladder cancers with concomitant prostatic stromal invasion and cancers within bladder diverticula. Because of 2 possible pT designations, prostatic stromal invasion in TUR specimens should not be automatically staged as either pT4a or pT2 (urethral). Recent data support that bladder cancer invading into the seminal vesicle has comparable outcome to pT4b tumors. Interestingly, several studies in pT4a tumors, which are staged based on sex-specific organs, have shown poorer outcome in females than males after radical cystectomy, and while there are possibly several reasons, they may also include anatomic factors. Despite the progress has been made, work remains to be done to inform future bladder cancer pT category definitions and their reproducibility in application and prognostication.
28397105	Detecting asymptomatic recurrence after radical cystectomy contributes to better prognosis in patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer.	The prognostic benefit of oncological follow-up to detect asymptomatic recurrence after radical cystectomy (RC) remains unclear. We aimed to assess whether routine follow-up to detect asymptomatic recurrence after RC improves patient survival. We retrospectively analyzed 581 RC cases for muscle-invasive bladder cancer at four hospitals between May 1996 and February 2017. All patients had regular follow-up examinations with urine cytology, blood biochemical tests, and computed tomography after RC. We investigated the first site and date of tumor recurrence. Overall survival in patients with recurrence stratified by the mode of recurrence (asymptomatic group vs. symptomatic group) was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method with the log-rank test. Cox proportional hazards regression analysis via inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) was used to evaluate the impact of the mode of diagnosing recurrence on survival. Of the 581 patients, 175 experienced relapse. Among those, 12 without adequate data were excluded. Of the remaining 163 patients, 76 (47%) were asymptomatic and 87 (53%) were symptomatic at the time of diagnosis. The most common recurrence site and symptom were lymph nodes (47%) and pain (53%), respectively. Time of overall survival after RC and from recurrence to death was significantly longer in the asymptomatic group than in the symptomatic group. A multivariate Cox regression analysis using IPTW showed that in the patients with symptomatic recurrence was an independent risk factor for overall survival after RC and survival from recurrence to death. Routine oncological follow-up for detection of asymptomatic recurrence contributes to a better prognosis after RC.
28381171	Identification and validation of a novel autophagy gene expression signature for human bladder cancer patients.	We sought to identify and validate a novel urinary autophagy transcript signature in patients with bladder cancer and evaluate its clinical utility. We performed an initial screening for seven autophagy transcript-based panel (autophagy-related protein 12 (ATG12); WD repeat domain, phosphoinositide interacting 2 (WIPI2); FYVE and coiled-coil domain-containing protein 1 (FYCO1); microtubule-associated protein light chain (MAPLC3); RB1-inducible coiled-coil 1 (RB1CC1); tachylectin-II-like beta-propeller domain 1 (TECPR1); and Unc-51-like kinase (ULK1)) that was identified based on bioinformatics analysis followed by SYBR Green-based polymerase chain reaction array validation in paired tissue and urine samples. Afterward, we evaluated the expression of differentially expressed autophagy transcripts in an independent validation set with reverse transcription quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction in urine sediments of 140 patients with bladder cancer, 68 patients with benign urological lesions, and 74 healthy controls (age and sex matched). The expression levels of ATG12, FYCO1, TECPR1, and ULK1 in paired bladder tissue and urine samples were significantly lower in bladder cancer than in control group (p < 0.001). In the validation set, the receiver-operating characteristic curve analyses demonstrated that each urinary autophagy transcripts showed high sensitivity and specificity for distinguishing bladder cancer from non-bladder cancer patients (ATG12, 75.4% and 86.1%; FYCO1, 87% and 75.7%; ULK1, 85.5% and 75.6%; and TECPR1, 90% and 81.9%). We document and validate a novel autophagy transcript signature for human bladder cancer diagnosis: bilharzial and non-bilharzial types.
28378639	Predictive role of serum and urinary cytokines in invasion and recurrence of bladder cancer.	Urothelial cancer patients are prone to recurrence, and there is no marker to predict which cases become refractory to the immunotherapy given to these patients. Tumour behaviour is decided by the dynamics between the pro- and anti-tumorigenic cytokines. In this study, 27 cytokines were estimated in serum and urine of 72 urothelial cancer patients and 42 healthy volunteer controls. Serum cytokines IL-1RA, IL-4 and RANTES were in significantly higher concentration in serum of patients compared to controls, while IL-2 was significantly less in concentration. Patients were found to have significantly high concentrations of 12 urinary cytokines (IL-2, IL-4, IL-8, IL-10, GM-CSF, IFN-gamma, IP-10, MIP-1a, PDGF, MIP-1b, RANTES and VEGF) in comparison to healthy controls. Serum VEGF and urinary IL-1ra, IL-4, IL-10, GM-CSF, IP-10, MIP-1a and MIP-1b concentrations were found significantly higher in concentration in high-grade tumours compared to low-grade tumours. There was no difference in either the serum or urinary cytokines between non-invasive and muscle-invasive cases. Serum IL-1ra, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-alpha and VEGF and urinary IL-1ra, IL-4, IL-8, IL-10, GM-CSF, IP-10, MIP-1a, PDGF, MIP-1b and VEGF were found to be significantly higher in recurrent patients compared to non-recurrent patients. Of these, high concentrations of urinary IL-1RA, IL-4, IL-10, IP-10, PDGF and VEGF and serum IL-1ra, IL-6, IL-10, VEGF and TNF-alpha were associated with poor recurrence-free survival. Poor recurrence-free survival was also seen with increasing number of cytokines showing high concentrations. The study shows that the estimation of a combination of these cytokines in minimally or non-invasive samples may act as a prognostic indicator.
28373448	Defining New Colorectal Cancer Syndromes in a Population-based Cohort of the Disease.	BACKGROUND/AIM: Most known cancer syndromes confer an increased risk of more than one tumour types, and families with more than one colorectal cancer often segregate other cancers as well. The aim of this study was to examine if there is a general increased risk of other cancers in colorectal cancer families, which are defined as having two or more cases of colorectal cancer in close relatives. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study used a detailed family history of cancer diagnoses in a cohort of more than 3,000 consecutive colorectal cancer cases. A comparison was made between families with sporadic and those with familial colorectal cancer cases. Detailed morphology data were used to find further support for putative syndromes. RESULTS: There were significantly more non-colorectal cancers in the family history of the familial CRC cases (p<0.001), with significantly more gastric cancers (p<0.001), prostate cancers (p<0.001), urinary bladder cancers (p<0.001) and melanomas (p=0.002), leukaemia/lymphomas (p=0.004), gynaecological cancers (p=0.007) and breast cancers (p=0.023). There was also some support for different morphological profiles for four of the five tested syndromes. CONCLUSION: This study found support for a general increased risk of one or more different cancer syndromes involving families with colorectal cancer and other cancers. Further studies will define the different possible syndromes and determine the genetic background.
28373436	Synergistic Effect of Carboplatin and Piroxicam on Two Bladder Cancer Cell Lines.	BACKGROUND/AIM: This study aimed to evaluate the in vitro efficacy of carboplatin and piroxicam, both in isolation and combined, against T24 and 5637 human urinary bladder cancer cell lines. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cell viability, drug interaction, cell morphology, cell proliferation, apoptosis and autophagy were analyzed after 72 h of drug exposure. Statistical analysis was performed and values of p<0.05 were considered statistically significant. RESULTS: Drug exposure in combination led to a significant reduction of cell viability comparatively to single-drug exposure. These combinations resulted in a synergistic interaction in the T24 (combination index for 50% effect (CI50)=0.65) and 5637 (CI50=0.17) cell lines. Notable increase of morphological alterations, a marked decrease of Ki-67 expression, a considerable enhancement of autophagic vacuoles and a minimal effect on apoptosis was observed in both cell lines treated with combined drugs. CONCLUSION: Data showed that in vitro combination of carboplatin and piroxicam produced a more potent antiproliferative effect when compared to single drugs.
28348449	Combined Genetic Biomarkers Confer Susceptibility to Risk of Urothelial Bladder Carcinoma in a Saudi Population.	We evaluated the associations between seven single nucleotide polymorphisms and susceptibility to urothelial bladder carcinoma (UBC) in a Saudi population. Genomic DNA was taken from buccal cells of 52 patients with UBC and 104 controls for genotyping of GSTT1, GSTM1, rs4646903, rs1048943, TP53 rs1042522, rs1801133, and rs1801394 using PCR and TaqMan(R) assays. The rs1801133 and rs1801394 variants showed strong associations with UBC (OR = 2.3, P = 0.0002; OR = 2.6, P = 0.0001, resp.). Homozygosity of Pro72 conferred a significant double risk in cases compared with controls (30.8% versus 15.4%), but the homozygote Arg/Arg had no effect on risk. Genotypic combinations of GSTM1/GSTT1, rs4646903/rs1048943, and rs1801133/rs1801394 exhibited significant linkage with the disease (chi2 = 10.3, P = 0.006; chi2 = 13.9, P = 0.003; and chi2 = 20.4, P = 0.0004, resp.). The GSTM1 and rs1042522Arg and rs1801394G variant alleles were more frequent in current smokers with UBC (52.4%, 52.5%, and 64.3%, resp.) than were the corresponding wild-types. Despite some variants having only a slight effect on UBC risk, the interaction effect of combined genetic biomarkers-or even the presence of one copy of a variant allele-is potentially much greater. Perhaps more studies regarding next-generation genetic sequencing and its utility can add to the risk of UBC.
28345469	The role of estradiol metabolism in urogenital schistosomiasis-induced bladder cancer.	Urogenital schistosomiasis is a neglected tropical disease that can lead to bladder cancer. How urogenital schistosomiasis induces carcinogenesis remains unclear, although there is evidence that the human blood fluke Schistosoma haematobium, the infectious agent of urogenital schistosomiasis, releases estradiol-like metabolites. These kind of compounds have been implicated in other cancers. Aiming for enhanced understanding of the pathogenesis of the urogenital schistosomiasis-induced bladder cancer, here we review, interpret, and discuss findings of estradiol-like metabolites detected in both the parasite and in the human urine during urogenital schistosomiasis. Moreover, we predict pathways and enzymes that are involved in the production of these metabolites emphasizing their potential effects on the dysregulation of the tumor suppressor gene p53 expression during urogenital schistosomiasis. Enhanced understanding of these potential carcinogens may not only shed light on urogenital schistosomiasis-induced neoplasia of the bladder, but would also facilitate development of interventions and biomarkers for this and other infection-associated cancers at large.
28345451	The impact of advanced proteomics in the search for markers and therapeutic targets of bladder cancer.	Bladder cancer is the most common cancer of the urinary tract and can be avoided through proper surveillance and monitoring. Several genetic factors are known to contribute to the progression of bladder cancer, many of which produce molecules that serve as cancer biomarkers. Blood, urine, and tissue are commonly analyzed for the presence of biomarkers, which can be derived from either the nucleus or the mitochondria. Recent advances in proteomics have facilitated the high-throughput profiling of data generated from bladder cancer-related proteins or peptides in parallel with high sensitivity and specificity, providing a wealth of information for biomarker discovery and validation. However, the transmission of screening results from one laboratory to another remains the main disadvantage of these methods, a fact that emphasizes the need for consistent and standardized procedures as suggested by the Human Proteome Organization. This review summarizes the latest discoveries and progress of biomarker identification for the early diagnosis, projected prognosis, and therapeutic response of bladder cancer, informs the readers of the current status of proteomic-based biomarker findings, and suggests avenues for future work.
28324275	The Impact of Blue Light Cystoscopy on the Diagnosis and Treatment of Bladder Cancer.	Photodynamic diagnostic technique with blue light cystoscopy (BLC) takes advantage of the preferential uptake and accumulation of protoporphyrins in neoplastic tissue which emit a red fluorescence when illuminated with blue light (360-450 nm wavelengths). This allows enhanced visualization of small papillary tumors and flat carcinoma in situ lesions that might have been missed on white light cystoscopy (WLC). There is compelling evidence that the ability of BLC to detect these additional tumors translates into improved recurrence rates compared to WLC. However, the impact of BLC with regard to progression rates and in patients who are managed with intravesical therapy is not yet known. Further work is required to optimize the integration of BLC into clinical practice, but the future for BLC appears promising.
28323779	GATA3 and MYB Expression in Cutaneous Adnexal Neoplasms.	Knowledge of staining pattern of certain immunostains might be useful in the classification of cutaneous adnexal tumors that can have clinical importance. We studied GATA3 and MYB expression in archival materials of 220 adnexal tumors comprised of sebaceous carcinomas, follicular tumors, apocrine carcinoma, predominantly apocrine tumors, predominantly eccrine tumors, and others including adenoid cystic carcinomas. Nuclear GATA3 expression was seen in 70% (153/220) of cases, including sebaceous carcinoma (93%), apocrine carcinoma (93%), follicular neoplasms (100%), and predominantly apocrine neoplasms (69%), yet only 38% of predominantly eccrine neoplasms. Nuclear MYB expression was seen in 43% (81/188) of cases, including adenoid cystic carcinoma (90%), predominantly apocrine tumors (66%), follicular neoplasms (49%), apocrine carcinomas (14%), predominantly eccrine tumors (11%), and sebaceous carcinomas (4%). GATA3 and MYB expression were noted in 43% (9/21) and 24% (5/21) of cutaneous metastases, respectively. Expression of both GATA3 and MYB was noted in 33% (60/184) of primary adnexal tumors versus 19% (4/21) of cutaneous metastases. GATA3 preferentially labels tumors with follicular, sebaceous, and apocrine differentiation. MYB is potentially a helpful stain in the distinction of desmoplastic trichoepithelioma versus basal cell carcinoma. The coexpression of GATA3 and MYB might be helpful in the distinction of primary cutaneous adnexal carcinoma versus metastatic breast, salivary gland, or urothelial carcinoma.
28322141	Lessons Learned from Gemcitabine: Impact of Therapeutic Carrier Systems and Gemcitabine's Drug Conjugates on Cancer Therapy.	Currently, drug delivery systems have a high impact in cancer therapy and are receiving more attention than conventional cancer treatment modalities. Compared with current cancer therapies, gemcitabine (2', 2'-difluoro-2'-deoxycytidine) has been proven to be an effective chemotherapeutic agent against pancreatic, colon, bladder, breast, ovarian, non-small-cell lung, and head and neck cancers in combination with other anticancer agents. To improve the safety and efficacy of cytotoxic drugs, several drug delivery systems have been explored. This review outlines the recent work directed toward gemcitabine delivery systems for cancer therapy, including aerosols, polymeric nanoparticles, liposomes, microparticles, carbon nanotubes, and multifunctional theranostic nanomedicines. It also provides insight into the design and development of gemcitabine conjugation for safe and effective cancer therapy. Despite the clinical promises of gemcitabine, many therapeutic challenges remain. Specifically, its therapeutic use in cancer chemotherapy is impeded by a short biological half-life, caused by its rapid metabolism, and resistance due to increased expression of ribonucleotide reductase. In our opinion, many research investigations have contributed to improve the selectivity and efficacy of gemcitabine. This combined approach of drug delivery systems and gemcitabine conjugates has shown promising efficacy in preclinical models and significant potential for future clinical cancer-therapeutic applications. Also, these strategies overcome most of the aforementioned limits of gemcitabine.
28321147	Detection of Circulating Tumour Cells in Urothelial Cancers and Clinical Correlations: Comparison of Two Methods.	Circulating tumour cells (CTC) are identified exploiting their protein/gene expression patterns or distinct size compared to blood cells. Data on CTC in bladder cancer (BC) are still scarce. We comparatively analyzed CTC enrichment by AdnaTest ProstateCancerSelect (AT) and ScreenCell(R)Cyto (SC) kits, combined with identification by EPCAM, MUC1, and ERBB2 expression and by cytological criteria, respectively, in 19 nonmetastatic (M0) and 47 metastatic (M+) BC patients, at baseline (T0) and during treatment (T1). At T0, CTC positivity rates by AT were higher in M+ compared to M0 cases (57.4% versus 25%, p = 0.041). EPCAM was detected in 75% of CTC-positive samples by AT, showing increasing expression levels from T0 to T1 (median (interquartile range, IQR): 0.18 (0.07-0.42) versus 0.84 (0.33-1.84), p = 0.005) in M+ cases. Overall, CTC positivity by SC was around 80% regardless of clinical setting and time point of analysis, except for a lower occurrence at T1 in M0 cases. At T0, circulating tumour microemboli were more frequently (25% versus 8%) detected and more numerous in M+ compared to M0 patients. The approach used for CTC detection impacts the outcome of CTC studies. Further investigations are required to clarify the clinical validity of AT and SC in specific BC clinical contexts.
28314322	Concurrent Chemotherapy Improves the Overall Survival of Patients Irradiated for Locally Recurrent Bladder Cancer.	AIM: To investigate the predictive value of several factors, including concurrent chemotherapy, for overall survival of patients irradiated for locally recurrent bladder cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty patients irradiated for local recurrence of bladder cancer were included; 14 received concurrent chemotherapy. Ten factors were analyzed for overall survival: gender, age, period from bladder cancer diagnosis to irradiation of local recurrence, Karnofsky performance scale, tumour grading, pack-years smoked, smoking during radiotherapy, radiation dose, interruption of radiotherapy and concurrent chemotherapy. RESULTS: On univariate analyses, significantly longer overall survival was found for those with age </=76 years (p=0.024), better performance status (p<0.001) and those treated with concurrent chemotherapy (p<0.001). On Cox regression analysis, concurrent chemotherapy remained significantly associated with survival (risk ratio 3.82, p=0.013); a trend for association was found for performance status (risk ratio 2.50, p=0.076). CONCLUSION: Addition of concurrent chemotherapy to radiotherapy for locally recurrent bladder cancer resulted in improved overall survival. Concurrent radiochemotherapy should be considered when this is clinically reasonable for such patients.
28314321	A Survival Score for Patients Assigned to Palliative Radiotherapy for Metastatic Bladder Cancer.	AIM: To create a survival score for patients with metastatic bladder cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In 46 irradiated patients, six characteristics were evaluated for their association with survival: Age, gender, Karnofsky performance scale, initial stage (American Joint Committee on Cancer), number of metastatic sites, and interval between bladder cancer diagnosis and palliative radiotherapy. Characteristics showing a trend (p<0.15) were incorporated into the score. Six-month survival rates were divided by 10. Patients' scores were derived by totaling the scores of these characteristics. RESULTS: Performance scale (p=0.14), stage (p=0.055) and number of metastatic sites (p=0.10) showed a trend for association with survival. Patients' scores were 6, 7, 8, 10 or 12 points, with corresponding 6-month survival rates of 20%, 0%, 0%, 46% and 45% (p=0.038). Two groups were created, with 6-8 and with 10-12 points, with 6-month survival rates of 9% and 46% (p=0.002), respectively. CONCLUSION: A new survival score was developed. Patients with 6-8 points should receive less aggressive treatments for metastatic bladder cancer. Those with 10-12 points may receive more intensive approaches.
28314306	Expression of Indoleamine 2,3-Dioxygenase Gene Is a Feature of Poorly Differentiated Non-muscle-invasive Urothelial Cell Bladder Carcinomas.	AIM: To evaluate indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) gene expression in non-muscle-invasive urothelial cell bladder carcinoma (NMIBC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Seventy-four patients undergoing surgical treatment for NMIBC were enrolled in the study. IDO gene expression was assessed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). RESULTS: IDO gene expression was detectable significantly more frequently (48/74, 64.86% vs. 5/21, 23.81%, p<0.001) and to significantly higher extents (p=0.01) in cancer tissues than in normal bladder mucosa. IDO gene expression was observed significantly more frequently in large (p=0.02), high-grade (p=0.05) and stage T1 (p=0.03) than in small, low-grade and stage Ta tumors. Expression levels were also significantly higher in large, high-grade and stage T1 tumors (p<0.01, p=0.05 and p=0.03, respectively). A direct positive correlation between IDO gene expression in tumor tissues and tumor size (R=0.24, p=0.04), grade (R=0.23, p=0.05) and stage (R=0.25, p=0.03) was detected. Multivariate analysis suggested a trend (p=0.08) towards longer overall survival in patients bearing tumors that did not express IDO gene. CONCLUSION: These data indicate that IDO gene expression is a feature of aggressive NMIBC, suggesting a potential immunosuppressive role of IDO.
28314276	Evodiamine Induces Cell Growth Arrest, Apoptosis and Suppresses Tumorigenesis in Human Urothelial Cell Carcinoma Cells.	BACKGROUND/AIM: Evodiamine, an indole alkaloid derived from Evodia rutaecarpa, exhibits pharmacological activities including vasodilatation, analgesia, anti-cardiovascular disease, anti-Alzheimer's disease, anti-inflammation, and anti-tumor activity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study analyzes the anti-tumor effects of evodiamine on cellular growth, tumorigenesis, cell cycle and apoptosis induction of human urothelial cell carcinoma (UCC) cells. RESULTS: The present study showed that evodiamine significantly inhibited the proliferation of UCC cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Also, evodiamine suppressed the tumorigenesis of UCC cells in vitro. Moreover, evodiamine caused G2/M cell-cycle arrest and induced caspase-dependent apoptosis in UCC cells. Finally, we demonstrated that evodiamine exhibits better cytotoxic than 5-fluorouracil, a clinical chemotherapeutic drug, for UCC cells. CONCLUSION: Evodiamine induces growth inhibition, tumorigenesis suppression, cell-cycle arrest, and apoptosis induction in human UCC cells. Therefore, this agent displays a therapeutic potential for treating human UCC cells and is worthy for further investigation.
28292092	Tuberculous prostatitis: mimicking a cancer.	Genitourinary tuberculosis is a common type of extra-pulmonary tuberculosis . The kidneys, ureter, bladder or genital organs are usually involved. Tuberculosis of the prostate has mainly been described in immune-compromised patients. However, it can exceptionally be found as an isolated lesion in immune-competent patients. Tuberculosis of the prostate may be difficult to differentiate from carcinoma of the prostate and the chronic prostatitis when the prostate is hard and nodular on digital rectal examination and the urine is negative for tuberculosis bacilli. In many cases, a diagnosis of tuberculous prostatitis is made by the pathologist, or the disease is found incidentally after transurethral resection. Therefore, suspicion of tuberculous prostatitis requires a confirmatory biopsy of the prostate. We report the case of 60-year-old man who presented a low urinary tract syndrome. After clinical and biological examination, and imaging, prostate cancer was highly suspected. Transrectal needle biopsy of the prostate was performed and histological examination showed tuberculosis lesions.
28285503	Development of Urinary Bladder Pre-Neoplasia by Schistosoma haematobium Eggs and Chemical Carcinogen in Mice.	Schistosoma haematobium is a biocarcinogen of human urinary bladder (UB). The present study investigated developing UB cancer mouse model by injecting S. haematobium eggs into the bladder wall and introduction of chemical carcinogens. Histopathological findings showed mild hyperplasia to epithelial vacuolar change, and high grade dysplasia. Squamous metaplasia was observed in the S. haematobium eggs+NDMA group at week 12 but not in other groups. Immunohistochemistry revealed significantly high expression of Ki-67 in urothelial epithelial cells of the S. haematobium eggs+BBN group at week 20. The qRT-PCR showed high expression of p53 gene in S. haematobium eggs group at week 4 and S. haematobium eggs+BBN group at week 20. E-cadherin and vimentin showed contrasting expression in S. haematobium eggs+BBN group. Such inverse expression of E-cadherin and vimentin may indicate epithelial mesenchymal transition in the UB tissue. In conclusion, S. haematobium eggs and nitrosamines may transform UB cells into squamous metaplasia and dysplasia in correlation with increased expression of Ki-67. Marked decrease in E-cadherin and increase in p53 and vimentin expressions may support the transformation. The present study introduces a promising modified animal model for UB cancer study using S. haematobium eggs.
28283915	Management of Voiding Dysfunction After Female Neobladder Creation.	PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Functional complications after orthotopic neobladder urinary diversion (ONB), including urinary incontinence and urinary retention, present unique challenges. The purpose of this review is to outline contemporary treatment options for voiding dysfunction after ONB in females. RECENT FINDINGS: Meticulous surgical technique in the form of urethral nerve-sparing has been shown to play an important role in maintaining continence, as has sparing the uterus when possible. Data supporting the effectiveness of lifestyle measures, urethral bulking, pubovaginal slings, and transobturator slings in the treatment of urinary incontinence are widely variable and limited to case reports. Urinary retention is still most effectively managed with self-catheterization. Voiding dysfunction after ONB can be devastating. Recent advances focus on improving surgical techniques to decrease the risk of incontinence and retention, as post-operative management options are limited.
28283914	Transurethral Resection of Bladder Tumors: Improving Quality Through New Techniques and Technologies.	PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Cystoscopy with transurethral resection of bladder tumors (TURBT) is essential in the diagnosis of bladder cancer as well as the management of non-muscle-invasive disease yet remains a comparatively imprecise procedure secondary to variability among patients, tumors, and surgeons alike. We will review evolving technologies and techniques used to enhance safety and efficacy of TURBT performance and education in the management of bladder cancer. RECENT FINDINGS: Though a generally safe procedure, efficacy of TURBT in terms of complete tumor excision, appropriate pathologic diagnosis, and absence of complications can vary significantly with direct impact on patient outcomes. Application of new techniques including bipolar electrocautery and photodynamic enhancement continues to shape endoscopic management of bladder cancer and improve safety, tumor excision rates, and downstream outcomes. High-quality bladder tumor resection is essential for effective bladder cancer management. Technologies such as bipolar electrocautery and photodynamic visualization improve safety and tumor eradication. Improved education and surgical technique will further standardize high-level outcomes for patients undergoing TURBT.
28281959	miR-489 Suppresses Proliferation and Invasion of Human Bladder Cancer Cells.	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been shown to be involved in bladder cancer progression. miR-489 (also known as miR-489-3p) was recently reported to be a tumor suppressor in several cancers. However, its exact role and mechanism in the progression of bladder cancer are largely unknown. In this study, we explore the role of miR-489 in the proliferation and invasion of human bladder cancer cells. The miR-489 expression levels were detected in bladder cancer and normal adjacent tissues, as well as in human normal bladder epithelial cells and bladder cancer cell lines. The results showed that miR-489 was sharply reduced in bladder cancer tissues and cell lines. Then the miR-489 mimic or oligo anta-miR-489 was transfected into T24 and UMUC3 bladder cancer cell lines. The results showed that the miR-489 mimic greatly increased the miR-489 level and significantly decreased the proliferation and invasion of T24 and UMUC3 cells. In contrast, the anta-miR-489 had a completely opposite effect on miR-489 expression, cell proliferation, and cell invasion. Moreover, bioinformatics and luciferase reporter gene assays confirmed that miR-489 targeted the mRNA 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) region of Jagged1 (JAG1), a Notch ligand. In conclusion, miR-489 suppressed proliferation and invasion of human bladder cancer cells.
28275021	Mullerianosis of the urinary bladder: a rare and problematic bladder tumour.	Mullerianosis of the bladder is an extremely rare and highly symptomatic bladder tumour comprising of at least two types of Mullerian derived tissues. We present the case of a 59-year-old woman presenting with painful macroscopic haematuria associated with urgency, frequency and incontinence. She is a nulliparous postmenopausal woman without malignancy risk factors or previous abdominal surgery. Initially identified on ultrasound scan, she was taken for transurethral resection of bladder tumour (TURBT). Histology confirms the diagnosis. Repeat TURBT was required for non-resolution of symptoms. Despite a thorough resection, symptoms recurred within months necessitating partial cystectomy. Although a 'benign' lesion, this lesion proved a difficult condition to treat requiring partial cystectomy.
28261619	The Long-Term Effect of Radical Prostatectomy on Erectile Function, Urinary Continence, and Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms: A Comparison to Age-Matched Healthy Controls.	Introduction. To analyze the impact of radical prostatectomy (RPE) on erectile function and lower urinary tract function in comparison to age-matched healthy men. Materials and Methods. Patients who underwent radical retropubic prostatectomy completed questionnaires containing the IIEF-5, the Bristol female LUTS questionnaire, and the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS). Results. Patients after RPE were included (n = 363). Age-matched healthy men (n = 363) were included. The mean IIEF-5 of patients aged 61-70 yrs after RPE was 10.4 +/- 6.6 versus 18.8 +/- 5.3 in the control cohort; the respective values for men aged 71-80 yrs after RPE were 7.2 +/- 6.5 versus 13.6 +/- 7.7 in the control cohort. Urinary incontinence after RPE was reported in 41.9% (61-70 years) and 37.7% (71-80) versus 7.5% and 15.1% in the control cohort. The mean IPSS of patients after RPE aged 61-70 yrs was 5.0 +/- 4.4 versus 5.5 +/- 4.9 in the control cohort; the respective values for men aged 71-80 yrs were 6.0 +/- 4.9 versus 7.5 +/- 5.7 in the healthy cohort. Conclusions. The negative effect of radical prostatectomy on erectile and urinary incontinence remains substantial. The physiologically declining erectile and lower urinary tract function with ageing reduces the difference between healthy men and those after surgery. Healthy men have a higher IPSS presumably due to the presence of bladder outlet obstruction.
28260746	Inhibition of T24 and RT4 Human Bladder Cancer Cell Lines by Heterocyclic Molecules.	BACKGROUND Bladder cancer is a major widespread tumor of the genitourinary tract. Around 30% of patients with superficial cancers develop invasive and metastatic pathology. MATERIAL AND METHODS Some new heterocyclic 4-methyl coumarin derivatives were designed using molecular modeling studies to evaluate their potential against bladder cancer lines T24 and RT-4. The designed compounds that showed good binding affinity to T24 and RT4 were synthesized, with excellent yield. The synthesized compounds after structural evaluation were further evaluated for their antiproliferative activity by cell viability assay, cell cycle analysis, and apoptosis assay. RESULTS The compound BC-14 exhibited the best cytotoxicity against T24 cells, but were not highly active against RT4 cells. CONCLUSIONS The results of the present study may suggest the selectivity pattern of the synthesized compounds. These results should be explored further with chemical modification for other cancer types.
28259358	Prognostic significance of lymphatic, vascular and perineural invasion for bladder cancer patients treated by radical cystectomy.	In radical cystectomy specimens with bladder cancer, lymphatic and vascular invasion are often reported as 'angiolymphatic' or 'lymphovascular' invasion, terms that combine the findings of tumour within simple endothelial-lined lymphatic spaces and tumour within muscle-lined blood vessels. It is unclear if these patterns of invasion have different prognostic significance. In addition, there are conflicting data regarding the significance of lymphatic, vascular and perineural invasion in patients with bladder cancer. Herein, we studied 1504 patients treated by radical cystectomy for bladder cancer at our institution and followed for a mean of 10.6 years. Cases were re-reviewed by a urological pathologist for lymphatic invasion defined as tumour within a non-muscle-lined endothelial-lined lymphatic space, vascular invasion defined as tumour in a muscle-lined blood vessel, and perineural invasion defined as tumour within the perineural sheath. Associations of clinical and pathological features with bladder cancer death were evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression models and summarised with hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals. Survival was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Multivariate analysis showed that lymphatic and vascular invasion but not perineural invasion were significantly associated with cancer specific survival (p<0.0001 and p=0.02, respectively). There was a significant association of lymphatic and vascular invasion but not perineural invasion with involved regional lymph nodes (p<0.0001 and p=0.004, respectively). In patients with metastasis to regional lymph nodes, lymphatic invasion remained significantly associated with outcome (p=0.02). The frequency of lymphatic and vascular invasion varied amongst histological subtypes of bladder cancer. Vascular and lymphatic invasion should be clearly defined and reported for radical cystectomy specimens containing bladder cancer.
28256904	Utility of early dynamic and delayed post-diuretic 18F-FDG PET/CT SUVmax in predicting tumour grade and T-stage of urinary bladder carcinoma: results from a prospective single centre study.	OBJECTIVE: Accurate pre-treatment grading and staging of bladder cancer are vital for better therapeutic decision and prognosis. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the correlation between maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) calculated during early dynamic and post-diuretic fluorine-18 fludeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) positron emission tomography (PET)/CT studies with grade and pT-stage of bladder cancer. METHODS: 39 patients with suspected/proven bladder carcinoma underwent 10-min early dynamic pelvic imaging and delayed post-diuretic whole-body FDG PET/CT imaging. SUVmax of the lesions derived from both studies was compared with grade and pT-stage. Relationship of SUVmax with grade and pT-stage was analyzed using independent sample t-test and analysis of variance. RESULTS: SUVmax of the early dynamic imaging showing tumour perfusion was independent from the SUVmax of delayed imaging. High-grade tumours showed higher SUVmax than low-grade tumours in the early dynamic imaging (5.4 +/- 1.4 vs 4.7 +/- 1.6; p-value 0.144) with statistically significant higher value in Stage pT1 tumours (6.8 +/- 0.8 vs 5.5 +/- 1.2; p-value 0.04). Non-invasive pTa tumours had significantly less SUVmax than higher stage tumours during early dynamic imaging [F(4,29) = 6.860, p 0.001]. CONCLUSION: Early dynamic imaging may have a role in predicting the grade and aggressiveness of the bladder tumours and thus can help in treatment planning and prognostication. Advances in knowledge: Dynamic PET/CT is a limitedly explored imaging technique. This prospective pilot study demonstrates the utility of this modality as a potential adjunct to standard FDG PET/CT imaging in predicting the grade and aggressiveness of the bladder tumours and thus can impact the patient management.
28254473	Precision surgery and genitourinary cancers.	The landscape of the surgical management of urologic malignancies has dramatically changed over the past 20 years. On one side, better diagnostic and prognostic tools allowed better patient selection and more reliable surgical planning. On the other hand, the implementation of minimally invasive techniques and technologies, such as robot-assisted laparoscopy surgery and image-guided surgery, allowed minimizing surgical morbidity. Ultimately, these advances have translated into a more tailored approach to the management of urologic cancer patients. Following the paradigm of "precision medicine", contemporary urologic surgery has entered a technology-driven era of "precision surgery", which entails a range of surgical procedures tailored to combine maximal treatment efficacy with minimal impact on patient function and health related quality of life. Aim of this non-systematic review is to provide a critical analysis of the most recent advances in the field of surgical uro-oncology, and to define the current and future role of "precision surgery" in the management of genitourinary cancers.
28250883	[Neoplastic Vesico-vaginal Fistula (VVF) secondary to bladder cancer: a rare entity].	Vesico-vaginal Fistula (VVF) secondary to bladder cancer is extremely rare. We report the case of a 54-year old post-menopausal patient with neoplasic Vesico-vaginal Fistula (VVF), without any surgical antecedents or recent obstetric trauma. Biopsy of the edges of the fistula confirmed urothelial carcinoma. In light of this observation, we here discuss VVF etiological forms and their different therapeutic strategies.
28250302	Henoch Schonlein Purpura Nephritis Associated with Intravesical Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) Therapy.	Henoch Schonlein purpura (HSP), also known as IgA vasculitis (IgAV), is a systemic small-vessel vasculitis that predominantly affects adolescents and is rare in adults. In many cases, the onset of HSP has been causally linked to an infectious disease. We encountered a case of HSP with severe renal involvement diagnosed by renal biopsy following bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) therapy for bladder cancer. This is of clinical relevance, as intravesical BCG administration is becoming an established therapy for superficial bladder cancer and is supposed to be safe. It is important for all clinicians to recognize that BCG therapy has this rare but potentially serious systemic complication.
28248879	A three-long noncoding RNA signature as a diagnostic biomarker for differentiating between triple-negative and non-triple-negative breast cancers.	BACKGROUND: Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive cancer with unfavorable outcome and it is useful to explore noninvasive biomarkers for its early diagnosis. Here, we identified differentially expressed long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in blood samples of patients with TNBC to assess their diagnostic value. METHODS: Differential expression of lncRNAs in plasma of patients with TNBC (n = 25) and non-TNBC (NTNBC; n = 35) and in healthy controls was compared by microarray analysis and validated by real-time PCR. lncRNA expression between plasma and BC tissues was compared using Pearson correlation test. Logit model was used to obtain a new lncRNA-based score. Receiver operating characteristic analysis was performed to assess the diagnostic value of the selected lncRNAs. RESULTS: Microarray data showed that 41 lncRNAs were aberrantly expressed. Among these, antisense noncoding RNA in the INK4 locus (ANRIL), hypoxia inducible factor 1alpha antisense RNA-2 (HIF1A-AS2), and urothelial carcinoma-associated 1 (UCA1) were markedly upregulated in plasma of patients with TNBC compared with patients with NTNBC (P < 0.01). HIF1A-AS2 expression was positively associated with its tissue levels (r = 0.670, P < 0.01). AUC (95% CI) of ANRIL, HIF1A-AS2, and UCA1 was 0.785 (0.660-0.881), 0.739 (0.610-0.844), and 0.817 (0.696-0.905), respectively. TNBCSigLnc-3, a new score obtained using the logit model, showed excellent diagnostic performance, with AUC of 0.934 (0.839-0.982), sensitivity of 76.0%, and specificity of 97.1%. CONCLUSION: ANRIL, HIF1A-AS2, and UCA1 expression was significantly increased in plasma of patients with TNBC, suggesting their use as TNBC-specific diagnostic biomarkers.
28246375	Giant Intradiverticular Bladder Tumor.	BACKGROUND Intradiverticular bladder tumors are rare. This renders diagnosis of an intradiverticular bladder tumor difficult. Imaging plays a vital role in achieving the diagnosis, and subsequently staging of the disease. CASE REPORT A 74-year-old male presented to our center with a few months history of constitutional symptoms. Upon further history, he reported hematuria two months prior to presentation, which stopped temporarily, only to recur a few days prior to coming to the hospital. The patient admitted to having lower urinary tract symptoms. However, there was no dysuria, no sandy urine, and no fever. Palpation of his abdomen revealed a vague mass at the suprapubic region, which was non tender. In view of his history and the clinical examination findings, an ultrasound of the abdomen and computed tomography (CT) was arranged. These investigations revealed a giant tumor that seemed to be arising from a bladder diverticulum, with a mass effect and hydronephrosis. He later underwent operative intervention. CONCLUSIONS Intradiverticular bladder tumors may present a challenge to the treating physician in an atypical presentation; thus requiring a high index of suspicion and knowledge of tumor pathophysiology. As illustrated in our case, CT with its wide availability and multiplanar imaging capabilities offers a useful means for diagnosis, disease staging, operative planning, and follow-up.
28238417	Enhanced expression of Programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) protein in benign vascular anomalies.	Programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) and its ligands have been shown to play a significant role in evasion of malignant tumour cells from the immune system. Last year, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved anti-PD-1 inhibitors for treatment of non-small cell lung carcinoma and recently has approved anti-PD-L1 blocker for treatment of metastatic urothelial cell carcinoma. However, the role that the immune system might have on benign tumours including vascular anomalies has received less attention. In this study, we evaluated PD-1 and PD-L1 expression on two benign vascular anomalies: infantile haemangiomas and venous malformations. Tissue microarrays (TMAs) from these two entities were stained for PD-1 and PD-L1 antibodies. Blood vessels from normal tissue were used as control. The endothelial cells in both infantile haemangioma and venous malformation showed high expression of PD-1 but were negative for PD-L1. Endothelial cells within the blood vessels in normal tissues were negative for both PD-1 and PD-L1. Our results showed over-expression of PD-1 in subsets of vascular anomalies, while PD-L1 was negative. This would raise the possibility of immunotherapy in benign vascular tumour when other options are exhausted.
28237355	[Immunotherapy for the treatment of patients with genitourinary cancers: Review and perspectives].	Management of genitourinary (GU) cancers is improving rapidly with the development of immunotherapy agents, especially anti-PD-1/anti-PD-L1 therapies. Large studies have shown better outcomes for the treatment of these patients, leading to new drug approvals and recent changes in standards of care in renal, prostate and bladder cancer. We performed a review of recent studies assessing efficacy of immuno-oncology therapies in GU cancers. New results are summarized and next ways of development of clinical research are discussed as the use of such therapies will soon be assessed in first-line or adjuvant settings.
28229968	Cytotoxic and toxicogenomic effects of silibinin in bladder cancer cells with different TP53 status.	Silibinin is a natural phenol found in the seeds of the milk thistle plant. Recent data have shown its effectiveness for preventing/treating bladder tumours. Therefore, in this study we investigated the cytotoxic and toxicogenetic activity of silibinin in bladder cancer cells with different TP53 statuses. Two bladder urothelial carcinoma cell lines were used: RT4 (wild-type TP53 gene) and T24 (mutated TP53 gene). Cell proliferation, clonogenic survival, apoptosis rates, genotoxicity and relative expression profile of FRAP/mTOR, FGFR3, AKT2 and DNMT1 genes and of miR100 and miR203 were evaluated. Silibinin promoted decreased proliferation and increased late apoptosis in TP53 mutated cells. Increased early apoptosis rates, primary DNA damage, and decrease of cell colonies in the clonogenic survival assay were detected in both RT4 and T24 cell lines. Down-regulation of FRAP/mTOR, AKT2, FGFR3, DNMT1 and miR100 expression occurred in RT4 cells. Modulation of miR203 was observed in both cell lines. In conclusion, despite the reduction of clone formation in both cell lines, the toxicogenomic effect of silibinin on FRAP/mTOR, AKT2, FGFR3, DNMT1 and miR100 was dependent on the TP53 status. Taken together, the data confirmed the role of silibinin as an antiproliferative compound, whose mechanism of action was related to the TP53 status.
28229220	Overexpression of HepaCAM inhibits bladder cancer cell proliferation and viability through the AKT/FoxO pathway.	PURPOSE: HepaCAM, an N-linked glycoprotein that encodes a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily, has been reported to be a tumor suppressor gene that mediates diverse cellular bio-functions. Recent studies have shown that the FoxO transcription factors play a pivotal role during cancer progression. Here, we explored the correlation between HepaCAM and the FoxO family via regulation of the PI3K/AKT pathway. METHODS: HepaCAM and FoxO3 expression were detected by immunohistochemistry staining. We detected the effect of HepaCAM on the proliferation and viability of bladder cancer through AKT signaling by colony formation, the MTT assay and Western blotting. We observed the nuclear translocation of FoxO3 by immunofluorescence staining after expressing HepaCAM. RESULTS: HepaCAM depletion was discovered in bladder cancer tissues compared with adjacent normal tissues, and the decreased level was associated with the degradation of FoxO3. Furthermore, re-expression of HepaCAM significantly disrupted T24 and BIU-87 cell colony formation, as well as reduced p-AKT and p-FoxO protein expression. We found that the combined treatment of HepaCAM-overexpressing adenovirus with the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 enhanced the inhibitory effects on cell proliferation, viability and protein expression. Additionally, overexpressed HepaCAM decreased the activated effect on cell proliferation, viability and protein expression of the AKT activator SC79. Moreover, we observed that HepaCAM induced nuclear translocation of FoxO3. CONCLUSIONS: Our research implicated that HepaCAM may function as a novel therapeutic target that inhibits the proliferation of bladder cancer via the AKT/FoxO pathway.
28222670	MicroRNA-223-3p inhibits human bladder cancer cell migration and invasion.	The regulation of initiation and progression during carcinogenesis of bladder carcinoma is not completely elucidated. Dysregulation of microRNAs has been detected to play critical roles in the development of various cancers, including bladder carcinoma, whereas the involvement of miR-223-3p in the tumorigenesis of bladder carcinoma has not been studied. Here, we show that significantly higher levels of nuclear receptor coactivator 1 and significantly lower levels of miR-223-3p were detected in bladder carcinoma tissue, compared to the adjacent non-tumor tissue. In addition, the levels of nuclear receptor coactivator 1 and miR-223-3p were inversely correlated. Moreover, low miR-223-3p levels in bladder carcinoma specimens were associated with poor prognosis. In vitro, depletion of miR-223-3p increased bladder carcinoma cell invasion, which was abolished by overexpression of nuclear receptor coactivator 1. Bioinformatics studies demonstrate that miR-223-3p may bind to the 3'-UTR of nuclear receptor coactivator 1 messenger RNA to inhibit its protein translation in bladder carcinoma cells. Together, our study highlights miR-223-3p as a previously unrecognized microRNA that inhibits bladder carcinoma invasiveness via nuclear receptor coactivator 1, and this finding may be important for developing innovative therapeutic targets in treating bladder carcinoma.
28222669	Downregulated XPA promotes carcinogenesis of bladder cancer via impairment of DNA repair.	Bladder cancer is the most common malignant tumor of urinary system, largely resulting from failure of repair of DNA damage to the environmental insults. The function of XPA in nucleotide excision repair pathway has been well documented. However, participation of XPA in the repair of DNA double-strand break remains unknown. Here, we reported that bladder cancer expressed low XPA levels compared to adjacent non-tumor bladder tissue, and this phenotype was closely associated with chromosomal aberrations. Moreover, downregulated XPA appeared to increase incidence of chromosome aberration. XPA reduction increased cell viability of a bladder cancer cell line RT4, while XPA re-expression decreased the cell viability of RT4 cells. Since high mutation frequency is the basis of mutations of oncogenes and anti-oncogenes, and may be the essence of bladder cancer susceptibility, our study suggests that downregulated XPA may promote carcinogenesis of bladder cancer via impairment of DNA repair.
28219587	Management of Bladder Cancer After Renal Transplantation.	OBJECTIVES: In renal transplant recipients, the risk of developing bladder cancer and rate of diagnosis of advanced staged bladder cancer are generally higher than the general population. Also, it is more challenging to treat renal transplant recipients than the regular patient population. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of radical cystectomy (RC) and urinary diversion with ileal conduit in renal transplant recipients. METHODS: We identified 2 patients with prior history of renal transplantation who underwent RC and ileal conduit urinary diversion for bladder cancer. Preoperative clinical and demographic data were presented and outcomes were assessed. RESULTS: The RC and ileal conduit urinary diversion were performed in the first patient 56 months after renal transplantation and in the second patient 64 months after renal transplantation. Clinical staging was high-grade T2 transitional cell cancer of the bladder for patient 1 and T2 with pure squamous cell cancer of the bladder for patient 2. No perioperative or postoperative complication and no graft dysfunction occurred in either patient. CONCLUSION: Our experience demonstrated that RC with ileal conduit reconstruction in renal transplant recipients is safe and feasible.
28214651	A review on the evolution of PD-1/PD-L1 immunotherapy for bladder cancer: The future is now.	The treatment of bladder cancer has evolved over time to encompass not only the traditional modalities of chemotherapy and surgery, but has been particularly impacted by the use of immunotherapy. The first immunotherapy was the live, attenuated bacterial Bacillus Calmette-Guerin vaccine, which has been the standard of care non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer since 1990. Modern immunotherapy has focused on inhibitors of checkpoint proteins, which are molecules that impede immune function, thereby allowing tumor cells to grow and proliferate unregulated. Several checkpoint targets (programmed death ligand-1 [PD-L1] programmed cell death protien-1 [PD-1], and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associated protein 4 [CTLA4]) have received the most attention in the treatment of bladder cancer, and have inhibitor agents either approved or in late-stage development. This review describes the most recent data on agents that inhibit PD-L1, found on the surface of tumor cells, and PD-1 found on activated T and B cells and macrophages. Atezolizumab is the only member of this class currently approved for the treatment of bladder cancer, but nivolumab, pembrolizumab, durvalumab, and avelumab all have positive results for this indication, and approvals are anticipated in the near future. The checkpoint inhibitors offer an effective alternative for patients for whom previously there were few options for durable responses, including those who are ineligible for cisplatin-based regimens or who are at risk of significant toxicity. Research is ongoing to further categorize responses, define ideal patient populations, and investigate combinations of checkpoint inhibitors to address multiple pathways in immune system functioning.
28214368	Evaluation of deformable image registration between external beam radiotherapy and HDR brachytherapy for cervical cancer with a 3D-printed deformable pelvis phantom.	PURPOSE: In this study, we developed a 3D-printed deformable pelvis phantom for evaluating spatial DIR accuracy. We then evaluated the spatial DIR accuracies of various DIR settings for cervical cancer. METHODS: A deformable female pelvis phantom was created based on patient CT data using 3D printing. To create the deformable uterus phantom, we first 3D printed both a model of uterus and a model of the internal cavities of the vagina and uterus. We then made a mold using the 3D printed uterus phantom. Finally, urethane was poured into the mold with the model of the internal cavities in place, creating the deformable uterus phantom with a cavity into which an applicator could be inserted. To create the deformable bladder phantom, we first 3D printed models of the bladder and of the same bladder scaled down by 2 mm. We then made a mold using the larger bladder model. Finally, silicone was poured into the mold with the smaller bladder model in place to create the deformable bladder phantom with a wall thickness of 2 mm. To emulate the anatomical bladder, water was poured into the created bladder. We acquired phantom image without applicator for EBRT. Then, we inserted the applicator into the phantom to simulate BT. In this situation, we scanned the phantom again to obtain the phantom image for BT. We performed DIR using the two phantom images in two cases: Case A, with full bladder (170 ml) in both EBRT and BT images; and Case B with full bladder in the BT image and half-full bladder (100 ml) in the EBRT image. DIR was evaluated using Dice similarity coefficients (DSCs) and 31 landmarks for the uterus and 25 landmarks for the bladder. A hybrid intensity and structure DIR algorithm implemented in RayStation with four DIR settings was evaluated. RESULTS: On visual inspection, reasonable agreement in shape of the uterus between the phantom and patient CT images was observed for both EBRT and BT, although some regional disagreements in shape of the bladder and rectum were apparent. The created phantom could reproduce the actual patient's uterus deformation by the applicator. For both Case A and B, large variation was seen in landmark error among the four DIR parameters. In addition, although DSCs were comparable, moderate differences in landmark error existed between the two different DIR parameters selected from the four DIR parameters (i.e., DSC = 0.96, landmark error = 13.2 +/- 5.7 mm vs. DSC = 0.97, landmark error = 9.7 +/- 4.0 mm). This result suggests that landmark error evaluation might thus be more effective than DSC for evaluating DIR accuracy. CONCLUSIONS: Our developed phantom enabled the evaluation of spatial DIR accuracy for the female pelvic region for the first time. Although the DSCs are high, the spatial errors can still be significant and our developed phantom facilitates their quantification. Our results showed that optimization is needed to identify suitable DIR settings. For determining suitable DIR settings, our method of evaluating spatial DIR accuracy using the 3D-printed phantom may prove helpful.
28214286	[Partial delegation to radiation therapists of the control by cone beam CT of prostate positioning].	PURPOSE: Intensity modulated radiotherapy for prostate cancer involves daily monitoring of the positioning of the prostate, possible with cone beam CT (CBCT). It allows increased accuracy compared to readjustments but induces an increase in the time dedicated to these medical checks. The aim of the study was to evaluate the possibility of delegation of this task to the radiation therapists by comparing their readjustments to the doctors. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Five consecutive patients treated with radiation for prostate cancer (76Gy) were analysed. All had a daily CBCT for position control. The movements of the prostate relative to the bony part, the positional variations of the prostate measured by the radiation therapists and the doctors and medical time required to analyse imagery (filling of the rectum and bladder and perform a recalibration) were measured. RESULTS: One hundred seventy-six CBCT were analysed or 980 steps in the three axes. The movements of the prostate relative to bony part were respectively at least 5mm in 19%, 7% and 3% in the anterior-posterior, upper-lower and right-left axes. Changes readjustments between radiation therapists and doctors were in 95% of cases at the most 4mm in the anterior-posterior and upper-lower axis, and 3mm in the left-right axis. The time for medical use of the CBCT averaged 8min 40 [4 to 22min]. CONCLUSION: The daily readjustment on the prostate using CBCT may be delegated to radiation therapists with acceptable concordance of less than 4mm for 95% of measurements. An initial and ongoing training will ensure treatment safety.
28212060	Pembrolizumab as Second-Line Therapy for Advanced Urothelial Carcinoma.	BACKGROUND: Patients with advanced urothelial carcinoma that progresses after platinum-based chemotherapy have a poor prognosis and limited treatment options. METHODS: In this open-label, international, phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned 542 patients with advanced urothelial cancer that recurred or progressed after platinum-based chemotherapy to receive pembrolizumab (a highly selective, humanized monoclonal IgG4kappa isotype antibody against programmed death 1 [PD-1]) at a dose of 200 mg every 3 weeks or the investigator's choice of chemotherapy with paclitaxel, docetaxel, or vinflunine. The coprimary end points were overall survival and progression-free survival, which were assessed among all patients and among patients who had a tumor PD-1 ligand (PD-L1) combined positive score (the percentage of PD-L1-expressing tumor and infiltrating immune cells relative to the total number of tumor cells) of 10% or more. RESULTS: The median overall survival in the total population was 10.3 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 8.0 to 11.8) in the pembrolizumab group, as compared with 7.4 months (95% CI, 6.1 to 8.3) in the chemotherapy group (hazard ratio for death, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.59 to 0.91; P=0.002). The median overall survival among patients who had a tumor PD-L1 combined positive score of 10% or more was 8.0 months (95% CI, 5.0 to 12.3) in the pembrolizumab group, as compared with 5.2 months (95% CI, 4.0 to 7.4) in the chemotherapy group (hazard ratio, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.37 to 0.88; P=0.005). There was no significant between-group difference in the duration of progression-free survival in the total population (hazard ratio for death or disease progression, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.81 to 1.19; P=0.42) or among patients who had a tumor PD-L1 combined positive score of 10% or more (hazard ratio, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.61 to 1.28; P=0.24). Fewer treatment-related adverse events of any grade were reported in the pembrolizumab group than in the chemotherapy group (60.9% vs. 90.2%); there were also fewer events of grade 3, 4, or 5 severity reported in the pembrolizumab group than in the chemotherapy group (15.0% vs. 49.4%). CONCLUSIONS: Pembrolizumab was associated with significantly longer overall survival (by approximately 3 months) and with a lower rate of treatment-related adverse events than chemotherapy as second-line therapy for platinum-refractory advanced urothelial carcinoma.

28209239	Decreased REG1alpha expression suppresses growth, invasion and angiogenesis of bladder cancer.	BACKGROUND: Previous study has indicated association between REG1alpha and bladder cancer. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of Regenerating gene I alpha (REG1alpha) in bladder cancer. METHODS: The role of REG1alpha in bladder cancer cell proliferation, migration and VEGF-induced angiogenesis was explored in vitro and in vivo. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis was assessed to determine the expression of REG1alpha in ten paired bladder cancer and adjacent non-cancerous tissues, and in 296 bladder cancer samples. RESULTS: Down-regulation of REG1alpha expression significantly reduced the proliferation, migration, invasion and VEGF-induced angiogenesis in vitro and the growth of xenograft tumors in vivo. VEGF expression in bladder cancer is associated with REG1alpha expression and recurrence. REG1alpha was overexpressed in bladder cancer tissues compared with adjacent normal samples. Patients with elevated REG1alpha exhibited shorter recurrence times and poor survival. CONCLUSION: Downregulation of REG1alpha expression can reduce tumor growth, migration, invasion and angiogenesis. Our study demonstrates that REG1alpha can be used as a marker of recurrence and prognosis in bladder cancer. Therefore, REG1alpha targeting in bladder cancer patients represents a promising therapeutic strategy.
28207521	Quantitative assessment of the relationship between RASSF1A gene promoter methylation and bladder cancer (PRISMA).	BACKGROUND: Methylation of the Ras-association domain family 1 isoform A (RASSF1A) gene promoter region is thought to participate in the initiation and development of many different cancers. However, in bladder cancer the role of RASSF1A methylation was unclear. To evaluate the relationship between RASSF1A methylation and bladder cancer, a quantitative assessment of an independent meta-analysis was performed. In addition, a DNA methylation microarray database from the cancer genome atlas (TCGA) project was used to validate the results of the meta-analysis. METHODS: We searched published articles from computerized databases, and DNA methylation data were extracted from TCGA project. All data were analyzed by R software. RESULTS: The results of the meta-analysis indicated that the frequency of RASSF1A gene methylation in bladder cancer patients is significantly higher than in healthy controls. The hazard ratio (HR) was 2.24 (95% CI = [1.45; 3.48], P = 0.0003) for overall survival (OS), and the RASSF1A gene promoter methylation status was strongly associated with the TNM stage and differentiation grade of the tumor. The similar results were also found by the data from TCGA project. CONCLUSION: There was a significant relationship between the methylation of the RASSF1A gene promoter and bladder cancer. Therefore, RASSF1A gene promoter methylation will be a potential biomarker for the clinical diagnosis of bladder cancer.
28207504	Unusual presentation of direct intraperitoneal metastases complicated with massive ascites from plasmacytoid variant of bladder cancer and adenocarcinoma of colon: A case report and literature review.	BACKGROUND: Plasmacytoid urothelial carcinoma (PUC) is a distinct variant of urinary bladder cancer, with a high propensity for invasion and poor prognosis. These tumors occur most commonly in male patients with the age of reported cases ranging from 46 to 87 years. CASE REPORT: We present a case of a 74-year-old male patient having massive ascites and bilateral lower leg edema. Colonoscopy showed a 3-cm lesion in the sigmoid colon and an edematous nonpapillary tumor was found by cystoscopy in the bladder. Histopathology analysis of the biopsies showed adenocarcinoma of colon and PUC of bladder. The diagnosis of PUC with peritoneal carcinomatosis was then confirmed by immunohistochemical stain. CONCLUSION: The diagnostic dilemmas of the unusual variant of urothelial malignancy, the origin of peritoneal metastasis, and its clinical impact are discussed in the present case.
28196288	Clinical adequacy assessment of autocontours for prostate IMRT with meaningful endpoints.	PURPOSE: To determine if radiation treatment plans created based on autosegmented (AS) regions-of-interest (ROI)s are clinically equivalent to plans created based on manually segmented ROIs, where equivalence is evaluated using probabilistic dosimetric metrics and probabilistic biological endpoints for prostate IMRT. METHOD AND MATERIALS: Manually drawn contours and autosegmented ROIs were created for 167 CT image sets acquired from 19 prostate patients. Autosegmentation was performed utilizing Pinnacle's Smart Probabilistic Image Contouring Engine. For each CT set, 78 Gy/39 fraction 7-beam IMRT treatment plans with 1 cm CTV-to-PTV margins were created for each of the three contour scenarios; PMD using manually delineated (MD) ROIs, PAS using autosegmented ROIs, and PAM using autosegmented organ-at-risks (OAR)s and the manually drawn target. For each plan, 1000 virtual treatment simulations with different systematic errors for each simulation and a different random error for each fraction were performed. The statistical probability of achieving dose-volume metrics (coverage probability (CP)), expectation values for normal tissue complication probability (NTCP), and tumor control probability (TCP) metrics for all possible cross-evaluation pairs of ROI types and planning scenarios were reported. In evaluation scenarios, the root mean square loss (RMSL) and maximum absolute loss (MAL) of coverage probability of dose-volume objectives, E[TCP], and E[NTCP] were compared with respect to the base plan created and evaluated with manually drawn contours. RESULTS: Femoral head dose objectives were satisfied in all situations, as well as the maximum dose objectives for all ROIs. Bladder metrics were within the clinical coverage tolerances except D35Gy for the autosegmented plan evaluated with the manual contours. Dosimetric indices for CTV and rectum could be highly compromised when the definition of the ROIs switched from manually delineated to autosegmented. Seventy-two percent of CT image sets satisfied the worst-case CP thresholds for all dosimetric objectives in all scenarios, the percentage dropped to 50% if biological indices were taken into account. Among evaluation scenarios, (MD,PAM ) bore the highest resemblance to (MD,PMD ) where 99% and 88% of cases met all CP thresholds for bladder and rectum, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: When including daily setup variations in prostate IMRT, the dose-volume metric CP, and biological indices of ROIs were approximately equivalent for the plans created based on manually drawn targets and autosegmented OARs in 88% of cases. The accuracy of autosegmented prostates and rectums are impediment to attain statistically equivalent plans created based on manually drawn ROIs.
28195861	Perioperative Management of a Patient With an Intrathecal Drug Delivery Device Infusing Ziconotide: A Case Report.	Intrathecal ziconotide is used for the treatment of chronic pain and is delivered by an implanted drug delivery device. Anesthesiologists should be familiar with the perioperative management of the pump as well as the potential adverse events related to continued ziconotide infusion during general anesthesia. A case is presented demonstrating the perioperative management of an intrathecal drug delivery device infusing ziconotide in a patient presenting for radical cystectomy with pelvic lymphadenectomy and ileal conduit diversion.
28187997	[Adjuvant radiotherapy for bladder cancer in patients with risk of locoregional recurrence: Who, what and how?]	Radical cystectomy with extended pelvic lymph node dissection remains the standard of care for non-metastatic muscle-invasive bladder cancer. Locoregional control is a key factor in the outcome of patients since it is related to overall survival, metastasis-free survival and specific survival. Locoregional recurrence rate is directly correlated to pathological results and the quality of lymphadenectomy. In addition, while pre- or postoperative chemotherapy improved overall survival, it showed no impact on locoregional recurrence-free survival. Several recent publications have led to the development of a nomogram that predicts the risk of locoregional recurrence, in order to identify patients for which adjuvant radiotherapy could be beneficial. International cooperative groups have then come together to provide the rational for adjuvant radiotherapy, reinforced by recent technical developments limiting toxicity, and to develop prospective studies to reduce the risk of relapse. The aim of this critical literature review is to provide an overview of the elements in favor of adjuvant radiation for patients treated for muscle-invasive bladder cancer.
28184944	Exploration of bladder cancer molecular mechanisms based on miRNA-mRNA regulatory network.	To explore the complex molecular mechanisms of bladder cancer, mRNA and miRNA expression profiles were combined for systematic analyses. A total of 18 common differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified from two mRNA expression datasets which consisted of 206 tumor and 74 normal tissues. Then, survival analysis based on the SurvExpress database showed that the common DEGs were able to significantly differentiate low- and high-risk groups in 4 public bladder cancer datasets (p<0.01). Notably, the tumor and normal samples were able to be almost clearly classified into 4 groups based on these identified common DEGs. In addition, 6 out of the 18 common DEGs, including ALDH1A1 and SRPX, are regulated by 6 reported miRNAs based on regulatory network analyses. Expression levels of the 6 DEGs were validated in 10 bladder cancer samples using RT-PCR, and the expression values were concordant with the microarray results. Collectively, our analyses indicated that various biological processes are involved in the development and progression of bladder cancer. Firstly, cell cycle checkpoints and DNA repair networks of cancer stem-like cells were regulated by high expression of ALDH1A1, and hence promoted tumor self-renewal or metastasis. Then, activation of HspB6 induced the angiogenesis process which provides necessary nutrition and oxygen for tumor cells. Moreover, downregulation of the expression of tumor-suppressor genes SRPX and FLNC further promoted apoptosis and metastasis. The identification of potential biological processes and genes can be helpful for the understanding of bladder cancer molecular mechanisms.
28179340	Different Gene Expression and Activity Pattern of Antioxidant Enzymes in Bladder Cancer.	The aim of this study was to evaluate the possible role in and contribution of antioxidant enzymes to bladder cancer (BC) etiology and recurrence after transurethral resection (TUR). We enrolled 40 patients with BC who underwent TUR and 100 sex- and age-matched healthy controls. The analysis was performed at diagnosis and recurrence, taking into account the time of recurrence. Gene expression of catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase 1 (GPX1) and manganese superoxide dismutase (SOD2) was determined in peripheral blood leukocytes. The activity of glutathione peroxidase 3 (GPX3) was examined in plasma, and GPX1 and copper-zinc containing superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) in erythrocytes. SOD2 and GPX1 expression and GPX1 and SOD1 activity were significantly higher in patients at diagnosis of BC in comparison to controls. In patients who had recurrence earlier than 1 year from TUR, CAT and SOD2 expression was lower (at diagnosis p=0.024 and p=0.434, at recurrence p=0.022 and p=0.010), while the GPX1 and GPX3 activity was higher (at diagnosis p=0.242 and p=0.394, at recurrence p=0.019 and p=0.025) compared to patients with recurrence after 1 year from TUR. This study revealed that the gene expression and activity of the antioxidant enzymes are elevated in blood of patients with BC, although a low expression of CAT might contribute to the recurrence of BC, in early prognosis.
28179333	Liver Metastasis of Urothelial Carcinoma with Hepatoid Features: An Unusual Morphological Finding.	Bladder cancer comprises of many well-known variants and divergent histologies, both of urothelial and adenocarcinomatous type. Extrahepatic tumors with features that resemble hepatocellular carcinoma, often referred to as hepatoid adenocarcinomas, have been described in many different organs, and are aggressive and prognostically unfavorable. Hepatoid features of bladder cancer are unusual and rarely reported. We report a unique case of a metastatic lesion to the liver consisting of a urothelial carcinoma with hepatoid features, a tumor that likely falls within the hepatoid adenocarcinoma spectrum. It is an unusual morphological finding in urothelial carcinoma and is important to recognize due to its potential for aggressive behavior, particularly when it involves a liver lesion in which hepatocellular carcinoma may be suspected.
28178718	Urothelial Carcinoma With Squamous Differentiation Is Associated With High Tumor Stage and Pelvic Lymph-Node Metastasis.	BACKGROUND: Squamous differentiation occurs in up to 20% of urothelial carcinoma cases and is thought to be an unfavorable prognostic factor. METHODS: Data from urothelial carcinoma in patients treated with cystectomy from 2002 to 2014 at Roswell Park Cancer Institute were retrospectively reviewed. A 2-tier system was adopted for stage analysis. T1 and T2 disease were grouped in organ-confined and low-stage categories, whereas T3 and T4 disease were grouped in high-stage categories. The extent of squamous differentiation was semi-quantified as focal (</=20%) or extensive (> 20%). RESULTS: Squamous differentiation occurred in 19.3% (47 of 244) of cases. Urothelial carcinoma with squamous differentiation presented with a significantly higher rate of high-stage disease compared with pure urothelial carcinoma (72.3% vs 43.1%; P < .01). The nodal metastatic rate in urothelial carcinoma with extensive squamous differentiation was significantly higher than that seen in pure urothelial carcinoma (46.2% vs 27.0%; P = .04). CONCLUSIONS: Urothelial carcinoma with squamous differentiation is associated with advanced tumor stage. In addition, urothelial carcinoma with extensive squamous differentiation presented with a significantly higher rate of nodal metastasis. These findings can be the contributing factors for the unfavorable clinical outcomes seen in patients with urothelial carcinoma and squamous differentiation.
28165387	Concurrent Autophagy Inhibition Overcomes the Resistance of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors in Human Bladder Cancer Cells.	Despite the potential therapeutic efficacy of epithelial growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors in the treatment of advanced stage bladder cancer, there currently is no clear evidence to support this hypothesis. In this study, we investigate whether the concurrent treatment of autophagy-blocking agents with EGFR inhibitors exerts synergistic anti-cancer effects in T24 and J82 human bladder cancer cells. Lapatinib and gefitinib were used as EGFR inhibitors, and bafilomycin A1 (BFA1), chloroquine (CQ) and 3-methyladenine (3-MA) were used as the pharmacologic inhibitors of autophagy activities. To assess the proliferative and self-renewal capabilities, the Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay and a clonogenic assay were performed, respectively. To examine apoptotic cell death, flow cytometry using annexin-V/propidium iodide (PI) was used. To measure the autophagy activities, the expression levels of LC3I and II was determined by Western blot analysis. To validate the synergistic effects of autophagy inhibition with EGFR inhibitors, we specifically blocked key autophagy regulatory gene ATG12 by transfection of small interference RNA and examined the phenotypic changes. Of note, lapatinib and gefitinib triggered autophagy activities in T24 and J82 human bladder cancer cells, as indicated by upregulation of LC3II. More importantly, inhibiting autophagy activities with pharmacologic inhibitors (BFA1, CQ or 3-MA) remarkably reduced the cell viabilities and clonal proliferation of T24 and J82 cells, compared to those treated with either of the agents alone. We also obtained similar results of the enhanced anti-cancer effects of EGFR inhibitors by suppressing the expression of ATG12. Notably, the apoptotic assay showed that synergistic anti-cancer effects were induced via the increase of apoptotic cell death. In summary, concomitant inhibition of autophagy activities potentiated the anti-cancer effects of EGFR inhibitors in human bladder cancer cells, indicating a novel therapeutic strategy to treat advanced bladder cancer.
28154264	Modifying Cationic Liposomes with Cholesteryl-PEG Prevents Their Aggregation in Human Urine and Enhances Cellular Uptake by Bladder Cancer Cells.	Intravesical drug delivery by cationic liposomes (Cat-LPs) represents a potent nanotechnology for enhancing therapeutic effects against bladder disorders. However, preventing the aggregation of Cat-LPs in urine poses a significant barrier. We report on an examination of the effect of modifying liposomes with polyethylene glycol (PEG) lipids to prevent Cat-LPs from aggregating in human urine. Although Cat-LPs underwent significant aggregation in human urine, introducing 5 mol% of PEG2k lipid or 2 mol% of PEG5k lipid completely inhibited the aggregation of the Cat-LPs. When 2 mol% of PEG2k lipids were introduced, the lipid structures of 1,2-distearoly-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DSPE) and 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycerol (DSG) greatly prevented aggregation compared with cholesterol. By contrast, when Cat-LPs, after incubation in urine, were exposed to bladder cancer cells, only introducing cholesteryl-PEG into the Cat-LPs showed a significant enhancement in cellular uptake. These results offer the potential for incorporating cholesteryl-PEG into Cat-LPs for achieving both stability in urine and effective cellular uptake.
28146082	An Integrated View of Aristolochic Acid Nephropathy: Update of the Literature.	The term "aristolochic acid nephropathy" (AAN) is used to include any form of toxic interstitial nephropathy that is caused either by ingestion of plants containing aristolochic acids (AA) as part of traditional phytotherapies (formerly known as "Chinese herbs nephropathy"), or by the environmental contaminants in food (Balkan endemic nephropathy). It is frequently associated with urothelial malignancies. Although products containing AA have been banned in most of countries, AAN cases remain regularly reported all over the world. Moreover, AAN incidence is probably highly underestimated given the presence of AA in traditional herbal remedies worldwide and the weak awareness of the disease. During these two past decades, animal models for AAN have been developed to investigate underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in AAN pathogenesis. Indeed, a more-in-depth understanding of these processes is essential to develop therapeutic strategies aimed to reduce the global and underestimated burden of this disease. In this regard, our purpose was to build a broad overview of what is currently known about AAN. To achieve this goal, we aimed to summarize the latest data available about underlying pathophysiological mechanisms leading to AAN development with a particular emphasis on the imbalance between vasoactive factors as well as a focus on the vascular events often not considered in AAN.
28145855	Association between GPX1 Pro189Leu polymorphism and the occurrence of bladder cancer in Morocco.	Worldwide, Bladder cancer is the most frequent male malignancy. It is the third most common male malignancy in Morocco. The risk factors for developing bladder cancer are multiples including dietary conditions, environmental exposure and oxidative stress. GPX1 gene encoding for the human cellular antioxidant enzyme glutathione peroxidase1 is a key factor in the cell detoxification process. GPX1 Pro198Leu polymorphism is associated with a decrease of enzyme activity and may contribute to bladder cancer susceptibility. The present case-control study was planned to assess the presence of GPX1 Pro198Leu polymorphism in Moroccan population to determine whether it is associated with the risk of developing bladder cancer in Moroccan patients. A total of 32 patients with bladder cancer and 40 healthy controls were enrolled. Genotyping of the GPX1 Pro198Leu polymorphism was carried out by PCR amplification and DNA sequencing. Pro198Leu polymorphism was observed in both bladder cancer patients and healthy controls. No significant association between the polymorphism and bladder cancer occurrence was found (Pro/Leu vs. Pro/Pro: p=0.425; Leu vs. Pro: p=0.435). For the analysis of Pro198Leu polymorphism and progression of bladder cancer, no association was observed neither for stages (Pro/Leu vs. Pro/Pro: p=0.500; Leu vs. Pro: p=0.500) nor grades (Pro/Leu vs. Pro/Pro: p=0.415; Leu vs. Pro: p=0.427). Our results clearly showed no significant association between Pro198Leu polymorphism and risk of bladder cancer in our population, suggesting that the effect of this polymorphism on bladder cancer development might be a result of a combination with other genetic alterations and/or non-genetic variables such as diet and lifestyle factors.
28139895	ALK-negative anaplastic large cell lymphoma with urinary bladder involvement diagnosed in urine cytology: A case report and literature review.	Anaplastic large cell lymphoma is an aggressive T-cell neoplasm. It rarely involves the urinary bladder, with just twelve cases reported thus far and only one being ALK-negative. Immunophenotyping (particularly for ALK) is mandatory, both for prognostic and therapeutic reasons. Herein, we report the case of a patient with an ALK-negative anaplastic large cell lymphoma involving the bladder which was diagnosed and fully characterized by immunocytochemistry in urine cytology. The patient underwent a cystoscopy and the urine sample disclosed tumor diathesis background and aggregates of atypical cells, with evidence of multinucleation and mitotic figures. Immunocytochemistry revealed strong membrane/Golgi positivity for CD30 and negativity for ALK. The patient was submitted to transurethral resection for therapeutic purposes, which confirmed the diagnosis. To the best of our knowledge, this represents only the third case of anaplastic large cell lymphoma with bladder involvement diagnosed in urine cytology and the very first with diagnostic findings allowing for immunophenotyping of the disease in a bladder wash. The present report reinforces the role of urine cytology as a suitable method for establishing an earlier diagnosis and characterization of the disease, avoiding submitting patients to invasive procedures like transurethral resections.

28135623	Molecular biomarkers to predict response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy for bladder cancer.	Cystectomy is the gold standard for treatment of localized muscle-invasive bladder cancer. However, about 50% of patients develop metastases within 2years after cystectomy and subsequently die for the disease. Neoadjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy before cystectomy improves the overall survival in patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer, and pathological response to neoadjuvant treatment (downstaging to pT1 at cystectomy) is a strong predictor of better disease-specific survival. Nevertheless, some patients do not benefit from neoadjuvant therapy. The identification of reliable biomarkers that could enable the clinicians to identify patients who will really benefit from neoadjuvant chemotherapy is a major issue. This approach could lead to individualized therapy, in order to optimize the chance of response, avoiding the impact of neoadjuvant treatment on quality of life and the delay of cystectomy in non-responder patients. However, no molecular predictive biomarkers have shown clinical utility. This paper aims to review currently available data about biomarkers predictive of response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in muscle-invasive bladder cancer.
28133711	Treatment of Pelvic Floor Disorders Following Neobladder.	Radical cystectomy remains the gold standard treatment for organ-confined high-grade recurrent or muscle-invasive bladder cancer. Orthotopic neobladder urinary diversion following cystectomy represents an option for patients wishing for continent urinary diversion. Female patients who undergo radical cystectomy with orthotopic bladder substitution are at risk for developing both common and neobladder-specific disorders of the pelvic floor, including urinary incontinence, hypercontinence, vaginal prolapse, and neobladder-vaginal fistula. Each of these sequelae can have significant impact on the patient's quality of life. Due to the increased frequency of orthotopic neobladder creation in women, subspecialty urologists are more likely to confront such pelvic floor disorders in bladder cancer survivors. This review presents the most current information on the treatment of pelvic floor disorders after orthotopic bladder substitution.
28126222	Diffusion-Weighted Genitourinary Imaging.	This review article aims to provide an overview on of diffusion-weighted MR imaging (DW-MR imaging) in the urogenital tract. Compared with conventional cross-sectional imaging methods, the additional value of DW-MR imaging in the detection and further characterization of benign and malignant lesions of the kidneys, bladder, prostate, and pelvic lymph nodes is discussed as well as the role of DW-MR imaging in the evaluation of treatment response.
28126213	Upper and Lower Tract Urothelial Imaging Using Computed Tomography Urography.	Computed tomography (CT) urography is the best noninvasive method of evaluating the upper urinary tract for urothelial malignancies. However, the utility of CT urography is heavily contingent on the use of proper image acquisition protocols. This article focuses on the appropriate protocols for optimizing CT urography acquisitions, including contrast administration and the timing of imaging acquisitions, as well as the use of ancillary techniques to increase collecting system distention. In addition, imaging findings are discussed that should raise concern for urothelial carcinoma at each of the 3 segments of the urinary tract: the intrarenal collecting systems, ureters, and bladder.
28120570	Preoperative Lymphocyte-Monocyte Ratio Ameliorates the Accuracy of Differential Diagnosis in Non-Metastatic Infiltrative Renal Masses.	PURPOSE: Distinguishing infiltrative renal cell carcinoma (RCC) from transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) is a challenging issue due to their radiologic similarities. We evaluated systemic inflammatory biomarkers as parameters for distinguishing tumor types. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A computerized search of medical records from November 2005 to October 2015 identified 116 patients with infiltrative renal masses who were difficult to diagnose confirmatively in radiological study. We investigated the diagnostic efficacy among these patients with their preoperative absolute neutrophil counts (ANC), absolute lymphocyte counts (ALC), absolute monocyte counts (AMC), neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), and lymphocyte-monocyte ratio (LMR). RESULTS: The infiltrative RCC group demonstrated significantly lower ALC {1449/muL (1140-1896), median [interquartile range (IQR)]} than the TCC group [1860/muL (1433-2342), p=0.016]. LMR [median (IQR)] also was lower in the infiltrative RCC group [2.98 (2.32-4.14) vs. TCC group 4.10 (2.86-6.09); p=0.011]. In subgroup analysis, non-metastatic infiltrative RCC showed lower ALC and LMR and higher NLR than non-metastatic TCC. Within non-metastatic infiltrative renal masses, multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that younger patient age and lower LMR were associated with infiltrative RCC [odds ratios (OR) 0.874, p=0.024 and OR 0.461, p=0.048, respectively]. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed that younger age and lower LMR were highly predictive of non-metastatic RCC (area under the curve=0.919, p<0.001). CONCLUSION: Age and LMR were significantly different between patients with infiltrative renal mass. These are potential markers for distinguishing between infiltrative RCC and TCC without metastasis.
28118455	Trends and Patterns of Disparities in Cancer Mortality Among US Counties, 1980-2014.	Introduction: Cancer is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States and results in a high economic burden. Objective: To estimate age-standardized mortality rates by US county from 29 cancers. Design and Setting: Deidentified death records from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) and population counts from the Census Bureau, the NCHS, and the Human Mortality Database from 1980 to 2014 were used. Validated small area estimation models were used to estimate county-level mortality rates from 29 cancers: lip and oral cavity; nasopharynx; other pharynx; esophageal; stomach; colon and rectum; liver; gallbladder and biliary; pancreatic; larynx; tracheal, bronchus, and lung; malignant skin melanoma; nonmelanoma skin cancer; breast; cervical; uterine; ovarian; prostate; testicular; kidney; bladder; brain and nervous system; thyroid; mesothelioma; Hodgkin lymphoma; non-Hodgkin lymphoma; multiple myeloma; leukemia; and all other cancers combined. Exposure: County of residence. Main Outcomes and Measures: Age-standardized cancer mortality rates by county, year, sex, and cancer type. Results: A total of 19511910 cancer deaths were recorded in the United States between 1980 and 2014, including 5656423 due to tracheal, bronchus, and lung cancer; 2484476 due to colon and rectum cancer; 1573593 due to breast cancer; 1077030 due to prostate cancer; 1157878 due to pancreatic cancer; 209314 due to uterine cancer; 421628 due to kidney cancer; 487518 due to liver cancer; 13927 due to testicular cancer; and 829396 due to non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Cancer mortality decreased by 20.1% (95% uncertainty interval [UI], 18.2%-21.4%) between 1980 and 2014, from 240.2 (95% UI, 235.8-244.1) to 192.0 (95% UI, 188.6-197.7) deaths per 100000 population. There were large differences in the mortality rate among counties throughout the period: in 1980, cancer mortality ranged from 130.6 (95% UI, 114.7-146.0) per 100000 population in Summit County, Colorado, to 386.9 (95% UI, 330.5-450.7) in North Slope Borough, Alaska, and in 2014 from 70.7 (95% UI, 63.2-79.0) in Summit County, Colorado, to 503.1 (95% UI, 464.9-545.4) in Union County, Florida. For many cancers, there were distinct clusters of counties with especially high mortality. The location of these clusters varied by type of cancer and were spread in different regions of the United States. Clusters of breast cancer were present in the southern belt and along the Mississippi River, while liver cancer was high along the Texas-Mexico border, and clusters of kidney cancer were observed in North and South Dakota and counties in West Virginia, Ohio, Indiana, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Texas, Alaska, and Illinois. Conclusions and Relevance: Cancer mortality declined overall in the United States between 1980 and 2014. Over this same period, there were important changes in trends, patterns, and differences in cancer mortality among US counties. These patterns may inform further research into improving prevention and treatment.
28116745	Response to Cabazitaxel Beyond 20 Cycles in A Patient with Penile Metastasis of Prostate Cancer: A Case Report.	Penile metastases are extremely rare events and generally occurs at a late stage of primary disease. They mostlyoriginate from prostate and bladder in the genitourinary tract. Penile metastases have a dismal prognosis and verylow survival rates. We report a case of penile metastasis in 70-year-old geriatric male patient with prostatic adenocarcinomawho was treated with cabazitaxel chemotherapy beyond 20 cycles with a good response and acceptableminimal toxicity.
28116744	Refractory Haematuria Resulting From Peritoneal Dissemination of Metastatic Gastric Cancer: Radiation Therapy For A Nodule Infiltrating The Urinary Bladder.	Bladder metastases from remote primary sites are rarely reported. We present a case of haematuria caused by infiltrationof the urinary bladder wall by a nodule resulting from peritoneal dissemination of a primary gastric tumour.The nodule was detected by computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging and cystoscopy. Transarterialembolization or haemostasis could not be performed because of the haematuria, thus the vesical bleeding was treatedwith a low irradiation dose of 3 Gy/fraction for a total of 30 Gy administered to the dome of the urinary bladder.No adverse effects occurred, and the gross haematuria and nodule resolved within 1 week. Thus, radiotherapyshould be considered for treatment of visceral bleeding caused by peritoneal dissemination of gastric cancer whenother methods of haemostasis cannot be performed.
28113097	The immune infiltrate in prostate, bladder and testicular tumors: An old friend for new challenges.	In genito-urinary tumors immunotherapy has been administered for a long time: Calmette-Guerin Bacillus as adjuvant treatment in high risk patients with non muscle invasive urothelial bladder cancer and interleukin-2 and interferon-alpha in metastatic kidney cancer. The vaccine Sipuleucel-T has been approved by United States Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of castration resistant prostate cancer patients with asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic disease, given the 22% reduction of mortality risk in this group. Recently immunotherapeutic agents targeting inhibitory immune checkpoint molecules lead to improved outcomes and lasting anti-tumor effects in a variety of hematological and solid malignancies, including urogenital tumors. The benefit from these treatments has been observed only in a proportion of subjects, raising a need in optimizing patients' selection for immune checkpoint blockade. The composition and activity of a pre-existing immune infiltrate may aid in identifying ideal candidates to immunotherapy, with possible implications for the clinical management of neoplastic diseases from earlier to later stages.
28110509	Urine cytology findings of primary paraganglioma of the urinary bladder: Case report.	Paraganglioma (PG) of the urinary bladder was detected in a 64-year-old male who was admitted to the hospital with gross hematuria. In voided urine, atypical cells were scattered as nests and single cells on low-power view. On higher-power view, tumor nests were composed of epithelioid cells with fine chromatin and moderate cytoplasm admixed with occasional spindle sustentacular cells. Single cells were discohesive and large with moderate cytoplasm and inconspicuous nucleoli. Subsequent cystoscopy revealed a solid oval mass. Histologically, tumor from the resected bladder showed infiltrating nested tumor cells with abundant cytoplasm. Immunohistochemically, the tumor cells were positive for synaptophysin, chromogranin, and CD56. The patient underwent partial cystectomy and was discharged without complications. Diagn.

28110502	Accuracy and Reproducibility of Nuclear/Cytoplasmic Ratio Assessments in Urinary Cytology Specimens.	BACKGROUND: Evaluation of the nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio is commonly used for assessment of the presence of malignancy and for grading and typing of malignant neoplasms. Despite its widespread usage, little information exists regarding the accuracy and reproducibility of non-automated assessment. METHODS: Forty-seven cells obtained from Papanicolaou stained urine cytologies were assessed by quantitative image analysis for nuclear area and cell area. The nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio was calculated. Visual estimates of the N/C ratio were made by six pathologists. Statistical analysis was performed to determine accuracy, precision, and interrater reliability. RESULTS: True N/C ratios varied from 0.02 to 0.81. 27% of cases demonstrated a true N/C ratio between 0.5 and 0.7. Quantitative estimates of N/C ratios were less precise and less accurate at high N/C ratios. The coefficient of variation was 27%. The majority of raters demonstrated decreased accuracy and precision of estimates as N/C ratio increased. Overall classification accuracy was 73%. Accuracy of classification was 53% for cases with a true N/C ratio between 0.4 and 0.8. Absolute interrater agreement was 75%. Chance corrected agreement (kappa) was 0.54. CONCLUSIONS: Visual quantitation of N/C ratio showed only a fair correlation with actual N/C ratio with correlation decreasing with increasing N/C ratio. In the critical range, 0.5-0.7 N/C ratio both interobserver correlation and correlation with true N/C ratio may be insufficiently accurate for precise category assignment as used in the Paris System.

28110463	Biomarkers of Renal Tumors: the Current State and Clinical Perspectives.	Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) ranks the first death rate among the urogenital tumors, whereas its incidence follows the incidences of prostate and bladder cancer. The diagnosis of RCC at early stages allows immediately undertaking appropriate treatment, which significantly increases patients' survival rate. Early and accurate diagnosis avoids inadequate treatment, provides the disease progression forecast, and permits to apply more efficient therapy. Unfortunately, the small renal tumors are usually asymptomatic resulting in the late diagnosis and, therefore, low efficacy of treatment. Thus, sensible and preventive biomarkers are essential for early RCC detection and monitoring of its progression. So far, many attempts were performed aimed at recognizing novel informative kidney tumor biomarkers applicable for early detection of the disease and possessing prognostic and predictive capabilities. This review summarizes recent advances in renal tumor biomarkers recognition, their diagnostic and prognostic values, and clinical feasibility.
28110453	Update on the Diagnosis and Treatment of Cholangiocarcinoma.	PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Cholangiocarcinoma is a rare biliary adenocarcinoma associated with poor outcomes. Cholangiocarcinoma is subdivided into extrahepatic and intrahepatic variants. Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma is then further differentiated into (1) peripheral mass-forming tumors and (2) central periductal infiltrating tumors. We aimed to review the currently known risk factors, diagnostic tools, and treatment options, as well as highlight the need for further clinical trials and research to improve overall survival rates. RECENT FINDINGS: Cholangiocarcinoma has seen significant increase in incidence rates over the last several decades. Most patients do not carry the documented risk factors, which include infections and inflammatory conditions, but cholangiocarcinoma typically forms in the setting of cholestasis and chronic inflammation. Management strategies include multispecialty treatments, with consideration of surgical resection, systemic chemotherapy, and targeted radiation therapy. Surgically resectable disease is the only curable treatment option, which may involve liver transplantation in certain selected cases. Referrals to centers of excellence, along with enrollment in novel clinical trials are recommended for patients with unresectable or recurrent disease. This article provides an overview of cholangiocarcinoma and discusses the current diagnosis and treatment options. While incidence is increasing and more risk factors are being discovered, much more work remains to improve outcomes of this ominous disease.
28107554	Inclusion of a variable RBE into proton and photon plan comparison for various fractionation schedules in prostate radiation therapy.	PURPOSE: A constant relative biological effectiveness (RBE) of 1.1 is currently used in proton radiation therapy to account for the increased biological effectiveness compared to photon therapy. However, there is increasing evidence that proton RBE vary with the linear energy transfer (LET), the dose per fraction, and the type of the tissue. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the impact of disregarding variations in RBE when comparing proton and photon dose plans for prostate treatments for various fractionation schedules using published RBE models and several alpha/beta assumptions. METHODS: Photon and proton dose plans were created for three generic prostate cancer cases. Three BED3Gy equivalent schedules were studied, 78, 57.2, and 42.8 Gy in 39, 15, and 7 fractions, respectively. The proton plans were optimized assuming a constant RBE of 1.1. By using the Monte Carlo calculated dose-averaged LET (LETd ) distribution and assuming alpha/beta values on voxel level, three variable RBE models were applied to the proton dose plans. The impact of the variable RBE was studied in the plan comparison, which was based on the dose distribution, DVHs, and normal tissue complication probabilities (NTCP) for the rectum. Subsequently, the physical proton dose was reoptimized for each proton plan based on the LETd distribution, to achieve a homogeneous RBE-weighted target dose when applying a specific RBE model and still fulfill the clinical goals for the rectum and bladder. RESULTS: All the photon and proton plans assuming RBE = 1.1 met the clinical goals with similar target coverage. The proton plans fulfilled the robustness criteria in terms of range and setup uncertainty. Applying the variable RBE models generally resulted in higher target doses and rectum NTCP compared to the photon plans. The increase was most pronounced for the fractionation dose of 2 Gy(RBE), whereas it was of less magnitude and more dependent on model and alpha/beta assumption for the hypofractionated schedules. The reoptimized proton plans proved to be robust and showed similar target coverage and doses to the organs at risk as the proton plans optimized with a constant RBE. CONCLUSIONS: Model predicted RBE values may differ substantially from 1.1. This is most pronounced for fractionation doses of around 2 Gy(RBE) with higher doses to the target and the OARs, whereas the effect seems to be of less importance for the hypofractionated schedules. This could result in misleading conclusions when comparing proton plans to photon plans. By accounting for a variable RBE in the optimization process, robust and clinically acceptable dose plans, with the potential of lowering rectal NTCP, may be generated by reoptimizing the physical dose. However, the direction and magnitude of the changes in the physical proton dose to the prostate are dependent on RBE model and alpha/beta assumptions and should therefore be used conservatively.
28106737	A Novel Combination RNAi toward Warburg Effect by Replacement with miR-145 and Silencing of PTBP1 Induces Apoptotic Cell Death in Bladder Cancer Cells.	Bladder cancer is one of the most difficult malignancies to control. We explored the use of a novel RNA-interference method for a driver oncogene regulating cancer specific energy metabolism by the combination treatment with a small interfering RNA (siRNA) and a microRNA. After transfection of T24 and 253JB-V cells with miR-145 and/or siR-PTBP1, we examined the effects of cell growth and gene expression by performing the trypan blue dye exclusion test, Western blot, Hoechst 33342 staining, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and electron microscopy. The anti-cancer effects of xenograft model mice with miR-145 and/or siR-PTBP1 were then assessed. The combination treatment induced the deeper and longer growth inhibition and reduced the levels of both mRNA and protein expression of c-Myc and polypyrimidine tract-binding protein 1 (PTBP1) more than each single treatment. Notably, the combination treatment not only impaired the cancer specific energy metabolism by inhibiting c-Myc/PTBP1/PKMs axis but also inactivated MAPK/ERK and PI3K/AKT pathways examined in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, the combination treatment induced apoptosis or autophagy; but, in some cells, apoptotic cell death was accompanied by autophagy, because the condensation of chromatin and many autophagosomes were coexistent. This combination treatment could be a novel RNA-interference strategy through the systemic silencing of the Warburg effect-promoting driver oncogene PTBP1 in bladder cancer cells.
28106244	Second malignancy risk in patients with bronchopulmonary carcinoids: epidemiological results from Italian Network of Cancer Registries.	PURPOSE: This epidemiological study aimed to determine the prevalence and characteristics of second tumors (STs) in patients with bronchopulmonary carcinoids (BCs). METHODS: Data on neuroendocrine carcinomas (NECs) from the AIRTUM registry (1975-2011) were used for the analysis. Among 32,325 NECs, we focused our analysis on 3,205 patients (9.9%) affected by BCs. The overall ST number and incidence were calculated. The number of STs was compared with the expected cancer number in the healthy Italian population, and the standardized incidence ratio (SIR) and 95% confidence intervals were calculated. RESULTS: The male/female ratio was 1.5:1 and the mean age 61.7 years (range: 7-94). A total of 640 STs were observed (overall incidence: 20%): 198 tumors were metachronous, 23 synchronous, and 419 occurred before the diagnosis of BC. The most common STs were bladder tumors (12.2%) followed by breast tumors (11.1%). We observed a large number of thyroid tumors (SIR = 3.88), with a remarkably higher frequency of thyroid tumors being synchronously detected with BC in female patients (SIR = 61.39). In male patients there was an increased frequency of urinary system tumors, in particular metachronous tumors of the kidney and renal pelvis (SIR = 3.34) and synchronous tumors of the urinary bladder (SIR = 11.48). CONCLUSIONS: A high frequency of STs is predictable in patients with BCs, with synchronous thyroid tumors being observed in women and kidney and urinary bladder tumors in men. However, these data should be interpreted with caution, considering that the diagnosis of such tumors often occurs as an incidental finding during investigations for other malignancies.
28095848	Laparoscopic versus open nephroureterectomy to treat localized and/or locally advanced upper tract urothelial carcinoma: oncological outcomes from a multicenter study.	BACKGROUND: Many studies have reported the oncological outcomes between open radical nephroureterectomy (ONU) and laparoscopic radical nephroureterectomy (LNU) of upper tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC). However, few data have focused on the oncological outcomes of LNU in the subgroup of localized and/or locally advanced UTUC (T1-4/N0-X). The purpose of this study was to compare the oncological outcomes of LNU vs. ONU for the treatment in patients with T1-4/N0-X UTUC. METHODS: We collected and analyzed the data and clinical outcomes retrospectively for 265 patients who underwent radical nephroureterectomy for T1-4/N0-X UTUC between April 2000 and April 2013 at two Chinese tertiary hospitals. Survival was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Cox's proportional hazards model was used for univariate and multivariate analysis. RESULTS: The mean patient age was 62.0 years and the median follow-up was 60.0 months. Of the 265 patients, 213 (80.4%) underwent conventional ONU, and 52 (19.6%) patients underwent LNU. The groups differed significantly in their presence of previous hydronephrosis, presence of previous bladder urothelial carcinoma, and management of distal ureter (P < 0.05). The predicted 5-year intravesical recurrence- free survival (RFS) (79% vs. 88%, P = 0.204), overall RFS (47% vs. 59%, P = 0.076), cancer-specific survival (CSS) (63% vs. 70%, P = 0.186), and overall survival (OS) (61% vs. 55%, P = 0.908) rates did not differ between the ONU and LNU groups. Multivariable Cox proportional regression analysis showed that surgical approach was not significantly associated with intravesical RFS (odds ratio [OR] 1.23, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.46-3.65, P = 0.622), Overall RFS (OR 0.99, 95% CI 0.54-1.83, P = 0.974), CSS (OR 1.38, 95% CI 0.616-3.13, P = 0.444), or OS (OR 1.61, 95% CI 0.81-3.17, P = 0.17). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this retrospective study showed no statistically significant differences in intravesical RFS, overall RFS, CSS, or OS between the laparoscopy and the open groups. Thus, LNU can be an alternative to the open procedure for T1-4/N0-X UTUC. Further studies, including a multi-institutional, prospective study are required to confirm these findings.
28088268	Aberrant beta-catenin expression in urothelial carcinomas in blackfoot disease-endemic areas.	Arsenic is a well-known toxic element and carcinogenic agent. The aim of this study was to investigate p63, E-cadherin, and beta-catenin proteins in urothelial carcinoma (UC) in both arsenic contaminated areas [so-called blackfoot disease (BFD) area] and non-BFD areas. The expressions of p63, E-cadherin, and beta-catenin proteins in 20 UC cases of blackfoot disease and 22 UC cases in non-BFD areas were detected using immunohistochemical methods. The results revealed a high p63 expression in 20 (47.6%) UC cases and high E-cadherin expression in six (14.3%) UC cases. Expressions of p63 and E-cadherin showed no significant correlations with clinicopathologic parameters. However, all 20 BFD cases and 12 of 22 (54.5%) non-BFD cases showed aberrant beta-catenin expression. Ten out of 22 (45.5%) non-BFD cases also had normal membranous immunoreactivity. The beta-catenin staining pattern significantly differed between cases in endemic and nonendemic areas of BFD (p=0.001). Tumor sites also significantly correlated with beta-catenin expression (p=0.044). In addition, membranous localization of beta-catenin was lower in UC from BFD-endemic areas compared with those from non-BFD endemic areas. In conclusion, it is suggested that relocalization of beta-catenin from membrane to cytoplasm may be involved in the tumorigenesis of UC from BFD-endemic areas.
28088216	Immunohistochemical features of giant cell ependymoma of the filum terminale with unusual clinical and radiological presentation.	BACKGROUND: Giant cell ependymoma of the filum terminale is a rare variant, generally manifested as a well-circunscribed intradural mass with an indolent biological behavior. CASE PRESENTATION: We describe the case of a 48-year-old Mexican female who non-relevant past medical history, that developed a GCE of the filum terminale. Magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography revealed the presence of an intra-axial tumor extending from L3 to L5 with extra-medullary invasion. Therefore the tumor was considered unresectable and only incisional biopsy was obtained, establishing the tentative diagnosis of a poorly differentiated neoplasia. A second evaluation of the case revealed the presence of numerous non-cohesive pleomorphic giant cells with intranuclear inclusions and broad eosinophilic cytoplasm, alternating with intermediate size cells with round, hyperchromatic nuclei and forming a perivascular pseudo-rosettes pattern. The ependymal phenotype was supported by light microscopy and corroborated by immunohistochemistry analysis. The patient was subsequently treated with radiotherapy 54Gy. She is alive after a 27-month follow-up, with residual disease, difficulty ambulating and pain. CONCLUSIONS: GCE of filum terminale may have an atypical clinical and radiological presentation, albeit with invasive characteristics and anaplasia on histologic analysis. However, its biological behavior is indolent and associated to longer survival. Due to the presence of giant cells, the differential diagnosis of other primary neoplasias at that site were considered, including paraganglioma, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors as well as metastatic malignant melanoma, adrenal carcinoma, thyroid gland carcinoma and urothelial carcinoma, that may all harbor giant cells.
28087474	FOXO1 down-regulation is associated with worse outcome in bladder cancer and adds significant prognostic information to p53 overexpression.	Nuclear FOXOs mediate cell cycle arrest and promote apoptosis. FOXOs and p53 could have similar effects as tumor suppressor genes. In spite of extensive literature, little is known about the role of FOXO1 and its relationship with p53 status in bladder cancer. Expression of FOXO1 and p53 were analyzed by immunohistochemistry in 162 urothelial carcinomas (UC). Decreased FOXO1 expression, p53 overexpression and the combination FOXO1 down-regulation/p53 overexpression were strongly associated with high grade (P=.030; P=.017; P=.004, respectively), high stage (P=.0001; P<.0001; P<.0001, respectively) or both (P=.0004; P<.0001; P<.0001, respectively). In the overall series of cases, p53 overexpression was associated with tumor progression (hazard ratio [HR]=3.18, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.19-8.48, P=.02), but this association was even stronger if having any alteration in any of the 2 genes was considered (HR=3.51, 95% CI 1.34-9.21, P=.01). Having both FOXO1 down-regulation and p53 overexpression was associated with disease recurrence (HR=2.75, 95% CI 1.06-7.13, P=.03). In the analysis of the different subgroups, having any alteration in any of the 2 genes was associated with progression in low-grade (P=.005) and pTa (P=.006) tumors. Finally, the combined FOXO1 down-regulation/p53 overexpression was associated with disease recurrence specifically in high-grade (P=.04) and in pT1 stage tumors (P=.007). Adding FOXO1 expression to the immunohistochemical analysis of p53 can provide relevant prognostic information on progression and recurrence of bladder cancer. It may be particularly informative on the risk of progression in the more indolent and on the risk of recurrence in the more aggressive tumors.
28081738	Silencing of Armadillo Repeat-Containing Protein 8 (ARMc8) Inhibits TGF-beta-Induced EMT in Bladder Carcinoma UMUC3 Cells.	Armadillo repeat-containing protein 8 (ARMc8) is a key factor in regulating cell migration, proliferation, tissue maintenance, and tumorigenesis. However, its role in bladder cancer remains unknown. Thus, in this study we sought to investigate the effect of ARMc8 on the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) progress in bladder cancer cells induced by transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1). Our results found that ARMc8 was highly expressed in bladder cancer cell lines. ARMc8 silencing inhibited the TGF-beta1-induced migration and invasion and suppressed the EMT progress in bladder cancer cells. Furthermore, ARMc8 silencing inhibited the TGF-beta1-induced expression of beta-catenin, cyclin D1, and c-myc in bladder cancer cells. In conclusion, the present study demonstrates a novel function for ARMc8, which acts as a mediator for TGF-beta1-induced cell migration/invasion through modulation of the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway in bladder cancer cells. This study suggests that ARMc8 may be a potential therapeutic target for the development of therapies for bladder cancer.
28077116	Quality of life and functional outcome after infravesical desobstruction and HIFU treatment for localized prostate cancer.	BACKGROUND: To evaluate quality of life, functional and oncological outcome after infravesical desobstruction and HIFU treatment for localized prostate cancer. METHODS: One hundred thirty-one patients, treated with TURP and HIFU in a single institution were followed up for oncological and functional outcome. Oncological outcome was quantified by biochemical recurrence free survival using the Stuttgart and Phoenix criteria. Quality of life was assessed by usage of standardized QLQ-C30 and QLQ-PR25 questionnaires. In addition, functional questionnaires such as IPSS and IIEF-5 were used. Complications were assessed by the Clavien-Dindo classification. RESULTS: One hundred thirty-one patients with a mean age of 72.8 years (SD: 6.0) underwent HIFU for prostate cancer (29.0% low risk, 58.8% intermediate risk, 12.2% high risk). PSA nadir was 0.6 ng/ml (SD: 1.2) after a mean of 4.6 months (SD: 5.7). Biochemical recurrence free survival defined by Stuttgart criteria was 73.7%, 84.4% and 62.5% for low-, intermediate- and high-risk patients after 22.2 months. Complications were grouped according to Clavien-Dindo and occurred in 10.7% (grade II) and 11.5% (grade IIIa) of cases. 35.1% of patients needed further treatment for bladder neck stricture. Regarding incontinence, 14.3%, 2.9% and 0% of patients had de novo urinary incontinence grade I degrees , II degrees and III degrees and 3.8% urge incontinence due to HIFU treatment. Patients were asked for the ability to have intercourse: 15.8%, 58.6% and 66.7% of patients after non-, onesided and bothsided nervesparing procedure were able to obtain sufficient erection for intercourse, respectively. Regarding quality of life, mean global health score according to QLQ-C30 was 69.4%. CONCLUSION: HIFU treatment for localized prostate cancer shows acceptable oncological safety. Quality of life after HIFU is better than in the general population and ranges within those of standard treatment options compared to literature. HIFU seems a safe valuable treatment alternative for patients not suitable for standard treatment.
28075465	Monoclonal antibody Zt/g4 targeting RON receptor tyrosine kinase enhances chemosensitivity of bladder cancer cells to Epirubicin by promoting G1/S arrest and apoptosis.	Epirubicin (EPI) is one of the most used intravesical chemotherapy agents after transurethral resection to non-muscle invasive bladder tumors (NMIBC) to prevent cancer recurrence and progression. However, even after resection of bladder tumors and intravesical chemotherapy, half of them will recur and progress. RON is a membrane tyrosine kinase receptor usually overexpressed in bladder cancer cells and associated with poor pathological features. This study aims to investigate the effects of anti-RON monoclonal antibody Zt/g4 on the chemosensitivity of bladder cells to EPI. After Zt/g4 treatment, cell cytotoxicity was significantly increased and cell invasion was markedly suppressed in EPI-treated bladder cancer cells. Further investigation indicated that combing Zt/g4 with EPI promoted cell G1/S-phase arrest and apoptosis, which are the potential mechanisms that RON signaling inhibition enhances chemosensitivity of EPI. Thus, combing antibody-based RON targeted therapy enhances the therapeutic effects of intravesical chemotherapy, which provides new strategy for further improvement of NMIBC patient outcomes.
28075173	TGFbeta1-Induced LncRNA UCA1 Upregulation Promotes Gastric Cancer Invasion and Migration.	According to recent studies, long noncoding RNA urothelial carcinoma associated 1 (UCA1) is involved in the development and progression of many malignant tumors, including gastric cancer (GC). We validated the detailed role of UCA1 in human GC cell lines and GC tissues so as to determine its exact function and the underlying mechanism of GC invasion and migration. In our research, lncRNA-UCA1 was specifically upregulated in GC tissues and cell lines, and augmented GC cell proliferation, and invasive and migratory capabilities. High UCA1 expression in GC was related with poorer prognosis (poorer invasion depth, lymph node metastasis, advanced TNM [T is for the original (primary) tumor, N for nearby (regional) lymph nodes that are involved, and M for distant metastasis] stage, and shorter overall survival). Epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT), associated with malignancy of cancers, was reported to be responsible for invasion and migration of cancer cells. Transforming growth factor beta1 (TGFbeta1)-induced EMT was well evaluated. UCA1 silence reduced the protein levels of EMT-related factors, vimentin and snail, while promoted E-cadherin and zonula occludens-1 protein levels in GC cells; the effect of UCA1 could be partly restored by TGFbeta1 treatment. Taken together, UCA1 might regulate the tumor proliferation, invasion, and metastasis under TGFbeta1 induction. Taken together, UCA1 might present a potential oncogenic factor by promoting GC cell proliferation, invasion, and migration. UCA1 could serve as a novel biomarker for prognosis and a novel therapeutic target of GC treatment.
28074341	Gap junction protein connexin43 deregulation contributes to bladder carcinogenesis via targeting MAPK pathway.	High expression of connexins was found in a variety of cancers, but their role is still controversial. We investigated whether connexin43 (Cx43) contributed to bladder carcinogenesis through MAPK activation. In this study, we found that Cx43 expression was significantly increased in bladder cancer tissues and cell line. Overexpression of Cx43 in bladder cancer 5637 cells increased cell proliferation, promoted cell cycle progression, and inhibited apoptosis. Western blot showed that JNK and ERK pathways were dramatically activated in Cx43-overexpressed cells. Conversely, knockdown of Cx43 inhibited cell proliferation by increasing apoptosis and causing cell cycle arrest, concomitant with inhibition of JNK and ERK signaling. In addition, JNK and ERK pathways were also activated in bladder cancer tissues. In conclusion, abnormal high expression and cytoplasmic localization of Cx43 contributed to bladder cancer. Inhibition of Cx43 activity could be a potential therapeutic strategy for preventing the progression of bladder cancer.
28074276	In stage pT1 non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC), high KRT20 and low KRT5 mRNA expression identify the luminal subtype and predict recurrence and survival.	Differential expression of cytokeratins (CK) is a characteristic feature of chemoresistant luminal (KRT20) and chemosensitive intrinsic aggressive basal (KRT5) subtypes in muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC). We investigated mRNA expression of KRT5 and KRT20 and its predictive value in stage pT1 bladder cancer. In retrospective analysis of clinical data and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues (FFPE) of patients with stage pT1 NMIBC who underwent transurethral resection of the bladder, a single-step RT-qPCR was used to measure mRNA expression. Furthermore, immunohistochemical (IHC) staining of CK20, panCK, and MIB1 was performed. Valid measurements were obtained from 231 samples out of a series of 284 patients. Spearman correlation revealed significant associations between mRNA and protein expression of KRT20/CK20 (rho 0.6096, p < 0.0001) and MKI67/MIB1 (rho 0.5467, p < 0.0001). A positive correlation was found between MKI67 and KRT20 expression (rho 0.3492, p < 0.0001), while MKI67 and KRT5 were negatively correlated (rho -0.1693, p = 0.01). High KRT20 expression (>/=40.26) was significantly associated with worse recurrence free survival (RFS) (p = 0.001), progression-free survival (PFS) (p = 0.0003), and cancer specific survival (CSS) (p = 0.0414). The combination of high KRT20 expression and low KRT5 expression (<36.83) was associated with unfavorable RFS (p = 0.0038) and PFS (p = 0.0003) and proved to be the only independent predictor for RFS (p = 0.0055) and PFS (p = 0.0023) in multivariate analysis. KRT20 mRNA determination was superior to CK20 protein estimation with regard to RFS and PFS prediction. KRT20 and KRT5 mRNA quantification can predict recurrence and progression of stage pT1 NMIBC reflecting basal and luminal subtypes of MIBC and is superior to CK20 protein expression determined by IHC.
28071013	The industrial potential of herbs and spices - a mini review.	Herbs and spices have been used for food and medicinal purposes for centuries - the first recorded evidence of their use dates back to 1500BC and the Ebers Papyrus, which mentioned spices such as anise, mustard, saffron, cinnamon, and cassia. Now, in the 21st century, a variety of secondary compounds produced by plants are used in many fields of industry, such as food production (to improve taste, to provide vitamins and macro- and microelements, and also to inhibit food spoilage caused by foodborne bacteria), in medicine (in the treatment of various diseases; in chemoprevention and cancer therapy; as a source of natural antimicrobials for the treatment of infectious disease), and in pharmacology and cosmetology (in dietary supplements, and as a result of the demand for preservative-free cosmetics, to reduce the risk of methylparaben allergies). The aim of this review is to present the major active compounds in herbs and spices and explore their potential applications in industry.
28070508	The Influence of Tumor Size on Oncologic Outcomes for Patients with Upper Tract Urothelial Carcinoma after Radical Nephroureterectomy.	Previous studies have reached diverse conclusions about the influence of tumor size on the oncologic outcomes in patients with upper tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC). In this study, we retrospectively analyzed the records of 687 patients and evaluated how tumor size affected the prognosis of patients with UTUC after surgery. Clinicopathologic characteristics and oncological outcomes were compared according to tumor size (</=3 cm versus >3 cm). During a median follow-up period of 65 months (range 3-144 months), 225 patients (32.8%) died from UTUC and 228 patients (33.2%) experienced intravesical recurrence (IVR). Patients with a larger tumor size tended to have a significantly higher percentage of being male (p = 0.011), tobacco consumption (p = 0.036), lack of preoperative ureteroscopy history (p = 0.003), renal pelvic location (p < 0.001), tumor necrosis (p = 0.003), advanced tumor stage (p < 0.001), higher tumor grade (p = 0.003), and lymph node metastasis (p = 0.018). Univariate analysis revealed that a tumor size >3 cm was significantly associated with worse cancer-specific survival (p = 0.002) and IVR (p = 0.011). However, the influence was not statistically significant after controlling for other factors in the multivariate analysis (hazard ratio [HR] 1.124, p = 0.414 and HR 1.196, p = 0.219). In conclusion, UTUC patients with a larger tumor present aggressive biological characteristics and tend to have a worse prognosis.
28068625	Loss of periplakin expression is associated with the tumorigenesis of colorectal carcinoma.	Periplakin (PPL), a member of the plakin protein family, has been reported to be down-expressed in urothelial carcinoma. The role of PPL in human colorectal cancer, however, remains largely unknown. Also little is known about the contribution of PPL to the malignant property of colorectal cancer and the intracellular function of PPL. In this study, we demonstrated that PPL was apparently down-expressed in colon carcinomas compared with normal and para-carcinoma tissues, which was correlated with the tumor size. Enforced expression of PPL in HT29 cells inhibited its proliferation evidenced by decreased expression of phosphorylated ERK and PCNA. Furthermore, PPL overexpression could reduce metastasis and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of HT29 cells, with decreased expression of N-cadherin, Snail, Slug and alpha-SMA while increased expression of E-cadherin. On the contrary, the PPL knockdown could promote the cell proliferation, migratory, invasive and EMT ability of HT29 cells. Moreover, enforced expression of PPL induced G1/G0 cell cycle arrest, with decreased cyclin D1, p-Rb and increased expression of p27kib, which could be reversed by PPL knockdown. In addition, PPL overexpression inhibited the growth of colon cancer allograft in vivo. Taken together, acted as a tumor suppressor in colon cancer progression, PPL could be a new biomarker or potential therapeutic target in colon cancer.
28056456	Bladder Metastases from Lung Cancer: Clinical and Pathological Implications: A Systematic Review.	Lung cancer is the tumor with the highest incidence in males worldwide and the most common cause of death from cancer overall; its high mortality is mostly due to its propensity to spread to other organs through lymphatic and blood vessels in spite of proper treatment. Bladder metastases from lung cancer are rare, with only 11 cases having been reported, all in recent years. This review aims to discuss some critical points regarding this uncommon condition, namely: (a) lung and bladder tumors share similar etiologic features; (b) almost all bladder metastases from lung cancer arise from lung adenocarcinomas; (c) cytology and superficial bladder biopsy may be falsely negative, since the neoplastic cells coming through the hematogenous route are typically located in the lamina propria and/or muscularis propria of the bladder wall; and (d) the differential diagnosis with primary bladder adenocarcinoma as well as primary and secondary small-cell carcinomas may be challenging. Though no definite conclusions can be drawn regarding treatment, we herein propose a practical algorithm to manage such patients based on available data.
28053981	The Functional Haplotypes of CHRM3 Modulate mRNA Expression and Associate with Bladder Cancer among a Chinese Han Population in Kaohsiung City.	Bladder cancer is one of the major cancer types and both environmental factors and genetic background play important roles in its pathology. Kaohsiung is a high industrialized city in Taiwan, and here we focused on this region to evaluate the genetic effects on bladder cancer. Muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M3 (CHRM3) was reported as a key receptor in different cancer types. CHRM3 is located at 1q42-43 which was reported to associate with bladder cancer. Our study attempted to delineate whether genetic variants of CHRM3 contribute to bladder cancer in Chinese Han population in south Taiwan. Five selected SNPs (rs2165870, rs10802789, rs685550, rs7520974, and rs3738435) were genotyped for 30 bladder cancer patients and 60 control individuals and genetic association studies were performed. Five haplotypes (GTTAT, ATTGT, GCTAC, ACTAC, and ACCAC) were found significantly associated with low CHRM3 mRNA level and contributed to increased susceptibility of bladder cancer in Kaohsiung city after rigid 10000 consecutive permutation tests. To our knowledge, this is the first genetic association study that reveals the genetic contribution of CHRM3 gene in bladder cancer etiology.
28052688	TERT promoter mutation status in sarcomatoid urothelial carcinomas of the upper urinary tract.	AIM: To determine TERT promoter mutation status as well as the expression of PAX8, GATA3, p63, p40, p53 and uroplakin III in 17 patients with the upper urinary tract sarcomatoid urothelial carcinoma. METHODS & RESULTS: TERT C228T mutations were found in six of 17 cases (35%). p53 was expressed in 77% of these tumors. PAX8, GATA3, p40 and uroplakin III are less frequently expressed. Lymph node metastases were present in ten cases (59%). Eight patients (47%), including all three patients with TERT mutation, died of cancer within 2 years after surgery. CONCLUSION: Sarcomatoid carcinoma of the upper urinary tract is an aggressive tumor and the presence of TERT mutation may portend poor prognosis.
28049247	Impact of the ASA Physical Status Score on Adjuvant Chemotherapy Eligibility and Survival of Upper Tract Urothelial Carcinoma Patients: a Multicenter Study.	The aim of the present multi-institutional study was to assess the influence of the American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status (ASA-PS) classification on adjuvant chemotherapy eligibility and survival in a multi-institutional cohort of patients treated with radical nephroureterectomy (RNU) for upper tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC). We retrospectively reviewed data from 416 patients who underwent RNU for UTUC at four Korean institutions between 2001 and 2013. The ASA-PS classification was obtained from the anesthesia chart. Locally advanced UTUC was defined as >/= pT3 and/or pN1 disease. The influence of ASA-PS score on survival was evaluated by Kaplan-Meier analyses and a multivariate Cox regression model. Patients with a higher ASA-PS class were less likely to be eligible for adjuvant chemotherapy in locally advanced UTUC (P = 0.016). Kaplan-Meier estimates showed that the high-risk ASA-PS group has a poorer overallsurvival (OS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS) compared to low risk ASA-PS groups in both the total and locally advanced UTUC cohorts. Based on multivariate Cox regression analysis, the high-risk ASA-PS category was an independent predictor for overall mortality (OM) (hazard ratio [HR], 1.919; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.017-3.619; P = 0.044) and cancer-specific mortality (CSM) (HR, 2.120; 95% CI, 1.023-4.394; P = 0.043). In conclusion, high-risk ASA-PS score was independently associated with a lower survival rate in patients with UTUC after RNU. However, the influence of ASA-PS classification on survival was limited to locally advanced UTUC. The lower eligibility of patients in the high-risk ASA category for adjuvant chemotherapy may contribute to the lower survival rate in this group.
28043166	Pharmacokinetic drug evaluation of atezolizumab for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma.	INTRODUCTION: Muscle invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) is difficult to manage for patients who progress during or after initial chemotherapy regimens. Current regimens offer low response rates with high toxicities. The advent of immune checkpoint inhibitors may represent a new opportunity for effective management of these patients. Areas covered: Atezolizumab is an engineered humanized monoclonal immunoglobulin G1 antibody that binds selectively to PD-L1 and prevents its interaction with PD-1 and B7-1. It is administered intravenously and is given every 3 weeks as long as there is no evidence of tumor progression. Phase I trials confirmed antitumor activity of atezolizumab in patients with advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma. Phase II trials showed an improved response rate and a longer durable response than current conventional therapy. Phase III trials are currently underway with an estimated accrual end date of 2017. Expert opinion: MIBC is a high-risk disease, and after progression on current chemotherapy regimens, second-line treatments leave much to be desired. Emerging evidence of efficacy and safety and a recent accelerated approval by the FDA presents atezolizumab as a promising treatment option. Current clinical challenges include the details of disease progression and determining where immune checkpoint inhibition will reside in the treatment algorithm.
28043077	A sensitive, label-free electrochemical detection of telomerase activity without modification or immobilization.	Telomerase has become one of the most typical tumor marker because it is closely related to cancers. In this paper, a simple label-free electrochemical detection of telomerase activity by using methylene blue (MB) as a G-quadruplex binding probe was proposed, avoiding commonly used complex label procedures, nano-probe synthesis, complicated electrode modification, probe immobilization or signal amplification. In the presence of telomerase substrate (TS) primer, the binding of MB on primer was weak. When repeats of (TTAGGG) were extended on the TS primer under the action of telomerase, they formed multiple G-quadruplexes with the help of K+. As a result, a large amount of MB bounded to multiple G-quadruplexes because they have more strong interaction with G-quadruplexes than TS primer. As a result, the diffusion current of MB decreased sharply, which was strongly dependent on the telomerase activity. The DPV current change has a linear correlation with the logarithm of HeLa cell number in the range of 10-10,000 cells, with the detection limit of 3 cells. The high sensitivity was due to the formed multiple G-quadruplexes. Using indium tin oxide (ITO) as working electrode without modification ensured the good reproducibility of the method. The method was also simple, rapid, and has been successfully applied in the telomerase activity detection in urine with good selectivity and reproducibility, which is significant for cancer diagnosis, anticancer drugs screening, and cancer therapy evaluation.
28042869	Genome-Wide Screen of miRNAs and Targeting mRNAs Reveals the Negatively Regulatory Effect of miR-130b-3p on PTEN by PI3K and Integrin beta1 Signaling Pathways in Bladder Carcinoma.	miRNAs have emerged as promising markers for tumors. However, the underlying mechanism of specific miRNAs in bladder cancer (BC) remains largely unknown. Here, a comprehensive miRNA/mRNA expression profile was executed by microarray assay for four pairs of bladder carcinoma and para-carcinoma tissues from patients with grade 2 (G2) T2. A total of 99 miRNAs and 4416 mRNAs were discovered to be significantly differentially expressed in BC tissues compared with controls. Five microRNAs and two mRNAs were validated by qRT-PCR in 30 pairs of samples, including G1-G3/T1-T4. Subsequently, we constructed a network with the five miRNAs-target mRNAs; gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses were utilized to recognize the functions and associated pathways. Moreover, we further found that miR-130b-3p was significantly up-regulated and negatively correlated with phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) expression in bladder cancer tissues. Next, we demonstrated that miR-130b-3p might target PTEN through bioinformatics and dual-luciferase reporter assay. Finally, we showed that miR-130b-3p could down-regulate PTEN expression, which promoted proliferation, migration, invasion and rearranged cytoskeleton through the activation of the PI3K and integrin beta1 signaling pathway in bladder cancer cells. Inversely, miR-130b-3p inhibitors induced apoptosis. Taken together, this research investigated, for the first time, miR-130b-3p by an incorporated analysis of microRNA/mRNA expressions of a genome-wide screen in BC. Our findings suggest that the miR-130b-3p/PTEN/integrin beta1 axis could play a critical role in the progression and development of BC and that miR-130b-3p might be a valuable clinical marker and therapeutical target for BC patients.
28034440	[Urothelial tumors in children].	Urothelial tumors are very rare in children (to date, only about 150 cases have been reported worlwide). Only 20% occur before the age of ten. The aim of this study is to specify the clinicopathologic features of urothelial tumor in young patients, which require a slightly different approach to treatment. On the basis of the WHO/ISUP (World Health Organisation/International Society of Urological Pathology) consensus classification report, these lesions are usually low-grade lesions, non invasive, and rarely recurrent. The sex ratio is three boys to one girl. These tumors are located preferentially in the low urinary tract, especially in the bladder. The main symptom is the macroscopic hematuria, which requires ultrasound examination in all cases. Cystoscopy is indicated in case of lesion of the bladder wall, or in case of persistent or recurrent hematuria, to obtain definitive diagnosis and biopsies. The tumors are mainly located on the posterior or lateral bladder wall above the trigone or near the ureteral orifices. Treatment is based on the transurethral resection of the lesion. The subsequent monitoring is sparsely codified, due to the exceptional occurrence of these tumors in the paediatric age group. These patients are likely to have better outcome than older patients, but it is due to the predominance of noninvasive papillary urothelial tumors. Tumor recurrences are not uncommon. In case of invasive, high-grade urothelial carcinomas, metastases or even lethal outcome may occur in rare cases.
28033269	Application of dual-energy spectral CT imaging in differential diagnosis of bladder cancer and benign prostate hyperplasia.	The aim of this study was to explore the clinical value of dual-energy spectral CT imaging in the differential diagnosis between bladder cancer and benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH).We retrospectively analyzed images of 118 patients who received pelvic dual-energy spectral CT imaging. These patients were later confirmed to have bladder cancer in 61 patients and BPH in 57 patients. CT values of the 2 lesion types from 40 to 140 keV were measured from the monochromatic spectral CT image to generate spectral HU curves. The slope of the spectral curve and the lesion effective atomic number were calculated. The measured parameters were analyzed with independent-sample Mann-Whitney U test.There was a statistically significant difference in CT value between the 2 groups from 40 to 90 keV, with the biggest difference at 40 keV (median and interquartile range: 83.3 HU and 22.9 HU vs 60.6 HU and 16.7 HU, Z = 5.932, P < 0.001). The slope of the spectral HU curve for bladder cancer was markedly higher than that of BPH (median and interquartile range: 0.48 and 0.23 vs 0.26 and 0.22, Z = 5.162, P < 0.001); the difference in effective atomic number (median and interquartile range: 7.99 and 0.21 vs 7.80 and 0.20, Z = 5.233, P < 0.001) was also statistically significant.Dual-energy spectral CT imaging provides high sensitivity and specificity for differentiating bladder cancer from benign prostate hyperplasia.
28031042	Transitional cell carcinoma with extension of the renal vein and IVC tumor thrombus: report of three cases and literature review.	BACKGROUND: Transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) originating from the renal pelvis with a venous tumor thrombus is a rare entity. However, clinicians should be aware of it because of its high malignancy and poor prognosis. CASE PRESENTATION: Here, we report three cases of pathologically confirmed TCC originating from the renal pelvis with extension into the renal vein or inferior vena cava (IVC). Of these patients, two are males and one is female (58~73 years old). Their main symptom is flank pain; besides, gross hematuria and weight loss is observed in one of the patients. Computed tomography (CT) scan of the first patient revealed multiple space-occupying lesions in the left renal pelvis and left medium and lower ureter with a tumor thrombus in the left renal vein. CT scan of the second patient revealed a right renal mass and extension into the IVC. Abdominal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the third patient showed a soft tissue mass in the region of the left renal sinus, and the signal of the soft tissue was observed in the left renal vein. The preoperative diagnoses of the first and third patient were TCC, while the second patient was renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Two patients with the preoperative diagnosis of TCC underwent laparoscopic radical nephroureterectomy with thrombectomy, and the other patient underwent radical nephrectomy with thrombectomy. The surgeries were successful. Although two of our patients underwent chemotherapy and radiotherapy, they died 2 and 19 months after the surgery, respectively. The other patient refused any adjuvant therapy and died 3 months after the operation. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to the extension of RCC to the renal vein or IVC, extension of TCC to the renal vein or IVC is rare. TCC with a venous tumor thrombus is often misdiagnosed as RCC. However, a correct preoperative or intraoperative diagnosis is of great importance to decide surgical strategy. Laparoscopic radical nephroureterectomy with thrombectomy may be a safe and feasible operative method in treatment of TCC with a renal vein thrombus. The prognosis of such cases is poor even if chemotherapy and radiotherapy are scheduled.
28027900	Amorphous aggregate adducts of linker histone H1 turn highly immunologic in the cancers of oesophagus, stomach, gall bladder and ovary.	Hyperglycaemic influence on carcinogenesis and tumour progression is emerging as a link between diabetes and cancer. This work establishes the disturbed structural integrity of nucleosomal linker histone H1 by methyglyoxal (MG) and then correlates the role of modified H1 in the auto-immunopathogenesis of multiple cancers. MG modification caused a loss of free epsilon-amino groups in H1 and raised its beta-sheet structural component with a consequence of non amyloid aggregation. It changed the folding-unfolding denaturation pattern of H1 and attached itself to the lysine residues of the protein eventually making up Nepsilon-(carboxyethyl) lysine. The structural variations act as extra antigenic determinants on H1 that yield aggressive antibody response, when immunised in rabbits. The ELISA tests proved the immunoglobulin response very specific and gel based studies established the preferential binding of antibodies generated against MG-H1 with the modified protein. Cross reaction analysis inferred the multiple specific natures of immunoglobulins with binding tendencies against different inhibitors. The immunoglobulin content in blood sera derived from human subjects with tumours of oesophagus, stomach, gall bladder and ovary confirmed the antibody presence against MG-H1 and competitive ELISA showed their high specificity. This may suggest a link between nucleosomal linker H1, hyperglycaemia, glycoxidation and cancer.
28013415	Prognostic impact of preoperative anemia on non-muscle-invasive bladder carcinoma treated with GreenLight laser vaporization.	In this study, we aimed to evaluate the impact of preoperative anemia (PA) on oncological outcomes among patients with non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) treated with GreenLight laser vaporization of bladder tumor (PV-BT). Between January 2010 and December 2015, 407 patients with NMIBC who underwent PV-BT surgery were stratified into normal and anemia groups based on the World Health Organization classification (anemia cutoff value: hemoglobin level, <13.0 m g/dL in men and <12.0 mg/dL in women). The Student's t test and chi-square test were performed to assess the effects of PA on clinical and pathological characteristics of patients with NMIBC. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to investigate the influence of PA on oncological survival outcomes. Before PV-BT, 139 patients (34.2%) were anemic. No significant differences in age, sex, smoking habit, tumor size, focality, grade, and stage were found between the anemia and normal groups. At a median follow-up period of 32.5 months (range, 8-60 months), 74 patients (18.2%) had urothelial recurrence, 30 (7.4%) died from any cause, and 21 (5.2%) died from bladder cancer. In the Kaplan-Meier analysis, preoperative anemia was significantly associated with decreased cancer-specific survival (CSS) and overall survival (OS) of the patients with NMIBC. However, recurrence-free survival (RFS) showed no statistically significant difference between the PA and normal groups. The preoperative anemic patients with NMIBC who underwent PV-BT surgery had worse CSS and OS. PA can be a useful and cost-effective prognostic marker in the clinical practice for NMIBC treatment.
28012925	Cigarette smoke extract induces epithelial-mesenchymal transition of human bladder cancer T24 cells through activation of ERK1/2 pathway.	Bladder cancer is a common genitourinary malignant disease worldwide. Abundant evidence has shown that cigarette smoke (CS) is a crucial risk factor for bladder cancer. Nevertheless, the mechanism underlying the relationship between cigarette smoking and bladder cancer remains unclear. In the present study, we investigated the effects of cigarette smoke extract (CSE) on mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway activation and EMT alterations in human bladder cancer T24 cells, and the preventive effect of extracellular regulated protein kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) inhibitor U0126 was further examined. Our results illustrated that CSE exposure induced morphological change of human bladder cancer T24 cells, enhanced migratory and invasive capacities, reduced epithelial marker expression and elevated mesenchymal marker expression. Meanwhile, exposure of T24 cells to CSE resulted in activation of ERK1/2 pathway as well as activator protein 1 (AP-1) proteins. Interestingly, treatment with ERK1/2 inhibitor U0126 effectively abrogated CSE-triggered EMT and ERK1/2/AP-1 activation. These findings provide novel insight into the molecular mechanisms of CS-associated bladder cancer and may open up new avenues in the search for potential target of bladder cancer intervention.
28009310	[THE EARLY DIAGNOSTICS OF MULTIPLE PRIMARY TUMORS OF MALE UROGENITAL TRACT (REVIEW OF CLINICAL CASES)].	Multiple primary tumors (MPT) or polyneoplasias significance is very important. MTP are met rarely in male urogenital system; only single cases are described in the literature. Nevertheless, during the last years there has been an increase of their frequency. So, in order to understand are urogenital MPT popular in men, what is the connection between their appearance and whether there is a trend of increase or not, we have decided to investigate the cases histories of 272 oncourological patients between 18-84 years old have been studied in the period of 2013 - 2015. The tumor tissue specimens of 272 oncourological patients have been investigated too, taken after the surgery and do a histological examination. It is well known, that the diagnosis of tumors is heavily based on the study of the surgical material and its histopathology of their sections stained with hematoxylin-eosin. In result we discovered 13 men from different age groups, more often in elderly patients of 55-70 years, in whom 2 urogenital tumors were discovered. Men with multiple primary tumors of the urogenital system have got mainly double synchronous tumor. It is necessary to organize the dynamic control for oncourological patients life after treatment of the first tumor, even in asymptomatic or atypical clinical course with the morphological methods use in CT, ultrasonography.
28002521	The cadherin switch assessment in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition of urothelial bladder carcinomas.	INTRODUCTION: The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process is a complex molecular mechanism that is involved in the acquisition of an aggressive, invasive and metastatic phenotype by carcinomas. The cadherin switch consists in the alteration of E-cadherin and N-cadherin expression and is specific for the EMT process. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study included 35 cases of primitive urothelial carcinomas investigated in relation with clinicopathological prognostic parameters and expression of E- and N-cadherins in the advancing edge and intratumoral compartments. RESULTS: In both compartments, the immunoexpression of E-cadherin decreased, while that of N-cadherin increased in high grade, deeply invasive, or those cases with lymph node metastases and advanced stages carcinomas, with a negative linear correlation observed between their expression percentage values. In this study, it was observed the presence of cadherin switch in urothelial carcinomas, the variation of the two proteins' immunostaining patterns being higher at the advancing edge. The presence of N-cadherin in intratumoral compartment designated it as actively involved in EMT process. CONCLUSIONS: The analysis of cadherins switch can be used to identify superficial urothelial carcinoma with invasion and metastasis potential.
28000900	miR-24-3p regulates bladder cancer cell proliferation, migration, invasion and autophagy by targeting DEDD.	microRNAs (miRNAs), a class of small non-coding RNA molecules, can regulate gene expression by interacting with the 3'-untranslated regions (3'UTR) of target genes and influence various biological processes. We investigated the potential role of miR-24-3p in the development of bladder cancer by regulating DEDD, a member of the death effector domain-containing protein family. First, we found that miR-24-3p was highly expressed and that DEDD was expressed at a low level in bladder cancer tissues compared with that in adjacent bladder tissues by qRT-PCR (P<0.0001). Second, we found that miR-24-3p promoted the proliferation ability of bladder cancer cells using the MTT assay and colony forming assay; and showed that miR-24-3p accelerated the migration and invasion of bladder cancer cells using migration and invasion assays (P<0.05). Moreover, miR-24-3p inhibited apoptosis of bladder cancer cells, as shown by flow cytometry (P<0.05). Western blot results demonstrated that miR-24-3p participated in autophagy of bladder cancer cells by DEDD. In addition, the tumor formation assay showed that miR-24-3p promoted the growth of bladder tumor in vivo. Furthermore, the luciferase reporter gene assay indicated that miR-24-3p suppressed DEDD gene transcription. Therefore, our study indicated that miR-24-3p promoted bladder cancer progression by inhibiting DEDD.
27999236	CD8+ T Lymphocyte Subsets in Bladder Tumor Draining Lymph Nodes.	BACKGROUND: Cytotoxic CD8+ T cells, as essential parts of the adaptive immune system, play pivotal roles in anti-tumor immune responses. It is well documented that cytokine expression profiles and activation status of these cells during anti-tumor immune responses affect the outcome of host-tumor interaction. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the percentages of CD8+ lymphocytes and their subsets in tumor draining lymph nodes of patients with bladder cancer. METHODS: Forty-five patients with bladder cancer, candidate for radical cystectomy, were recruited. Mononuclear cells were isolated from draining lymph nodes using Ficoll-Hypaque gradient centrifugation, and were activated by PMA/Ionomycin in the presence of Golgi inhibitors. The cells were then permeabilized and stained with appropriate flourochrome conjugated antibodies against CD3, CD8, IFN-gamma, IL-17 and IL-4 molecules. Data were collected on a four-color flow cytometer and analyzed by CellQuestPro software. RESULTS: Despite no difference in the frequency of IL-17 producing CD8+ (Tc17) lymphocytes, the mean expression of IL-17 in this subset was significantly elevated in high-grade patients (p=0.011). The percentage of double positive IFN-gamma/IL-17 CD8+ lymphocytes was also significantly increased in node positive patients compared to node negative ones (p=0.046). Our results also demonstrated that the percentage of IFN-gamma producing CD8+ (Tc1) lymphocytes was significantly increased in the patients with higher histological grade compared to those with lower ones (p=0.038). CONCLUSION: IFN-gamma and IL-17 producing CD8+ T cells may increase in advanced stages of bladder cancer, but their correlation with tumor prognosis remains to be investigated.
27992058	An MRI-compatible patient rotation system - design, construction, and first organ deformation results.	PURPOSE: Conventionally in radiotherapy, a very heavy beam forming apparatus (gantry) is rotated around a patient. From a mechanical perspective, a more elegant approach is to rotate the patient within a stationary beam. Key obstacles to this approach are patient tolerance and anatomical deformation. Very little information on either aspect is available in the literature. The purpose of this work was therefore to design and test an MRI-compatible patient rotation system such that the feasibility of a patient rotation workflow could be tested. METHODS: A patient rotation system (PRS) was designed to fit inside the bore of a 3T MRI scanner (Skyra, Siemens) such that 3D images could be acquired at different rotation angles. Once constructed, a pelvic imaging study was carried out on a healthy volunteer. T2-weighted MRI images were taken every 45 degrees between 0 degrees and 360 degrees , (with 0 degrees equivalent to supine). The prostate, bladder, and rectum were segmented using atlas-based auto contouring. The images from each angle were registered back to the 0 degrees image in three steps: (a) Rigid registration was based on MRI visible markers on the couch. (b) Rigid registration based on the prostate contour (equivalent to a rigid shift to the prostate). (c) Nonrigid registration. The Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and mean average surface distance (MASD) were calculated for each organ at each step. RESULTS: The PRS met all design constraints and was successfully integrated with the MRI scanner. Phantom images showed minimal difference in signal or noise with or without the PRS in the MRI scanner. For the MRI images, the DSC (mean +/- standard deviation) over all angles in the prostate, rectum, and bladder was 0.60 +/- 0.11, 0.56 +/- 0.15, and 0.76 +/- 0.06 after rigid couch registration, 0.88 +/- 0.03, 0.81 +/- 0.08, and 0.86 +/- 0.03 after rigid prostate guided registration, and 0.85 +/- 0.03, 0.88 +/- 0.02, 0.87 +/- 0.02 after nonrigid registration. CONCLUSIONS: An MRI-compatible patient rotation system has been designed, constructed, and tested. A pelvic study was carried out on a healthy volunteer. Rigid registration based on the prostate contour yielded DSC overlap statistics in the prostate superior to interobserver contouring variability reported in the literature.
27988802	Local recurrence of prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy is at risk to be missed in 68Ga-PSMA-11-PET of PET/CT and PET/MRI: comparison with mpMRI integrated in simultaneous PET/MRI.	PURPOSE: The positron emission tomography (PET) tracer 68Ga-PSMA-11, targeting the prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA), is rapidly excreted into the urinary tract. This leads to significant radioactivity in the bladder, which may limit the PET-detection of local recurrence (LR) of prostate cancer (PC) after radical prostatectomy (RP), developing in close proximity to the bladder. Here, we analyze if there is additional value of multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) compared to the 68Ga-PSMA-11-PET-component of PET/CT or PET/MRI to detect LR. METHODS: One hundred and nineteen patients with biochemical recurrence after prior RP underwent both hybrid 68Ga-PSMA-11-PET/CTlow-dose (1 h p.i.) and -PET/MRI (2-3 h p.i.) including a mpMRI protocol of the prostatic bed. The comparison of both methods was restricted to the abdomen with focus on LR (McNemar). Bladder-LR distance and recurrence size were measured in axial T2w-TSE. A logistic regression was performed to determine the influence of these variables on detectability in 68Ga-PSMA-11-PET. Standardized-uptake-value (SUVmean) quantification of LR was performed. RESULTS: There were 93/119 patients that had at least one pathologic finding. In addition, 18/119 Patients (15.1%) were diagnosed with a LR in mpMRI of PET/MRI but only nine were PET-positive in PET/CT and PET/MRI. This mismatch was statistically significant (p = 0.004). Detection of LR using the PET-component was significantly influenced by proximity to the bladder (p = 0.028). The PET-pattern of LR-uptake was classified into three types (1): separated from bladder; (2): fuses with bladder, and (3): obliterated by bladder). The size of LRs did not affect PET-detectability (p = 0.84), mean size was 1.7 +/- 0.69 cm long axis, 1.2 +/- 0.46 cm short-axis. SUVmean in nine men was 8.7 +/- 3.7 (PET/CT) and 7.0 +/- 4.2 (PET/MRI) but could not be quantified in the remaining nine cases (obliterated by bladder). CONCLUSION: The present study demonstrates additional value of hybrid 68Ga-PSMA-11-PET/MRI by gaining complementary diagnostic information compared to the 68Ga-PSMA-11-PET/CTlow-dose for patients with LR of PC.
27987237	Bladder cancer cells induce immunosuppression of T cells by supporting PD-L1 expression in tumour macrophages partially through interleukin 10.	Immunotherapy based on BCG vaccination is an effective treatment in bladder cancer, but a positive response is restricted to a subset of patients and for a limited period of time only. This suggests that T cells antitumour responses are effective but can become compromised in bladder cancer. To investigate the underlying mechanisms, we first identified peripheral blood monocytes and tumour macrophages using the pan-monocyte/macrophage marker CD14, and found that the PD-L1 expression on the monocytes/macrophages in bladder cancer patients was significantly higher than that in controls. The monocytes from bladder cancer patients were also more capable at inducing apoptosis and inhibiting proliferation in activated autologous T cells than monocytes from controls, which was directly associated with the level of PD-L1 expression. We next investigated the tumour cells' participation in upregulating PD-L1 in monocytes/macrophages. Significant elevation of PD-L1 was observed in monocytes after culturing with autologous tumour cells, which did not require direct contact but required soluble factors. The STAT phosphorylation pattern in monocytes after tumour cell co-culture was consistent with effects of the interleukin (IL)-10 signalling pathway. We then found that removal of IL-10 in monocyte-tumour cell co-culture reduced the PD-L1 upregulation in monocytes, but IL-10 by itself was unable to directly upregulate PD-L1. Primary bladder tumour cells secreted significant levels of IL-10, indicating that they could serve as the source of IL-10. Together, these results demonstrated a novel pathway that bladder cancer cells induced immunosuppression of T cells by supporting PD-L1 expression in tumour macrophages partially through IL-10.
27986693	Cautious use and optimal dose of morphine for relieving malignant pain in a complex patient with multiple comorbidities.	Oral morphine remains the drug of choice for the management of severe pain due to cancer as per WHO ladder of analgesia. Providing adequate pain relief in palliative care settings for pain due to cancer is challenging. Options become limited in cases of associated systemic comorbidities such as renal dysfunction, hypoproteinaemia, anaemia. Patients with renal dysfunction and other comorbidities may develop drug overdose due to abnormal pharmacokinetics. Renal dysfunction affects the pharmacokinetics of morphine by altering its absorption, metabolism and clearance. Plasma albumin also influences drug availability, its plasma distribution and thus available free morphine for its clinical effect. Morphine should be used cautiously for the treatment of pain in patients with renal failure, hypoproteinaemia, hyperbilirubinaemia and anaemia. In such patients, alternate opiates like fentanyl, hydromorphone, or oxycodone may be used as these drugs are not significantly excreted by the kidneys.
27983522	Different expression patterns of histone H3K27 demethylases in renal cell carcinoma and bladder cancer.	OBJECTIVE: UTX and JMJD3 are recently identified histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27) demethylases. Many studies have shown aberrant H3K27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) levels widely exist in multiple cancers, and that altered H3K27me3 levels are correlated with tumorigenesis and tumor progression. To investigate expression patterns of UTX and JMJD3 genes in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and bladder cancer and the relationship between gene expression and tumor development. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Samples were collected from 35 patients with RCC and 21 patients with bladder cancer and qRT-PCR was performed. RESULTS: By comparing with adjacent normal tissues, the expression of JMJD3 (10/21 = 47.62%) and UTX (10/21 = 47.62%) were significantly upregulated in bladder cancer tissues and the expression of JMJD3 (15/35 = 42.86%) was significantly downregulated in RCC tissues. Stratified analyses revealed that upregulated expression of JMJD3 was significantly associated with poorly differentiated tumor nuclear grade (p= 0.005) and advanced clinical stage (p= 0.043) in the bladder cancer group, while downregulated expression of JMJD3 was significantly associated with advanced clinical stage (p= 0.045) and poorly differentiated tumor nuclear grade (p= 0.011) in the RCC group. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest JMJD3 could be a hallmark and is involved in the development of RCC and bladder cancers. The potential role of H3K27 demethylases as biomarkers needs further investigations.
27980268	Pulmonary Mucosa-associated Lymphoid Tissue Lymphoma with Spontaneous Regression after Computed Tomography-guided Needle Biopsy: A Case Report and Summary of 8 Reported Cases.	A 72-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital with a solitary right lung nodule. She had no symptoms and no abnormal physical findings except for bladder cancer. Tumor markers were mildly elevated but no other abnormal laboratory data were found. The nodule was diagnosed to be pulmonary mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma on computed tomography-guided needle biopsy. Thereafter, she first underwent surgery for bladder cancer. The lung nodule was found to have slightly increased at three months and then disappeared at 15 months after the biopsy. The notable clinical course of this rare disease suggests the effectiveness of a non-interventional treatment strategy.
27974927	Development of new immunotherapy treatments in different cancer types.	Cancer immunotherapy involves the use of therapeutic modalities that determine a manipulation of the immune system by using immune agents such as cytokines, vaccines, cell therapies and humoral, transfection agents. Immunotherapy of cancer has to stimulate the host's anti-tumor response by increasing the effector cell number and the production of soluble mediators and decrease the host's suppressor mechanisms by inducing tumor killing environment and by modulating immune checkpoints. Immunotherapy seems to work better in more immunogenic tumors. Making a review of literature, the article presents the new immunologic treatments in cancers less presented in the latest conferences, cancers in which, immunotherapy is still under investigation. Bladder cancer was the first indication for which immunotherapy was used in 1970. A promising clinical research in bladder cancer is the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors. Although breast cancer is considered immunologically silent, several preclinical and clinical studies suggested that immunotherapy has the potential to improve the clinical outcomes for patients with breast cancer. Cervical cancer, brain cancer, head and neck cancer and colorectal and esophageal cancers are cancer types for which new immune-based cancer treatments are currently under development. Recent agents used in clinical trials will be described in before mentioned cancers.
27974922	Outcome of urinary bladder cancer after combined therapies.	Rationale:Urinary bladder cancer is the fourth most common cancer in men and the eighth in women, being an important public health issue. Methods:: Medical files of 155 patients (132M/ 23F) with urinary bladder cancer treated between 2006 and 2012 were retrospectively analyzed. The median age at diagnosis was 65 years (range: 19-85 years). Disease free survival (DFS) for patients with complete tumor resection receiving adjuvant treatment and progression free survival (PFS) for patients with post-operative residual disease was estimated. Results:The distribution of the stage disease was: 50 patients (32.2%) stage II, 47 (30.3%) stage III, 58 (37.4%) stage IV. Radical cystectomy was performed in 56 patients (36.1%), while 99 patients (63.9%) underwent repeated transurethral resection of the urinary bladder tumor (TURBT). Postoperative treatment included multimodal therapy in 47 patients (30.3%) (chemotherapy and external beam radiation), external beam radiation alone in 57 patients (36.8%) and chemotherapy alone (methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin, and cisplatin-MVAC or gemcitabine+platinum) in 51 patients (32.9%). After a median follow-up of 31 months (range: 3-79 months), 51 patients (32.9%) presented local recurrence, 32 patients (21%) distant recurrence (metastases), 10 patients (6.4%) both local and distant recurrence, and 62 patients (40%) were free of disease. The median duration until progression was 27 months. Discussion:Despite the combined therapy approaches, urinary bladder carcinoma remains an aggressive disease, with a high relapse rate. Earlier diagnosis, aggressive radical surgery in intention to cure (cystectomy), and adjuvant multimodal treatment (radiotherapy and chemotherapy) are needed for survival improvement.
27960233	Iatrogenic changes in the urinary tract.	A handful of therapeutic procedures are used to treat malignancies of the urinary tract, most frequently intravesical immunotherapy or chemotherapy, but also neoadjuvant systemic chemotherapy. These treatment modalities produce morphological changes in the urothelium that can be mistaken for carcinoma; in particular, these therapies frequently mimic urothelial carcinoma in situ (CIS) urothelial dysplasia or true invasive neoplasia. Drugs such as mitomycin C used after transurethral resection of bladder tumour to reduce recurrences, bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) intravesical immunotherapy to treat high-risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer and urothelial CIS and platin-based systemic chemotherapy to improve postcystectomy disease-specific survival are examples of therapy-related atypia seen in the urinary tract. To complicate the pathologist's life, a number of systemic drugs in use to treat other diseases, such cyclophosphamide, used to treat some autoimmune disorders or certain haematological malignancies or, in the case of anaesthetics, ketamine, used increasingly as an illegal recreational drug, may produce similarly relevant atypical changes in the urothelium, and therefore need to be differentiated from intraepithelial neoplasia. Other less frequent procedures, such as photodynamic and laser therapy or the newer gene therapy to treat urothelial neoplasia, remain experimental. An immunohistochemical approach to reactive urothelium versus carcinoma in situ using p53, cytokeratin 20 and CD44 is also valid in the post-therapy setting. The pathologist should be aware of these novelties, as he or she plays a crucial role in evaluating treatment efficacy, but at the same time needs to avoid misdiagnosing secondary atypia as intraepithelial neoplasia.
27959455	High expression of B23 is associated with tumorigenesis and poor prognosis in bladder urothelial carcinoma.	B23, a multifunctional nucleolar protein, is overexpressed in numerous cancers and is associated with tumorigenesis. However, the clinical significance and potential role of B23 in bladder urothelial carcinoma remains to be elucidated. The present study observed that the mRNA and protein expression levels of B23 were increased in bladder cancer cells and tissues. The overexpression of B23 contributed to tumorigenesis and was associated with poor prognosis in bladder cancer patients. Silencing of B23 by short hairpin RNA inhibited tumor cell growth and colony formation. In addition, knockdown of B23 suppressed the phosphorylation of extracellular signalregulated kinase (ERK), resulting in the inactivation of the ERK signaling pathway. Therefore, the present study indicated that B23 promotes bladder cancer cell growth via activation of the ERK signaling pathway and is a novel potential biomarker for the diagnosis and prognosis of bladder cancer.
27939400	Atezolizumab as first-line treatment in cisplatin-ineligible patients with locally advanced and metastatic urothelial carcinoma: a single-arm, multicentre, phase 2 trial.	BACKGROUND: First-line chemotherapy for patients with cisplatin-ineligible locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma is associated with short response duration, poor survival, and high toxicity. This study assessed atezolizumab (anti-programmed death-ligand 1 [PD-L1]) as treatment for metastatic urothelial cancer in cisplatin-ineligible patients. METHODS: For this single-arm, multicentre, phase 2 study, in 47 academic medical centres and community oncology practices in seven countries in North America and Europe, we recruited previously untreated patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer who were cisplatin ineligible. Patients were given 1200 mg intravenous atezolizumab every 21 days until progression. The primary endpoint was independently confirmed objective response rate per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (central review), assessed in prespecified subgroups based on PD-L1 expression and in all patients. All participants who received one or more doses of atezolizumab were included in the primary and safety analyses. This study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02108652. FINDINGS: Between June 9, 2014, and March 30, 2015, we enrolled 123 patients, of whom 119 received one or more doses of atezolizumab. At 17.2 months' median follow-up, the objective response rate was 23% (95% CI 16 to 31), the complete response rate was 9% (n=11), and 19 of 27 responses were ongoing. Median response duration was not reached. Responses occurred across all PD-L1 and poor prognostic factor subgroups. Median progression-free survival was 2.7 months (2.1 to 4.2). Median overall survival was 15.9 months (10.4 to not estimable). Tumour mutation load was associated with response. Treatment-related adverse events that occurred in 10% or more of patients were fatigue (36 [30%] patients), diarrhoea (14 [12%] patients), and pruritus (13 [11%] patients). One treatment-related death (sepsis) occurred. Nine (8%) patients had an adverse event leading to treatment discontinuation. Immune-mediated events occurred in 14 (12%) patients. INTERPRETATION: Atezolizumab showed encouraging durable response rates, survival, and tolerability, supporting its therapeutic use in untreated metastatic urothelial cancer.

27932164	Retzius Space Preservation Technique for Robotic-Assisted Laparoscopic Radical Prostatectomy in a Kidney Transplant Patient: First Case in Thailand and Our First Experience.	OBJECTIVE: The aim of this work was to report our experience in robotic-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy for the treatment of localized prostate cancer in a kidney transplant recipient. METHODS: A 73-year-old man with chronic renal failure underwent living-donor kidney transplantation (KT) in 1993. His baseline creatinine after KT was approximately 1.2 mg/dL. He developed lower urinary tract symptoms in 1999. He was diagnosed with benign prostatic hyperplasia and treated accordingly. He was followed regularly with the use of digital rectal examination and measurement of serum prostatic-specific antigen (PSA). In 2014, his serum PSA was 11.53 ng/mL. Prostate biopsy was done and revealed localized prostatic adenocarcinoma with a Gleason score of 7 (3+4). We performed robotic-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy with the use of the Retzius space preservation technique. RESULTS: The patient underwent successful robotic-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy without any complications. The operative time was 210 minutes with estimated blood loss of 250 mL. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was discharged on the 6th day after surgery with a retained Foley catheter. A cystogram was done on the 13th day after surgery and showed no urethrovesical anastomosis leakage. After Foley catheter removal, the patient could urinate normally without urinary incontinence. Pathologic analysis revealed positive surgical margin with no extraprostatic extension and no seminal vesical invasion. One month after the operation, PSA was 0.08 ng/mL and renal function remained stable. CONCLUSIONS: Robotic-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy is technically feasible and safe for the treatment of localized prostate cancer in the renal transplant patient. The Retzius space preservation technique is helpful in minimizing the manipulation of transplanted kidney and urinary bladder during the operation, resulting in favorable postoperative renal function and continence outcome.
27930581	Associations between interventions for urolithiasis and urinary tract cancer among patients in Taiwan: The effect of early intervention.	The aim of this study was to investigate cancer risk in patients with a history of urolithiasis and to determine whether intervention for calculi attenuated the risk of subsequent urinary tract cancer (UTC).Using data from the National Health Insurance Research Database in Taiwan, we performed a nationwide cohort study enrolling participants (n = 42,732) aged > 30 years who were diagnosed with urinary tract calculi between 2000 and 2009. Age- and gender-matched insured individuals (n = 213,660) found in the health service records over the same period were recruited as the control group. The Cox proportional hazards model and competing risks regression model were used to examine the relationship between urolithiasis and UTC, as well as whether early intervention for urolithiasis decreased the subsequent cancer risk relative to late intervention.Participants with a previous diagnosis of urolithiasis (n = 695) had a 1.82-fold (95% CI: 1.66-1.99, P < 0.001) increased risk of developing UTC. Furthermore, the risk of UTC associated with urolithiasis was higher in women (adjusted HR: 2.43, 95% CI: 1.94-3.05) than in men (adjusted HR: 1.72, 95% CI: 1.55-1.90). When stratified by cancer site, the adjusted HR for bladder, renal pelvis/ureter, renal, and prostate cancers were 1.94 (95% CI: 1.62-2.33), 2.94 (95% CI: 2.24-3.87), 2.94 (95% CI: 2.29-3.77), and 1.45 (95% CI: 1.27-1.65), respectively. Patients who received interventions for urolithiasis within 3 months of detection had a decreased risk of subsequent UTC (adjusted HR: 0.53, 95% CI: 0.40-0.71, P < 0.001).The present study demonstrated that urolithiasis increased the risk of subsequent UTC, especially upper UTC. Hence, it is recommended that physicians administer the appropriate interventions as early as possible upon diagnosis of urolithiasis.
27929505	A comprehensive evaluation of adaptive daily planning for cervical cancer HDR brachytherapy.	The purpose of this study was to evaluate adaptive daily planning for cervi-cal cancer patients who underwent high-dose-rate intracavitary brachytherapy (HDR-BT) using comprehensive interfractional organ motion measurements. This study included 22 cervical cancer patients who underwent 5 fractions of HDR-BT. Regions of interest (ROIs) including high-risk clinical tumor volume (HR-CTV) and organs at risk (OARs) were manually contoured on daily CT images. All patients were clinically treated with adaptive daily plans (ADP), which involved ROI delineation and dose optimization at each treatment fraction. Single treatment plans (SP) were retrospectively generated by applying the first treatment fraction's dwell times adjusted for decay and dwell positions of the applicator to subsequent treatment fractions. Various existing similarity metrics were calculated for the ROIs to quantify interfractional organ variations. A novel similarity (JRARM) score was established, which combined both volumetric overlap metrics (DSC, JSC, and RVD) and distance metrics (ASD, MSD, and RMSD). Linear regression was performed to determine a relationship between interfractional organ varia-tions of various similarity metrics and D2cc variations from both plans. Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were used to assess ADP and SP by comparing EQD2 D2cc (alpha/beta = 3) for OARs. For interfractional organ variations, the sigmoid demonstrated the greatest variations based on the JRARM, DSC, and RMSD metrics. Comparisons between paired ROIs showed differences in metrics at each treatment fraction. RVD, MSD, and RMSD were found to be significantly correlated to D2cc varia-tions for bladder and sigmoid. The comparison between plans found ADP provided lower EQD2 D2cc of OARs than SP. Specifically, the sigmoid demonstrated sta-tistically significant dose variations (p = 0.015). Substantial interfractional organ motion occurs during HDR-BT based on comprehensive measurements and may significantly affect D2cc of OARs. Adaptive daily planning provides improved dose sparing for OARs compared to single planning with the extent of sparing being different among OARs.
27929498	Dosimetric comparison of intensity-modulated radiotherapy and volumetric-modulated arc radiotherapy in patients with prostate cancer: a meta-analysis.	Intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) and volumetric-modulated arc therapy (VMAT) are two main radiotherapy techniques. The aim of this study is to explore which is the preferred technique in prostate treatment through the related publica-tions and meta-analysis. Two authors independently identified all relevant articles available regarding eligibility criteria on PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases until December 2015. Publication bias was evaluated with funnel plot, and statistical analyses were performed with Stata software. P &lt; 0.05 was thought statistically significant. Ten studies comprised a total of 110 patients; in total 110 IMRT plans and 110 VMAT plans that were included in this study. V40, V60, and V70 of rectum were significantly decreased in VMAT than in IMRT. However, V50 of rectum and V40, V50, V60, V70 of bladder had no statistical differences between IMRI and VMAT plans. Compared with IMRT, the treatment time and MUs of VMAT were significantly lower. VMAT protects rectum better than IMRT and improves the delivery efficiency. VMAT may be the preferred modality for treating prostate cancer.
27929486	Dosimetric and volumetric changes in the rectum and bladder in patients receiving CBCT-guided prostate IMRT: analysis based on daily CBCT dose calculation.	Delivered dose can be calculated by transferring the planned treatment beams onto the daily CBCT. Bladder and rectum volumetric doses were calculated and cor-related to the daily bladder and rectum fullness. Patients for this study underwent hypofractionated prostate IMRT to 70 Gy in 28 fractions. Daily CBCT was utilized for image guidance. A clinically acceptable plan was created using a CTV-to-PTV uniform margin of 5 mm. Image fusion was performed to transfer the bladder and rectum contours onto each CBCT. Contours were then edited to match the anatomy of each CBCT. Using the daily treatment isocenter, the planned beams were transferred onto the CBCT and daily and cumulative DVHs calculated. For the results a total of 168 daily CBCTs were evaluated. The bladder was found to be smaller for 74.7% of the 168 daily CBCTs accessed in this study. This reduction in volume correlated to an increase in the cumulative bladder V70 Gy from 9.47% on the planning CT to 10.99% during treatment. V70Gy for the rectum was 7.27% on the planning CT, when all six patients were averaged, and increased to 11.56% on the average of all daily treatment CBCTs. Increases in volumetric rectum dose correlated with increases in rectal volume. For one patient, the rectum and blad-der absolute V70 Gy, averaged over the course of treatment, increased by 295% and 61%, respectively. Larger variations in the daily bladder and rectal volume were observed and these correlated to large deviations from the volumetric dose received by these structures. In summary, bladder and rectum volume changes during treatment have an effect on the cumulative dose received by these organs. It was observed that the volumetric dose received by the bladder decreases as the volume of the bladder increases. The inverse was true for the rectum.
27929483	A dosimetric evaluation of knowledge-based VMAT planning with simultaneous integrated boosting for rectal cancer patients.	RapidPlan, a commercial knowledge-based optimizer, has been tested on head and neck, lung, esophageal, breast, liver, and prostate cancer patients. To appraise its performance on VMAT planning with simultaneous integrated boosting (SIB) for rectal cancer, this study configured a DVH (dose-volume histogram) estimation model consisting 80 best-effort manual cases of this type. Using the model-generated objectives, the MLC (multileaf collimator) sequences of other 70 clinically approved plans were reoptimized, while the remaining parameters, such as field geometry and photon energy, were maintained. Dosimetric outcomes were assessed by comparing homogeneity index (HI), conformal index (CI), hot spots (volumes receiving over 107% of the prescribed dose, V107%), mean dose and dose to the 50% volume of femoral head (Dmean_FH and D50%_FH), and urinary bladder (Dmean_UB and D50%_UB), and the mean DVH plotting. Paired samples t-test or Wilcoxon signed-rank test suggested that comparable CI were achieved by RapidPlan (0.99+/- 0.04 for PTVboost, and 1.03 +/- 0.02 for PTV) and original plans (1.00 +/- 0.05 for PTVboost and 1.03 +/- 0.02 for PTV), respectively (p &gt; 0.05). Slightly improved HI of planning target volume (PTVboost) and PTV were observed in the RapidPlan cases (0.05 +/- 0.01 for PTVboost, and 0.26 +/- 0.01 for PTV) than the original plans (0.06 +/- 0.01 for PTVboost and 0.26 +/- 0.01 for PTV), p &lt; 0.05. More cases with positive V107% were found in the original (18 plans) than the RapidPlan group (none). RapidPlan significantly reduced the D50%_FH (by 1.53 Gy / 9.86% from 15.52 +/- 2.17 to 13.99+/- 1.16 Gy), Dmean_FH (by 1.29 Gy / 7.78% from 16.59+/- 2.07 to 15.30 +/- 0.70 G), D50%_UB (by 4.93 Gy / 17.50% from 28.17 +/- 3.07 to 23.24+/- 2.13 Gy), and Dmean_UB (by 3.94Gy / 13.43% from 29.34 +/- 2.34 to 25.40 +/- 1.36 Gy), respectively. The more concentrated distribution of RapidPlan data points indicated an enhanced consis-tency of plan quality.
27929482	Anatomy-based definition of point A utilizing three-dimensional volumetric imaging approach for high-dose-rate (HDR) intracavitary brachytherapy dose prescription when treating cervical cancer using limited resources.	This study was designed to determine whether volumetric imaging could identify consistent alternative prescription methods to Manchester/point A when prescribing radiation dose in the treatment of cervical cancer using HDR intracavitary brachy-therapy (ICBT). One hundred and twenty-five treatment plans of 25 patients treated for carcinoma of the cervix were reviewed retrospectively. Each patient received 5 fractions of HDR ICBT following initial cisplatin-based pelvic chemoradiation, and radiation dose was originally prescribed to point A (ICRU-38). The gross tumor volume (GTV) and high-risk clinical target volume (HR-CTV) were contoured in three dimensions on the CT datasets, and inferior-superior, anterior-posterior, and left-right dimensions HR-CTV were recorded along with multiple anatomic and skeletal dimensions for each patient. The least square-best fit regression lines were plotted between one half of the HR-CTV width and pelvic cavity dimension at femoral head level and at maximum cavity dimension. The points in both plots lie reasonably close to straight lines and are well defined by straight lines with slopes of 0.15 and 0.17; intercept on y-axes of -0.08 and -0.03, point A, at the same level as defined based on applicator coordinates, is defined using this correlation, which is a function of distance between femoral heads/dimensions of maximum pelvic cavity width. Both relations, defined by straight lines, provide an estimated location of point A, which provides adequate coverage to the HR-CTV compared to the point A defined based on applicator coordinates. The point A defined based on femoral head distance would, therefore, be a reasonable surrogate to use for dose prescription because of subjective variation of cavity width dimension. Simple surrogate anatomic/skeletal landmarks can be useful for prescribing radiation dose when treating cervical cancer using intracavitary brachytherapy in limited-resource settings. Our ongoing work will continue to refine these models.
27928146	Clinical Significance of Hematuria in Atrial Fibrillation With Oral Anticoagulation Therapy.	BACKGROUND: Hematuria is a common and important complication in atrial fibrillation (AF) patients on oral anticoagulation therapy (OAT). This study evaluated the clinical significance of hematuria and its relationship with genitourinary disease in AF patients receiving OAT.Methods and Results:Among 20,456 consecutive AF patients who visited a tertiary hospital from January 2005 to April 2015, 5,833 had hematuria. Of these 5,833 patients, 3,798 were on OAT (OAT(+) group) and 2,035 were not (OAT(-) group). A total of 1,785 patients from each group were then matched on propensity score analysis. The prevalence of cancer and other diseases in the genitourinary tract was evaluated. While there was no difference in the prevalence of genitourinary stones or urinary tract infection, genitourinary cancer was significantly more common in the OAT(+) group than in the OAT(-) group (1.6% vs. 0.7%, P=0.011). Bladder cancer was the most common genitourinary malignancy, and it was significantly more common in the OAT(+) group (1.2% vs. 0.5%, P=0.019). Subjects on warfarin were more likely to have bladder cancers of lower pathologic grade (63.6% vs. 33.3%, P=0.124). CONCLUSIONS: OAT was associated with a higher prevalence and early detection of genitourinary cancer in AF patients with hematuria. Meticulous evaluation of the cause of hematuria is necessary in AF patients with hematuria receiving OAT.
27922690	MicroRNA-152 inhibits tumor cell growth by directly targeting RTKN in hepatocellular carcinoma.	Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common form of adult liver cancer and accounts for approximately 90% of all cases of primary liver cancer annually. Rhotekin (RTKN), which functions as a cancer promoter, can be frequently detected in many human cancers, including gastric cancer, colorectal carcinoma and bladder carcinoma. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of RTKN in HCC. Using HCC cells and tissues from patients with liver cancer, we demonstrated that RTKN was significantly increased in HCC. To examine the effect of RTKN on HCC, RTKN overexpressed or silenced HepG2 and Hep3B cells were constructed. Cell proliferation and apoptosis were measured by RT-PCR and flow cytometry. The results showed that RTKN can function as an oncogene and promote the proliferation, while inhibiting apoptosis, of HepG2 and Hep3B cells. Furthermore, we identified that RTKN is a direct gene target of miR-152. miR-152 can reverse the growth promoting effect of RTKN on HCC cells through G2/M phase arrest and nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) signal inhibition. In conclusion, our research identified that miRNA-152 can inhibit tumor cell growth by targeting RTKN in HCC.
27922689	Rb knockdown accelerates bladder cancer progression through E2F3 activation.	Bladder cancer is one of the most common cancers diagnosed in the world and leads to significant mortality and morbidity among affected patients. The retinoblastoma (Rb) protein is a main tumor suppressor, controlling cellular responses to potentially oncogenic stimulation. E2F3 was invariably disrupted in different human cancers for its central role in the control of cellular proliferation. Here, we investigated how Rb is integrated to control bladder cancer progression through E2F3 and p53 regulation. The results exhibit that Rb expression is lower in patients with bladder tumor, while E2F3 level is high. Rb knockdown enhanced bladder tumor cell proliferation and migration, aggravated with p53 silence. Interestingly, Rb silence results in E2F3, Myc and mTOR signaling pathway activation, contributing to bladder cancer cell proliferation and apoptosis suppression mainly through caspase-3 inhibition in vitro and in vivo. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that Rb is highly expressed in normal bladder cells, but was repressed in tumor tissues of the bladder completely, suggesting a possible role of Rb as a tumor suppressor.
27922685	5bromo3(3hydroxyprop1ynyl)2Hpyran2one induces apoptosis in T24 human bladder cancer cells through mitochondria-dependent signaling pathways.	The present study was performed to investigate the effect of 5-bromo-3-(3-hydroxyprop-1-ynyl)-2H-pyran-2-one (BHP) on the induction of apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in T24 human bladder carcinoma cells. An MTT assay was used to investigate the inhibition of cell proliferation. Flow cytometry was used to observe alterations in the cell cycle, generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), alterations in mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and induction of apoptosis in the T24 cells following BHP treatment. Western blot analysis was performed for the determination of expression levels of apoptotic proteins, and 4,6diamidino2phenylindole dihydrochloride staining was used to observe apoptosis and DNA damage. The results demonstrated that treatment of the bladder cancer cells with BHP enhanced the activation of caspases and increased the production of ROS. It also caused damage to DNA, reduced MMP, and increased the secretion of endonuclease G and apoptosisinducing factor from the mitochondria. The expression levels of cyclin E and cell division cycle 25C were reduced, whereas the expression levels of p21 and phosphorylated p53 were increased in the BHPtreated cells. In addition, treatment with BHP caused cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase, increased the expression levels of B cell lymphoma2 (Bcl2)associated X protein and poly(ADPribose) polymerase, decreased the expression of Bcl2 and ultimately induced apoptosis of the T24 cells. Thus, BHP inhibited the proliferation of bladder cancer cells by inducing cell apoptosis through the mitochondrial pathway.
27922670	Downregulation of LAPTM5 suppresses cell proliferation and viability inducing cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase of bladder cancer cells.	Our transcriptome analysis revealed in bladder cancer (BCa) tissues a significant induction of lysosomal-associated multispanning membrane protein 5 (LAPTM5), a lysosomal membrane protein preferentially expressing in immune cells and hematopoietic cells. Transportation of LAPTM5 from Golgi to lysosome could be inhibited by deficiency of Nedd4, a key member of E3 ubiquitin ligase family overexpressing in invasive BCa and promoting its progression. Therefore, we hypothesize that LAPTM5 may be closely correlated with BCa tumorigenesis. In human BCa tissues, we observed that LAPTM5 was significantly induced at both mRNA and protein levels, which is consistent with our microarray result. Furthermore, we established a BCa cell model with downregulated LAPTM5, revealing a significantly delayed growth rate in the BCa cells with knockdown of LAPTM5. Moreover, cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase was triggered by decreased LAPTM5 as well, which could lead to delayed BCa cell growth. In contrast, no significant alteration of apoptosis in the BCa cells with downregulated LAPTM5 was noticed. Analysis of the changes of migration and invasion, showed significant reduced LAPTM5 suppressed cell metastasis. Furthermore, proteins involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) were strongly altered, which plays a central role in metastasis. In addition, phosphorylated ERK1/2 and p38, key members of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family regulating BCa tumorigenesis, were strongly decreased. Taken together, our results suggested that decreased LAPTM5 inhibited proliferation and viability, as well as induced G0/G1 cell cycle arrest possibly via deactivation of ERK1/2 and p38 in BCa cells.
27919999	Predicting Survival After Irradiation of Metastases from Transitional Carcinoma of the Bladder.	AIM: For patients with metastatic bladder cancer, radiotherapy is a good option to control symptoms and improve outcomes. Potential prognostic factors for survival including the radiation dose were investigated. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Ten factors were evaluated in 63 patients for association with survival after irradiation namely age, gender, performance status, initial T-category, initial N-category, metastases at initial diagnosis, number of metastases, metastatic sites, radiation dose and time from diagnosis of metastases to irradiation. RESULTS: On univariate analysis, survival was negatively associated with Karnofsky performance score (KPS) </=70 (p=0.033), initial N-category >/=1 (p=0.026) and radiation doses given as equivalent dose in 2-Gy fractions (EQD2) <20 Gy. Doses >30 Gy were slightly superior to 20-30 Gy. On multivariate analysis, EQD2 (p=0.015) maintained its significance; a trend was found for N-category (p=0.063) and KPS (p=0.073). CONCLUSION: Predictors for survival after irradiation of metastases from bladder cancer were identified. Radiation doses >/=20 Gy should be used.
27919986	Videoscopic Inguinal-iliac-obturator Lymph-node Dissection: New Videoscopic Technique for Regional Lymphadenectomy in Patients with Melanoma.	AIM: The feasibility of videoscopic inguinal-iliac-obturator lymphadenectomy (VIIOL) was assessed in 20 patients with melanoma and compared with a retrospective sample of 24 patients undergoing standard 'open' technique (IIOL). RESULTS: No postoperative death occurred; the mean operative time was lower in the IIOL series (190 min vs. 302 min) but the quality of life was greatly improved in the VIIOL group thanks to earlier bladder catheter removal, no nasogastric suction, less pain, earlier mobilization, lower in-hospital stay, and earlier resumption of daily activities (27.6 vs. 83.2 days, p<0.001). Six out of 20 patients in the IIOL series had wound complications (30%) as compared to one in the VIIOL series (4%) (p=0.035). CONCLUSION: Staging and therapeutic efficacy of VIIOL were similar to the standard technique; the longer operative time of VIIOL was greatly compensated by less pain, lower wound complication rate, and earlier discharge from hospital and recovery of daily activities.
27919942	A Single Intravesical Instillation of VAX014 Inhibits Orthotopic Superficial Bladder Tumor Implantation to Increase Survival.	BACKGROUND/AIM: VAX014 minicells (VAX014) have been previously characterized as an integrin-specific oncolytic biotherapeutic agent. The present study was designed to evaluate the potential of VAX014 as an immediate post-operative intravesical adjuvant therapy in the treatment of non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The ability of VAX014 to kill a panel of dissociated urothelial carcinoma cell lines was tested in vitro. In vivo experiments were conducted using a single intravesical dose of VAX014 in the anti-implantation variation of the MB49 syngeneic orthotopic bladder cancer model with tumor implantation and overall survival rates serving as study endpoints. RESULTS: VAX014 rapidly killed dissociated urothelial carcinoma cells, while single dose in vivo pharmacology studies demonstrated the dose-dependent ability of VAX014 to prevent tumor implantation and development, ultimately resulting in a significant survival advantage compared to controls. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that VAX014 holds potential as an immediate post-operative adjuvant therapy in NMIBC.
27919140	[Undifferentiated Prostate Cancer Treated with Radiation Therapy].	We describe a 75-year-old man with undifferentiated prostate cancer that was treated with radiation therapy. He presented at a nearby general hospital with dysuria and pain upon micturition. He was diagnosed with undifferentiated prostate cancer by a needle biopsy and referred to our hospital for further examination and treatment. Enhanced computed tomography and magnetic resonance images showed prostate cancer and right obturator lymph node metastasis measuring 2.5 cm. Cystoscopy and colonoscopy revealed direct invasion of the urinary bladder and rectum. We constructed a vesical fistula and an artificial anus, and then treated the primary tumor and lymph node metastasis with radiation. Undifferentiated prostate cancer is extremely rare and to our knowledge only a few cases have been reported. We suggest that radiation might be effective for treating undifferentiated prostate cancer with or without local invasion and/or metastasis along with total body control.
27919138	[Modified Toyoda Method for Complete Duplex Ureters in Tubeless Cutaneous Ureterostomy : Report of a Case].	A 65-year-old man underwent radical cystectomy and cutaneous ureterostomy for bladder cancer. Because the patient had left complete duplex ureters,we modified the Toyoda method to construct the tubeless cutaneous ureterostomy with a unilateral stomal creation. The adhesive portion of both ureteral walls in duplex ureters was simultaneously cut approximately 5 mm from the distal end longitudinally,and the common sheath of the cut portion of the ureters was cut approximately 5 mm longitudinally in order to separate the two ureters. This procedure was repeated to make a"fish-mouth"aperture. Two opened ureteral walls were formed into the upper and lower plates of the Toyoda method stoma,respectively. To our knowledge,this is the first report of a surgical procedure of the tubeless cutaneous ureterostomy in complete duplex ureters.
27919135	[Bladder Metastasis of Renal Cell Carcinoma 7 Years after Ex Vivo Partial Nephrectomy and Auto-Transplantation : A Case Report].	Metastasis of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) to urinary bladder is extremely rare. We report a case of metastasis arising from RCC to the urinary bladder 7 years after treatment of bilateral RCC. A 74-year-old man was diagnosed with bilateral multiple renal tumors (T1aN0M1, PUL, OSS) with two lesions in the right kidney and a solitary lesion of the left kidney in 2008. He underwent laparoscopic radical nephrectomy for the right side in September 2008. The next month, ex vivo partial nephrectomy and auto-transplantation was performed for the left kidney because the tumor was located very close to the collecting system. Metastatectomies for the lung and bone followed and the histopathological findings of all lesions were clear cell carcinoma. The following years went well without any recurrence. Seven years after the surgery, the patient complained of asymptomatic gross hematuria and cystoscopy revealed a solitary non-papillary tumor of the bladder. Transurethral resection of the tumor was performed in June 2015 and the histopathological diagnosis of the resected specimens was clear cell carcinoma. Because the additional immunohistochemical examinations were positive for CD10 and negative for CK7, we diagnosed the bladder tumor as metastasis arising from RCC. Direct dissemination of the tumor cells into the urinary tract during partial nephrectomy followed by implantation to the bladder mucosa is a probable mechanism of metastasis in this case.
27919128	[Ipsilateral Occurrence of Renal Pelvic Carcinoma after Partial Nephrectomy for Renal Cell Carcinoma].	A 70-year-old man underwent left partial nephrectomy for renal cell carcinoma (pT1aN0M0). One year after the surgery, he presented with hematuria and fatigue. Computed tomography showed a left 8 cm renal tumor and multiple liver and lung metastases. We performed percutaneous renal and liver biopsy with echo guidance. The diagnosis of both kidney and liver was urothelial carcinoma. He died 3 weeks after the diagnosis. Ipsilateral occurrence of the pelvic renal carcinoma after partial nephrectomy for renal cell carcinoma is extremely rare. To our knowledge, this case is the first to be reported in Japan and elsewhere.
27913867	Comparison of different concepts for interpretation of chromosomal aberrations in urothelial cells detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization.	PURPOSE: Urine fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) has become a broadly used marker for noninvasive detection of bladder cancer (BC). However, it has been discussed whether the interpretation algorithm proposed by the manufacturer could be improved. Aim of the present study was to compare alternative evaluation strategies of FISH for detection of BC. METHODS: We included 1048 patients suspicious for BC, who underwent urine FISH examination before cystoscopy (diagnostic cohort). Herefrom, we selected 122 patients (prognostic cohort) with a history of non-muscle-invasive BC who were cystoscopically tumor free and received FISH analysis ahead of a follow-up period of 24 months. FISH results were interpreted by the algorithms of UroVysion, Bubendorf et al. and Zellweger et al. RESULTS: In the diagnostic cohort, 228 patients (21.8%) had BC at time of evaluation; in the prognostic cohort 39 patients (32.0%) experienced tumor recurrence. Alterations in chromosome 3, 7 and 17 correlated with the presence of BC. Relative loss of 9p21 was associated with BC and higher risk for progression. The evaluation strategy proposed by Zellweger et al. showed highest accuracy of all FISH assessments. Performance of evaluation strategies differed in voided urine samples and samples obtained after mechanical manipulation. CONCLUSIONS: The performance of FISH in BC diagnosis strongly depends on the interpretation criteria. Alternative evaluation methods partly show superior diagnostic performance compared to the manufacturer's algorithm. The introduction of specific cutoffs for tetraploid cells improves specificity. Further modifications of the interpretation algorithm of the Urovysion(R) FISH assay have the potential to positively affect the value of this test in diagnosis and surveillance of BC.
27909718	Enzalutamide inhibits proliferation of gemcitabine-resistant bladder cancer cells with increased androgen receptor expression.	Advanced bladder cancer is treated mainly with gemcitabine and cisplatin, but most patients eventually become resistance. Androgen receptor (AR) signaling has been implicated in bladder cancer as well as other types of cancer including prostate cancer. In this study, we investigated the expression and role of AR in gemcitabine-resistant bladder cancer cells and also the potential of enzalutamide, an AR inhibitor, as a therapeutic for the chemoresistance. First of all, we established gemcitabine-resistant T24 cells (T24GR) from T24 bladder cancer cells and performed gene expression profiling. Microarray analysis revealed upregulation of AR expression in T24GR cells compared with T24 cells. AR mRNA and protein expression was confirmed to be increased in T24GR cells, respectively, by quantitative RT-PCR and western blot analysis, which was associated with more potent AR transcriptional activity as measured by luciferase reporter assay. The copy number of AR gene in T24GR cells determined by PCR was twice as many as that of T24 cells. AR silencing by siRNA transfection resulted in inhibition of proliferation of T24GR cells. Cell culture in charcoal-stripped serum and treatment with enzalutamide inhibited growth of T24GR cells, which was accompanied by cell cycle arrest. AR transcriptional activity was found to be reduced in T24GR cells by enzalutamide treatment. Lastly, enzalutamide also inhibited cell proliferation of HTB5 bladder cancer cells that express AR and possess intrinsic resistance to gemcitabine. Our results suggest that enzalutamide may have the potential to treat patients with advanced gemcitabine-resistant bladder cancer with increased AR expression.
27903467	Arteriocutaneous Fistula Associated with Bilateral Femoral Pseudoaneurysms Caused by Bacillus Calmette-Guerin. Apropos of a Case and Review of Literature.	Vascular complications of intravesical instillation of bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) are rare. BCG is an attenuated strain of Mycobacterium bovis that was initially developed for vaccination against tuberculosis, but it has also been used as an adjuvant treatment for bladder transitional carcinoma. We report a patient with a history of instillation of BCG 2 years before, who underwent surgical treatment of 2 pseudoaneurysms. The first, located in the left superficial femoral artery (SFA), was resected, and the artery was ligated because he had a history of femoropopliteal occlusion. After 4 weeks, he presented another one associated with hemorrhage by cutaneous fistula, in the right common femoral artery. In this case, revascularization was performed by means a common-to-deep femoral artery bypass with polytetrafluorethylene graft and reimplantation of SFA. Initially, bacterial cultures were negative, but bacilli cultures identified M. bovis after 3 weeks. Antituberculosis therapy was administered. After 13 months, the patient was asymptomatic and duplex ultrasound showed no signs of recurrent infection. This exposure should be considered if presentation of the false aneurysm is spontaneous and there is a history of bladder carcinoma.
27900539	SEOM Clinical Guideline for treatment of muscle-invasive and metastatic urothelial bladder cancer (2016).	The goal of this article is to provide recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of muscle-invasive and metastatic bladder cancer. The diagnosis of muscle-invasive bladder cancer is made by pathologic evaluation after transurethral resection. Recently, a molecular classification has been proposed. Staging of muscle-invasive bladder cancer must be done by computed tomography scans of the chest, abdomen and pelvis and classified on the basis of UICC system. Radical cystectomy and lymph node dissection are the treatment of choice. In muscle-invasive bladder cancer, neoadjuvant chemotherapy should be recommended in patients with good performance status and no renal function impairment. Although there is insufficient evidence for use of adjuvant chemotherapy, its use must be considered when neoadjuvant therapy had not been administered in high-risk patients. Multimodality bladder-preserving treatment in localized disease is an alternative in selected and compliant patients for whom cystectomy is not considered for clinical or personal reasons. In metastatic disease, the first-line treatment for patients must be based on cisplatin-containing combination. Vinflunine is the only drug approved for use in second line in Europe. Recently, immunotherapy treatment has demonstrated activity in this setting.
27900519	Early dynamic imaging in 68Ga- PSMA-11 PET/CT allows discrimination of urinary bladder activity and prostate cancer lesions.	PURPOSE: PET/CT with 68Ga-labelled prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-ligands has been proven to establish a promising imaging modality in the work-up of prostate cancer (PC) patients with biochemical relapse. Despite a high overall detection rate, the visualisation of local recurrence may be hampered by high physiologic tracer accumulation in the urinary bladder on whole body imaging, usually starting 60 min after injection. This study sought to verify whether early dynamic 68Ga-PSMA-11 (HBED-CC)PET/CT can differentiate pathologic PC-related tracer uptake from physiologic tracer accumulation in the urinary bladder. METHODS: Eighty consecutive PC patients referred to 68Ga -PSMA-11 PET/CT were included in this retrospective analysis (biochemical relapse: n = 64; primary staging: n = 8; evaluation of therapy response/restaging: n = 8). In addition to whole-body PET/CT acquisition 60 min post injection early dynamic imaging of the pelvis in the first 8 min after tracer injection was performed. SUVmax of pathologic lesions was calculated and time-activity curves were generated and compared to those of urinary bladder and areas of physiologic tracer uptake. RESULTS: A total of 55 lesions consistent with malignancy on 60 min whole body imaging exhibited also pathologic 68Ga-PSMA-11 uptake during early dynamic imaging (prostatic bed/prostate gland: n = 27; lymph nodes: n = 12; bone: n = 16). All pathologic lesions showed tracer uptake within the first 3 min, whereas urinary bladder activity was absent within the first 3 min of dynamic imaging in all patients. Suvmax was significantly higher in PC lesions in the first 6 min compared to urinary bladder accumulation (p < 0.001). In the subgroup of PC patients with biochemical relapse the detection rate of local recurrence could be increased from 20.3 to 29.7%. CONCLUSIONS: Early dynamic imaging in 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT reliably enables the differentiation of pathologic tracer uptake in PC lesions from physiologic bladder accumulation. Performance of early dynamic imaging in addition to whole body imaging 60 min after tracer injection might improve the detection rate of local recurrence in PC patients with biochemical relapse referred for 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT.
27897011	A SPATIOTEMPORAL MODEL TO SIMULATE CHEMOTHERAPY REGIMENS FOR HETEROGENEOUS BLADDER CANCER METASTASES TO THE LUNG.	Tumors are composed of heterogeneous populations of cells. Somatic genetic aberrations are one form of heterogeneity that allows clonal cells to adapt to chemotherapeutic stress, thus providing a path for resistance to arise. In silico modeling of tumors provides a platform for rapid, quantitative experiments to inexpensively study how compositional heterogeneity contributes to drug resistance. Accordingly, we have built a spatiotemporal model of a lung metastasis originating from a primary bladder tumor, incorporating in vivo drug concentrations of first-line chemotherapy, resistance data from bladder cancer cell lines, vascular density of lung metastases, and gains in resistance in cells that survive chemotherapy. In metastatic bladder cancer, a first-line drug regimen includes six cycles of gemcitabine plus cisplatin (GC) delivered simultaneously on day 1, and gemcitabine on day 8 in each 21-day cycle. The interaction between gemcitabine and cisplatin has been shown to be synergistic in vitro, and results in better outcomes in patients. Our model shows that during simulated treatment with this regimen, GC synergy does begin to kill cells that are more resistant to cisplatin, but repopulation by resistant cells occurs. Post-regimen populations are mixtures of the original, seeded resistant clones, and/or new clones that have gained resistance to cisplatin, gemcitabine, or both drugs. The emergence of a tumor with increased resistance is qualitatively consistent with the five-year survival of 6.8% for patients with metastatic transitional cell carcinoma of the urinary bladder treated with a GC regimen. The model can be further used to explore the parameter space for clinically relevant variables, including the timing of drug delivery to optimize cell death, and patient-specific data such as vascular density, rates of resistance gain, disease progression, and molecular profiles, and can be expanded for data on toxicity. The model is specific to bladder cancer, which has not previously been modeled in this context, but can be adapted to represent other cancers.
27896277	Prediction of Bacillus Calmette-Guerin Response in Patients with Bladder Cancer after Transurethral Resection of Bladder Tumor by Using Genetic Variation Based on Genomic Studies.	Purpose. We aimed to comprehensively review contemporary literature on genetic and epigenetic biomarkers associated with the prediction of Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) response after the transurethral resection of a bladder tumor and to discuss the application of these biomarkers in precision cancer care for bladder cancer. Method. We performed a systematic review of published literatures in the databases PubMed and Embase by using the following key words: bladder cancer, BCG, gene, and methylation. Studies associated with cell lines, animal models, and muscle invasive bladder cancer were excluded. Results. The genetic variations associated with BCG response can be classified into three categories: germline variations, somatic variations, and epigenetic alterations. Genes related to BCG response were mainly involved in single-nucleotide polymorphisms, copy number variations, and gene methylations. Conclusions. Although these gene alterations are currently the most promising predictive markers of BCG response, most studies about bladder cancer DNA biomarkers are related to germline variations in candidate genes, and the results are not consistent. Only one study is related to somatic variation, and further evaluation in large-scale validation studies should be conducted to assess the potential clinical application of these findings. In addition, other biomarkers based on different "-omics" technologies should be considered in future studies.
27894318	Surgical treatment of recurrent urachal carcinoma with liver metastasis: a case report and literature review.	BACKGROUND: Urachal carcinoma is a rare malignancy with poor prognosis due to late presentation of the disease and its aggressiveness. Surgery remains the mainstay of therapy even in cases of disease recurrence. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of salvage surgery in the case of urachal carcinoma with liver metastasis. CASE PRESENTATION: The patient was a young woman who suffered from locally advanced urachal carcinoma treated with en-bloc cystectomy, hysterectomy with bilateral adnexectomy, partial resection of the sigmoid colon, and partial resection of the rectus abdominis muscle with the fascia, skin, and umbilicus. Adjuvant chemotherapy with paclitaxel and carboplatin was applied. Two years after the treatment, she was diagnosed with a single liver metastasis and a local pelvic recurrence. In a two-step operation, the patient underwent right hemihepatectomy as well as resection of pelvic recurrence site and adjuvant chemotherapy with gemcitabine. Due to the disease progression, a complete resection of the lesions was not achieved and the response to chemotherapy was poor. The patient died of the disease after a year. CONCLUSIONS: Surgery is the first line of treatment for urachal carcinoma and should be always considered as an option in cases of disease recurrence. Radical initial surgical management, close patient surveillance, and prompt treatment of disease relapse may all contribute to prolonging patient's survival.
27893679	Pelvic inflammatory disease increases the risk of a second primary malignancy in patients with cervical cancer treated by surgery alone.	As the number of long-term cervical cancer survivors continues to increase because of improvements in treatment, concerns about second primary malignancy have grown. The high-risk area of second primary cancers in cervical cancer survivors is the pelvis. Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) could be a useful marker for gynecological cancers. Thus, we designed a large-scale, nationwide, controlled cohort study to investigate whether PID or other risk factors increased the risk of second primary cancers in patients with cervical cancer treated by surgery alone.Between 2000 and 2010, a total of 24,444 cervical cancer patients were identified using the Registry Data for Catastrophic Illness and the National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) of Taiwan. Patients who received definite surgery were selected. To exclude the effect on second primary malignancy by treatment modalities, all cervical patients who ever having received adjuvant or definite radiotherapy or chemotherapy for primary cervical cancer were excluded. Finally, 3860 cervical cancer patients treated by surgery alone without adjuvant treatments were analyzed.Cox proportional hazards model was used for multivariate analysis and the Kaplan-Meier method was used to assess the cumulative risks. Regarding the incidence of second primary cancers, the standardized incidence ratio (SIR) was used.The median follow-up time was 56.6 months. The 6-year cumulative risk of second primary cancers is 0.16% and 0.12% for PID and without PID, respectively. After adjustment for confounders, age of less than 50 years, the presence of diabetes mellitus, and PID were significantly positivity associated with the risk of second primary cancers. The hazard ratios (HRs) of age less than 50 years, diabetes mellitus, and PID were 1.38 (95% CI = 1.11-2.04), 1.40 (95% CI = 1.06-1.85), and 1.35 (95% CI = 1.00-1.81), respectively. A higher incidence of second primary cancers was observed in the genitals, bladder, and colon.In conclusion, the incidence of second primary cancers was higher in the genitals, bladder, and colon in patients with cervical cancer treated with surgery alone. The patients with PID had a higher risk of second primary cancers.
27888661	Use of vimentin immunocytochemical staining for evaluation of atypical cells in voided urine samples.	BACKGROUND: Cytomorphology of exfoliated atypical reactive/repair renal tubular cells (RRTC) can resemble atypical urothelial cells thus suggesting a differential diagnostic question of urothelial neoplasia in urinary cytology. Vimentin expression has been shown in RRTC and used for differentiation from atypical urothelial cells. METHODS: The institutional computer database was searched for urinary cytology cases with vimentin immunocytochemical staining (2008-2012). Original cytopathological diagnoses based on cytomorphology and the results of vimentin immunostaining were compared to follow-up data, including histopathological diagnosis, subsequent urinary cytopathology reports, and clinical findings. RESULTS: Of the 42 cases with vimentin immunocytochemical staining, 33 were positive and 9 negative. Consequently, significant renal disease was found in 9/33 (27%) of vimentin positive cases and nehrolithiasis in 4/33 (12%) of vimentin positive and 1/9 (11%) of vimentin negative cases. Erythrocyturia of undetermined origin was diagnosed in nine cases (seven vimentin positive and two negative). Urinary cytology follow-up was negative in three vimentin positive cases. Urothelial carcinoma was found in 3/9 (30%) of vimentin negative cases. Thirteen patients were lost to follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Vimentin immunocytochemical staining could be used as an ancillary method for evaluation of atypical cells in urinary specimens in selected cases with RRTC exhibiting cytological atypia. Unnecessary diagnostic procedures for evaluation of urothelial carcinoma could be avoided in vimentin positive cases and further diagnostic work-up for evaluation of a significant renal disease could be suggested in vimentin positive cases.

27885906	Supporting women with toileting in palliative care: use of the female urinal for bladder management.	AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: This study explored whether a female urinal is an acceptable, safe and effective product to meet the toileting requirements of women receiving palliative care on oncology wards in hospitals. BACKGROUND: There is minimal evidence on how urinary incontinence should be managed in women receiving palliative care. Female urinals may present an option. There have been two general reviews of products, but no formal evaluation since 1999. METHODS: This qualitative interview study used semi-structured interviews. Eleven healthy volunteers, 9 patients and 7 staff members used (or assisted with) a VernaFem (Vernacare) female urinal and were subsequently interviewed. Directed content analysis was used to analyse the interviews. RESULTS: User testing confirmed that the VernaFem is an acceptable, safe and effective product. Design improvements were suggested. CONCLUSIONS: While unlikely to be suitable for all patients, hospitals should consider offering a female urinal to patients in receipt of palliative care.
27879653	Ellagic Acid Inhibits Bladder Cancer Invasiveness and In Vivo Tumor Growth.	Ellagic acid (EA) is a polyphenolic compound that can be found as a naturally occurring hydrolysis product of ellagitannins in pomegranates, berries, grapes, green tea and nuts. Previous studies have reported the antitumor properties of EA mainly using in vitro models. No data are available about EA influence on bladder cancer cell invasion of the extracellular matrix triggered by vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A), an angiogenic factor associated with disease progression and recurrence, and tumor growth in vivo. In this study, we have investigated EA activity against four different human bladder cancer cell lines (i.e., T24, UM-UC-3, 5637 and HT-1376) by in vitro proliferation tests (measuring metabolic and foci forming activity), invasion and chemotactic assays in response to VEGF-A and in vivo preclinical models in nude mice. Results indicate that EA exerts anti-proliferative effects as a single agent and enhances the antitumor activity of mitomycin C, which is commonly used for the treatment of bladder cancer. EA also inhibits tumor invasion and chemotaxis, specifically induced by VEGF-A, and reduces VEGFR-2 expression. Moreover, EA down-regulates the expression of programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1), an immune checkpoint involved in immune escape. EA in vitro activity was confirmed by the results of in vivo studies showing a significant reduction of the growth rate, infiltrative behavior and tumor-associated angiogenesis of human bladder cancer xenografts. In conclusion, these results suggest that EA may have a potential role as an adjunct therapy for bladder cancer.
27879189	Gemcitabine-induced hemolytic-uremic syndrome treated with eculizumab or plasmapheresis: two case reports.	BACKGROUND: Drug-induced hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS) has shown good response to eculizumab (ECU). We present 2 cases of patients with gemcitabine-induced HUS (GEM-HUS), one of whom was treated with ECU and the other with conventional treatment. Patient 1: A 74-year-old male with resected adenocarcinoma of the pancreas started adjuvant treatment with GEM, but after 5 months GEM was discontinued due to acute kidney injury and severe hypertension. Laboratory analyses identified microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MHA) and thrombocytopenia. Plasmapheresis (Pph) was initiated but was stopped due to a severe adverse reaction. Treatment with ECU was initiated at the time of clinical progression requiring hemodialysis. After 7 doses of ECU, hemolysis and kidney function improved and the patient was able to stop hemodialysis. 1 month after the last dose of ECU serum creatinine (sCr) was 1.8 mg/dL. Patient 2: A 68-year-old male with resected urothelial carcinoma stopped GEM after 2 months due to hematologic toxicity. 1 month later the patient visited the emergency room due to minimal effort dyspnea, hypertension, and peripheral edema. Laboratory analyses showed decreased kidney function, MHA, and thrombocytopenia. Symptomatic treatment was started. After an initial recovery, kidney dysfunction, hemolysis, and thrombocytopenia progressed. Corticoid boluses were ineffective and hemodialysis was initiated. Eleven Pph treatments were necessary to recover hematologic data. The patient remained on hemodialysis for 2 months and evolved to stage IV chronic kidney disease. 8 months after hospital release, sCr was 3.5 mg/dL. CONCLUSION: ECU successfully improved kidney function in a patient with GEM-HUS, while conventional treatment did not..
27876211	Evaluation of anti-proliferative and anti-inflammatory activities of Pelagia noctiluca venom in Lipopolysaccharide/Interferon-gamma stimulated RAW264.7 macrophages.	Components of Pelagia noctiluca (P. noctiluca) venom were evaluated for their anticancer and nitric Oxide (NO) inhibition activities. Three fractions, out of four, obtained by gel filtration on Sephadex G75 of P. noctiluca venom revealed an important selective anti-proliferative activity on several cell lines such as human bladder carcinoma (RT112), human glioblastoma (U87), and human myelogenous leukemia (K562) but not on mitogen-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Interestingly, P. noctiluca components showed an important dose-dependent anti-inflammatory activity, through inhibition of NO production via transcriptional regulation of Inducible NO Synthase (iNOS), in IFN-gamma/LPS stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophages. These data strongly suggest that P. noctiluca venom could be used as a natural inhibitor of cancer cell lines and a potent anti-inflammatory agent for the treatment of anti-inflammatory diseases.
27873391	Immunocytochemical staining for p53 and Ki-67 helps to characterise urothelial cells in urine cytology.	OBJECTIVE: The presence of atypical cells in urine cytology is unsatisfactory for both cytologists and clinicians. The objective of this study was to test whether p53 and Ki-67 immunostaining could improve urothelial carcinoma (UC) detection on urinary cytology. METHODS: A total of 196 urine samples were analysed, 142 from the bladder, 41 from the upper tract and 13 from ileal bladder replacement. Cytology results were expressed as normal (N) (n = 81), atypia cannot exclude low-grade UC (ALG) (n = 25), suspicious for high-grade UC (SHG) (n = 39) and high-grade UC (HG) (n = 51). Actual diagnoses were confirmed by histopathological analysis, cystoscopic examination or follow-up for at least 1 year. Immunocytochemistry performed on CytoSpin slides allowed the determination of the percentage of positive cells with p53 and Ki-67. RESULTS: The median percentage values [first to third quartile] of p53 and Ki-67 were 0 [0-5] and 0 [0-1] for N cytology, 5 [0-40] and 2 [1-10] for ALG, 10 [0-30] and 6 [3-25] for SHG, and 30 [10-80] and 20 [10-30] for HG, respectively. Statistically higher values were observed for both tests (P < 0.001) in positive cytologies (ALG, SHG and HG). The optimal cut-offs were 5% for p53 and 3% for Ki-67. The sensitivity and specificity for the detection of all UC were 86.4% and 76.7% for cytology alone, 81.3% and 93.2% for cytology and p53, 75.7% and 88% for cytology and Ki-67, and 68.9% and 97.5% for cytology, p53 and Ki-67, respectively. CONCLUSION: Using p53 and/or Ki-67 in addition to cytology increases the specificity without penalising the sensitivity.
27871870	Carcinogenic risk of emerging persistent organic pollutant perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS): A proposal of classification.	Perfluoroalkyls are stable synthetic chemicals, able to repel oils, fats and water. These compounds have been used in the manufacturing of products such as Teflon(R), lubricants, paints, fire-fighting foams, coatings for pans, carpets, clothes, and paperboard for packaging, among others. It is believed that populations are exposed constantly to them. Its regulation in the world is under development and several controversies are in the course of litigation. One occupational study shows bladder cancer risk. This paper intends to review scientific information on the most critical perfluoroalkyl compound and proposes a procedure to get a cancer-risk categorization which PFOS can cause to populations. METHODS: As a guiding axis, we used the IARC process for developing monographs of carcinogenic risks. We used the SIGN guides for evaluating the quality of studies in human populations; and finally, we used the Squire method for evaluating studies in laboratory animals. Inadequate evidence of carcinogenicity was found in human studies mainly due to chance, threshold effect and confounders. In experimental animal studies, inadequate evidence of carcinogenicity was found in view of the number of affected species, different types of neoplasms, dose-response relationship and genotoxicity found in in-vivo and in-vitro studies. In this proposal, we concluded that cancer risk for PFOS, according to the IARC method, is not classifiable as carcinogenic to humans (group 3).
27869492	Risk factors for development of primary bladder squamous cell carcinoma.	INTRODUCTION The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of risk factors for primary squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the bladder. MATERIALS A total of 90 cases of primary SCC of the bladder were identified through multicentre analysis. Patient demographics, stage and grade of cancer at presentation, management and outcomes were recorded. The presence of known risk factors (catheter use, neuropathic bladder, smoking history, recurrent urinary tract infection and bladder stones) was also documented. RESULTS Over half of the patients had at least one identifiable risk factor for the development of primary bladder SCC: 13.9% of patients had a history of catheter use (clean intermittent self-catheterisation [CISC] in 11.1%), 10.0% of patients had a neuropathic bladder, 27.8% were smokers or ex-smokers and 20.0% had a documented history of recurrent urinary tract infection. Statistical analysis of the results showed no association between risk factors and grade of tumour at presentation. CONCLUSIONS These data further support the association between primary bladder SCC and several of the well documented risk factors for its development. Chronic use of CISC may confer a greater risk for development of SCC than thought previously. Further evidence of the role of CISC in primary SCC is required to justify routine screening and to determine exactly when surveillance of the bladder should begin for this group of patients.
27867173	Evaluation of In Vivo Volumetric Dosimetry for Prostate Cancer Using Electronic Portal Imaging Device.	PURPOSE: Volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) is capable of acquiring projection images using electronic portal imaging device (EPID). Commercial EPID-based dosimetry software, dosimetry check (DC), allows in vivo dosimetry using projection images. The purpose of this study was to evaluate in vivo dosimetry for prostate cancer using VMAT. METHOD: VMAT plans were generated for eight patients with prostate cancer using treatment planning system (TPS), and patient quality assurances (QAs) were carried out with phantom. We analyzed five plans as phantom study and five plans as patient study. Projection images were acquired during VMAT delivery. DC converted acquired images into fluence images and used a pencil beam algorithm to calculate dose distributions delivered on the CT images of the phantom and the patients. We evaluated isocenter point doses and gamma analysis in both studies and dose indexes of planning target volume (PTV), bladder and rectum in patient study. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Dose differences at the isocenter were less than a criterion in both studies. Pass rates of the gamma analysis were less than a criterion by two plans in the phantom study. Dose indexes of reconstructed distribution were lower than original plans and standard deviations of PTV in reconstructed distribution were larger than original plans. The errors were caused by some issues, such as the commissioning of DC, variations in patient anatomy, and patient positioning. CONCLUSION: The method was feasible to non-invasively perform in vivo dose evaluation for prostate cancer using VMAT.
27866896	Performance of the irregular surface compensator compared with four-field box and intensity modulated radiation therapy for gynecologic cancer.	PURPOSE: A retrospective planning study was undertaken to evaluate the dosimetric advantages of the irregular surface compensator (ISC) technique, a forward planning technique with electronic compensation algorithm available on Varian Eclipse treatment planning system. This was extensively compared to the conventional four-field box (4FB) and intensity modulated radiation therapy using 5 fields (IMRT5F) on gynecologic cancer patients. METHODS: Twenty-two patients were enrolled. The prescribed dose was 50.4Gy in 28 fractions to the primary target including pelvic lymph nodes. 4FB treatment plans were generated, then fluence of anterior and posterior fields were modified to generate ISC plans. IMRT5F were inversely optimized with equally spaced five coplanar fields. Dose-volume parameters were evaluated for the comparison of three planning techniques. The MU and delivery time were also estimated. RESULTS: In terms of target coverage, the conformity and homogeneity index of ISC (1.67 and 1.03, respectively) were superior to those of 4FB (2.43 and 1.06, respectively) but slightly inferior to those of IMRT5F (1.10 and 1.02, respectively). ISC also illustrated an overall improvement in normal organ saving. Compared to 4FB, the mean dose of the rectum was reduced by about 4.0-5.0Gy with ISC and IMRT5F. The volume receiving large doses was reduced for bladder with statistical significance with ISC and more with IMRT5F relative to 4FB. The mean number of MU per fraction were 200.86 (4FB), 446.09 (ISC) and 895.59 (IMRT5F). CONCLUSION: The ISC technique has the superior target coverage and healthy tissue sparing in comparison with conventional 4FB and comparable normal organ saving compared to IMRT5F. The ISC can be an available option for gynecologic radiotherapy.
27863160	Primary B-cell lymphoma of the uterine cervix: Presentation in Pap-test slide and cervical biopsy.	This case involved a 69-year-old female who presented with irritative urinary voiding. Imaging studies showed an 18-cm uterine mass centering on the cervix and extending into the bladder. The Pap test slide demonstrated necrotic background and degenerative changes in single and grouped atypical "small round blue cells" with high nuclear/cytoplasm ratio, scant cytoplasm, and hyperchromatic focally cleaved nuclei with occasional nuclear membrane "snout projections." Cervical biopsies showed similar findings. The tumor cells were positive for CD45, CD20, and PAX-5, and negative with epithelial, neuroendocrine, and muscle markers. A Ki-67 immunostain showed a markedly elevated proliferative index and the MUM1 stain was diffusely positive. Molecular study identified clonal immunoglobulin heavy chain gene rearrangement. Owing to its rarity, cervical lymphoma may sometimes be confused with other types of malignant neoplasms or inflammatory processes. Therefore, it is important to recognize the cytological features of cervical lymphomas and be aware of the potential diagnostic pitfalls for timely diagnosis and therapy. Diagn.

27861390	Diagnosis and treatment of gastrointestinal stromal tumor extending to prostate: A case report and literature review.	RATIONALE: Gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) is the neoplasm of gastrointestinal tract. PATIENT CONCERNS: The patient complained about the retention of urinary. DIAGNOSES: GIST. INTERVENTIONS: radical prostatectomy and the imatinib therapy. OUTCOMES: No recurrence and metastasis have been found during a 14-month follow-up. LESSONS: comprehensive treatment is necessary for the GIST treatment. Furthermore, we summarize a review of the literature of GIST occurring in the prostate gland treated by different methods and 4 kinds of rare diseases in prostate.
27859848	Evaluation of double immunocytochemical staining for CK20 and P53 as a potential adjunct to cytology for urothelial cancer diagnosis.	OBJECTIVE: To evaluate double immunocytochemical staining with p53 and CK20, as a tool for improving the accuracy of urinary cytology. The aim of the present study was to clarify the diagnostic significance of the expression of these markers and to investigate the possibility of using this information for better monitoring of bladder cancer patients during follow-up. MATERIAL AND METHODS: One hundred and twenty-five urine cytology cases were retrieved with corresponding histology from our files. One ThinPrep(R) smear was available for each of them and dual immunocytological staining for p53 and CK20 was performed. Eleven cases were excluded from the study because of hypocellularity. The material comprised 58 malignant, 36 atypical and 20 negative for malignancy cases. Immunocytochemistry was evaluated by two cytopathologists, blinded to the histological diagnosis or follow-up data. A cut-off threshold of five stained atypical cells, according to the literature, was used for evaluation. RESULTS: Fifty-two out of 58 malignant cases were positive for at least one of the markers (89.6%). In the atypical and negative groups, 18 (50%) and 5 (25%) cases were positive, respectively. Accuracy parameters evaluation for cytology versus the combination of cytology with immunocytological staining were: sensitivity 73.4% versus 91.1%, specificity 100% versus 74.3%, positive predictive value (PPV) 100% versus 88.9% and negative predictive value (NPV) 62.5% versus 78.8%. CONCLUSIONS: Double immunocytochemical staining for p53 and CK20 is easy to perform and evaluate and can improve cytology sensitivity. It is helpful in establishing a diagnosis of malignancy and may be used as a triage tool to select patients that require cystoscopy during clinical follow-up.
27859276	Urological complications after cystectomy as part of pelvic exenteration are higher than that after cystectomy for primary bladder malignancy.	BACKGROUND: Total cystectomy and subsequent reconstruction of the urinary tract may be required for primary malignancy of the bladder, or in the context of multi-visceral resection for more advanced pelvic tumors. Complications following urinary diversion are a major source of morbidity, particularly in pelvic exenteration (PE) patients. METHODS: All patients who underwent radical cystectomy alone or during PE at a single tertiary referral centre between 2008 and 2014 were reviewed. Postoperative urological complications were collected and compared between groups. RESULTS: Two hundred and thirty-one patients underwent en bloc cystectomy (98 cystectomy alone, 133 as part of a PE). Postoperative urological complications occurred in 33% of the cystectomy alone group and 59% of the PE group (P < 0.001). PE for recurrence had higher complications than PE for primary malignancy (67% vs. 48%, P = 0.035). Urological leaks occurred in 3%, 6%, and 14% of patient who had cystectomy alone, PE for primary malignancy and PE for recurrence. Major blood loss and previous pelvic radiotherapy independently predicted conduit-associated complications in PE patients (P = 0.002 and 0.035). CONCLUSIONS: Urological complications of cystectomy, particularly urine leaks and sepsis, are more common in patients undergoing PE compared to those with cystectomy alone. Prior pelvic radiotherapy, the extent of surgical resection and major blood loss may contribute to urological morbidity. J. Surg. Oncol. 2017;115:307-311. (c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
27858162	Downregulated KLK13 expression in bladder cancer highlights tumor aggressiveness and unfavorable patients' prognosis.	PURPOSE: Despite recent research advantages on the molecular and subcellular background, bladder cancer (BlCa) remains a clinically neglected malignancy. This is strongly reflected by the generic approach of disease diagnosis and management. Additionally, patients' prognosis became a rather demanding task due to the great disease heterogeneity. Here, we aimed to evaluate, for the first time, the clinical value of KLK13 in BlCa. METHODS: A total of 279 bladder specimens (137 tumors, 107 adjacent normal tissues and 35 healthy samples) were included. Total RNA was extracted, reverse transcribed, and KLK13 expression was assessed by quantitative real-time PCR. RESULTS: KLK13 expression is significantly increased in bladder tumors compared to normal adjacent epithelium. However, reduced KLK13 expression is correlated with disease aggressiveness, including higher tumor stage and grade, and high-risk TaT1 tumors according to the EORTC stratification. Moreover, Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analysis highlighted the prognostic value of the reduced KLK13 expression for the prediction of TaT1 patients' recurrence and shorter disease-free survival following TURBT. Finally, the combination of KLK13 expression with EORTC-risk stratification results to an improved prediction of TaT1 patients' outcome. CONCLUSION: This first clinical study of KLK13 in BlCa reveals its deregulated expression in bladder tumors and highlights KLK13 as a promising marker for improving TaT1 patients' prognosis following treatment.
27852299	Increased risk for urological cancer associated with anxiety disorder: a retrospective cohort study.	BACKGROUND: Anxiety disorders (ADs) are common with a high rate of medical comorbidities. Although the association between ADs and the overall cancer risk remains controversial, patients with ADs were found to be more likely to develop specific cancer types. Herein, we estimated the risk of developing urological cancers among patients with ADs in a 5-year follow-up period using a population-based database. METHODS: Two study cohorts were identified from the Taiwan Longitudinal Health Insurance Database 2005: patients with ADs, and comparison subjects selected by one-to-one matching for sex, age, and the year of recruitment. Follow-up was undertaken to determine whether sampled patients and comparison subjects had developed urological cancers in the subsequent 5 years. RESULTS: We found that urological cancers occurred among 0.54% of patients with ADs and 0.13% of comparison subjects. After adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics, medical comorbidities, and alcohol and tobacco use disorder, the stratified Cox proportional hazard regression suggested that patients with ADs were more likely to develop urological cancers relative to comparison subjects (adjusted hazard ratio, 3.67; 95% confidence interval, 2.85 ~ 4.72). The adjusted HR for males with ADs was 3.82 (95% CI: 2.79 ~ 5.23) in comparison to males without ADs. In addition, the adjusted HR for females with ADs was 3.47 (95% CI: 2.26 ~ 5.31) than those females without ADs. CONCLUSIONS: We concluded that during the 5-year follow-up period, there was a significantly increased risk of urological cancers among patients with ADs.
27842445	Cabozantinib in genitourinary malignancies.	Cabozantinib inhibits a variety of cellular receptors including VEGFR1-3, MET, AXL, RET, FLT3 and KIT. These signaling pathways have been shown to be important in genitourinary malignancies. Along its clinical development, it has shown most activity in advanced renal cell carcinoma; the METEOR study compared cabozantinib to everolimus and showed clinically and statistically significant improvements in both progression-free survival and overall survival. Herein, we review the development of cabozantinib in the genitourinary malignancies of renal cell carcinoma, prostate adenocarcinoma and urothelial carcinoma.
27838683	Applying the Paris System for Reporting Urine Cytology Increases the Rate of Atypical Urothelial Cells in Benign Cases: A Need for Patient Management Recommendations.	The Paris System (TPS) for reporting urinary cytology attempts to unify the terminology in this field. OBJECTIVES: To analyze the impact of adopting TPS by measuring nomenclature agreement and cytohistological correlation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Voided urine liquid-based cytology samples corresponding to 149 biopsy-proven cases (76 high-grade carcinomas, 40 low-grade carcinomas, and 33 benign lesions), were reclassified by the same pathologist using TPS. Diagnostic agreement and sensitivity for both nomenclature systems was measured. RESULTS: When using TPS, the rate of atypical samples increased 8 times (from 3 to 24.2%) in benign cases, 10 times (from 2.5 to 25%) in low-grade carcinomas, and 2.4 times (from 6.6 to 15.8%) in high-grade carcinomas. The false-positive rate (abnormal cytology in negative or low-grade carcinoma cases) increased from 11 to 34.2%. Sensitivity was higher (63 vs. 49%) with TPS at the expense of a lower specificity (73 vs. 91%). The agreement between both nomenclatures was moderate for negative and high-grade carcinoma cases (k = 0.42 and 0.56, respectively) and weak for low-grade tumors (k = 0.35). CONCLUSIONS: Adopting TPS for reporting urine cytology results in a considerable increase in atypical diagnoses, improving sensitivity but lowering specificity. Appropriate management recommendations for patients with an atypical cytological diagnosis are required.
27832799	Estimation of second cancer risk after radiotherapy for rectal cancer: comparison of 3D conformal radiotherapy and volumetric modulated arc therapy using different high dose fractionation schemes.	PURPOSE: To investigate second cancer risk (SCR) comparing volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) and 3D conformal radiotherapy (3DCRT) with different high dose fractionation schemes. METHODS: VMAT and 3DCRT virtual treatment plans for 25 patients previously treated with radiotherapy for rectal cancer were evaluated retrospectively. Doses prescribed were 25 x 1.8 Gy and 5 x 5 Gy, respectively. SCR was estimated using a carcinogenesis model and epidemiological data for carcinoma and sarcoma induction. SCR was determined by lifetime attributable risk (LAR). RESULTS: Mean excess LAR was highest for organs adjacent to the PTV. Total LAR for VMAT and 3DCRT was 2.3-3.0 and 2.0-2.7 %, respectively. For 5 x 5 Gy, LAR was 1.4-1.9 % for VMAT and 1.2-1.6 % for 3DCRT. Organ-specific excess LAR was significantly higher for VMAT, and highest for bladder and colon. Size and shape of the PTV influenced SCR and was highest for age </= 40 years. For a patient with an additional lifetime risk of 60 years, LAR was 10 % for 25 x 1.8 Gy and 6 % for 5 x 5 Gy. CONCLUSIONS: No statistically significant difference was detected in SCR using VMAT or 3DCRT. For bladder and colon, organ-specific excess LAR was statistically lower using 3DCRT, however the difference was small. Compared to epidemiological data, SCR was smaller when using a hypofractionated schedule. SCR was 2 % higher at normal life expectancy. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT02572362 . Registered 4 October 2015. Retrospectively registered.
27832048	Vital Signs: Disparities in Tobacco-Related Cancer Incidence and Mortality - United States, 2004-2013.	BACKGROUND: Tobacco use causes at least 12 types of cancer and is the leading preventable cause of cancer. METHODS: Data from the United States Cancer Statistics dataset for 2004-2013 were used to assess incidence and death rates and trends for cancers that can be caused by tobacco use (tobacco-related cancers: oral cavity and pharynx; esophagus; stomach; colon and rectum; liver; pancreas; larynx; lung, bronchus, and trachea; kidney and renal pelvis; urinary bladder; cervix; and acute myeloid leukemia) by sex, age, race, ethnicity, state, county-level poverty and educational attainment, and cancer site. RESULTS: Each year during 2009-2013, on average, 660,000 persons in the United States received a diagnosis of a tobacco-related cancer, and 343,000 persons died from these cancers. Tobacco-related cancer incidence and death rates were higher among men than women; highest among black men and women; higher in counties with low proportion of college graduates or high level of poverty; lowest in the West; and differed two-fold among states. During 2004-2013, incidence of tobacco-related cancer decreased 1.3% per year and mortality decreased 1.6% per year, with decreases observed across most groups, but not at the same rate. CONCLUSIONS: Tobacco-related cancer declined during 2004-2013. However, the burden remains high, and disparities persist among certain groups with higher rates or slower declines in rates. IMPLICATIONS FOR PUBLIC HEALTH PRACTICE: The burden of tobacco-related cancers can be reduced through efforts to prevent and control tobacco use and other comprehensive cancer control efforts focused on reducing cancer risk, detecting cancer early, improving cancer treatments, helping more persons survive cancer, improving cancer survivors' quality of life, and better assisting communities disproportionately impacted by cancer.
27831760	Suppression of HBXIP Reduces Cell Proliferation, Migration and Invasion In Vitro, and Tumorigenesis In Vivo in Human Urothelial Carcinoma of the Bladder.	Hepatitis B X-interacting protein (HBXIP) has been found overexpressed in several types of human cancer, however, the status of HBXIP expression in urothelial carcinoma of the bladder (UCB) has not been explored. In this study, the authors used real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot to test the expression of HBXIP in UCB and adjacent tissues. The expression of HBXIP was significantly increased in UCB tissues. In addition, they showed that suppression of HBXIP induced cell cycle arrest and increased cell apoptosis in T24 cells. Also, suppression of HBXIP also decreased T24 and PC3 cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. More importantly, the authors found that inhibition of HBXIP reduced the tumorigenesis in vivo, suggesting that HBXIP plays an important role in UCB progression. These data for the first time showed that HBXIP acts as an oncoprotein in UCB, suggesting that HBXIP may become a potential novel therapeutic target for the treatment of UCB.
27828864	Comparison of the efficacy and feasibility of en bloc transurethral resection of bladder tumor versus conventional transurethral resection of bladder tumor: A meta-analysis.	BACKGROUND: The aim of this meta-analysis was to compare the feasibility of en bloc transurethral resection of bladder tumor (ETURBT) versus conventional transurethral resection of bladder tumor (CTURBT). METHODS: Relevant trials were identified in a literature search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and Google Scholar using appropriate search terms. All comparative studies reporting participant demographics, tumor characteristics, study characteristics, and outcome data were included. RESULTS: Seven trials with 886 participants were included, 438 underwent ETURBT and 448 underwent CTURBT. There was no significant difference in operation time between 2 groups (P = 0.38). The hospitalization time (HT) and catheterization time (CT) were shorter in ETURBT group (mean difference[MD] -1.22, 95% confidence interval [CI] -1.63 to -0.80, P < 0.01; MD -0.61, 95% CI -1.11 to -0.11, P < 0.01). There was significant difference in 24-month recurrence rate (24-month RR) (odds ratio [OR] 0.66, 95% CI 0.47-0.92, P = 0.02). The rate of complication with respect to bladder perforation (P = 0.004), bladder irritation (P < 0.01), and obturator nerve reflex (P < 0.01) was lower in ETURBT. The postoperative adjuvant intravesical chemotherapy was evaluated by subgroup analysis, and 24-month RR in CTURBT is higher than that in ETURBT in mitomycin intravesical irrigation group (P = 0.02). CONCLUSION: The first meta-analysis indicates that ETURBT might prove to be preferable alternative to CTURBT management of nonmuscle invasive bladder carcinoma. ETURBT is associated with shorter HT and CT, less complication rate, and lower recurrence-free rate. Moreover, it can provide high-qualified specimen for the pathologic diagnosis. Well designed randomized controlled trials are needed to make results comparable.
27827955	A Novel Role of Dickkopf-Related Protein 3 in Macropinocytosis in Human Bladder Cancer T24 Cells.	Dickkopf-related protein 3 (Dkk-3) is a potential tumor suppressor reported in various cancer entities. However, we found that Dkk-3 was exceptionally upregulated in bladder cancer T24 cells. To validate the biological role of Dkk-3 other than a tumor suppressor, we examined the function of Dkk-3 in T24 cells. Gene silencing of Dkk-3 inhibited cell growth through inducing G(0)/G(1) cell-cycle arrest. Furthermore, Dkk-3 knock-down caused macropinocytosis accompanied by autophagy, which were canceled in part by their inhibitors 5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl) amiloride (EIPA) and 3-methyladenine (3-MA). The macropinocytosis was induced by the Dkk-3 knock-down when there were sufficient extracellular nutrients. On the other hand, when the nutritional condition was poor, the autophagy was mainly induced by the Dkk-3 knock-down. These data indicated that Dkk-3 has a role in modulating macropinocytotic and autophagic pathways, a distinct function other than a Wnt antagonist.
27826047	Elevated preoperative plasma fibrinogen level is an independent predictor of malignancy and advanced stage disease in patients with bladder urothelial tumors.	PURPOSE: To investigate the association between preoperative plasma fibrinogen levels and clinicopathological features in patients with bladder urothelial tumors. METHODS: In this retrospective single-center study, we evaluated preoperative plasma fibrinogen levels in 503 patients newly diagnosed with bladder urothelial tumors between January 2009 and October 2014. All patients received surgical intervention as the primary treatment method. Associations between preoperative plasma fibrinogen levels and clinicopathological parameters were analyzed. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to identify independent associations. RESULTS: The mean preoperative fibrinogen level in patients with bladder urothelial carcinoma (BUC) was significantly higher than that in patients with papilloma or papillary urothelial neoplasm of low malignant potential (PUNLMP) (P = 0.004). Additionally, patients with BUC with advanced-stage disease showed elevated plasma fibrinogen levels compared to patients with early-stage disease (high-grade BUC vs. low-grade BUC: P = 0.002; muscle-invasive BUC vs. non-muscle-invasive BUC: P = 0.010). In a multivariate regression model, a plasma fibrinogen level >3.04 g/L was identified to be independently associated with the presence of BUC (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.653, P = 0.047), high-grade BUC (HR = 1.869, P = 0.004), and muscle-invasive BUC (HR = 1.870, P = 0.044). CONCLUSIONS: Elevated preoperative plasma fibrinogen level is an independent predictor of malignancy as well as advanced-stage carcinoma in patients with bladder urothelial tumors, suggesting that plasma fibrinogen may be a promising diagnostic and prognostic biomarker for bladder tumors.
27824327	18F-FDG PET/CT in Bladder Cancer.	Urinary clearance of F-FDG and variability in bladder wall FDG uptake may hamper the interpretation and limit the use of FDG-PET/CT for imaging bladder tumors. Nevertheless, careful combined evaluation of both CT and FDG-PET images of the urinary tract can provide useful findings. We present 2 cases of bladder cancer detected by FDG-PET/CT. These cases suggest that FDG uptake can be indicative of malignancy in bladder cancer when viewed in conjunction with CT scans and that whole-body FDG-PET/CT scans should always be reviewed with particular attention to the urinary tract because abnormalities suggestive of bladder cancer can be found unexpectedly.
27824057	Bladder cancer in individuals with spinal cord injuries: a meta-analysis.	OBJECTIVES: To conduct a scoping review of all the literature related to bladder cancer in individuals with spinal cord injuries (SCIs). METHODS: We searched for trials in MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and the Cochrane Register. Meta-analysis methods were used to evaluate these studies. RESULTS: A total of 18 articles were identified and included as the evidence base for analysis. The incidence of bladder cancer in individuals with SCI is 6 per thousand (95% confidence interval (CI), 5-6 per thousand, I2=49.2%). Mean patient age at bladder cancer diagnosis was 50 years (95% CI, 45-55 years, I2=92.7%). Length of indwelling catheterization of the patient population ranged from 6 to 29 years, with an average of 16 years (95% CI, 12-20 years, I2=94.4%). The interval between SCI and the first diagnosis of bladder cancer was 24 years (95% CI, 21-27 years, I2=85.3%). In the SCI population the estimated percent of squamous cell carcinoma is 36.8% (95% CI, 31.6-42.5%, I2=32.3%). In addition, 46.3% (95% CI, 33.7-59.4%, I2=40.5%) of the bladder cancer histology was traditional transitional cell carcinoma. Other pathological subtypes account for 17.1% (95% CI, 12.8-22.6%, I2=21.5%). The 1-year overall survival rate after treatment of bladder cancer was 62.1% (95% CI, 56.2-66.7%, I2=21.3%). Cystoscopy demonstrated a sensitivity of 64% (95% CI, 49.3-76.5%, I2=37.7%) for detecting bladder cancer. Cytology demonstrated a sensitivity of 36.3% (95% CI, 21.5-54.3%, I2=40.2%) for detecting bladder cancer. CONCLUSION: Bladder cancer is a rare and potentially lethal occurrence in SCI patients. Physicians need to have a high index of suspicion for bladder cancer, particularly among SCI patients managed with long-term indwelling catheters.
27823742	Nerve-sparing radical hysterectomy versus conventional radical hysterectomy in early-stage cervical cancer. A systematic review and meta-analysis of survival and quality of life.	BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Survival after radical hysterectomy (RH) for early-stage cervical cancer is good. Hence quality of life (QOL) after treatment is an important issue. Nerve-sparing radical hysterectomy (NSRH) improves QOL by selectively sparing innervation of bladder, bowel and vagina, reducing therapy-induced morbidity. However, the oncological outcome and the functional outcome after NSRH are subjects of debate. We aim to present the best possible evidence available regarding both QOL and survival after NSRH in early-stage cervical cancer. METHODS: Systematic review and meta-analysis on studies comparing NSRH and RH. RESULTS: Forty-one studies were included, and 27 were used for the meta-analysis. There was no difference in 2-, 3- and 5-year overall survival: the risk ratios (RRs) were respectively 1.02 (95% CI 0.99-1.05, n=879), 1.01 (95% CI 0.95-1.08, n=1324) and 1.03 (95% CI 0.99-1.08, n=638). No difference was found in 2-, 3- and 5-year disease-free survival: RR 1.01 (95% CI 0.95-1.05, n=1175), 0.99 (95% CI 0.94-1.03, n=1130) and 1.00 (95% CI 0.95-1.06, n=933) respectively. Post-operative time to micturition was significantly shorter in the NSRH group: standardized mean difference (SMD) -0.84 (CI 95% -1.07 to -0.60). CONCLUSIONS: NSRH can be considered safe and effective for early-stage cervical cancer since short- and long-term survival do not differ from those of conventional RH, while bladder function after NSRH is significantly less impaired.

27822480	Pretreatment Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte Ratio Can Predict the Prognosis in Bladder Cancer Patients Who Receive Gemcitabine and Nedaplatin Therapy.	Introduction and Objectives. Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) has been suggested to be a simple marker of the systemic inflammatory response in critical care patients. We previously assessed the utility of NLR as a biomarker to predict tumor recurrence and cancer death in bladder cancer patients who underwent radical cystectomy. In this study, we evaluated the prognostic impact of NLR in bladder cancer patients who received gemcitabine and nedaplatin (GN) chemotherapy. Methods. A total of 23 patients who received GN chemotherapy for advanced bladder cancer were enrolled in this study. The cut-off point of NLR according to the sensitivity and specificity levels was derived from the area under receiver operator characteristics (AUROC) curve plotted for disease progression or overall mortality. Results. The NLR cut-off point was determined as 4.14 for both tumor progression and overall mortality. Median progression-free survival (PFS)/overall survival (OS) in the higher NLR group (NLR >/= 4.14) and lower NLR group (NLR < 4.14) were 194/468 days versus 73/237 days, respectively. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that higher NLR significantly correlated with poorer PFS (p = 0.011) and OS (p = 0.045). Conclusions. NLR may serve as a new biomarker to predict responses to GN-based chemotherapy in advanced bladder cancer patients and/or their prognosis.
27821538	Cardiac Mortality Among 200 000 Five-Year Survivors of Cancer Diagnosed at 15 to 39 Years of Age: The Teenage and Young Adult Cancer Survivor Study.	BACKGROUND: Survivors of teenage and young adult cancer are acknowledged as understudied. Little is known about their long-term adverse health risks, particularly of cardiac disease that is increased in other cancer populations where cardiotoxic treatments have been used. METHODS: The Teenage and Young Adult Cancer Survivor Study cohort comprises 200 945 5-year survivors of cancer diagnosed at 15 to 39 years of age in England and Wales from 1971 to 2006, and followed to 2014. Standardized mortality ratios, absolute excess risks, and cumulative risks were calculated. RESULTS: Two thousand sixteen survivors died of cardiac disease. For all cancers combined, the standardized mortality ratios for all cardiac diseases combined was greatest for individuals diagnosed at 15 to 19 years of age (4.2; 95% confidence interval, 3.4-5.2) decreasing to 1.2 (95% confidence interval, 1.1-1.3) for individuals aged 35 to 39 years (2P for trend <0.0001). Similar patterns were observed for both standardized mortality ratios and absolute excess risks for ischemic heart disease, valvular heart disease, and cardiomyopathy. Survivors of Hodgkin lymphoma, acute myeloid leukaemia, genitourinary cancers other than bladder cancer, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, lung cancer, leukaemia other than acute myeloid, central nervous system tumour, cervical cancer, and breast cancer experienced 3.8, 2.7, 2.0, 1.7, 1.7, 1.6, 1.4, 1.3 and 1.2 times the number of cardiac deaths expected from the general population, respectively. Among survivors of Hodgkin lymphoma aged over 60 years, almost 30% of the total excess number of deaths observed were due to heart disease. CONCLUSIONS: This study of over 200 000 cancer survivors shows that age at cancer diagnosis was critical in determining subsequent cardiac mortality risk. For the first time, risk estimates of cardiac death after each cancer diagnosed between the ages of 15 and 39 years have been derived from a large population-based cohort with prolonged follow-up. The evidence here provides an initial basis for developing evidence-based follow-up guidelines.
27820650	Upregulation of miR-3658 in bladder cancer and tumor progression.	Despite increasing advances in surgical techniques and adjuvant chemotherapies, bladder cancer remains the ninth leading cause of male malignancy-associated deaths worldwide. Several microRNAs (miRNAs) have been identified to be closely associated with the progression and prognosis of, and response to treatments in various human cancers. However, few studies have investigated the role of miR-3658 in bladder cancer. In this study, we examined the expression of miR-3658 in 96 pairs of bladder cancer tissues and adjacent non-tumor tissues via quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. Results showed that expression of miR-3658 was up-regulated in the bladder cancer tissues as compared with that in the corresponding control tissues (4.15 +/- 2.78 vs 2.17 +/- 1.14; P < 0.0001). Furthermore, higher miR-3658 expression was significantly associated with lymph node invasion, distant metastasis, histological grade, TNM stage, and tumor recurrence in bladder cancer (all P < 0.0001). miR-3658 expression was not associated with other clinicopathological variables such as age, gender, tumor size, and number (all P > 0.05). Our study revealed that miR-3658 overexpression is involved in tumor progression of bladder cancer, indicating that the miRNA possesses prognostic values.
27818121	Evidence for APOBEC3B mRNA and protein expression in oral squamous cell carcinomas.	It has been demonstrated that APOBEC3B possesses cytidine deaminase activity, which is likely to result in C-to-T signature mutations. Increased expression of the APOBEC3B gene has been shown to correlate with higher incidence of such mutations in various cancer types, such as breast, bladder, lung, and head and neck carcinomas. In the current study, we used in silico methods, immunohistochemistry and qRT-PCR to detect the presence of APOBEC3B signature mutations and examine the levels and patterns of APOBEC3B expression in oral squamous cell carcinomas (OSCCs). Using the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, we have found a high incidence of C-to-T transitions in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs), of which OSCCs constitute the largest subgroup. Additionally, we compared APOBEC3B expression, at both mRNA and protein level, between OSCCs and non-cancerous samples. APOBEC3B was detected in both groups, but nuclear localization was consistent only in normal oral cells. APOBEC3B mRNA levels were clearly higher in OSCCs than in controls. These results suggest that while in normal oral cells APOBEC3B has an important nuclear function to fulfill, this activity may be hindered in a subgroup of tumor cells, due to the more prominent localization of the enzyme in the cytoplasm.
27817158	A PET/MRI study towards finding the optimal [18F]Fluciclovine PET protocol for detection and characterisation of primary prostate cancer.	PURPOSE: [18F]Fluciclovine PET imaging shows promise for the assessment of prostate cancer. The purpose of this PET/MRI study is to optimise the PET imaging protocol for detection and characterisation of primary prostate cancer, by quantitative evaluation of the dynamic uptake of [18F]Fluciclovine in cancerous and benign tissue. METHODS: Patients diagnosed with high-risk primary prostate cancer underwent an integrated [18F]Fluciclovine PET/MRI exam before robot-assisted radical prostatectomy with extended pelvic lymph node dissection. Volumes-of-interest (VOIs) of selected organs (prostate, bladder, blood pool) and sub-glandular prostate structures (tumour, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), inflammation, healthy tissue) were delineated on T2-weighted MR images, using whole-mount histology samples as a reference. Three candidate windows for optimal PET imaging were identified based on the dynamic curves of the mean and maximum standardised uptake value (SUVmean and SUVmax, respectively). The statistical significance of differences in SUV between VOIs were analysed using Wilcoxon rank sum tests (p<0.05, adjusted for multiple testing). RESULTS: Twenty-eight (28) patients [median (range) age: 66 (55-72) years] were included. An early (W1: 5-10 minutes post-injection) and two late candidate windows (W2: 18-23; W3: 33-38 minutes post-injection) were selected. Late compared with early imaging was better able to distinguish between malignant and benign tissue [W3, SUVmean: tumour vs. BPH 2.5 vs. 2.0 (p<0.001), tumour vs. inflammation 2.5 vs. 1.7 (p<0.001), tumour vs. healthy tissue 2.5 vs. 2.0 (p<0.001); W1, SUVmean: tumour vs. BPH 3.1 vs. 3.1 (p=0.771), tumour vs inflammation 3.1 vs. 2.2 (p=0.021), tumour vs. healthy tissue 3.1 vs. 2.5 (p<0.001)] as well as between high-grade and low/intermediate-grade tumours (W3, SUVmean: 2.6 vs. 2.1 (p=0.040); W1, SUVmean: 3.1 vs. 2.8 (p=0.173)). These differences were relevant to the peripheral zone, but not the central gland. CONCLUSION: Late-window [18F]Fluciclovine PET imaging shows promise for distinguishing between prostate tumours and benign tissue and for assessment of tumour aggressiveness.
27814720	miR-199a-5p suppresses human bladder cancer cell metastasis by targeting CCR7.	BACKGROUND: C-C chemokine receptor type 7 (CCR7) overexpression correlated with lymphatic metastasis and poor prognosis is a major obstacle to bladder cancer treatment. Recent studies have revealed that miR-199a-5p was significantly abnormal expressed in several solid tumors and functioned as oncogene or tumor suppressor. This study was aimed to further investigate the effects of miR-199a-5p on the cell metastasis mediated by CCR7 in bladder cancer. METHODS: Quantitative Real Time PCR (qRT-PCR) was firstly performed to identified the expression of miR-199a-5p and CCR7 in human bladder cancer samples and cell lines. Following that, the effects of miR-199a-5p on cell migratory and invasive activities were assessed by wound healing and Matrigel invasion assays, respectively. Finally, luciferase reporter assay and western blot were employed to investigate whether CCR7 could directly interact with miR-199a-5p. RESULTS: miR-199a-5p downregulation and CCR7 upregulation were firstly observed in bladder cancer samples and cell lines. In addition, both miR-199a-5p downregulation and CCR7 upregulation were significantly involved in bladder cancer clinicopathological features. Moreover, overexpression of miR-199a-5p could inhibit baldder cancer cell migration and invasion. miR-199a-5p was confirmed to be able to target the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of CCR7 and regulate the expression of CCR7, Matrix metalloproteinases 9 (MMP-9) and Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT)-related proteins. CONCLUSION: Our findings added newer insights into the multifaceted role played by miR-199a-5p/CCR7 in bladder cancer, prompting for the first time this miRNA/chemokine axis that regulates cell metastasis. The results strongly supported miR-199a-5p as a potential therapeutic agent and diagnostic marker of bladder cancer.
27814275	Detection of bladder cancer in urine sediments by a hypermethylation panel of selected tumor suppressor genes.	BACKGROUND: Promoter hypermethylation can be a useful biomarker for early detection and prognosis of bladder cancer, monitoring response to treatment and complement classical diagnostic procedures. OBJECTIVE: The molecular test was performed on DNA from bladder cancer cells in voided urine samples, tumor tissue DNA and normal control DNAs. We aimed to assess the diagnostic potential of epigenetic changes in urine DNA from bladder cancer cases at various clinico-pathological stages of the disease. METHODS: The methylation status of 5 genes (p14ARF, p16INK4A, RASSF1A, DAPK, APC) in 113 tumor samples paired with voided urine specimens was analyzed by MSP. We compared the results of methylation analysis with UroVysion test. RESULTS: The methylation profile in tumor/urine DNA was significantly correlated (p </= 0,05) with tumor grade in p14ARF, RASSF1a, APC/p14ARF, APC genes, respectively and with stage in p14ARF, RASSF1a/p14ARF genes, respectively. The results of UroVysion test were in correlation with hypermethylation both in tumor and urine DNA in p14ARF, RASSF1a and APC genes (p = 0,008; 0,02 and 0,04, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Promoter hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes is a frequent mechanism in bladder cancer. We found promoter hypermethylation in all grades and stages of all cases examined. Methylation profile of selected suppressor genes may be a potential useful biomarker and enhance early detection of bladder cancer using a noninvasive urine test.
27807073	Archetype and Rearranged Non-coding Control Regions in Urothelial Bladder Carcinoma of Immunocompetent Individuals.	BACKGROUND: Polyomaviruses (PyVs) are potential transforming viruses. Despite their involvement in human tumours still being debated, there is evidence to suggest a role for PyVs in bladder carcinoma (BC). Therefore, a possible association between PyVs and BC was investigated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Urine, blood and fresh bladder tissue specimens were collected from 29 patients with BC. PyV prevalence, non-coding control region (NCCR) organization and genotypic analysis were assessed. RESULTS: Data showed a significant prevalence of John Cunningham (JC) PyV in BC tissues and in urine with respect to BKPyV, while simian virus 40 was not revealed. A BKPyV rearranged NCCR sequence was isolated, whereas a JCPyV archetypal structure was consistently retained. A prevalence of European genotypes was observed. CONCLUSION: Our data would suggest a JCPyV involvement in cancer progression and a BKPyV association with BC pathogenesis in immunocompetent patients. However, further work is necessary to better understand the exact role of PyVs in urothelial carcinogenesis.
27226018	Omental flap after pelvic exenteration for pelvic cancer.	Pelvic infection is a significant clinical problem after pelvic exenteration. The clinical benefit of an omental flap in reducing the incidence of such infections is unknown. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether an omental flap after pelvic exenteration reduces the incidence of pelvic infection and the length of postoperative hospital stay. In this study, we demonstrate a safe, effective, simple method for reducing the incidence of pelvic infection using an omental flap. We performed pelvic exenteration for tumors that were suspected to have extensive invasion to the bladder, prostate, or uterus. The omentum was dissected from the transverse colon and greater curvature of the stomach. The flap was based on the right gastroepiploic vessels and tunneled in the retrocolic plane, through the mesentery of the transverse colon and ileocecum, to the defect. Twenty-seven patients were analyzed retrospectively. Ten patients received omental flaps, and 17 patients underwent pelvic exenteration without an omental flap. The incidence of pelvic infection was significantly reduced in the patients with omental flaps.
27803478	Development of a Drug Delivery System for Cancer Immunotherapy.	Delivery systems are a powerful technology for enhancing the effect of cancer immunotherapy. We have been in the process of developing lipid-based delivery systems for controlling the physical properties and dynamics of immunofunctional molecules such as antigens and adjuvants. The lipid nanoparticulation of these molecules improves their physical properties, resulting in a good water dispensability, greater stability, and small size. The cell wall skeleton of bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG-CWS) could be used to replace live BCG as a drug for treating bladder cancer, but problems associated with the physical properties of BCG-CWS have prevented its use. To overcome such problems, we developed a novel packaging method that permits BCG-CWS to be encapsulated into lipid nanoparticles, which induce antitumor responses against bladder cancer. Lipid nanoparticulation also improves the intracellular trafficking and biodistribution of immunofunctional molecules. Cyclic di-GMP (c-di-GMP) is an adjuvant that is recognized by the cytosolic sensor. However, c-di-GMP cannot pass through the cell membrane. We encapsulated c-di-GMP into lipid nanoparticles containing a pH-responsive lipid that was developed in our laboratory and achieved efficient cytosolic delivery and the induction of antitumor immunity. Furthermore, we are attempting to control the functions of immune cells by RNA interference. We have recently succeeded in the efficient delivery of small interfering RNA into mouse dendritic cells (DCs), which led to the enhancement of antitumor activity of DCs. In this review, our recent efforts regarding cancer immunotherapy using lipid-based nanoparticles are reviewed.
27771969	Vinflunine for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer.	INTRODUCTION: Vinflunine belongs to the class of vinca alkaloids and acts by disrupting the microtubule dynamics during cell cycle; this agent is currently available for previously treated advanced transitional cell carcinoma in Europe. The aim of this invited review is to evaluate the potential role of vinflunine for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Areas covered: The potential role of vinflunine in NSCLC is discussed on the basis of the available data, including full papers and meeting abstracts. Relevant preclinical studies describing the pharmacological properties of vinflunine are also included. The review also summarizes clinical studies, including phase I trials involving NSCLC among other tumors as well as phase II/III trials specifically addressing this malignancy. Additionally, the safety profile and the current regulatory status of vinflunine is discussed. Expert opinion: Vinflunine is active as single agent and as part of platinum-based combinations in NSCLC. It results non-inferior to docetaxel in a randomized phase III trial including previously treated NSCLC patients; additionally, its safety profile is generally considered manageable. Ultimately, further studies are needed to confirm the role of vinflunine in NSCLC, in consideration of the evolving evidence regarding targeted therapies and immune check-point inhibitors.
27147435	Quantitative Evaluation of Heavy Metals and Trace Elements in the Urinary Bladder: Comparison Between Cancerous, Adjacent Non-cancerous and Normal Cadaveric Tissue.	The role of heavy metals and trace elements (HMTE) in the development of some cancers has been previously reported. Bladder carcinoma is a frequent malignancy of the urinary tract. The most common risk factors for bladder cancer are exposure to industrial carcinogens, cigarette smoking, gender, and possibly diet. The aim of this study was to evaluate HTME concentrations in the cancerous and adjacent non-cancerous tissues and compare them with those of normal cadaveric bladder. This prospective study included 102 paired samples of full-thickness cancer and adjacent non-cancerous bladder tissues of radical cystectomy (RC) specimens that were histologically proven as invasive bladder cancer (MIBC). We used 17 matched controls of non-malignant bladder tissue samples from cadavers. All samples were processed and evaluated for the concentration of 22 HMTE by using Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectrometry (ICP-OES). Outcome analysis was made by the Mann-Whitney U, chi-square, Kruskal-Wallis, and Wilcoxon signed ranks tests. When compared with cadaveric control or cancerous, the adjacent non-cancerous tissue had higher levels of six elements (arsenic, lead, selenium, strontium, zinc, and aluminum), and when compared with the control alone, it had a higher concentration of calcium, cadmium, chromium, potassium, magnesium, and nickel. The cancerous tissue had a higher concentration of cadmium, lead, chromium, calcium, potassium, phosphorous, magnesium, nickel, selenium, strontium, and zinc than cadaveric control. Boron level was higher in cadaveric control than cancerous and adjacent non-cancerous tissue. Cadmium level was higher in cancerous tissue with node-positive than node-negative cases. The high concentrations of cadmium, lead, chromium, nickel, and zinc, in the cancerous together with arsenic in the adjacent non-cancerous tissues of RC specimens suggest a pathogenic role of these elements in BC. However, further work-up is needed to support this conclusion by the application of these HMTE on BC cell lines.
27706947	Simultaneous integrated boost (SIB) of the parametrium and cervix in radiotherapy for uterine cervical carcinoma: a dosimetric study using a new alternative approach.	OBJECTIVE: To compare the dose distributions of intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) and volumetric-modulated arc therapy (VMAT) using the simultaneous integrated boost (SIB) technique with that of the traditional midline block (MB) technique for boosting the parametrium in patients with cervical cancer. METHODS: Treatment plans using VMAT or IMRT with the SIB technique (VMAT-SIB and IMRT-SIB) and IMRT followed by the MB technique (IMRT-MB) were generated for each of the 10 patients with cervical cancer. For the SIB plans, 45-Gy and 50-Gy dose levels in 25 equal fractions were set for the pelvis planning target volume 45 (PTV45) and the parametrial boost volume (PTV50), respectively. For the IMRT-MB plans, the parametrium was sequentially boosted with the MB technique (5.4 Gy in three fractions) after pelvic IMRT (PTV45). RESULTS: Volume receiving 100% of the prescribed dose or more coverage of the PTV50 was significantly better for VMAT-SIB and IMRT-SIB than that for IMRT-MB (99.08 and 99.31% compared with 91.79%, respectively; p < 0.05). VMAT-SIB and IMRT-SIB both generated significantly greater doses to the organs at risk (OARs) except for the volume receiving 50 Gy or more doses, which were significantly lower for the bladder and bowel. Comparable results were achieved with VMAT-SIB and IMRT-SIB. CONCLUSION: The VMAT-SIB and IMRT-SIB techniques are promising in terms of dose distributions and tumour coverage, although these approaches might result in slightly higher doses of radiation to the OARs. Advances in knowledge: This is the first study to examine the feasibility of the SIB technique using IMRT or VMAT to boost the parametrium. The techniques dosimetrically produced better target coverage but resulted in slightly higher doses to the OARs.
27798930	Metastasectomy Improves Survival in Patients with Metastatic Urothelial Carcinoma.	Metastatic urothelial carcinoma is one of the most fatal urological malignancies. Cisplatin-based systemic chemotherapy is the standard treatment for metastatic urothelial carcinoma, and there is little evidence to support metastasectomy. The aims of the study were to evaluate the efficacy of metastasectomy and to investigate the prognoses of the patients. The study included 436 patients with urothelial carcinoma who were treated at our hospital. Of these, we included and retrospectively analyzed 29 patients who received curative treatment for the primary tumor and had been treated for metastases. Seven of these patients underwent metastasectomy. In a multivariate analysis, a serum C-reactive protein level before treatment for metastasis of <1 mg/dl and metastasectomy were independent significant predictors of both better progression-free survival and better overall survival. Metastasectomy may be considered a potential treatment for patients with metastases from urothelial carcinoma.
27798924	Clinical Results for Bladder Cancer Treated by Radiotherapy Without Concurrent Standard Chemotherapy.	AIM: To evaluate clinical outcomes of three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT) alone in patients with bladder cancer who were unfit for concurrent standard chemotherapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between January 2007 and May 2016, 34 patients (20 men, 14 women) aged 65-97 years (median=83) with bladder cancer cT1-4bN0-1M1 were treated with conformal whole-bladder radiotherapy with fractions of 1.8-3 Gy up to a total dose of 40-50 Gy. RESULTS: Median survival was 10 months (range=1-99); 1-year and 3-year survival was 51.4% and 34.3%, respectively. Radiation dose >50 Gy was associated with improved survival. Three-year local control (LC) rate was 58.8%. On multivariate analysis, only radiation dose showed a significant association with LC. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrated the safety and feasibility of radiotherapy in patients with bladder cancer unfit for concurrent standard chemotherapy. A higher radiation dose may confer superior LC and overall survival (OS) without complications.
27798881	Expression of the p53 Inhibitors MDM2 and MDM4 as Outcome Predictor in Muscle-invasive Bladder Cancer.	AIM: To evaluate the prognostic role of the p53-upstream inhibitors MDM2, MDM4 and its splice variant MDM4-S in patients undergoing radical cystectomy (RC) for muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC). MATERIALS AND METHODS: mRNA Expression levels of MDM2, MDM4 and MDM4-S were assessed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) in 75 RC samples. Logistic regression analyses identified predictors of recurrence-free (RFS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS). RESULTS: High expression was found in 42% (MDM2), 27% (MDMD4) and 91% (MDM4-S) of tumor specimens. Increased MDM2 expression was significantly associated with higher tumor stage (p=0.05) and lymphovascular invasion (LVI) (p=0.041). In the univariate analysis, low MDM4 expression (hazard ratio (HR)=5.93; p=0.002; HR=3.00; p=0.047), but not MDM2 (HR=1.63; p=0.222; HR=1.59; p=0.27), were associated with RFS and CSS. In the multivariate analysis, the combination of low MDM4 and high MDM2 was significant for RFS and CSS (HR=14.9; p=0.001; HR=5.63; p=0.019). CONCLUSION: The combination of MDM2 and MDM4 expression is an independent predictor in patients undergoing RC for MIBC.
27797838	Systemic sarcoidosis first manifesting in a tattoo in the setting of immune checkpoint inhibition.	The use of immune checkpoint inhibitors is revolutionising the treatment of cancer. However, their unique toxicity profile is substantially different from what has been observed with traditional chemotherapy, resulting in a novel learning curve for medical oncologists. Early recognition of these toxicities can make a substantial impact in ameliorating these side effects in the oncological and medical-surgical fields. Here, we present a case of Lofgren syndrome sarcoidosis, which first manifested in a tattoo in a patient with metastatic urothelial cancer on therapy with anti-CTLA-4 (ipilimumab) and anti-PD1 (nivolumab).
27796928	Latent Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus infection in bladder cancer cells promotes drug resistance by reducing reactive oxygen species.	Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is the major etiologic agent of Kaposi's sarcoma, primary effusion lymphoma, and multicentric Castleman's disease. Recent studies have indicated that KSHV can be detected at high frequency in patient-derived bladder cancer tissue and might be associated with the pathogenesis of bladder cancer. Bladder cancer is the second most common cancer of the genitourinary tract, and it has a high rate of recurrence. Because drug resistance is closely related to chemotherapy failure and cancer recurrence, we investigated whether KSHV infection is associated with drug resistance of bladder cancer cells. Some KSHV-infected bladder cancer cell lines showed resistance to an anti-cancer drug, cisplatin, possibly as a result of down-regulation of reactive oxygen species. Additionally, drug resistance acquired from KSHV infection could partly be overcome by HDAC1 inhibitors. Taken together, the data suggest the possible role of KSHV in chemo-resistant bladder cancer, and indicate the therapeutic potential of HDAC1 inhibitors in drug-resistant bladder cancers associated with KSHV infection.
27184560	Intramedullary dermoid cyst infection mimicking holocord tumor: should radical resection be mandatory?-a case report.	BACKGROUND: Dermoid cysts are benign lesions which contain epidermal and dermal elements. Dermoid cysts usually contain a dermal sinus tract but this is not mandatory. Dermoid cysts can manifest by spinal cord infection without a dermal sinus tract. An infected spinal dermoid cyst associated with a holocord spinal abscess poses diagnostic and surgical challenges. Although radical surgical drainage is considered as the main treatment modality for spinal abscess, less extensive surgery for microbiological sampling and appropriate antibiotic treatment can be another alternative modality. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 1-year-old boy patient was admitted to our hospital with progressive paraplegia, bladder dysfunction, and neck rigidity. Medical history of the patient included recurrent urinary tract infection and cephalosporin treatments several times. Initial neurological examination revealed confusion, fever, neck rigidity, paraplegia (also, the motor power of the right upper extremity was three fifths that of the upper extremities). He had urinary and gastrointestinal retention. Conservative surgery was performed to take pathological and microbiological samples. With appropriate antibiotic regimen, the nuchal rigidity and fever improved dramatically. Infectious parameters in blood biochemistry significantly decreased after the antibiotic regimen. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Holocord spinal abscesses are a rare entity. The source of the disease can be hemopoietic spread or contagious spread. The dermal sinus tract is major risk factor for contagious spread. The major hemopoietic sources are urogenital infection, endocarditis, and infective lung diseases. The hemopoietic spread is a more common source for pediatric patients. The thoracolumbar region is the most common site of involvement. Spinal infection has a tendency to extend longitudinally throughout spinal fibers. The pathogenesis of the holocord edema or syrinx is uncertain. The underlying etiology may be inflammation, infection, and associated venous congestion within the spinal canal. Also, CSF circulation alteration due to arachnoiditis may be another etiological factor. The most important entities on outcome are appropriate surgical treatment and antibiotic administration.
27112784	The suppressive effects of miR-1180-5p on the proliferation and tumorigenicity of bladder cancer cells.	In our previous research, we have reported that a candidate microRNA (miR-1180-5p) has the capacity to induce overexpression of tumor suppressor gene p21 and inhibit the growth of human bladder cancer (BCa) cell lines in vitro. However, the exact mechanism as to how miR-1180-5p suppresses BCa cell proliferation remains unknown, and the inhibitory effect of miR-1180-5p in vivo also need to be investigated. In the present study, we found that the expression level of miR-1180-5p was lower in BCa cells than in normal human urothelial cells. Furthermore, we found that overexpression of p21, activated by miR-1180-5p, interfered with cell cycle progress by inhibiting the cell cycle related proteins (CDK4, CDK6, Cyclin D1 and Cyclin A2), and thereby suppressed BCa cell proliferation. In addition, miR-1180-5p also suppressed the tumor growth in vivo significantly. Taken together, our study provides evidence that up-regulation of p21 is mainly responsible for the suppressive effect of miR-1180-5p on BCa cells and miR-1180-5p can significantly inhibit tumorigenicity in vivo.
27791261	Meta-analysis reveals no significant association between ERCC6 polymorphisms and bladder cancer risk.	BACKGROUND: Numerous studies have been conducted to evaluate the association between excision repair cross-complementing group 6 (ERCC6) gene polymorphisms and bladder cancer risk, but their findings have been inconsistent. Here we performed a meta-analysis to attempt to clarify this association. METHODS: Studies were retrieved from the PubMed and China National Knowledge Infrastructure databases up to October 1, 2015, with strict selection and exclusion criteria. A total of 5,032 samples, comprising samples from 2,475 bladder cancer patients and 2,557 controls from 5 studies, were included in the meta-analysis. The odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) was used to evaluate the strength of the associations. RESULTS: Regarding the Met1097Val polymorphism, no significant association with bladder cancer risk was found in any of the genetic models evaluated (Val vs. Met: OR = 1.10, 95% CI, 0.97-1.25; Val/Val vs. Met/Met: OR = 1.23, 95% CI, 0.86-1.75; Val/Val + Val/Met vs. Met/Met: OR = 1.12, 95% CI, 0.96-1.30; Val/Val vs. Met/Met + Val/Met: OR = 0.81, 95% CI, 0.57-1.14). Similarly, as regards the Arg1230Pro polymorphism, we also found no positive results. CONCLUSIONS: According to the results of our meta-analysis, there is no evidence of a link between the ERCC6 gene polymorphisms and bladder cancer risk. Well-designed further studies, with larger sample sizes and adjustment for confounders such as smoking status, are needed to confirm these conclusions.
27502337	Prediction of histological stage based on cytoscopic appearances of newly diagnosed bladder tumours.	INTRODUCTION In the 75-80% of urothelial bladder cancers (UBC) presenting as non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC), transurethral resection of bladder tumour (TURBT) is the key treatment and staging procedure. In the 20-25% of patients with muscle invasive bladder cancer (MIBC), further cross-sectional imaging is required to complete the staging process before considering radical treatment. Given the adverse effects of ionising radiation, clinicians identify patients believed to have MIBC, and so requiring further imaging pre-TURBT, at the tumour histology/stage based on the tumour's visual characteristics. There is minimal evidence describing the accuracy of such predictions in newly-diagnosed patients. METHODS Over a 6-year period, a database of patients undergoing resection of newly-diagnosed bladder lesions in a single UK centre was prospectively established. Predictions based on histology were simultaneously recorded, and the accuracy of these predictions of histology/stage subsequently assessed. RESULTS One hundred and twenty two (73.1%) patients with histologically confirmed NMIBC had predictions recorded versus 45 (26.9%) patients with MIBC. Visual assessment predictions of MIBC had a sensitivity of 88.9% (95% confidence interval [CI] 76.5%-95.2%) and a specificity of 91.0% (95% CI 84.6%-94.9%), giving a positive predictive value of 78.4% (95% CI 65.4%-87.5%) and a negative predictive value of 95.7% (95% CI 90.3%-98.1%). CONCLUSIONS We find that visual assessment is accurate in predicting the presence of MIBC. This supports the practice of stratifying patients at the time of initial cystoscopy for those requiring further radiological staging pre-TURBT.
27486853	Oncolytic virus therapy: A new era of cancer treatment at dawn.	Oncolytic virus therapy is perhaps the next major breakthrough in cancer treatment following the success in immunotherapy using immune checkpoint inhibitors. Oncolytic viruses are defined as genetically engineered or naturally occurring viruses that selectively replicate in and kill cancer cells without harming the normal tissues. T-Vec (talimogene laherparepvec), a second-generation oncolytic herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) armed with GM-CSF, was recently approved as the first oncolytic virus drug in the USA and Europe. The phase III trial proved that local intralesional injections with T-Vec in advanced malignant melanoma patients can not only suppress the growth of injected tumors but also act systemically and prolong overall survival. Other oncolytic viruses that are closing in on drug approval in North America and Europe include vaccinia virus JX-594 (pexastimogene devacirepvec) for hepatocellular carcinoma, GM-CSF-expressing adenovirus CG0070 for bladder cancer, and Reolysin (pelareorep), a wild-type variant of reovirus, for head and neck cancer. In Japan, a phase II clinical trial of G47, a third-generation oncolytic HSV-1, is ongoing in glioblastoma patients. G47 was recently designated as a "Sakigake" breakthrough therapy drug in Japan. This new system by the Japanese government should provide G47 with priority reviews and a fast-track drug approval by the regulatory authorities. Whereas numerous oncolytic viruses have been subjected to clinical trials, the common feature that is expected to play a major role in prolonging the survival of cancer patients is an induction of specific antitumor immunity in the course of tumor-specific viral replication. It appears that it will not be long before oncolytic virus therapy becomes a standard therapeutic option for all cancer patients.
27440446	Role of galectin-1 in urinary bladder urothelial carcinoma cell invasion through the JNK pathway.	Human galectin-1 is a member of the galectin family, proteins with conserved carbohydrate-recognition domains that bind galactoside. Galectin-1 is highly expressed in various tumors and participates in various oncogenic processes. However, detailed descriptions of the function of galectin-1 in urinary bladder urothelial carcinoma have not been reported. Our previous cohort investigation showed that galectin-1 is associated with tumor invasiveness and is a possible independent prognostic marker of urinary bladder urothelial carcinoma. The present study aimed to clarify the relevance of galectin-1 expression level to tumor progression and invasion. In order to decipher a mechanism for the contribution of galectin-1 to the malignant behavior of urinary bladder urothelial carcinoma, two bladder cancer cell lines (T24 and J82) were established with knockdown of galectin-1 expression by shRNA. Bladder cancer cells with LGALS1 gene silencing showed reduced cell proliferation, lower invasive capability, and lower clonogenicity. Extensive signaling pathway studies indicated that galectin-1 participated in bladder cancer cell invasion by mediating the activity of MMP9 through the Ras-Rac1-MEKK4-JNK-AP1 signaling pathway. Our functional analyses of galectin-1 in urinary bladder urothelial carcinoma provided novel insights into the critical role of galectin-1 in tumor progression and invasion. These results revealed that silencing the galectin-1-mediated MAPK signaling pathway presented a novel strategy for bladder cancer therapy.
27312587	Cullin-1 promotes cell proliferation in human breast cancer and is related to diabetes.	AIM: Breast carcinoma (BCA) and diabetes mellitus (DM) are two major health problems in women and the general population. Cullin-1 is reported to be an important tumor-related protein involved in cell-cycle progression, signal transduction and transcription. The aim of this work is to investigate the role of Cullin-1 in the development of BCA and to find potential relationships between Cullin-1 and diabetes in BCA patients. METHODS: To evaluate the function of Cullin-1, we entered 168 patients with primary invasive BCA in this study. Pairs of BCA tissues and adjacent noncancerous tissues from these patients were collected between 2006 and 2008. We used immunohistochemistry to analyze the correlation between Cullin-1 expression and clinicopathological variables and patient survival. In addition, we investigated the role of Cullin-1 in BCA cell proliferation. RESULTS: Cullin-1 expression was upregulated in BCA tissues. Enhanced immunoreactivity for Cullin-1 in BCA tissues was inversely correlated with overall survival and disease-free survival, which suggested a poor prognosis in BCA patients. Strong expression of Cullin-1 was more frequently observed in patients with estrogen receptor negativity and HER2 positivity. We also found that Cullin-1 expression was increased in BCA patients with a previous diagnosis of diabetes. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that increased Cullin-1 expression is significantly correlated with poor prognosis in patients with BCA. Cullin-1 might regulate BCA cell proliferation through the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Thus, Cullin-1 might be an important marker and a therapeutic target in BCA.
26612603	MicroRNAs in Bladder Outlet Obstruction: Relationship to Growth and Matrix Remodelling.	The discovery of microRNAs (miRNAs), which are ~22 nucleotide RNAs that inhibit protein synthesis in a sequence-specific manner and are present in a range of species, has born hope of new therapeutic strategies. miRNAs play important roles in development and disease, but they remain poorly studied in uropathologies beyond cancer. Here, we discuss biological functions of miRNAs in the lower urogenital tract. A special focus is on miRNAs that change in bladder outlet obstruction (BOO). This is a condition that affects nearly one third of all men over 60 years and that involves growth and fibrosis of the urinary bladder. Animal models of BOO, such as that in rat, have been developed, and they feature a massive 6-fold bladder growth over 6 weeks. Using microarrays, we have charted the miRNAs that change during the time course of this process and identified several with important modulatory roles. We discuss known and predicted functions of miR-1, miR-29, miR-30, miR-132/212, miR-204 and miR-221, all of which change in BOO. The majority of the miRNA-mediated influences in BOO are expected to favour growth. We also outline evidence that miR-29 represents a key effector molecule in a generic response to mechanical distension that is designed to counteract exaggerated organ deformation via effects on matrix deposition and stiffness. We conclude that miRNAs play important roles in bladder remodelling and growth and that they may be targeted pharmacologically to combat diseases of the lower urinary tract.
27784990	Molecular targets in urothelial cancer: detection, treatment, and animal models of bladder cancer.	Bladder cancer remains one of the most expensive cancers to treat in the United States due to the length of required treatment and degree of recurrence. In order to treat bladder cancer more effectively, targeted therapies are being investigated. In order to use targeted therapy in a patient, it is important to provide a genetic background of the patient. Recent advances in genome sequencing, as well as transcriptome analysis, have identified major pathway components altered in bladder cancer. The purpose of this review is to provide a broad background on bladder cancer, including its causes, diagnosis, stages, treatments, animal models, as well as signaling pathways in bladder cancer. The major focus is given to the PI3K/AKT pathway, p53/pRb signaling pathways, and the histone modification machinery. Because several promising immunological therapies are also emerging in the treatment of bladder cancer, focus is also given on general activation of the immune system for the treatment of bladder cancer.
27514658	ESR1, ERBB2, and Ki67 mRNA expression predicts stage and grade of non-muscle-invasive bladder carcinoma (NMIBC).	Pathological staging and grading are crucial for risk assessment in non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). Molecular grading might support pathological evaluation and minimize interobserver variability. In this study, the well-established breast cancer markers ESR1, PGR, ERBB2, and MKI67 were evaluated as potential molecular markers to support grading and staging in NMIBC. We retrospectively analyzed clinical data and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues (FFPE) of patients with NMIBC. Messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of the aforementioned markers was measured by single-step reverse transcription quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) using RNA-specific TaqMan assays. Relative gene expression was determined by normalization to two reference genes (CALM2 and B2M) using the 40-DeltaDeltaCT method and correlated to histopathological stage and grade. Pathological assessment was performed by an experienced uropathologist. Statistical analysis was performed using the SAS software JMP 9.0.0 version and GraphPad Prism 5.04. Of 381 cases of NMIBC, samples of 100 pTa and 255 pT1 cases were included in the final study. Spearman rank correlation revealed significant correlations between grade and expression of MKI67 (r = 0.52, p < 0.0001), ESR1 (r = 0.25, p < 0.0001), and ERBB2 (r = 0.18, p = 0.0008). In Mann-Whitney tests, MKI67 was significantly different between all grades (p < 0.0001), while ESR1 (p = 0.0006) and ERBB2 (p = 0.027) were significantly different between G2 and G3. Higher expression of MKI67 (r = 0.49; p < 0.0001), ERBB2 (r = 0.22; p < 0.0001), and ESR1 (r = 0.18; p = 0.0009) mRNA was positively correlated with higher stage. MKI67 (p < 0.0001), ERBB2 (p = 0.0058), and PGR (p = 0.0007) were significantly different between pTa and pT1. In NMIBC expression of ESR1, ERBB2 and MKI67 are significantly different between stage and grade. This potentially provides objective parameters for pathological evaluation.
27782913	Post-therapeutic dosimetry of 177Lu-DKFZ-PSMA-617 in the treatment of patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.	OBJECTIVE: Lu-DKFZ-PSMA-617, a urea-based compound, binds to the extracellular domain of prostate-specific membrane antigen, thus providing an effective target for the treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Before its therapeutic use, it is necessary that the radiation dosimetry of this radiopharmaceutical be studied to determine the safe activity that can be administered in patients to prevent haematological, renal and liver toxicity. The present study thus aimed to assess the pharmacokinetics and dosimetry of Lu-DKFZ-PSMA-617 in CRPC patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: After obtaining ethical clearance from the institute ethics review board, we enrolled mCRPC patients who were positive on a Glu-NH-CO-NH-Lys-(Ahx)-[Ga(HBED-CC)] PET/CT scan. For kidney protection, a cocktail of lysine and arginine diluted in 2 litres of normal saline was infused, starting from 30 to 60 min before Lu-DKFZ-PSMA-617 infusion. The mean administered activity in the overall population was 2.52+/-1.3 GBq. For the purpose of dosimetry, each patient underwent nine planar whole-body scans along with blood and urine sample collection at 0.5, 3.5, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 144 and 168 h, respectively. SPECT/CT was performed to derive the volume of salivary glands (parotid and submandibular glands) and tumour. Dosimetric evaluation was carried out using the OLINDA/EXM 1.0 software. RESULTS: A total of 26 mCRPC patients with a mean age of 66.30+/-9.95 years (range: 38-81 years) were recruited. Normal physiological uptake was observed in all the patients in the lacrimal glands, salivary glands (parotid glands and submandibular glands), liver, spleen, kidneys, intestines and urinary bladder. Organs with the highest absorbed doses were the salivary glands, followed by the kidneys, receiving 1.24+/-0.26 and 0.99+/-0.31 mGy/MBq, respectively. The mean absorbed doses to the liver, urinary bladder and red marrow were 0.36+/-0.10, 0.243+/-0.09 and 0.048+/-0.05 mGy/MBq, respectively. The mean whole-body dose was 0.016+/-0.003 mGy/MBq. CONCLUSION: Lu-DKFZ-PSMA-617 therapy is a safe option in the treatment of mCRPC patients.
27782723	Automatic multiorgan segmentation in CT images of the male pelvis using region-specific hierarchical appearance cluster models.	PURPOSE: Accurate segmentation of pelvic organs in CT images is of great importance in external beam radiotherapy for prostate cancer. The aim of this studying is to develop a novel method for automatic, multiorgan segmentation of the male pelvis. METHODS: The authors' segmentation method consists of several stages. First, a pretreatment includes parameterization, principal component analysis (PCA), and an established process of region-specific hierarchical appearance cluster (RSHAC) model which was executed on the training dataset. After the preprocessing, online automatic segmentation of new CT images is achieved by combining the RSHAC model with the PCA-based point distribution model. Fifty pelvic CT from eight prostate cancer patients were used as the training dataset. From another 20 prostate cancer patients, 210 CT images were used for independent validation of the segmentation method. RESULTS: In the training dataset, 15 PCA modes were needed to represent 95% of shape variations of pelvic organs. When tested on the validation dataset, the authors' segmentation method had an average Dice similarity coefficient and mean absolute distance of 0.751 and 0.371 cm, 0.783 and 0.303 cm, 0.573 and 0.604 cm for prostate, bladder, and rectum, respectively. The automated segmentation process took on average 5 min on a personal computer equipped with Core 2 Duo CPU of 2.8 GHz and 8 GB RAM. CONCLUSIONS: The authors have developed an efficient and reliable method for automatic segmentation of multiple organs in the male pelvis. This method should be useful for treatment planning and adaptive replanning for prostate cancer radiotherapy. With this method, the physicist can improve the work efficiency and stability.
27781946	The Role of Clusterin in Carcinogenesis and its Potential Utility as Therapeutic Target.	Clusterin is a glycoprotein that has been implicated in many processes, including apoptosis, cell cycle regulation and DNA repair. Since clusterin expression has also been associated with tumorigenesis and the progression of various malignancies including prevalent tumors like prostate, colon, bladder and breast, this protein has been proposed as a good candidate for future treatments. There have been numerous studies conducted in cell lines and xenograft models with successful results that, in general, justify the use of clusterin as a therapeutic target. However, it is still necessary to continue with these studies in order to achieve a better understanding of the role of this protein in carcinogenesis and to determine those specific situations in which its therapeutic use may be more favorable. In this review, we will make a brief description of clusterin structure and genetics, its implication in tumorigenesis and cancer progression and its prognosis utility. Finally, we will analyze the effects of clusterin inhibition in different types of cancer.
27781412	Causes of false-negative for high-grade urothelial carcinoma in urine cytology.	INTRODUCTION: The Paris System for classifying urine cytology emphasizes identification of high-grade urothelial carcinoma (HGUC). The causes of false-negative urine cytologies (UC) within this system are not well described. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We identified 660 cases between 2005 and 2013 with both UC and subsequent cystoscopic biopsies. UC were classified as either Negative for HGUC or "Abnormal" ("Atypical", "Suspicious", and "Malignant"). Apparent false-negative cases were reviewed in a nonblinded fashion by two cytopathologists and two subspecialized genitourinary pathologists. RESULTS: A total of 199 of the 660 cases (30%) were histologically diagnosed as HGUC. The UC were "Abnormal" in 170/199 cases (sensitivity/specificity of 86%/71%). Twenty four apparent false negative cases were available for retrospective review. Five of 24 (21%) cystoscopic biopsies were found not to be HGUC on review (one false positive and four low-grade urothelial carcinoma (LGUC on review). Of the remaining 19 UC, 7 (29%) cytology samples were found to be truly negative on review, 11 (46%) were found to be Atypical, and 1 (4%) suspicious. Of the 12 UC that were at least "Atypical" with histologic HGUC on review: six misses (half) were attributed to obscuring inflammation/blood, four to poor preservation, eight to paucity of abnormal cells, and 1 case to interpretive error; many cases demonstrated overlapping reasons. CONCLUSION: About one fifth of apparent false negative diagnoses for HGUC can be because of overdiagnosis of HGUC by surgical pathologists. If poor preservation or obscured samples are called nondiagnostic, the sensitivity/specificity of UC for HGUC can be as high as 94%/71%. Diagn. Cytopathol. 2016;44:994-999.

27697109	Epigenetic regulation of long noncoding RNA UCA1 by SATB1 in breast cancer.	Special AT-rich sequence binding protein 1 (SATB1) is a nuclear matrix-associated DNA-binding protein that functions as a chromatin organizer. SATB1 is highly expressed in aggressive breast cancer cells and promotes growth and metastasis by reprograming gene expression. Through genomewide cross-examination of gene expression and histone methylation, we identified SATB1 target genes for which expression is associated with altered epigenetic marks. Among the identified genes, long noncoding RNA urothelial carcinoma-associated 1 (UCA1) was upregulated by SATB1 depletion. Upregulation of UCA1 coincided with increased H3K4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) levels and decreased H3K27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) levels. Our study showed that SATB1 binds to the upstream region of UCA1 in vivo, and that its promoter activity increases with SATB1 depletion. Furthermore, simultaneous depletion of SATB1 and UCA1 potentiated suppression of tumor growth and cell survival. Thus, SATB1 repressed the expression of oncogenic UCA1, suppressing growth and survival of breast cancer cells. [BMB Reports 2016; 49(10): 578-583].
27448305	CYLD downregulates Livin and synergistically improves gemcitabine chemosensitivity and decreases migratory/invasive potential in bladder cancer: the effect is autophagy-associated.	Although GC (gemcitabine and cisplatin) chemotherapy remains an effective method for treating bladder cancer (BCa), chemoresistance is a major obstacle in chemotherapy. In this study, we determined whether gemcitabine resistance correlates with migratory/invasive potential in BCa and whether this relationship is regulated by the cylindromatosis (CYLD)-Livin module. First, we independently investigated the correlation of CYLD/Livin and gemcitabine resistance with the potential for tumor migration and invasiveness. Second, we found that co-transfected CYLD and Livin dramatically improved sensitivity to gemcitabine chemotherapy and decreased migration/invasion potential. Next, we determined that CYLD may regulate Livin by the NF-kappaB-dependent pathway. We also found that CYLD overexpression and Livin knockdown might improve gemcitabine chemosensitivity by decreasing autophagy and increasing apoptosis in BCa cells. Finally, the effects of CYLD-Livin on tumor growth in vivo were evaluated. Our study demonstrates that CYLD-Livin might represent a potential therapeutic for chemoresistant BCa.
27350368	Comprehensive investigation of aberrant microRNA profiling in bladder cancer tissues.	There has been accumulative evidence that microRNAs (miRNAs) play essential roles in the tumorigenesis and progression of bladder cancer. However, individual studies and small sample size caused discrepant outcomes. Thus, the current study focused on a comprehensive profiling of all differentially expressed miRNAs in a total of 519 bladder cancer tissue samples, based on miRNA microarray data. Altogether, 11 prioritized miRNAs stated by 21 published microarray datasets, including five down-regulated (miR-133a-3p, miR-1-3p, miR-99a-5p, miR-490-5p, and miR-133b) and six up-regulated candidate miRNAs (miR-182-5p, miR-935, miR-518e-3p, miR-573, miR-100-3p, and miR-3171) were analyzed with vote-counting strategy and a Robust Rank Aggregation method. Subsequently, miRNA in silico target prediction and potential pathway enrichment analysis were performed to investigate the prospective molecular mechanism of miRNAs in the tumorigenesis of bladder cancer. We found that most of the relative pathways of the aberrantly expressed miRNAs found in the current study were closely correlated with different biological processes, cellular components, molecular functions, cancer pathogeneses, and some cell signalings, such as Wnt signaling, insulin/IGF, PI3 kinase, and FGF signaling pathways. Hence, a comprehensive overview on the miRNA expression pattern in bladder cancer tissues was gained by the current study. These miRNAs might be involved in the tumorigenesis and deterioration of bladder cancer.
27235118	mTOR inhibitors in urinary bladder cancer.	Despite the great scientific advances that have been made in cancer treatment, there is still much to do, particularly with regard to urinary bladder cancer. Some of the drugs used in urinary bladder cancer treatment have been in use for more than 30 years and show reduced effectiveness and high recurrence rates. There have been several attempts to find new and more effective drugs, to be used alone or in combination with the drugs already in use, in order to overcome this situation.The biologically important mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway is altered in cancer and mTOR inhibitors have raised many expectations as potentially important anticancer drugs. In this article, the authors will review the mTOR pathway and present their experiences of the use of some mTOR inhibitors, sirolimus, everolimus and temsirolimus, in isolation and in conjunction with non-mTOR inhibitors cisplatin and gemcitabine, on urinary bladder tumour cell lines. The non-muscle-invasive cell line, 5637, is the only one that exhibits a small alteration in the mTOR and AKT phosphorylation after rapalogs exposure. Also, there was a small inhibition of cell proliferation. With gemcitabine plus everolimus or temsirolimus, the results were encouraging as a more effective response was noticed with both combinations, especially in the 5637 and T24 cell lines. Cisplatin associated with everolimus or temsirolimus also gave promising results, as an antiproliferative effect was observed when the drugs were associated, in particular on the 5637 and HT1376 cell lines. Everolimus or temsirolimus in conjunction with gemcitabine or cisplatin could have an important role to play in urinary bladder cancer treatment, depending on the tumour grading.
27776475	Multiple Means by Which Nitric Oxide can Antagonize Photodynamic Therapy.	Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a unique site-specific treatment for eradicating a variety of solid tumors, including prostate, lung, bladder, and brain tumors. PDT is a three-component modality involving (i) administration of a photosensitizing agent (PS), (ii) PS photoexcitation by visible or near-infrared light, and (iii) molecular oxygen. Upon photoexcitation, PS gives rise to tumor-damaging reactive oxygen species, most prominently singlet oxygen (1O2). Previous studies revealed that endogenous nitric oxide (NO) in various mouse tumor models significantly reduced PDT effectiveness. Recent studies in the authors' laboratory indicated that NO produced by photostressed tumor cells per se can elicit anti-PDT effects. For example, breast cancer COH-BR1 and prostate cancer PC3 cells exhibited a rapid and prolonged upregulation of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) after sensitization with 5- aminolevulinic acid (ALA)-induced protoporphyrin-IX, followed by broad-band visible irradiation. Use of iNOS inhibitors and NO scavengers demonstrated that iNOS/NO played a key role in cell resistance to apoptotic photokilling. Moreover, cells surviving an ALA/light challenge proliferated, migrated, and invaded more rapidly than controls, again in iNOS/NOdependent fashion. Thus, NO was found to play a crucial role in various manifestations of enhanced aggressiveness exhibited by remaining live cells. Recent work has revealed that induced NO in PDT-targeted PC3 cells can also translocate and increase aggressiveness of non-targeted bystander cells. These negative and potentially tumor-promoting side effects of NO in PDT may be averted through use of iNOS inhibitors as adjuvants. Each of the above aspects of PDT antagonism by NO will be discussed in this review.
27748815	Differential expression of multidrug resistancerelated proteins in adriamycinresistant (pumc91/ADM) and parental (pumc91) human bladder cancer cell lines.	Multidrug resistance (MDR) is the major obstacle to bladder cancer chemotherapy. Several mechanisms have been implicated in the development of MDR, including extrusion of the drug by cell membrane pumps, associated with Pglycoprotein (Pgp) and multidrug resistanceassociated protein (MRP); increased DNA damage repair, associated with topoisomerase II (Topo II); suppression of druginduced apoptosis, associated with p53; and regulation of cancer cell growth, associated with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). In the present study, the expression levels of these five markers were detected in an adriamycin (ADM)resistant human bladder cancer cell line (pumc91/ADM) and its parental cell line (pumc91), in order to determine which marker is more important, or whether all of them participate in drug resistance. The expression levels of Pgp, MRP, Topo II, VEGF and p53 were measured in the two cell lines by reverse transcriptionquantitative polymerase chain reaction, western blotting and immunohistochemistry. A significant increase in Pgp, MRP and VEGF, and a decrease in Topo II mRNA expression were detected in the pumc91/ADM drugresistant cell line compared with the pumc91 cell line; however, no difference in p53 mRNA expression was detected between the cells. In pumc91/ADM cells, the protein expression levels of Pgp and MRP were upregulated, whereas Topo II was significantly decreased. However, no marked differences in p53 or VEGF expression were detected between the two cell lines at the protein level. The cytoplasmic and cell membrane localization of Pgp and MRP, the cytoplasmic localization of VEGF, and the nuclear localization of p53 and Topo II were confirmed in the two cell lines. The present study detected increased Pgp and MRP, and reduced Topo II expression in pumc91/ADM cells compared with pumc91 cells; however, no difference was detected in p53 and VEGF expression between the cell lines. In conclusion, a significant upregulation of MRP and downregulation of Topo II were detected in the ADMresistant human bladder cancer cell line (pumc91/ADM) compared with in the parental cell line (pumc91).
27667646	lncRNA-UCA1 enhances cell proliferation through functioning as a ceRNA of Sox4 in esophageal cancer.	Esophageal cancer (EC) is one of the most common gastrointestinal cancers, which leads to the sixth ranking of cancer-related death. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play pivotal roles in many biological processes. lncRNA human urothelial carcinoma associated 1 (UCA1) is significantly upregulated and functions as an important oncogene in many types of human cancers. However, the role of UCA1 in EC and its underlying mechanism remains unclear. In the present study, we demonstrated that UCA1 was significantly upregulated in EC tissues and associated with poor prognosis. Overexpression of UCA1 promoted the proliferation of EC cells, while silence of UCA1 inhibited EC cells growth. Furthermore, we found that Sox4 was a direct target gene of UCA1. UCA1 regulated Sox4 expression through functioning as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA). UCA1 directly interacted with miR-204 and decreased the binding of miR-204 to Sox4 3'UTR, which suppressed the degradation of Sox4 mRNA by miR-204. This study provides the first evidence that UCA1 promotes cell proliferation through Sox4 in EC, suggesting that UCA1 and Sox4 may be potential therapeutic targets for EC.
27614395	Development and Validation of a Novel Recurrence Risk Stratification for Initial Non-muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer in Asia.	BACKGROUND: Some risk classifications to determine prognosis of patients with non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) have disadvantages in the clinical setting. We investigated whether the EORTC (European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer) risk stratification is useful to predict recurrence and progression in Japanese patients with NMIBC. In addition, we developed and validated a novel, and simple risk classification of recurrence. METHODS: The analysis was based on 1085 patients with NMIBC at six hospitals. Excluding recurrent cases, we included 856 patients with initial NMIBC for the analysis. The Kaplan-Meier method with the log-rank test were used to calculate recurrence-free survival (RFS) rate and progression-free survival (PFS) rate according to the EORTC risk classifications. We developed a novel risk classification system for recurrence in NMIBC patients using the independent recurrence prognostic factors based on Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. External validation was done on an external data set of 641 patients from Kyorin University Hospital. FINDINGS: There were no significant differences in RFS and PFS rates between the groups according to EORTC risk classification. We constructed a novel risk model predicting recurrence that classified patients into three groups using four independent prognostic factors to predict tumour recurrence based on Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. According to the novel recurrence risk classification, there was a significant difference in 5-year RFS rate between the low (68.4%), intermediate (45.8%) and high (33.7%) risk groups (P<0.001). INTERPRETATION: As the EORTC risk group stratification may not be applicable to Asian patients with NMIBC, our novel classification model can be a simple and useful prognostic tool to stratify recurrence risk in patients with NMIBC. FUNDING: None.
27612592	Meta-Analysis of the Luminal and Basal Subtypes of Bladder Cancer and the Identification of Signature Immunohistochemical Markers for Clinical Use.	BACKGROUND: It has been suggested that bladder cancer can be divided into two molecular subtypes referred to as luminal and basal with distinct clinical behaviors and sensitivities to chemotherapy. We aimed to validate these subtypes in several clinical cohorts and identify signature immunohistochemical markers that would permit simple and cost-effective classification of the disease in primary care centers. METHODS: We analyzed genomic expression profiles of bladder cancer in three cohorts of fresh frozen tumor samples: MD Anderson (n=132), Lund (n=308), and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) (n=408) to validate the expression signatures of luminal and basal subtypes and relate them to clinical follow-up data. We also used an MD Anderson cohort of archival bladder tumor samples (n=89) and a parallel tissue microarray to identify immunohistochemical markers that permitted the molecular classification of bladder cancer. FINDINGS: Bladder cancers could be assigned to two candidate intrinsic molecular subtypes referred to here as luminal and basal in all of the datasets analyzed. Luminal tumors were characterized by the expression signature similar to the intermediate/superficial layers of normal urothelium. They showed the upregulation of PPARgamma target genes and the enrichment for FGFR3, ELF3, CDKN1A, and TSC1 mutations. In addition, luminal tumors were characterized by the overexpression of E-Cadherin, HER2/3, Rab-25, and Src. Basal tumors showed the expression signature similar to the basal layer of normal urothelium. They showed the upregulation of p63 target genes, the enrichment for TP53 and RB1 mutations, and overexpression of CD49, Cyclin B1, and EGFR. Survival analyses showed that the muscle-invasive basal bladder cancers were more aggressive when compared to luminal cancers. The immunohistochemical expressions of only two markers, luminal (GATA3) and basal (KRT5/6), were sufficient to identify the molecular subtypes of bladder cancer with over 90% accuracy. INTERPRETATION: The molecular subtypes of bladder cancer have distinct clinical behaviors and sensitivities to chemotherapy, and a simple two-marker immunohistochemical classifier can be used for prognostic and therapeutic stratification.

27599396	Clinical significance of CD44 variant 9 expression as a prognostic indicator in bladder cancer.	CD44, a major surface receptor for hyaluronic acid, has multiple isoforms and represents a major cancer stem cell marker for various epithelial tumors. CD44 variant 9 (CD44v9) was correlated with recurrence and metastasis in gastric and colon cancer. We examined its role in invasion and as a biomarker for the basal muscle invasive molecular subtype showing worse prognosis, and for tumor progression in high risk (pT1/high grade) nonmuscle invasive bladder cancers (NMIBCs). CD44v9, cytokeratin 5/6 (CK5/6), and cytokeratin 20 (CK20) expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry in 98 pathologically confirmed specimens (36 muscle and 62 highrisk nonmuscle) and correlated to clinical outcome. In vitro analysis was performed using two human bladder cancer cell lines (HT1376 and 5637). The CD44v9 highexpressing group exhibited significantly lower progressionfree and cancerspecific survival rates in both muscle (P=0.0349 and 0.0382, respectively) and nonmuscle (P=0.0002 and 0.0079) invasive patients. CD44v9 expression was significantly correlated with CK5/6 (P<0.001), colocalizing at the muscle invasion front but distinctly separated from CK20 in nonmuscle invasion. CD44 and CD44v9 siRNA knockdown demonstrated significantly lower Matrigel invasion ability and significantly shorter migration distance (all P<0.01). CD44 and CD44v9 knockdown increased Ecadherin and decreased Ncadherin, snail, and slug epithelialmesenchymal transition marker protein expression. Thus, higher CD44v9 expression was associated with worse prognosis, likely impacting invasion and migration via the epithelialmesenchymal transition. Together, these findings suggest that CD44v9 expression might be a useful predictive biomarker in basaltype muscle and high-risk NMIBC.
27775939	Prospective Pilot Study to Evaluate the Incremental Value of PET Information in Patients With Bladder Cancer Undergoing 18F-FDG Simultaneous PET/MRI.	PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to conduct a prospective pilot study comparing the diagnostic performance of MRI alone and F-FDG simultaneous PET/MRI using a diuresis protocol in bladder cancer patients. METHODS: Twenty-two bladder cancer patients underwent F-FDG PET/MRI, using intravenous furosemide and oral hydration for bladder clearance. A radiologist scored probability of tumor in 3 locations (urinary bladder, pelvic lymph nodes, nonnodal pelvis) using 1- to 3-point scale (1 = negative, 2 = equivocal, 3 = definite tumor). A nuclear medicine physician reviewed fused PET/MRI images, after which scores were reassigned based on combined findings. Follow-up pathologic and imaging data served as reference. Performances of MRI alone and PET/MRI were compared. RESULTS: Of these patients, 82%, 38%, and 18% were positive for bladder, pelvic nodal, and nonnodal pelvic tumor, respectively. At a score of 3, PET/MRI exhibited greater accuracy for detection of bladder tumor (86% vs 77%), metastatic pelvic lymph nodes (95% vs 76%), and nonnodal pelvic malignancy (100% vs 91%). In the bladder, PET changed the level of suspicion in 36% of patients (50% increased suspicion, 50% decreased suspicion), with 75% of these changes deemed correct based on reference standard. For pelvic lymph nodes, PET changed suspicion in 52% (36% increase, 64% decrease), with 95% of changes deemed correct. For nonnodal pelvis, PET changed suspicion in 9% (100% increase), with 100% deemed correct. CONCLUSIONS: Additional PET information helped to appropriately determine level of suspicion in multiple anatomic sites for otherwise equivocal findings on MRI alone. Although requiring larger studies, findings suggest a possible role for simultaneous PET/MRI to assist bladder cancer management.
27775662	Capsaicin Suppresses Cell Proliferation, Induces Cell Cycle Arrest and ROS Production in Bladder Cancer Cells through FOXO3a-Mediated Pathways.	Capsaicin (CAP), a highly selective agonist for transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1 (TRPV1), has been widely reported to exhibit anti-oxidant, anti-inflammation and anticancer activities. Currently, several therapeutic approaches for bladder cancer (BCa) are available, but accompanied by unfavorable outcomes. Previous studies reported a potential clinical effect of CAP to prevent BCa tumorigenesis. However, its underlying molecular mechanism still remains unknown. Our transcriptome analysis suggested a close link among calcium signaling pathway, cell cycle regulation, ROS metabolism and FOXO signaling pathway in BCa. In this study, several experiments were performed to investigate the effects of CAP on BCa cells (5637 and T24) and NOD/SCID mice. Our results showed that CAP could suppress BCa tumorigenesis by inhibiting its proliferation both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, CAP induced cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase and ROS production. Importantly, our studies revealed a strong increase of FOXO3a after treatment with CAP. Furthermore, we observed no significant alteration of apoptosis by CAP, whereas Catalase and SOD2 were considerably upregulated, which could clear ROS and protect against cell death. Thus, our results suggested that CAP could inhibit viability and tumorigenesis of BCa possibly via FOXO3a-mediated pathways.
27775224	Urine cytology of nonurothelial malignancies-a 10-year experience in a large multihospital healthcare system.	BACKGROUND: Urine cytology is the most frequently utilized test to detect urothelial cancer. Secondary bladder neoplasms need to be recognized as this impacts patient management. We report our experience on nonurothelial malignancies (NUM) detected in urine cytology over a 10-year period. METHODS: A 10-year retrospective search for patients with biopsy-proven NUM to the urothelial tract yielded 25 urine samples from 14 patients. Two cytopathologists blinded to the original cytology diagnosis reviewed the cytology and histology slides. The incidence, cytomorphologic features, diagnostic accuracy, factors influencing the diagnostic accuracy, and clinical impact of the cytology result were studied. RESULTS: The incidence of NUM was <1%. The male:female ratio was 1.3. An abnormality was detected in 60% of the cases; however, in only 4% of the cases, a primary site was identified accurately. Of the false negatives, 96% was deemed as sampling errors and 4% was interpretational. Patient management was not impacted in any of the false-negative cases due to concurrent or past tissue diagnosis. CONCLUSION: Colon cancer was the most frequent secondary tumor. Sampling error attributed to the false-negative results. Necrosis and dirty background was often associated with metastatic lesions from colon. Obtaining history of a primary tumor elsewhere was a key factor in diagnosis of a metastatic lesion. Hematopoietic malignancies remain to be a diagnostic challenge. Cytospin preparations were superior for evaluating nuclear detail and background material as opposed to monolayer (Thinprep) technology. Diagnostic accuracy was improved by obtaining immunohistochemistry. Diagn. Cytopathol. 2016. (c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Diagn. Cytopathol. 2017;45:22-28. (c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
27665730	Diagnostic value of positive urinary cytology in the detection of recurrent urothelial carcinoma: 10-Year Experience at the Papanicolaou Cytology Laboratory.	INTRODUCTION: Urothelial carcinoma (UCC) of the bladder is the most common malignancy of the urinary tract. The performance of urine cytology (UCy) after radical cystectomy (RC) and urinary diversion is quite variable and there is no consensus regarding its role in post-treatment surveillance. The goal of this study is to retrospectively review the diagnostic value of positive (suspicious or positive for malignancy) diverted urine cytology (DUCy) in the detection of urinary tract recurrence of UCC. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective 10-year (January 2005 to January 2015) computerized search for all DUCy specimens was conducted. All suspicious (Susp) or positive for malignant cells (PMC) ThinPrep cases were identified and retrospectively reviewed. Clinical, surgical, and pathological follow-up for patients with Susp or PMC UCy were tabulated and analyzed. RESULTS: During the 10-year-period, 1,525 DUCy cases from 408 patients were identified. Of these, 25 cases (1.64%) from 10 patients were called either Susp (13; 0.85%) or PMC (12; 0.79%). The 25 DUCy cases occurred within a mean of 20 months post-RC. Out of 10 patients, 9 had a concurrent biopsy or a subsequent resection of the recurrent site. Of these 9 patients, 8 (89%) had subsequent biopsy or resection, which showed recurrent UCC. In 5/8 patients, positive DUCy was the very first manifestation of recurrence, which was subsequently confirmed by imaging or histology. CONCLUSION: It is our experience that patients with positive UCy after RC have a high likelihood of recurrent UCC and should be counseled and managed accordingly. Diagn. Cytopathol. 2016;44:975-979.

27590593	Drug-eluting biodegradable ureteral stent: New approach for urothelial tumors of upper urinary tract cancer.	Upper urinary tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC) accounts for 5-10% of urothelial carcinomas and is a disease that has not been widely studied as carcinoma of the bladder. To avoid the problems of conventional therapies, such as the need for frequent drug instillation due to poor drug retention, we developed a biodegradable ureteral stent (BUS) impregnated by supercritical fluid CO2 (scCO2) with the most commonly used anti-cancer drugs, namely paclitaxel, epirubicin, doxorubicin, and gemcitabine. The release kinetics of anti-cancer therapeutics from drug-eluting stents was measured in artificial urine solution (AUS). The in vitro release showed a faster release in the first 72h for the four anti-cancer drugs, after this time a plateau was achieved and finally the stent degraded after 9days. Regarding the amount of impregnated drugs by scCO2, gemcitabine showed the highest amount of loading (19.57mug drug/mg polymer: 2% loaded), while the lowest amount was obtained for paclitaxel (0.067mug drug/mg polymer: 0.01% loaded). A cancer cell line (T24) was exposed to graded concentrations (0.01-2000ng/ml) of each drugs for 4 and 72h to determine the sensitivities of the cells to each drug (IC50). The direct and indirect contact study of the anti-cancer biodegradable ureteral stents with the T24 and HUVEC cell lines confirmed the anti-tumoral effect of the BUS impregnated with the four anti-cancer drugs tested, reducing around 75% of the viability of the T24 cell line after 72h and demonstrating minimal cytotoxic effect on HUVECs.
27562722	Long non-coding RNA UCA1 promotes the tumorigenesis in pancreatic cancer.	The contribution of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) to tumorigenesis and metastasis of pancreatic cancer (PC) remains largely unknown. Urothelial cancer-associated 1 (UCA1), which is an originally identified lncRNA in bladder cancer, has be proved to play a pivotal role in bladder cancer progression and embryonic development. In this study, we detected the mRNA expression of UCA1 in 128 PC patients by qRT-PCR, and found that UCA1 expression was significantly, up-regulated in tumor tissues than that in matched adjacent non-tumor tissues (p<0.05). Clinicopathological analysis demonstrated that UCA1 expression in PC significantly correlated with malignant potential factors such as tumor size (p=0.021), depth of invasion (p=0.033), CA19-9 level (p=0.034) and tumor stage (p=0.013). Cox proportional hazards regression analysis also confirmed that high UCA1 expression was an independent prognostic biomarker of PC (p=0.046), which led to an obviously shorter 5-year overall survival (OS) compared to those patients with low UCA1 expressions (p=0.018). Furthermore, we effectively down-regulated UCA1 mRNA expression by transfecting RNA interfere fragments into SW-1990 cells, and our results in vitro indicated that down-regulation of UCA1 could effectively inhibit the cell proliferative activities, induce apoptotic rate and cause cell cycle arrest in PC cells (p<0.05). Meanwhile, UCA1 expression negative-correlated with p27 in PC tissues (r2=0.46, p<0.01), and knockdown of p27 partly abrogated the cell proliferative activities caused by UCA1 (p<0.05). Our results raised the possibility of using UCA1 as a potential prognostic biomarker and therapy target of PC, and down-regulation of UCA1 might be considered to be a novel molecular treatment strategy for patients with PC.
27550406	Surgical therapy of vulvar cancer: how to choose the correct reconstruction?	OBJECTIVE: To create a comprehensive algorithmic approach to reconstruction after vulvar cancer ablative surgery, which includes both traditional and perforator flaps, evaluating anatomical subunits and shape of the defect. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 80 cases of reconstruction after vulvar cancer ablative surgery, performed between June 2006 and January 2016, transferring 101 flaps. We registered the possibility to achieve the complete wound closure, even in presence of very complex defects, and the postoperative complications. On the basis of these experience, analyzing the choices made and considering the complications, we developed an algorithm to help with the selection of the flap in vulvoperineal reconstruction after oncologic ablative surgery for vulvar cancer. RESULTS: We employed eight types of different flaps, including 54 traditional fasciocutaneous V-Y flaps, 23 rectus abdominis myocutaneous flaps, 11 anterolateral thigh flaps, three V-Y gracilis myocutaneous flaps, three free style perforators V-Y flaps from the inner thigh, two Limberg flaps, two lotus flaps, two deep inferior epigastric artery perforator flap, and one superficial circumflex iliac artery perforator flap. The structures most frequently involved in resection were vulva, perineum, mons pubis, groins, vagina, urethra and, more rarely, rectum, bladder, and lower abdominal wall. CONCLUSION: The algorithm we implemented can be a useful tool to help flap selection. The key points in the decision-making process are: anatomical subunits to be covered, overall shape and symmetry of the defect and some patient features such as skin laxity or previous radiotherapy. Perforator flaps, when feasible, must be considered standard in vulvoperineal reconstruction, although in some cases traditional flaps remain the best choice.
27550405	Carcinoma of the cervix in elderly patients treated with radiotherapy: patterns of care and treatment outcomes.	OBJECTIVE: The aim of this analysis was to examine the management of cervix cancer in elderly patients referred for radiotherapy and the results of treatment in terms of overall survival (OS), relapse-free survival (RFS), and treatment-related toxicities. METHODS: Patients were eligible if they were aged >/=75 years, newly diagnosed with cervix cancer and referred for radiotherapy as part of their treatment. Patient details were retrieved from the gynaecology service database where clinical, histopathological treatment and follow-up data were prospectively collected. RESULTS: From 1998 to 2010, 126 patients aged >/=75 years, met selection criteria. Median age was 81.5 years. Eighty-one patients had definitive radiotherapy, 10 received adjuvant radiotherapy and 35 had palliative radiotherapy. Seventy-one percent of patients had the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage 1b-2b disease. Median follow-up was 37 months. OS and RFS at 3 years among those treated with curative intent were 66.6% and 75.9% respectively with majority of patients dying without any evidence of cervix cancer. Grade 2 or more late toxicities were: bladder 5%, bowel 11%, and vagina 27%. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) status was a significant predictor of OS and RFS with each unit increment in ECOG score increased the risk of death by 1.69 times (p<0.001). CONCLUSION: Following appropriate patient selection, elderly patients treated curatively with radiotherapy for cervix cancer have good disease control. Palliative hypofractionated regimens are well tolerated in patients unsuitable for radical treatment.
27599849	Plasma and urine DNA levels are related to microscopic hematuria in patients with bladder urothelial carcinoma.	a) Objective: An increase in cell-free DNA was observed in the plasma of many cancer patients. This major biomarker can be used to differentiate patients with malignant neoplasms from those with benign neoplasms or healthy patients. Depending on the characteristic of the tumor, there are qualitative variations in the circulating cell-free DNA. Today, studies on the concentration of fragments of circulating cell-free DNA and their respective sizes in patients with bladder cancer are not plentiful in the literature. A 100% effective plasma tumor marker, which would help in the diagnosis and follow-up of bladder cancer, is yet to be developed; therefore, cell-free DNA levels in the plasma may represent a valuable biomarker for the diagnosis, prognosis and follow-up of patients with this type of tumor. b) Design and methods: In this study we analyze the kinetics of plasma and urine DNA concentrations in patients with bladder cancer, relating them to the other clinical laboratory variables. c) Results: Patients with hematuria showed a positive correlation with urine DNA. d) Conclusion: An increase in plasma and urine DNA was unprecedentedly reported over time, a fact that may come in handy in the prognosis of patients. Furthermore, microscopic haematuria is correlated with plasma and urinary DNA levels.
27765044	Bladder chondrosarcoma plus urothelial carcinoma in recurred transitional cell carcinoma of the upper urinary tract: a case report and literature review.	BACKGROUND: Sarcomatoid urothelial carcinoma (SUC) is a rare malignant neoplasm of the urinary bladder comprising 0.2-0.6 % of all histological bladder tumor subtypes. It presents as a high-stage malignancy and exhibits aggressive biological behavior, regardless of the treatment employed. It is defined as histologically indistinguishable from sarcoma and as a high-grade biphasic neoplasm with malignant epithelial and mesenchymal components. The mean age of patients presenting with SUC is 66 years, and the male-to-female ratio is 3:1. In addition, gross hematuria is usually present. The prognosis of SUC is poorer than that of typical urothelial carcinoma because of uncertainty concerning the optimal treatment regimen. CASE PRESENTATION: We report the case of a 77-year-old woman with SUC containing a chondrosarcoma component who, 12 years previously, had undergone a nephroureterectomy for pT3N0M0 ureter cancer of the contralateral upper urinary tract. From the 4th year of follow-up after nephroureterectomy, multiple recurrent bladder tumors staged as Ta transitional cell carcinoma developed, and six transurethral resections of the bladder (TURB) with multiple intravesical instillations were performed without any evidence of metastases and upper tract recurrences. In 2015, a right partial distal ureterectomy and an additional TURB were performed due to a papillary mass at the right contralateral ureterovesical junction of the bladder, which was confirmed as a high-grade pT1 transitional cell carcinoma. After a further 2 years of follow-up, total pelvic exenteration with an ileal conduit diversion was performed to remove the mass, which was a pT4N0M0 tumor composed of carcinomatous and sarcomatous elements compatible with a sarcomatoid carcinoma including grade 3 transitional cell carcinoma and chondrosarcoma. Immunohistochemical examination showed that tumor cells were positive for vimentin and p63 and negative for NSE and Cd56 markers. In the first postoperative month, a metastatic lung nodule was detected on chest CT. The patient was scheduled for adjuvant gemcitabine-cisplatin chemotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: The present case was interesting because we cannot be sure if the SUC chondrosarcoma originated from the 12-year-ago proximal ureter tumor, the 2-year-ago contralateral distal ureter tumor, or a new primary bladder tumor. Genetic profiling might have been useful to determine the origin of the SUC chondrosarcoma.
27612412	A systematic review and meta-analysis of oncological and renal function outcomes obtained after segmental ureterectomy versus radical nephroureterectomy for upper tract urothelial carcinoma.	OBJECTIVE: To perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of the comparative studies reporting oncological and renal function outcomes of segmental ureterectomy (SU) versus radical nephroureterectomy (RNU) for upper tract urothelial carcinomas (UTUC). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A literature search on Pubmed, Embase, and the Cochrane library was conducted according to the PRISMA guidelines, and a meta-analysis was performed to assess cancer-specific survival (CSS), overall survival (OS), recurrence-free survival (RFS), intravesical recurrence free survival (IVRFS) and surgery-related variations in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). RESULTS: A total of 11 retrospective studies with 3963 patients who underwent either SU (n = 983; 24.8%) or RNU (n = 2980; 75.2%) were included. Although patients treated with SU were more likely to be diagnosed with favorable pathological features, the meta-analysis of unadjusted data revealed no significant difference between both groups in terms of CSS (HR 0.90, p = 0.33) and OS (HR 0.98, p = 0.93). Accordingly, the meta-analysis of adjusted data confirmed equivalent CSS (HR = 0.90, p = 0.47) between SU and RNU. Similarly, no significant difference was found in terms of RFS (HR 1.06, p = 0.72) and IVRFS (HR 1.35, p = 0.39). However, a significant decreased risk of impaired renal function was observed after SU when compared to RNU (mean eGFR difference = 9.32 ml/1.73 m2, p = 0.007). CONCLUSION: Although adverse patient and tumor characteristics were not equally balanced between treatment arms, our systematic review and meta-analysis supports similar oncological outcomes between SU and RNU, with better preservation of renal function after SU. As such, SU should be preferably used as the first-line treatment for low-risk ureter tumors, while considered for selected cases of high-risk disease.
27032295	Perioperative and oncologic outcomes of robot-assisted vs. open radical cystectomy in bladder cancer patients: A comparison of two high-volume referral centers.	OBJECTIVES: To examine perioperative and oncologic outcomes of open (ORC) and robot-assisted radical cystectomy (RARC) in bladder cancer (BCa) patients. METHODS AND MATERIALS: 368 consecutive patients with cT1-4 M0 BCa treated at two high-volume European centers between 2004 and 2013 were evaluated. Data on complications, operative time, blood loss, postoperative transfusion, reoperation, length of stay (LOS), positive margins, recurrence, cancer-specific mortality (CSM), and overall survival were evaluated. Uni- and multivariable regression analyses tested the impact of the surgical approach on perioperative and oncologic outcomes. RESULTS: Overall, 230 (62.5%) and 138 (37.5%) patients were treated with ORC and RARC. In multivariable analyses RARC patients had higher odds of prolonged operative time and low-grade complications (all P </= 0.001). Patients treated with ORC had higher odds of blood loss >500 ml and prolonged LOS (all P </= 0.03). No differences were observed in high-grade complications and positive margins (all P >/= 0.06). No differences were observed in 5-year recurrence-free and CSM-free survival rates between patients treated with ORC vs. RARC (57.1 vs. 54.2% and 61.9 vs. 73.5%; all P >/= 0.3). This was confirmed in multivariable analyses, where the surgical approach was not associated with the risk of recurrence and CSM (all P >/= 0.1). CONCLUSIONS: Although ORC might be associated with a shorter operative time, RARC led to lower blood loss and shorter LOS. No differences exist in high-grade complications and positive margins. RARC and ORC provide similar oncologic control.
27764046	68Ga-DOTATOC and 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT Unmasked a Case of Prostate Cancer With Neuroendocrine Differentiation.	A bedridden 90-year-old man with fever and elevated prostate-specific antigen (PSA) (49 ng/mL) was referred for differentiation between infection and tumor. F-FDG PET/CT was negative for infection, but Ga-PSMA PET/CT showed multiple lesions in prostate gland with infiltration to bladder wall and seminal vesicle, consistent with locally advanced prostate cancer. The lesion with the highest Ga-PSMA uptake was strongly avid for Ga-DOTATOC, suggesting neuroendocrine tumor differentiation. After hormonal therapy, PSA normalized, but chromogranin-A increased (from 251 to 398 ng/mL), inferring progression of neuroendocrine tumor differentiation. Advanced prostate cancer may require investigation for pathological neuroendocrine transformation, although PSA may suggest improvement.
27761190	Left Anterior Descending Coronary Artery and Multiple Peripheral Mycotic Aneurysms Due to Mycobacterium Bovis Following Intravesical Bacillus Calmette-Guerin Therapy: A Case Report.	The use of live attenuated intravesicular Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) therapy is a generally accepted safe and effective method for the treatment of superficial transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) of the bladder. Although rare, < 5% of patient's treated with intravesicular BCG therapy may develop potentially serious complications, including localized infections to the genitourinary tract, mycotic aneurysms and osteomyelitis. We present here a case of a 63-year-old male who developed left coronary and multiple peripheral M. Bovis mycotic aneurysms as a late complication of intravesicular BCG therapy for superficial bladder cancer. The patient initially presented with acute onset pain and swelling in the left knee > 2 years following initial therapy, and initial workup revealed a ruptured saccular aneurysm of the left popliteal artery as well as incidental bilateral common femoral artery aneurysms. Following endovascular treatment and additional workup, the patient was discovered to have additional aneurysms in the right popliteal artery and left anterior descending artery (LAD). Surgical pathology and bacterial cultures obtained from the excised femoral aneurysms and surgical groin wounds were positive for Mycobacterium Bovis, and the patient was initiated on a nine-month antimycobacterial course of isoniazid, rifampin and ethambutol. Including the present case, there has been a total of 32 reported cases of mycotic aneurysms as a complication from intravesicular BCG therapy, which we will review here. The majority of reported cases involve the abdominal aorta; however, this represents the first known reported case of a coronary aneurysm.
27757783	Overexpression of autotaxin is associated with human renal cell carcinoma and bladder carcinoma and their progression.	Autotaxin (ATX) as an important tumor cell motility-stimulating factor is upregulated in many different types of cancer. ATX, a member of the ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase and phosphodiesterase family of enzymes, possesses lysophospholipase D activity which hydrolyzes lysophosphatidylcholine to generate the potent tumor growth factor and mitogen lysophosphatidic acid (LPA). LPA acts on specific G-protein-coupled receptors, thereby regulating cell growth, migration, and survival. This study aimed to investigate the differences in gene expression pattern of ATX between cancerous and adjacent normal tissue of human renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and bladder carcinoma (BC) and find the correlation between ATX expression and clinicopathological features of both of these carcinomas. Both the RCC and BC tissues and with the adjacent normal tissues were collected. Immunohistochemistry and Western blotting analysis were used to detect the extent of ATX expression in all of these samples. Immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis revealed that expression of ATX protein in carcinoma tissues is significantly higher than that in the adjacent normal tissues. Immunohistochemistry analysis showed that ATX is localized in cytoplasm. Western blotting analysis showed that ATX protein is expressed in both RCC and BC, and the expression levels were 69.5 and 48.0 %, respectively, higher in RCC and BC carcinoma tissue samples than in the adjacent normal tissues, which is consistent with the results of immunohistochemistry study. Thus, this study provided the evidence that ATX is highly expressed in both RCC and BC. Further research can be done to identify the diagnosis and treatment significance of both these carcinomas.
27519498	Laparoscopic nerve-sparing radical hysterectomy for bulky cervical cancer (>/=6 cm) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy: A multicenter prospective cohort study.	OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to evaluate the clinical outcomes of laparoscopic nerve-sparing radical hysterectomy (LNRH) for bulky-stage cervical cancer (lesion >/= 6 cm) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). METHODS: This study prospective recruited patients with pathology-confirmed cervical cancer presenting as a bulky mass (lesion >/= 6 cm). Subjects included patients who underwent laparoscopic radical surgery. They were assigned to one of two groups by surgical method: patients who underwent LNRH after NAC and patients who underwent classical laparoscopic radical hysterectomy (LRH) after NAC. We compared the patients' general clinical characteristics, surgical profiles, pathological findings and adjuvant therapies between the two groups. Recovery of bladder and intestinal function was evaluated by questionnaire. Patients were followed for up to 1 year to determine the maintenance of effect. RESULTS: Compared with patients treated with LRH, patients who underwent LNRH presented no significant differences in age, surgery characteristics, pathological findings, adjuvant therapies or main adverse effects. The mean duration of residual urine <50 mL in the LNRH group was 11 days, much shorter than that in the LRH group (18 days; P < 0.001). The period of passage of gas by anus was shorter (38.9 +/- 4.1 h) in LNRH patients than that in LRH patients (56.5 +/- 4.0 h; P < 0.001). The urinary and intestinal symptoms were evaluated 1 year after surgery. The recovery of urinary and intestinal function of patients was better in the LNRH group than in the LRH group. CONCLUSION: LNRH is a safe and feasible surgical management for bulky-stage cervical cancer patients (lesion >/= 6 cm), and after NAC, the urinary and intestinal function of patients in LNRH group showed better recovery compared with functions in the LRH group. The technique is relatively new, and its oncologic efficiency has not yet been fully established. Prospective randomised controlled studies with an increased number of patients and long-term postoperative follow-up should be carried out to investigate the effect of this therapeutic strategy for bulky-stage cervical cancer.
27752923	A simple method to induce hypoxia-induced vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) expression in T24 human bladder cancer cells.	Angiogenesis is an essential process for the establishment, development, and dissemination of several malignant tumors including bladder cancer. The hypoxic condition promotes the stabilization of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1alpha), which translocates to the nucleus to mediate angiogenic factors including the vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A). AnaeroGen system was developed for microbiology area to create a low oxygen tension required to the growth of anaerobic bacteria. Here, we hypothesized the use of AnaeroGen system to induce hypoxia in T24 human bladder carcinoma cells, in order to promote the overexpression of VEGF-A. T24 cells were cultured in six-well plates containing McCoy medium. Exposures of T24 cells to hypoxia for 1, 8, 24, and 48 h were performed using the Oxoid AnaeroGen system, while T24 cells under normoxia were used as control. The expression of VEGF-A and HIF-1alpha was analyzed by real-time PCR. ELISA for HIF-1alpha was carried out. The VEGF-A expression increased significantly by Oxoid AnaeroGen-induced hypoxia in a time-depending manner, reaching the peak in 48 h of hypoxia. Although HIF-1alpha mRNA was not changed, HIF-1alpha protein was increased in the presence of hypoxia, reaching a peak at 8 h. These results demonstrated that the Oxoid AnaeroGen system is a simple method to expose T24 cells to hypoxia and efficiently to upregulate VEGF expression in T24 cells.
27752905	Expression of miRNA-630 in bladder urothelial carcinoma and its clinical significance.	Many studies informed that microRNAs (miRNAs) could function as diagnostic and prognostic indicators in several cancers. The aims of this study were to explore the expression of miR-630 in bladder urothelial carcinoma and its clinical significance for the evaluation of cancer prognosis. A total of 116 patients with bladder urothelial carcinoma were obtained in this retrospective study between May, 2012 and Sep. 2015. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was conducted to evaluate the expression level of miR-630. The chi-square test was used to examine the associations between miR-630 expression and the clinicopathological features. The Kaplan-Meier method was conducted to explore the survival status of urothelial carcinoma patients. The log-rank test was used to analyze differences in survival rate. The results showed an obvious increase in miR-630 expression from normal bladder to bladder urothelial carcinoma (P=0.027). Additionally, patients with higher miR-630 expression had significantly shorter disease-free survival (DFS) (P=0.043) and overall survival (OS) (P=0.038) than those with lower miR-630 expression. Furthermore, multivariate analysis revealed that up-regulation of miR-630 was an independent prognostic factor for both DFS (P=0.042) and OS (P=0.046). It was demonstrated that miR-630 may be a novel and valuable prognostic factor for bladder urothelial carcinoma.
27752904	Influence of position and radiation technique on organs at risk in radiotherapy of rectal cancer.	The influence of the position and radiation technique on the organs at risk (OARs) in radiotherapy of rectal cancer was evaluated. The relationship between the volume of irradiated small bowel (VSB) and acute bowel toxicity was determined. A total of 97 cases of rectal cancer were retrospectively randomized to receive radiotherapy with the designated treatment positions and radiation plans. Among 64 patients in the supine position, 32 patients were given three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3DCR) and 32 patients were subjected to intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) respectively. The rest 33 patients were treated with 3DCRT in the prone position with a belly board. The VSB was calculated for doses from 5 to 45 Gy at an interval of 5 Gy. With prescription dose in planned target volume (PTV) of 50 Gy, the dose distribution, conformal index for PTV (CIPTV), dose-volume histogram (DVH) of OARs, the correlation of VSB and the acute toxicity were compared. The results were shown as follows: (1) Among the 3 methods, there were no differences in PTV's converge including V95 and D95; (2) For IMRT under a supine position, CIPTV was closest to 1, the mean dose of small bowel decreased (P<0.05), and the mean VSB from V30 to V45 significantly decreased (P<0.05). (3) For 3DCRT with a belly board under a prone position, the mean dose and the mean VSB from 40 to 45 Gy were less than those for 3DCRT under a supine position (P<0.05); (4) Mean proportion of VSB was significantly greater in the patients experiencing diarrhea grade 2-4 than in those with diarrhea grade 0-1 at dose levels from V30 to V45 (P<0.05). It was concluded that for the radiotherapy of rectal cancer, IMRT technique might decrease the high-dose VSB to reduce the risk of acute injury. 3DCRT with a belly board under a prone position is superior to 3DCRT under a supine position, which could be a second choice for radiation of rectal cancer.
27752150	High-grade urothelial bladder cancer in children: A case report and critical analysis of the literature.	BACKGROUND: Bladder cancer is relatively common in adults. In children, it is extremely rare and in the majority of cases, low grade, low stage urothelial cancers are found. CASE REPORT: We describe the diagnostic, therapeutic, and follow-up management of bladder cancer in a 3-year-old boy examined for painless hematuria. Transurethral resection of the tumor was performed and T1 high grade urothelial cancer with osseous metaplasia was found in definitive specimens. During the 2-year follow-up, there has been no recurrence. Typical characteristics of the most prevalent bladder tumors are presented. CONCLUSION: Despite its low incidence and low prevalence bladder cancer in children is a very serious condition which must not be missed in the differential diagnosis of hematuria or urinary tract infection. It is vital to differentiate urothelial cancer from hamartoma and nephrogenic adenoma and, particularly in osseous metaplasia, from sarcomatoid carcinoma. Especially in high-grade cancers, precise TUR of the tumor with a careful follow-up is essential to detect cancer recurrence and reduce progression.
27749139	Proportion and characteristics of men with unknown risk category in the National Prostate Cancer Register of Sweden.	BACKGROUND: Knowledge on missing data in a clinical cancer register is important to assess the validity of research results. For analysis of prostate cancer (Pca), risk category, a composite variable based on serum levels of prostate specific antigen (PSA), stage, and Gleason score, is crucial for treatment decisions and a strong determinant of outcome. The aim of this study was to assess the proportion and characteristics of men in the National Prostate Cancer Register (NPCR) of Sweden with unknown risk category. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Men diagnosed with Pca between 1998 and 2012 registered in NPCR with known or unknown risk category were compared with respect to age, socioeconomic factors, comorbidity, cancer characteristics, cancer treatment, and mortality from Pca and other causes. RESULTS: In total, 3315 of 129 391 (3%) men had unknown risk category. Compared to other men in NPCR, these men more often had a concomitant bladder cancer diagnosis, 19% versus 1%, diagnosis of benign prostatic hyperplasia 31% versus 5%, received unspecified Pca treatment 16% versus 3%, had higher comorbidity, Charlson Comorbidity Index 2 or higher, 34% versus 13%, and had lower Pca mortality 12% versus 30%, but similar mortality from other causes. CONCLUSION: Men with unknown risk category were rare in NPCR but distinctly different from other men in NPCR in many aspects including higher comorbidity and lower Pca mortality.
27748855	Extra-virgin olive oil phenols block cell cycle progression and modulate chemotherapeutic toxicity in bladder cancer cells.	Epidemiological data indicate that the daily consumption of extravirgin olive oil (EVOO), a common dietary habit of the Mediterranean area, lowers the incidence of certain types of cancer, in particular bladder neoplasm. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the antiproliferative activity of polyphenols extracted from EVOO on bladder cancer (BCa), and to clarify the biological mechanisms that trigger cell death. Furthermore, we also evaluated the ability of low doses of extravirgin olive oil extract (EVOOE) to modulate the in vitro activity of paclitaxel or mitomycin, two antineoplastic drugs used in the management of different types of cancer. Our results showed that EVOOE significantly inhibited the proliferation and clonogenic ability of T24 and 5637 BCa cells in a dosedependent manner. Furthermore, cell cycle analysis after EVOOE treatment showed a marked growth arrest prior to mitosis in the G2/M phase for both cell lines, with the subsequent induction of apoptosis only in the T24 cells. Notably, simultaneous treatment of mitomycin C and EVOOE reduced the drug cytotoxicity due to inhibition of ROS production. Conversely, the cotreatment of T24 cells with paclitaxel and the polyphenol extract strongly increased the apoptotic cell death at each tested concentration compared to paclitaxel alone. Our results support the epidemiological evidence indicating that olive oil consumption exerts health benefits and may represent a starting point for the development of new anticancer strategies.
27741379	Dosimetric and radiobiological impact of intensity modulated proton therapy and RapidArc planning for high-risk prostate cancer with seminal vesicles.	INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the dosimetric and radiobiological impact of intensity modulated proton therapy (IMPT) and RapidArc planning for high-risk prostate cancer with seminal vesicles. METHODS: Ten high-risk prostate cancer cases were included in this retrospective study. For each case, IMPT plans were generated using multiple field optimisation (MFO) technique (two fields) with XiO treatment planning system (TPS), whereas RapidArc plans were generated using double-arc technique (two full arcs) with Eclipse TPS. IMPT and RapidArc plans were optimised for a total prescription dose of 79.2 Gy (relative biological effectiveness (RBE)) and 79.2 Gy, respectively, using identical dose-volume constraints. IMPT and RapidArc plans were then normalised such that at least 95% of the planning target volume (PTV) received the prescription dose. RESULTS: The mean and maximum PTV doses were comparable in IMPT plans (80.1 +/- 0.3 Gy (RBE) and 82.6 +/- 1.0 Gy (RBE) respectively) and RapidArc plans (80.3 +/- 0.3 Gy and 82.8 +/- 0.6 Gy respectively) with P = 0.088 and P = 0.499 respectively. The mean doses of the rectum and bladder were found to be significantly lower in IMPT plans (16.9 +/- 5.8 Gy (RBE) and 17.5 +/- 5.4 Gy (RBE) respectively) when compared to RapidArc plans (41.9 +/- 5.7 Gy and 32.5 +/- 7.8 Gy respectively) with P < 0.000 and P < 0.000 respectively. For the rectum, IMPT produced lower V30 (21.0 +/- 9.6% vs. 68.5 +/- 10.0%; P < 0.000), V50 (14.3 +/- 5.8% vs. 45.0 +/- 10.0%; P < 0.000) and V70 (6.9 +/- 3.4% vs. 12.8 +/- 3.6%; P < 0.000) compared to RapidArc. For the bladder, IMPT produced lower V30 (23.2 +/- 7.0% vs. 50.9 +/- 15.6%; P < 0.000) and V50 (16.6 +/- 5.4% vs. 25.1 +/- 9.6%; P = 0.001), but similar V70 (9.7 +/- 3.5% vs. 10.5 +/- 4.2%; P = 0.111) compared to RapidArc. RapidArc produced lower mean dose for both the right femoral head (19.5 +/- 4.2 Gy vs. 27.4 +/- 4.5 Gy (RBE); P < 0.000) and left femoral head (18.0 +/- 4.3 Gy vs. 28.0 +/- 5.6 Gy (RBE); P < 0.000). Both IMPT and RapidArc produced comparable bladder normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) (0.6 +/- 0.2% vs. 0.5 +/- 0.2%; P = 0.152). The rectal NTCP was found to be lower using IMPT (0.8 +/- 0.7%) than using RapidArc (1.7 +/- 0.7%) with P < 0.000. CONCLUSION: Both IMPT and RapidArc techniques provided comparable mean and maximum PTV doses. For the rectum, IMPT produced better dosimetric results in the low-, medium- and high-dose regions and lower NTCP compared to RapidArc. For the bladder, the NTCP and dosimetric results in the high-dose region were comparable in both sets of plans, whereas IMPT produced better dosimetric results in the low- and medium-dose regions.
27607180	Unexpected Detection of Urinary Bladder Cancer on Dual Phase 18F-NaF PET/CT in a Patient With Back Pain.	A 72-year-old man underwent F-NaF PET/CT to evaluate causes of lower back pain. The PET images revealed multiple foci of increased activity in several vertebral bodies, which might account for the patient's symptoms. In addition, the CT image revealed partially calcified soft tissue mass in the posterior wall of the urinary bladder, which was photopenic relative to the radioactive urine on early PET images but became intense on delayed PET images. The diagnosis of transitional cell carcinoma was made pathologically after a transurethral resection of the mass.
27607159	Clinical Significance of Quantitative 123I-MIBG SPECT/CT Analysis of Pheochromocytoma and Paraganglioma.	PURPOSE: This retrospective study compared the diagnostic performances of quantitative versus visual analyses of I-MIBG scintigraphy in patients with suspected pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma (PPGL). MATERIALS AND METHODS: SPECT images were obtained 6 and/or 24 h after MIBG injection from 68 patients with clinically suspected PPGL, with attenuation correction by low-dose unenhanced CT. Planar images were also obtained at each time point. SUVs of retroperitoneal tumors, including PPGLs, and physiological uptake by normal organs were measured using the SPECT images. The diagnostic performance of the quantitative assessment in differentiating PPGLs from other lesions or normal adrenal glands was assessed using receiver operating characteristic analysis. The planar scans and 6-h and 24-h SPECT/CT images were also assessed visually. RESULTS: PPGLs showed a significantly higher SUVmax (mean +/- SD = 9.97 +/- 3.86) than other retroperitoneal lesions (3.85 +/- 1.51) or normal adrenal glands (3.91 +/- 1.20). At an optimal cut-off of 6.57, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of the quantitative assessment for 6-h SPECT/CT in differentiating PPGLs was 78.6%, 96.3%, and 92.6%, respectively; the area under the curve was 0.878. The diagnostic performance did not significantly differ between the quantitative and visual analyses, but the specificity of the former tended to be higher at 6 h (96.3% vs. 90.7%) and at 24 h (91.2% vs. 82.4%). CONCLUSIONS: The specificity, but not the sensitivity, of the quantitative approach was higher than that of visual assessment in differentiating PPGLs from other retroperitoneal pathologies and from physiological uptake in the normal adrenal gland.
27744452	Ginkgolide B Inhibits Human Bladder Cancer Cell Migration and Invasion Through MicroRNA-223-3p.	BACKGROUND/AIMS: Ginkgolide B (GB) is currently used as an anticancer drug for treatment of some malignant cancers. However, whether it may have therapeutic effects on bladder cancer remains unknown. Here, we studied the effects of GB on bladder cancer cells. METHODS: Bladder cells were treated with different doses of GB, and the effects on ZEB1 and microRNA-223-3p (miR-223-3p) were analyzed by RT-qPCR and/or Western blot. Prediction of a regulatory relationship between miR-93 and 3'-UTR of Beclin-1 mRNA was performed by a bioinformatics algorithm and confirmed by a dual luciferase reporter assay. RESULTS: We found that GB dose-dependently decreased ZEB1 protein, but not mRNA, in bladder cancer cells, resulting in suppression of cell invasion. Moreover, in bladder cancer cells, GB dose-dependently decreased the levels of miR-223-3p, which suppressed the protein translation of ZEB1 through binding to 3'-UTR of ZEB1 mRNA. Overexpression of miR-223-3p decreased ZEB1 protein, while depletion of miR-223-3p increased ZEB1 protein in bladder cancer cells. CONCLUSION: GB inhibits bladder cancer cell invasiveness through suppressing ZEB1 protein translation via upregulating miR-223-3p.
27743530	Targeting fibroblast growth factor receptors and immune checkpoint inhibitors for the treatment of advanced bladder cancer: New direction and New Hope.	Bladder cancer is one of the leading causes of death in Europe and the United States. About 25% of patients with bladder cancer have advanced disease (muscle-invasive or metastatic disease) at presentation and are candidates for systemic chemotherapy. In the setting of metastatic disease, use of cisplatin-based regimens improves survival. However, despite initial high response rates, the responses are typically not durable leading to recurrence and death in the vast majority of these patients with median overall survival of 15months and a 5-year survival rate of 10%. Furthermore, unfit patients for cisplatin have no standard of care for first line therapy in advance disease Most second-line chemotherapeutic agents tested have been disappointing. Newer targeted drugs and immunotherapies are being studied in the metastatic setting, their usefulness in the neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings is also an intriguing area of ongoing research. Thus, new treatment strategies are clearly needed. The comprehensive evaluation of multiple molecular pathways characterized by The Cancer Genome Atlas project has shed light on potential therapeutic targets for bladder urothelial carcinomas. We have focused especially on emerging therapies in locally advanced and metastatic urothelial carcinoma with an emphasis on immune checkpoints inhibitors and FGFR targeted therapies, which have shown great promise in early clinical studies.
27737963	Long-term single-institute experience with trimodal bladder-preserving therapy with proton beam therapy for muscle-invasive bladder cancer.	OBJECTIVE: We retrospectively elucidated the oncological outcomes, prognostic factors and toxicities of proton beam therapy in trimodal bladder-preserving therapy for muscle-invasive bladder cancer at our institution. METHODS: From 1990 to 2015, 70 patients with cT2-3N0M0 muscle-invasive bladder cancer underwent trimodal bladder-preserving therapy consisting of maximal transurethral resection of the bladder tumor, small pelvis photon irradiation, intra-arterial chemotherapy and proton beam therapy. The overall survival rate, progression-free survival rate, time to progression, predictive factors for progression and toxicities were analyzed. Progression was defined as when muscle-invasive recurrence, distant metastasis or upper urinary tract recurrence was observed. RESULTS: The patients' median age was 65 (range 36-85) years. The median follow-up period was 3.4 (range 0.6-19.5) years. The 5-year cumulative overall survival rate, progression-free survival rate and time to progression rate were 82%, 77%, and 82%, respectively. In univariate and multivariate analyses, tumor multiplicity and tumor size (>/=5 cm) were significant and independent factors associated with progression (hazard ratio 3.5, 95% confidence interval 1.1-12; hazard ratio 5.0, 95% confidence interval 1.3-17; P < 0.05 for all). As for toxicity, 26 (18%) patients had grade 3-4 acute hematologic toxicities and 2 (3%) patients had grade 3 late genitourinary toxicity. No patient had to discontinue the treatment due to acute toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: Our bladder-preserving therapy with proton beam therapy was well tolerated and achieved a favorable mortality rate. Tumor multiplicity and tumor size were important risk factors for progression. Our findings indicate that this therapy can be an effective treatment option for selected muscle-invasive bladder cancer patients.
27737712	Long term disease free survival with multimodal therapy in small cell bladder cancer.	BACKGROUND: Small cell bladder cancer (SCBC) is an aggressive subtype accounting for less than 1 % of all bladder malignancies associated with rapid progression, early metastases formation and high mortality rates. CASE PRESENTATION: We present an unusual long term disease free survival of a 60 year-old man who was diagnosed with SCBC two and a half years ago. He underwent four cycles of cisplatin/etoposide chemotherapy as well as a prophylactic whole-brain radiotherapy followed by a radical cystoprostatectomy and ileal neobladder with extended pelvic lymphadenectomy. Since 33 months the patient is now recurrence-free. CONCLUSION: In this case report, we were able to show that early multimodal therapy results in long term disease free survival, thus we highly recommend neoadjuvant chemotherapy as a part of multimodal management of a primary metastases-free, localized and surgically resectable SCBC.
27735841	The Fascinating Effects of Baicalein on Cancer: A Review.	Cancer is one of the leading causes of death worldwide and a major global health problem. In recent decades, the rates of both mortality and morbidity of cancer have rapidly increased for a variety of reasons. Despite treatment options, there are serious side effects associated with chemotherapy drugs and multiple forms of drug resistance that significantly reduce their effects. There is an accumulating amount of evidence on the pharmacological activities of baicalein (e.g., anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antiviral, and antitumor effects). Furthermore, there has been great progress in elucidating the target mechanisms and signaling pathways of baicalein's anti-cancer potential. The anti-tumor functions of baicalein are mainly due to its capacities to inhibit complexes of cyclins to regulate the cell cycle, to scavenge oxidative radicals, to attenuate mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK), protein kinase B (Akt) or mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) activities, to induce apoptosis by activating caspase-9/-3 and to inhibit tumorinvasion and metastasis by reducing the expression of matrix metalloproteinase-2/-9 (MMP-2/-9). In this review, we focused on the relevant biological mechanisms of baicalein involved in inhibiting various cancers, such as bladder cancer, breast cancer, and ovarian cancer. Moreover, we also summarized the specific mechanisms by which baicalein inhibited the growth of various tumors in vivo. Taken together, baicalein may be developed as a potential, novel anticancer drug to treat tumors.
27734426	The Rate of Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy Use in Muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer and The Approach of Urologists in Turkey.	PURPOSE: To investigate the proportion of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) use in patients with muscle invasive bladder cancer before radical cystectomy and the approach of urologists to this subject. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We invited 242 urologists during the 12th International Urooncology Congress in Turkey to answer a self-administered questionnaire. The questionnaire included questions related to radical cystectomy, lymph node dissection and neoadjuvant chemotherapy that had been performed in patients with muscle invasive bladder cancer by the urologist. RESULTS: The median number of radical cystectomy operations was 20 per year. 122 (50.5 %) of 242 urologists had used neoadjuvant chemotherapy for the treatment of muscle invasive bladder cancer before radical cystectomy. The mean rate of neoadjuvant chemotherapy use by these urologists (n=122) was 28.46 %. The most common reasons for not using neoadjuvant chemotherapy by urologists in Turkey were as follows: (i) neoadjuvant chemotherapy might lead to a decrease in the cure rate of radical cystectomy due to delayed surgery (ii) complication rate of radical cystectomy might be elevated and the surgery might be complicated by NAC use. CONCLUSION: Although the European Association of Urology (EAU) guidelines panel on muscle invasive bladder cancer recommends using NAC in T2-T4a bladder, the rate of neoadjuvant chemotherapy use was still found to be low in our country because urologists have concerns about adverse effects NAC on radical cystectomy.&nbsp.
27730323	Feasibility of electronic nose technology for discriminating between head and neck, bladder, and colon carcinomas.	Electronic nose (e-nose) technology has the potential to detect cancer at an early stage and can differentiate between cancer origins. Our objective was to compare patients who had head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) with patients who had colon or bladder cancer to determine the distinctive diagnostic characteristics of the e-nose. Feasibility study An e-nose device was used to collect samples of exhaled breath from patients who had HNSCC and those who had bladder or colon cancer, after which the samples were analyzed and compared. One hundred patients with HNSCC, 40 patients with bladder cancer, and 28 patients with colon cancer exhaled through an e-nose for 5 min. An artificial neural network was used for the analysis, and double cross-validation to validate the model. In differentiating HNSCC from colon cancer, a diagnostic accuracy of 81 % was found. When comparing HNSCC with bladder cancer, the diagnostic accuracy was 84 %. A diagnostic accuracy of 84 % was found between bladder cancer and colon cancer. The e-nose technique using double cross-validation is able to discriminate between HNSCC and colon cancer and between HNSCC and bladder cancer. Furthermore, the e-nose technique can distinguish colon cancer from bladder cancer.
27725446	CYP2A13 Genetic Polymorphisms in Relation to the Risk of Bladder Cancer in Japanese Smokers.	Tobacco-specific nitrosamines including 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK) and N-nitrosonornicotine (NNN), which can be activated by the metabolic enzyme CYP2A13, are potent procarcinogens. Smoking plays a role in carcinogenesis in the human bladder, which expresses CYP2A13 at a relatively high level. Numerous genetic polymorphisms of CYP2A13 causing amino acid substitution might reduce CYP2A13 metabolic activity toward NNK and NNN, resulting in decreased susceptibility to bladder cancer. The aim of this study was to reveal any association between bladder cancer development and CYP2A13 genetic polymorphisms in Japanese smokers. The CYP2A13 genotype of each subject (163 bladder cancer patients and 161 controls) was determined by next-generation sequencing (NGS) of the full CYP2A13 gene. All samples were genotyped for five CYP2A13 variant alleles (CYP2A13*2, *3, *4, *6, *7). Based on biological logistic regression, the odds ratio (95% confidence interval) for the CYP2A13*1/*2 genotype was 0.34 (0.17-0.69). Thus, CYP2A13 genetic polymorphisms might play important roles in the development of bladder cancer in Japanese smokers.
27721403	CXCL2/MIF-CXCR2 signaling promotes the recruitment of myeloid-derived suppressor cells and is correlated with prognosis in bladder cancer.	The accumulation of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) has been observed in solid tumors and is correlated with tumor progression; however, the underlying mechanism is still poorly understood. In this study, we identified a mechanism by which tumor cells induce MDSC accumulation and expansion in the bladder cancer (BC) microenvironment via CXCL2/MIF-CXCR2 signaling. Elevated expression of CXCL2 and MIF and an increased number of CD33+ MDSCs were detected in BC tissues, and these increases were significantly associated with advanced disease stage and poor patient prognosis (P<0.01). A positive association was observed between CXCL2 or MIF expression and the number of tumor-infiltrating CD33+ MDSCs (P<0.01). Subsequently, we demonstrated that CD45+CD33+CD11b+HLA-DR- MDSCs from fresh BC tissues displayed high levels of suppressive molecules, including Arg1, iNOS, ROS, PDL-1 and P-STAT3, and stronger suppression of T-cell proliferation. Interestingly, these CD45+CD33+CD11b+HLA-DR- MDSCs exhibited increased CXCR2 expression compared with that in peripheral blood from BC patients or healthy controls (P<0.05). Chemotaxis assay revealed that bladder cancer cell line J82 induced MDSC migration via CXCL2/MIF-CXCR2 signaling in vitro. Mechanistic studies demonstrated that J82-induced MDSC trafficking and CXCR2 expression were associated with increased phosphorylation of p38, ERK and p65. Conversely, inhibition of the phosphorylation of p38, ERK or p65 decreased J82-induced MDSC trafficking and CXCR2 expression. CXCL2/MIF-stimulated activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase and nuclear factor kappa B pathways in MDSCs was MyD88 dependent. Overall, our results identify the CXCL2/MIF-CXCR2 axis as an important mediator in MDSC recruitment and as predictors and potential therapeutic targets in BC patients.
27721291	Metastatic malignant melanoma of the urinary bladder: A case report and review of the literature.	Metastatic bladder tumors constitute <5% of all bladder tumors and metastatic malignant melanoma of the urinary bladder is very rare. We present a case report of a metastatic malignant melanoma of the urinary bladder. A 70-year-old woman without any apparent significant clinical history was admitted to the Department of Urology for gross hematuria. Microscopic findings of the transurethral resection specimen revealed fascicles, sheets, and diffuse areas composed of oval and fusiform cells with focal pigmentation. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that the tumor cells were positive for human melanoma black-45, Melan-A, and S100, and negative for pancytokeratin. Subsequently, we contacted the patient and learned that she was admitted to the Department of Ophthalmology for painless and progressive visual field loss 15 years ago. She had been diagnosed with a primary ocular (uveal) melanoma. A detailed patient history coupled with histological and immunohistochemical findings were necessary to make the final diagnosis of metastatic melanoma.
27720312	The surgical management of patients with clinical stage T4 bladder cancer: A single institution experience.	INTRODUCTION: Patients with clinical T4 (cT4) bladder cancer (BCa) infrequently undergo radical cystectomy (RC). We investigated the reliability of preoperative clinical staging, perioperative and survival outcomes in patients treated with RC due to cT4a-b BCa disease at a single tertiary care institution. METHODS: The study relied on 917 BCa patients treated with RC and pelvic lymph node dissection (PLND) at a single institution between January 1995 and December 2012. We compared the accuracy of the clinical assessment with final pathology results. Moreover, we evaluated perioperative outcomes, complication rates and survival after surgery. RESULTS: The median follow-up was 62 months. Overall, 74 (8.1%) patients presented cT4 stage at preoperative evaluation. Conversely, a pathological T4 disease was confirmed only in 68.9% patients staged initially as cT4. No differences were recorded in complications, 30 days readmission or 30 days death rates between cT1-T3 vs. cT4a vs. cT4b (p > 0.1). At multivariable Cox regression analyses predicting cancer specific mortality, clinical T4 stage vs. clinical T1-2, clinical T3 stage vs. clinical T1-2 and age were predictors of worst survival after RC (all p < 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: We recorded poor concordance between preoperative imaging and pathology in cT4 patients. No differences in major perioperative outcomes and acceptable survival expectancies were reported in patients treated for cT4 disease.
27718498	The activity of class I, II, III and IV alcohol dehydrogenase isoenzymes and aldehyde dehydrogenase in the sera of bladder cancer patients.	OBJECTIVES: Studies on alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity in the sera of patients with malignant neoplasms show that cancer cells in many organs may release ADH isoenzymes into the blood. The aim of this study was to investigate the differences in the activity of ADH isoenzymes and ALDH in the sera of patients with bladder cancer (BCa), and with different grades of the disease. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Blood samples were taken from 39 patients with BCa (15 patients with low-grade and 24 with high-grade BCa) and from 60 healthy subjects. Class III and IV of ADH and total ADH activity were measured using the photometric method, while class I and II ADH and ALDH activity using the fluorometric method with class-specific fluorogenic substrates. RESULTS: The activity of the class I ADH isoenzyme and total ADH was significantly higher in the sera of BCa patients as compared to control group. Analysis of ALDH activity did not show statistically significant differences between the tested groups. Significantly higher total activity of ADH in comparison to control was found in both, low-grade and high-grade BCa group. The activity of ADH class I was also significantly higher in high-grade BCa group when compared to low-grade patients and controls. CONCLUSION: The increase of total ADH activity in the sera of BCa patients seems to be caused by isoenzymes released from cancerous cells. The higher activity of ADH I probably resulted from metastatic tumors as significant increase was detected only in the sera of high-grade bladder cancer patients.
27717437	Management of Urethral Recurrences: Urothelial and Nonurothelial.	This article discusses the diagnostic and therapeutic options in the management of urethral cancer recurrence in patients treated with urethral sparing cystectomy as well as those who had urethral preservation following primary urethral carcinoma.
27714486	Optimized workflow and imaging protocols for whole-body oncologic PET/MRI.	Although PET/MRI has the advantages of a simultaneous acquisition of PET and MRI, high soft-tissue contrast of the MRI images, and reduction of radiation exposure, its low profitability and long acquisition time are significant problems in clinical settings. Thus, MRI protocols that meet oncological purposes need to be used in order to reduce examination time while securing detectability. Currently, half-Fourier acquisition single-shot turbo spin echo and 3D-T1 volumetric interpolated breath-hold examination may be the most commonly used sequences for whole-body imaging due to their shorter acquisition time and higher diagnostic accuracy. Although there have been several reports that adding diffusion weighted image (DWI) to PET/MRI protocol has had no effect on tumor detection to date, in cases of liver, kidney, bladder, and prostate cancer, the use of DWI may be beneficial in detecting lesions. Another possible option is to scan each region with different MRI sequences instead of scanning the whole body using one sequence continuously. We herein report a workflow and imaging protocols for whole-body oncologic PET/MRI using an integrated system in the clinical routine, designed for the detection, for example by cancer screening, of metastatic lesions, in order to help future users optimize their workflow and imaging protocols.
27712593	Knockdown of UBE2T Inhibits Osteosarcoma Cell Proliferation, Migration, and Invasion by Suppressing the PI3K/Akt Signaling Pathway.	Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2T (UBE2T), a member of the E2 family, was found to be overexpressed in a great many cancers such as bladder cancer, lung cancer, and prostate cancer. However, there have been no reports on the role of UBE2T in osteosarcoma. In this study, we tried to make the effects of UBE2T on osteosarcoma clear. The study results showed that UBE2T was overexpressed in osteosarcoma tissues and cell lines. Moreover, UBE2T knockdown inhibited osteosarcoma cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. We also observed that UBE2T downregulation could suppress the activity of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Therefore, we concluded that UBE2T exerted its inhibitory effects on osteosarcoma cells via suppressing the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. These findings indicated that UBE2T may be a potential therapeutic target for osteosarcoma treatment.
27706668	Enhancement of dendritic cells with melanoma-associated antigen 3 for inducing cytotoxicity by cytotoxic T lymphocytes on bladder cancer BIU-87 cells.	To determine the cytotoxic effect of lymphocytes activated by melanoma-associated antigen 3 (MAGE-3)-sensitized dendritic cells (DCs) on BIU-87 tumor cells, and to evaluate the possibility of MAGE-3-peptide-pulsed DCs as a vaccine in bladder cancer immunotherapy, the proliferation of T cells and the activity of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) were examined by the MTT method. CTLs were induced by MAGE-3-sensitized DCs, or by ovalbumin (OVA) peptide and non-sensitized DCs as controls, respectively. The results indicated that MAGE-3-sensitized DCs have the ability to promote the proliferation of T cells as well as the cytotoxic activity of CTLs on bladder cancer cells in comparison with OVA peptide and non-sensitized DCs. In other words, DCs sensitized by the MAGE-3 antigen peptide could obviously upregulate the proliferation of T cells, which resulted in the growth inhibition of bladder cancer BIU-87 cells. In addition, MAGE-3-sensitized DCs played an important role in inhibiting the growth of human BIU-87 tumor xenografts in nude mice.
27698324	Cytomorphologic and Immunophenotypic Profile of a Cohort of Small Cell Carcinoma of the Urinary Bladder.	BACKGROUND: The incidence of primary small cell carcinoma (SCC) of the urinary bladder is extremely rare. We sought to analyze the cytologic and immunophenotypic features of SCC of the urinary bladder in urine and reassert the importance of cytologic examination of urine specimens for diagnosis of this tumor. METHODS: We studied the clinical and cytomorphologic features in the presurgical urine specimens (4 voided urine and 2 bladder-washing specimens) of histopathologically and immunohistochemically proven cases of SCC of the urinary bladder. RESULTS: There were 6 cases, all males, with an age range of 61-81 years. On cytologic and histopathologic examination, typical SCC morphology was present in all cases. On immunohistochemistry, synaptophysin and CD56 were positive in all 6 cases, while chromogranin was positive in only 3. The Ki-67 labeling index ranged from 30 to 100%. CONCLUSIONS: SCC should be kept in the differential diagnosis, when high-grade urothelial carcinoma is suspected in a urine cytology specimen, as this distinction has important therapeutic and prognostic implications. Therefore, a careful observation and, if required, the use of an appropriate immunocytochemical panel on the presurgical urine specimens can lead to a correct diagnosis.
27697092	miR-935 Promotes Liver Cancer Cell Proliferation and Migration by Targeting SOX7.	Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common cancer in the world. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a type of small noncoding RNA that can regulate the expression of target genes under physiological and pathophysiological conditions. Aberrant expression of microRNA-935 (miR-935) has been reported in cancer studies. However, its expression and mechanism in HCC remain unclear. In our study, we found that miR-935 was upregulated in liver cancer tissues and cells. Overexpression of miR-935 in liver cells promoted cell proliferation, tumorigenesis, and cell cycle progression, whereas inhibition of miR-935 reduced cell proliferation, tumorigenicity, and cell cycle progression. These changes in the properties of HCC cells were associated with upregulation of two well-known cellular G1/S transitional regulators: cyclin D1 and c-Myc. Additionally, we identified SOX7 as a direct target of miR-935. Overexpression of miR-935 inhibited SOX7 expression but promoted the levels of c-Myc and cyclin D1, which promotes cell proliferation and tumorigenesis; knockdown of miR-935 increased SOX7 level and inhibited c-Myc and cyclin D1 expression, whereas SOX7 silencing could promote cell proliferation, cell motility, and invasiveness in vitro. Our findings suggest that miR-935 represents a biomarker and a potential new target in HCC progression by suppressing SOX7 expression.
27694794	Long Non-Coding RNA (LncRNA) Urothelial Carcinoma Associated 1 (UCA1) Increases Multi-Drug Resistance of Gastric Cancer via Downregulating miR-27b.	BACKGROUND In this study, we aimed to investigate the association between UCA1 and miR-27b in gastric cancer and further study their involvement in multi-drug resistance (MDR) of gastric cancer. MATERIAL AND METHODS The microarray data of dysregulated lncRNAs in gastric cancer tissues was retrieved in the GEO dataset. QRT-PCR analysis was performed to assess UCA1 expression based on 28 paired cancerous and peritumoral normal tissues. The human gastric cancer cell line SGC-7901, and SGC-7901 derived Adriamycin (doxorubicin) resistant SGC-7901/ADR, cisplatin resistant SGC-7901/DDP, and 5-FU resistant SGC-7901/FU cells were used as in vitro cell models to assess the effect of UCA1 and miR-27b on MDR. RESULTS UCA1 was significantly upregulated in the cancerous tissues and its expression was negatively correlated with miR-27b expression level. Inhibition of UCA1 significantly restored miR-27b expression in MDR gastric cancer cells. UCA1 knockdown and miR-27b overexpression reduced IC50 of ADR, DDP, and 5-FU in SGC-7901/ADR cells and increased ADR induced cell apoptosis. UCA1 overexpression and miR-27b inhibition increased the IC50 of ADR, DDP, and 5-FU in SGC-7901 cells and reduced ADR induced cell apoptosis. Western blot analysis showed that UCA1 knockdown and miR-27b overexpression also decreased anti-apoptotic protein BCL-2 and increased apoptotic protein cleaved caspase-3. CONCLUSIONS UCA1 is negatively correlated with miR-27b expression in gastric cancer tissue. Knockdown of UCA1 restored miR-27b expression in gastric cancer cells. The UCA1-miR-27b axis was involved in regulation of chemosensitivity of gastric cancer cells.
27694174	Evaluation of Prostate Cancer with Radiolabeled Amino Acid Analogs.	Conventional imaging of prostate cancer has limitations related to the frequently indolent biology of the disease. PET is a functional imaging method that can exploit various aspects of tumor biology to enable greater detection of prostate cancer than can be provided by morphologic imaging alone. Radiotracers that are in use or under investigation for targeting salient features of prostate cancer include those directed to glucose, choline, acetate, prostate-specific membrane antigen, bombesin, and amino acids. The tumor imaging features of this last class of radiotracers mirror the upregulation of transmembrane amino acid transport that is necessary in carcinomas because of increased amino acid use for energy requirements and protein synthesis. Natural and synthetic amino acids radiolabeled for PET imaging have been investigated in prostate cancer patients. Early work with naturally occurring amino acid-derived radiotracers, such as l-11C-methionine and l-1-11C-5-hydroxytryptophan, demonstrated promising results, including greater sensitivity than 18F-FDG for intraprostatic and extraprostatic cancer detection. However, limitations with naturally occurring amino acid-derived compounds, including metabolism of the radiotracer itself, led to the development of synthetic amino acid radiotracers, which are not metabolized and therefore more accurately reflect transmembrane amino acid transport. Of the synthetic amino acid-derived PET radiotracers, anti-1-amino-3-18F-fluorocyclobutane-1-carboxylic acid (18F-FACBC or 18F-fluciclovine) has undergone the most promising translation to human use, including the availability of simplified radiosynthesis. Several studies have indicated advantageous biodistribution in the abdomen and pelvis with little renal excretion and bladder activity-characteristics beneficial for prostate cancer imaging. Studies have demonstrated improved lesion detection and diagnostic performance of 18F-fluciclovine in comparison with conventional imaging, especially for recurrent prostate cancer, although issues with nonspecific uptake limit the potential role of 18F-fluciclovine in the diagnosis of primary prostate cancer. Although work is ongoing, recently published intrapatient comparisons of 18F-fluciclovine with 11C-choline reported higher overall diagnostic performance of the former, especially for the detection of disease relapse. This review is aimed at providing a detailed overview of amino acid-derived PET compounds that have been studied for use in prostate cancer imaging.
27685836	Immune complexome analysis reveals the specific and frequent presence of immune complex antigens in lung cancer patients: A pilot study.	Cancer immunotherapies such as antibodies targeting T cell checkpoints, or adaptive tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) transfer, have been developed to boost the endogenous immune response against human malignancies. However, activation of T cells by such antibodies can lead to the risk of autoimmune diseases. Also, the selection of tumor-reactive T cells for TIL relies on information regarding mutated antigens in tumors and does not reflect other factors involved in protein antigenicity. It is therefore essential to engineer therapeutic interventions by which T cell reactivity against tumor cells is selectively enhanced (i.e., "focused cancer immunotherapy") based on tumor antigens that are specifically expressed in the tumor of a certain cancer and in many patients with this cancer. Immune complexes (ICs) are the direct and stable products of immunological recognition by humoral immunity. Here, we searched for tumor-specific IC antigens in each of five cancers (lung (n = 28), colon (n = 20), bladder (n = 20), renal cell (n = 15) and malignant lymphoma (n = 9)), by using immune complexome analysis that comprehensively identifies and profiles the constituent antigens in ICs. This analysis indicated that gelsolin and inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor heavy chains were specifically and frequently detected (at a frequency higher than 80%), and that phosphoproteins (VENTX, VCIP135) were also specifically present in the ICs of lung cancer patients. Immune complexome analysis successfully identified several tumor-specific IC antigens with high detection frequency in lung cancer patients. These specific antigens are required to validate the clinical benefit by further analysis using a large number of patients.
27683053	Integrin-linked kinase regulates cadherin switch in bladder cancer.	Cadherin switch is specific of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and is closely related to tumor cell invasion. However, the molecular mechanism that promotes the phenotypic changes remains unclear and elusive. We found that integrin-linked kinase (ILK) is a key factor involved in cadherin switch. The expression and activity of ILK are elevated in a variety of cancers but its mechanisms are not exactly understood. In this report, we studied the role and mechanism of ILK in EMT of human bladder cancer. We showed that silencing of ILK expression by small interfering RNA (siRNA) significantly abolished the nuclear translocation or the presence of markers associated with EMT like Snail, Twist, Zeb, and beta-catenin. ILK knockdown by siRNA suppressed N-cadherin expression and increased re-expression of E-cadherin in bladder cancer cells. We suggest that ILK is a major signaling factor involved in EMT. It is essential to understand the molecular mechanism of EMT in aim to possibly use it in search for new therapeutic targets.
27671517	5-Aminolevulinic acid in intraoperative photodynamic therapy of bladder cancer (results of multicenter trial).	The results of multicenter prospective trial for efficacy of combined modality treatment: transurethral resection (TUR)+photodynamic therapy (PDT) with alasens for bladder cancer are represented in the article. Trials were organized by Research Institute of Organic Intermediates and Dyes and conducted according to clinical protocol approved by Ministry of Health of Russia, at the sites of leading Russian cancer clinical centers. The trial included 45 subjects with verified diagnosis of non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer. Patients underwent TUR of bladder with simultaneous PDT as anti-relapse treatment. Alasens was administered to patients as intravesicular instillation of 3% solution in volume of 50ml with 1.5-2h exposure (prior to TUR). TUR was performed after instillation. PDT session was conducted immediately after the completion of TUR on a single occasion by means of combined local irradiation on tumor bed with diffuse irradiation on whole urinary bladder mucosa (light dose of local irradiation - 100J/cm2, diffuse irradiation - 20J/cm2). Good tolerance of the treatment was noticed, there were no complications. Among 45 patients included in the trial, 35 (78%) completed 12 month protocol follow-up without relapse. In our study PDT with alasens after TUR reported a recurrence rate of non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer for 1st year after treatment of 22%. TUR with intraoperative PDT with 5-aminolevulinic acid may offer an alternative in the treatment of non-muscle-invasive intermediate and high-risk bladder cancer.
27668704	A nonrandomized, prospective, clinical study on the impact of circulating tumor cells on outcomes of urothelial carcinoma of the bladder patients treated with radical cystectomy with or without adjuvant chemotherapy.	To investigate outcomes of urothelial carcinoma of the bladder (UCB) patients treated with radical cystectomy (RC) according to the presence of circulating tumor cells (CTC) and the administration of adjuvant chemotherapy (AC). We prospectively enrolled 226 UCB patients treated with RC without neoadjuvant chemotherapy at our institution between 2007 and 2013. Blood samples were obtained from all patients preoperatively and analyzed for CTC using the CellSearch(R) system. Platinum-based AC was administered in 50 patients (27.0%). Cox regression models evaluated the association of CTC with disease recurrence, cancer-specific and overall mortality according to AC administration. 185 patients were available for analyses. CTC were present in 41 patients (22.2%). Patients with presence of CTC received AC more frequently, compared to patients without CTC (p = 0.027). At a median follow-up of 31 months, the presence of CTC was associated with disease recurrence, cancer-specific and overall mortality (p-values < 0.001) in patients without AC administration. In patients who received AC, there was no difference in either endpoint between patients with or without presence of CTC. In multivariable analysis of patients without AC administration, the presence of CTC was an independent predictor for disease recurrence (HR: 4.9; p < 0.001), cancer-specific (HR: 4.2; p = 0.003) and overall mortality (HR: 4.2; p = 0.001). The CTC status may be implemented in decision-making regarding AC administration in UCB patients following RC. CTC measurement should be implemented in future UCB studies on systemic chemotherapy to validate our findings.
27664031	C-terminal region of Mad2 plays an important role during mitotic spindle checkpoint in fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe.	The mitotic arrest deficiency 2 (Mad2) protein is an essential component of the spindle assembly checkpoint that interacts with Cdc20/Slp1 and inhibit its ability to activate anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C). In bladder cancer cell line the C-terminal residue of the mad2 gene has been found to be deleted. In this study we tried to understand the role of the C-terminal region of mad2 on the spindle checkpoint function. To envisage the role of C-terminal region of Mad2, we truncated 25 residues of Mad2 C-terminal region in fission yeast S.pombe and characterized its effect on spindle assembly checkpoint function. The cells containing C-terminal truncation of Mad2 exhibit sensitivity towards microtubule destabilizing agent suggesting perturbation of spindle assembly checkpoint. Further, the C-terminal truncation of Mad2 exhibit reduced viability in the nda3-KM311 mutant background at non-permissive temperature. Truncation in mad2 gene also affects its foci forming ability at unattached kinetochore suggesting that the mad2-CT mutant is unable to maintain spindle checkpoint activation. However, in response to the defective microtubule, only brief delay of mitotic progression was observed in Mad2 C-terminal truncation mutant. In addition we have shown that the deletion of two beta strands of Mad2 protein abolishes its ability to interact with APC activator protein Slp1/Cdc20. We purpose that the truncation of two beta strands (beta7 and beta8) of Mad2 destabilize the safety belt and affect the Cdc20-Mad2 interaction leading to defects in the spindle checkpoint activation.
27663930	Estimating the excess lifetime risk of radiation induced secondary malignancy (SMN) in pediatric patients treated with craniospinal irradiation (CSI): Conventional radiation therapy versus helical intensity modulated radiation therapy.	PURPOSE: To quantify the risk of radiation-induced second malignancies (SMN) in pediatric patients receiving craniospinal irradiation (CSI) either with 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (Conv CSI) or tomotherapy helical intensity modulated radiation therapy (Tomo CSI). METHODS AND MATERIALS: A novel predictive model that accounts for short- and long-term carcinogenesis was incorporated into our institutional treatment planning system to quantify the lifetime risk of SMN in incidentally irradiated organs. Five pediatric patients previously treated with CSI were studied. For each case, Conv CSI and Tomo CSI plans were computed. The excess absolute number of SMN was computed for each plan for each patient. For female patients, age was varied to assess its impact. RESULTS: Tomo CSI has a much higher risk than Conv CSI for breast cancer. Tomo has a slightly increased risk for the lung, and conventional has a slightly higher risk for the thyroid. Both techniques have intermediate risks to the pancreas and stomach, and lesser risks to the bladder and rectum. For the breast, the magnitude of the absolute risks varied with age: 14.2% versus 7.4% (Tomo vs Conv) age 5; 16.9% versus 7.6% age 10, and 18.6% versus 8.0% age 15. CONCLUSIONS: Tomo has a higher risk for inducing breast and lung second cancers, and when using Tomo-based intensity modulated radiation therapy, care should be taken to avoid incidental radiation to the breast. When planning CSI, one needs to balance these cancer risks against other normal tissue effects.
27648282	Use of a prospective cohort study in the development of a bladder scanning protocol to assist in bladder filling consistency for prostate cancer patients receiving radiation therapy.	INTRODUCTION: Evidence of variations in bladder filling effecting prostate stability and therefore treatment and side-effects is well established with intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT). This study aimed to increase bladder volume reproducibility for prostate radiation therapy by implementing a bladder scanning (BS) protocol that could assist patients' bladder filling at computed tomography (CT) simulation and treatment. METHODS: Based on a retrospective review of 524 prostate cancer patients, a bladder volume of 250-350 mL was adopted as 'ideal' for achieving planning dose constraints. A prospective cohort study was conducted to assess the clinical utility of measuring patients' bladder volumes at CT simulation using an ultrasound bladder scanner (Verathon 9400 BladderScan((R))). A revised bladder preparation protocol was utilised by a bladder scan group (BS) and a non-BS group followed the standard departmental bladder preparation protocol. Time and volume data for the BS group (n = 17) were compared with the non-BS group (n = 17). RESULTS: The BS cohort had a CT bladder volume range of 221-588 mL; mean 379 mL, SD 125 mL. The non-BS group had a larger range: 184-757 mL; mean 373 mL, SD 160 mL (P = 0.9171). There was a positive correlation between CT volume and BS volume in the BS group (r = 0.797; P = 0.0002) although BS volumes were smaller: range 160-420 mL; mean 251 mL; SD 91 mL; P < 0.0001). The maximum bladder volume receiving 50 Gy (V50) from the BS group was 46.4%, mean 24.5%. The maximum bladder V50 from the non-BS group was 50.9%, mean 27.3% (P = 0.5178). Treatment data from weekly cone beam CT scans were also compared over 6 weeks. They were assessed as being a pass if bladder and bowel requirements were acceptable. The BS group proceeded to treatment on the basis of a pass 92.7% of the time, whereas the pass rate for non-BS group was 75%; difference 17.7% (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: The BS is a useful tool for achieving consistent, appropriately sized bladder volumes in prostate cancer patients.
27647456	Deformable image registration for adaptive radiotherapy with guaranteed local rigidity constraints.	BACKGROUND: Deformable image registration (DIR) is a key component in many radiotherapy applications. However, often resulting deformations are not satisfying, since varying deformation properties of different anatomical regions are not considered. To improve the plausibility of DIR in adaptive radiotherapy in the male pelvic area, this work integrates a local rigidity deformation model into a DIR algorithm. METHODS: A DIR framework is extended by constraints, enforcing locally rigid deformation behavior for arbitrary delineated structures. The approach restricts those structures to rigid deformations, while surrounding tissue is still allowed to deform elastically. The algorithm is tested on ten CT/CBCT male pelvis datasets with active rigidity constraints on bones and prostate and compared to the Varian SmartAdapt deformable registration (VSA) on delineations of bladder, prostate and bones. RESULTS: The approach with no rigid structures (REG0) obtains an average dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 0.87 +/- 0.06 and a Hausdorff-Distance (HD) of 8.74 +/- 5.95 mm. The new approach with rigid bones (REG1) yields a DSC of 0.87 +/- 0.07, HD 8.91 +/- 5.89 mm. Rigid deformation of bones and prostate (REG2) obtains 0.87 +/- 0.06, HD 8.73 +/- 6.01 mm, while VSA yields a DSC of 0.86 +/- 0.07, HD 10.22 +/- 6.62 mm. No deformation grid foldings are observed for REG0 and REG1 in 7 of 10 cases; for REG2 in 8 of 10 cases, with no grid foldings in prostate, an average of 0.08 % in bladder (REG2: no foldings) and 0.01 % inside the body contour. VSA exhibits grid foldings in each case, with an average percentage of 1.81 % for prostate, 1.74 % for bladder and 0.12 % for the body contour. While REG1 and REG2 keep bones rigid, elastic bone deformations are observed with REG0 and VSA. An average runtime of 26.2 s was achieved with REG1; 31.1 s with REG2, compared to 10.5 s with REG0 and 10.7 s with VMS. CONCLUSIONS: With accuracy in the range of VSA, the new approach with constraints delivers physically more plausible deformations in the pelvic area with guaranteed rigidity of arbitrary structures. Although the algorithm uses an advanced deformation model, clinically feasible runtimes are achieved.
27646812	Evidence of a clinically significant interaction between warfarin and intravesical gemcitabine.	PURPOSE: A case of supratherapeutic International Normalized Ratio (INR) values and hematomas subsequent to concomitant administration of warfarin and intravesical gemcitabine is reported. SUMMARY: A 90-year-old man with bladder cancer refractory to bacillius Calmette-Guerin was diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and started on warfarin one month before starting treatment with intravesical gemcitabine 2 g (one dose per week for six weeks). Before intravesical gemcitabine was started, the patient reached consecutive therapeutic INR values. During the first five cycles of intravesical gemcitabine, the patient began to experience critically elevated INRs, which resulted in hospitalization and led to the discovery of hematomas. At hospital discharge, the decision was made to discontinue warfarin permanently given the patient's history of critically elevated INRs. Instead, enoxaparin was initiated due to the patient's history of DVT and active malignancy. Enoxaparin was started at a therapeutic, renally adjusted dosage of 60 mg subcutaneously once daily after the patient's hematomas resolved and hemoglobin level stabilized. The patient was cleared for discharge to his home after 17 days of hospitalization. He was scheduled to follow up with both urology and hematology departments regarding any further treatment for bladder cancer. A week after discharge, the patient's family decided that he would not receive the last (sixth) cycle of intravesical gemcitabine. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of an interaction between intravesical gemcitabine and warfarin. CONCLUSION: A 90-year-old man on a stable dose of warfarin experienced an increase in INR values after receiving intravesical gemcitabine for the treatment of bladder cancer.
27644620	Chronic Infections of the Urinary Tract and Bladder Cancer Risk: a Systematic Review.	Literature on the relationship between recurrent urinary tract infections and urinary bladder carcinoma risk has been inconsistent. Therefore, we carried out this systematic review of observational studies to ascertain if there is any association between chronic urinary tract infection and urinary bladder carcinoma. A total of 10 databases were searched using Boolean: CINAHL, PUBMED, Google Scholar, Medline, Science Direct, SCIRUS, Cochrane, UK PubMed central, NHS evidence and WHO-website. The search yielded an initial hit of 3,518 articles and after screening and critical appraisal, seven studies were included for this review. Four articles reported an association between chronic urinary tract infections and bladder cancer while three concluded a weak or no association at least in one gender. Main findings in this review were that most of the studies reported an association between chronic urinary tract infections and bladder cancer risk. However, inferences about the causal association between chronic urinary tract infections and bladder cancer risk should be drawn cautiously considering the methodological limitations of case-control studies included in this review. Therefore, more empirical evidence is needed to determine the causal nature of relationships between chronic urinary tract infections and bladder cancer risk.
27644609	Lack of Any Role of Systemic Inflammatory Responses in Predicting Muscle Invasion by Bladder Cancer.	BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study is to evaluate if there is a relation between platelet:lymphocyte ratio (PLR) and neutrophil lymphocyte ratio (NLR) values and tumour histology and spread in bladder cancer cases. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Bladder cancer patients undergoing TUR-M operation, with histopathologically verified diagnosis, followed-up and treated at the Private Medical Park Gaziantep Hospital between 2010 and 2015, were included in the study. NLR and PLR values were calculated using complete blood count data obtained at the first presentation. RESULTS: A total of 99 patients were included in the study, 7 (7.1%) women and 92 men (92.9%). When NLR was used as the indicator of systemic inflammatory response (SIR), it was determined that 52 (52.5%) of the patients were SIR negative and 47 (47.5%) SIR positive. No significant relation could be detected between NLR and tumour grade and muscle invasion (p=0.948, p=0.480). When PLR was used as SIR indicator, it was determined that 71 (71.7%) of the patients were found as negative and 28 (28.3%) as positive. No significant relation could be detected between PLR and tumour grade and muscle invasion (p=0.651, p=0.494). CONCLUSIONS: In our study we did not detected a relation between tumour histological behavior and PLR and NLR in bladder cancer. However, NLR and PLR are easily calculated, accessible, inexpensive and simple-to-use laboratory data from whole blood counts.
27642214	Uroplakin II Expression in Breast Carcinomas Showing Apocrine Differentiation: Putting Some Emphasis on Invasive Pleomorphic Lobular Carcinoma as a Potential Mimic of Urothelial Carcinoma at Metastatic Sites.	Uroplakin II antibody is exclusively specific for urothelial carcinoma. Nonurothelial carcinoma has not been reported to be immunoreactive for uroplakin II. In the present study, we hypothesized that breast carcinoma showing apocrine differentiation, such as invasive pleomorphic lobular carcinoma (IPLC) and apocrine carcinoma (AC), stains positive for uroplakin II. We identified 6 cases of IPLC between 2000 and 2014 by searching a computerized pathological database. We randomly selected 10 cases of each classic invasive lobular carcinoma (cILC) and AC and five cases of apocrine metaplasia (AM) that coexisted in a surgically resected breast carcinoma specimen. Immunohistochemistry was performed for uroplakin II, GATA3, CK7, CK20, and other representative markers positive for urothelial carcinoma. All cases of IPLC, AC, and AM, except those of cILC, showed immunoreactivity for uroplakin II. Poorly differentiated urothelial carcinoma sometimes shows similar morphology to IPLC with the following immunophenotype: CK7+, CK20-, GATA3+, and uroplakin II+. In the present study, this immunophenotype was observed in all the cases of IPLC and AC. Therefore, when studying metastatic, poorly differentiated carcinoma showing the aforementioned immunophenotype, we should consider the possibility of it being IPLC in addition to metastatic urothelial carcinoma.
27638828	Apoptotic effect of the selective PPARbeta/delta agonist GW501516 in invasive bladder cancer cells.	GW501516 is a selective and high-affinity synthetic agonist of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor beta/delta (PPARbeta/delta). This molecule promoted the inhibition of proliferation and apoptosis in few cancer cell lines, but its anticancer action has never been investigated in bladder tumor cells. Thus, this study was undertaken to determine whether GW501516 had antiproliferative and/or apoptotic effects on RT4 and T24 urothelial cancer cells and to explore the molecular mechanisms involved. Our results indicated that, in RT4 cells (derived from a low-grade papillary tumor), GW501516 did not induce cell death. On the other hand, in T24 cells (derived from an undifferentiated high-grade carcinoma), this PPARbeta/delta agonist induced cytotoxic effects including cell morphological changes, a decrease of cell viability, a G2/M cell cycle arrest, and the cell death as evidenced by the increase of the sub-G1 cell population. Furthermore, GW501516 triggered T24 cell apoptosis in a caspase-dependent manner including both extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways through Bid cleavage. In addition, the drug led to an increase of the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, a mitochondrial dysfunction associated with the dissipation of DeltaPsim, and the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria to the cytosol. GW501516 induced also ROS generation which was not responsible for T24 cell death since NAC did not rescue cells upon PPARbeta/delta agonist exposure. For the first time, our data highlight the capacity of GW501516 to induce apoptosis in invasive bladder cancer cells. This molecule could be relevant as a therapeutic drug for high-grade urothelial cancers.
27631965	LINC00312 inhibits the migration and invasion of bladder cancer cells by targeting miR-197-3p.	To investigate the influence of the long non-coding RNA LINC00312 on bladder cancer (BC) cell invasion and metastasis by targeting miR-197-3p. BC and corresponding adjacent tissues were collected. LINC00312 and miR-197-3p were measured, and their correlation was detected through quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). BC cell line T24 was transfected and grouped (five groups) according to different transfection conditions. A scratch test was applied to analyze cell migration, and a Transwell assay was used to test cell invasion ability. Western blotting was to measure matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, MMP-9, and the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 2 (TIMP2) protein levels. qRT-PCR indicated that LINC00312 expression was lower but miR-197-3p expression was higher in BC tissues compared with adjacent tissues; LINC00312 was negatively correlated with miR-197-3p. The migration test revealed that the downregulation of miR-197-3p and overexpression of LINC00312 inhibited cell migration and invasion abilities, while the overexpression of miR-197-3p and the upregulation of LINC00312 promoted cell migration and invasion. BC cells with downregulated miR-197-3p or upregulated LINC00312 had low MMP-2 and MMP-9 levels but high TIMP2. LINC00312 inhibited BC cell invasion and metastasis through mediating miR-197-3p.
27631264	The relationship between GSTA1, GSTM1, GSTP1, and GSTT1 genetic polymorphisms and bladder cancer susceptibility: A meta-analysis.	BACKGROUND: Previous studies have investigated the relationship between GSTA1, GSTM1, GSTP1, and GSTT1 polymorphisms and bladder cancer (BCa) susceptibility, respectively, but the results remain inconsistent. So, we conducted this meta-analysis including 79 case-control studies to explore such relationships. METHODS: We searched PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane library, Web of Science, and CNKI for relevant available studies. The pooled odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were implemented to evaluate the intensity of associations. Publication bias was estimated using Begg funnel plots and Egger regression test. To assess the stability of the results, we used sensitivity analysis with the method of calculating the results again by omitting 1 single study each time. Between-study heterogeneity was tested using the I statistic. RESULTS: No significant association between GSTA1 polymorphism and BCa susceptibility (OR = 1.05, 95% CI 0.83-1.33) was noted. Besides, meaningful association between individuals who carried the GSTM1 null genotype and increased BCa risk was detected (OR = 1.39, 95%CI 1.28-1.51). When stratified by ethnicity, significant difference was found in both Caucasian (OR = 1.39, 95% CI 1.23-1.58) and Asian populations (OR = 1.45, 95% CI 1.31-1.61). Moreover, in the subgroup analysis by source of controls (SOC), the results were significant in both hospital-based control groups (OR = 1.49, 95% CI 1.35-1.64) and population-based control groups (OR = 1.21, 95% CI = 1.07-1.37). Additionally, the analysis revealed no significant association between GSTP1 polymorphism and BCa risk (OR = 1.07, 95% CI 0.96-1.20). What is more, significant associations between GSTT1 polymorphism and BCa susceptibility were discovered (OR = 1.11, 95% CI 1.00-1.22). In the subgroup analysis by ethnicity, significant associations between GSTT1 null genotype and BCa risk were observed only in Caucasians (OR = 1.25, 95% CI 1.09-1.44). Furthermore, when stratified by SOC, no obvious relationship was found between the GSTT1 null genotype polymorphism with hospital-based population (OR = 1.11, 95% CI 0.97-1.28) or population-based population (OR = 1.10, 95% CI 0.96-1.27). CONCLUSION: This study suggested that GSTM1 null genotype and GSTT1 null genotype might be related to higher BCa risk, respectively. However, no associations were observed between GSTA1 or GSTP1 polymorphisms and BCa susceptibility.
27631180	Evaluation of miR-182/miR-100 Ratio for Diagnosis and Survival Prediction in Bladder Cancer.	BACKGROUND: Abnormal expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) plays an important role in development of several cancer types, including bladder cancer (BCa). However, the relationship between the ratio of miR-181/miR-100 and the prognosis of BCa has not been studied yet. The aim of this study was to evaluate the expression of miR-182, miR-100 and their clinical significance in BCa. METHODS: Upregulation of miR-182 and down-regulation of miR-100 were validated in tissue specimens of 134 BCa cases compared with 148 normal bladder epithelia (NBE) specimens using TaqMan-based real-time reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). The diagnostic and prognostic evaluation of miR-182, miR-100, and miR-182/miR-100 ratio was also performed. RESULTS: miR-182 was upregulated in BCa and miR-100 was down-regulated in BCa compared with NBE (P < 0.001). The areas under receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs-ROC) for miR-182 and miR-100 were 0.913 and 0.810, respectively. However, miR-182/miR-100 ratio increased the diagnostic performance, yielding an AUC of 0.981 (97.01% sensitivity and 90.54% specificity). Moreover, miR-182/miR-100 ratio was associated with pT-stage, histological grade, BCa recurrence and carcinoma in situ (P < 0.05 for all). Multivariate Cox regression analysis indicated that miR-182/miR-100 ratio was an independent prognostic factor for overall survival (Hazard ratio: 7.142; 95% CI: 2.106 - 9.891; P < 0.01). Furthermore, Kaplan-Meier curve analysis revealed that high-level of miR-182/miR-100 ratio was significantly correlated with shortened survival time for BCa patients (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: The miR-182/miR-100 ratio may serve as a novel promising biomarker for diagnosis and survival prediction in BCa. Further studies are needed to elucidate the role of miR-182/miR-100 ratio as a noninvasive diagnostic tool for BCa.
27630347	Feasibility and Safety of Laparoscopic Total Mesometrial Resection in Early-stage Cervical Cancer.	AIM: In this study we aimed to analyze the safety and feasibility of total mesometrial resection (TMMR) using the laparoscopic approach. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Laparoscopic TMMR and pelvic lymphadenectomy (LNE) was carried out in 34 patients with cervical cancer FIGO IA-IIB from April 2012-April 2016 at our tertiary center. Para-aortic LNE was performed when indicated. The main outcomes included surgical margins, a number of retrieved lymph node, intra- and post-operative complications, and recurrence rates. RESULTS: Complete microscopic tumor resection was confirmed in 33/34 (97%) patients. No conversion to open surgery was necessary. Mean intra-operative blood loss was only 65.2 ml with no blood transfusions required. Intra-operative complications occurred in 4/34 (11.8%) cases (2 bladder injuries and 2 ureteric injuries). Post-operative complications were observed in 10/35 (29.4%) cases. Only one complication occurred after 30 days (vesico-vaginal fistula). There was a loco-regional recurrence within a mean follow-up time of 25.9 months. CONCLUSION: Laparoscopic TMMR appears to be feasible and safe in the treatment of early-stage cervical cancer. Further large-scale studies are required.
27630325	Radiotherapy for Muscle-invasive Bladder Cancer in Very Elderly Patients.	AIM: The standard therapy for muscle invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) is radical total cystectomy; however, radiotherapy (RT) is performed in patients who cannot tolerate surgery due to advanced age. This study aimed to retrospectively examine whether the feasibility of concurrent use of intra-arterial chemotherapy (IAC) can be assessed using both treatment results of RT for MIBC in elderly patients and the G8 Screening Tool. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We studied 16 patients who had received intra-arterial chemoradiotherapy (IACRT) or RT alone between February 2004 and December 2012. The median age was 83 (range=75-91) years. Twelve patients had stage II and 4 had stage III disease. Ten patients received IACRT and six received RT alone. In order to determine whether the G8 score distinguishes patients for treatment with IACRT or RT alone, we calculated the cut-off of the G8 score for addition of IAC. RESULTS: The overall median G8 score was 12 (range=9-15), with scores of 13 (range=12-15) in the IACRT group and 10 (range=9-11) in the RT-alone group. The G8 score was 12 or more in all patients in the IACRT group. The median follow-up period was 35 (range=6-64) months. The 2- and 5-year overall survival rates were 80% and 66.7% in the IACRT group. The 1- and 2-year survival rates in the RT-alone group were 50% and 25%, respectively. Regarding late adverse events, only one patient experienced grade 2 genitourinary toxicity. CONCLUSION: IACRT was considered to be useful for the treatment of MIBC in elderly patients, with tolerable adverse events. Moreover, used in conjunction with age and performance status, the G8 Screening Tool is potentially applicable for determining the feasibility of performing IAC. To our knowledge, this is the first report about the correlation between G8 score and feasibility of IAC.
27630289	Association of Enhancer of Zeste 2 (EZH2) Genotypes with Bladder Cancer Risk in Taiwan.	AIM: Bladder cancer is the sixth most common cancer worldwide and its incidence is particularly high in many developed regions including southwestern Taiwan. However, the genetic contribution to the etiology of bladder cancer is not well-understood. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association of the enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) genotypes with Taiwan bladder cancer risk. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three polymorphic variants of EZH2 were analyzed regarding their association with bladder cancer risk, and three hundred and seventy-five patients with bladder cancer and same number of age- and gender-matched healthy controls recruited were genotyped by the PCR-RFLP method. RESULTS: Among the three polymorphic sites examined, the genotypes of EZH2 rs887569 (C to T), but not rs41277434 (A to C) or rs3757441 (T to C), were positively associated with bladder cancer risk (p for trend =0.0146). Individuals with the EZH2 rs887569 TT genotypes were associated with decreased cancer risk than those with wild-type CC genotype. The stratified analyses showed that EZH2 rs887569 TT genotypes had protective effects on non-smokers but obviously not on smokers. CONCLUSION: Our findings provide evidence that the T allele of EZH2 rs887569 may be associated with the lower risk of bladder cancer development, especially among non-smokers.
27629260	Metastatic Signet-Ring Cell Carcinoma of the Bladder in Cerebrospinal Fluid.	Primary bladder signet-ring cell carcinoma (SRCC) is extremely rare and associated with an aggressive course. To our knowledge, we describe the first metastatic bladder SRCC identified in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). A 68-year-old male with 1 year history of primary bladder SRCC with spinal metastasis presented with multiple falls and loss of consciousness. Brain imaging showed high signal in the frontoparietal sulci and superior cerebellum. CSF analysis was significant for increased leukocytes with monocyte predominance while protein and glucose values were within normal range. There was a hypercellular population of pleomorphic tumor cells with signet-ring morphology, similar to those seen in his diagnostic bladder biopsies. The signet-ring cells were positive for cytokeratin 7 and 20 and negative for CDX-2 and prostate-specific antigen. The patient's clinical condition rapidly deteriorated and he died less than a week after presentation. At autopsy, brain sections revealed signet ring cells in the meninges overlying the cerebrum, cerebellum, brainstem, spinal cord, and pituitary with superficial invasion of the brain parenchyma. No brain parenchymal lesions were present. This case illustrates a unique complication of primary bladder SRCC. Diagn. Cytopathol. 2017;45:73-76. (c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
27629141	Long non-coding RNA UCA1 enhances tamoxifen resistance in breast cancer cells through a miR-18a-HIF1alpha feedback regulatory loop.	Recent studies reported that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) might play critical roles in regulating endocrine resistance of breast cancer. Urothelial carcinoma-associated 1 (UCA1) is an lncRNA with an oncogenic role in breast cancer. This study aimed to investigate whether UCA1 is involved in acquired tamoxifen resistance in estrogen receptor (ER)-positive cancer cells. Our findings reveal that tamoxifen induces UCA1 upregulation in ER-positive breast cancer cells in a HIF1alpha-dependent manner. UCA1 upregulation results in significantly enhanced tamoxifen resistance. The upregulated UCA1 sponges miR-18a, which is a negative regulator of HIF1alpha. Therefore, UCA1 upregulation is further enhanced through a miR-18a-HIF1alpha feedback loop. In addition, our data also showed that miR-18a is a modulator of tamoxifen sensitivity due to its regulative effect on cell cycle proteins. miR-18a inhibitor reduced the sensitivity of MCF-7 cells to tamoxifen, while miR-18a mimics sensitized BT474 cells to tamoxifen. Therefore, miR-18a downregulation also partly contributes to acquired tamoxifen resistance in the cancer cells. These findings provide some useful information for future clinical treatment of tamoxifen resistance.
27627789	The effect of clamping the indwelling urinary catheter before removal in cervical cancer patients after radical hysterectomy.	AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To determine the effect of clamping the indwelling urinary catheter before its removal on bladder reconditioning in patients with cervical cancer after radical hysterectomy. BACKGROUND: It is suggested that indwelling urinary catheters should be clamped intermittently to fill the bladder and restore bladder function before removal. However, indwelling urinary catheter clamping showed no effect on bladder reconditioning according to some clinical studies. DESIGN: Randomised controlled study. METHODS: A total of 210 patients with cervical cancer after type C radical hysterectomy were randomised on 1:2 into two groups. In the clamping group, indwelling urinary catheters were clamped intermittently for 48 hours before removal based on a bladder-training sheet, while in the control group, the indwelling urinary catheters were removed without clamping. The primary outcome of the study was the rate of recatheterisation. The secondary outcomes included residual urine volume 24 hours after removal, incidence of urinary tract infection and duration of recatheterisation. RESULTS: Seventy patients were assigned to the clamping group and 128 to the control group with paralleled baseline characteristics. The days of the primary catheterisation (13.20 +/- 0.79 vs. 13.38 +/- 1.04) and the incidence of urinary tract infection (22.9% vs. 20.3%) had no significant differences between the two groups. Ten patients in the clamping group and 19 in the control group underwent recatheterisation, the incidence of which showed no significant difference (14.3% vs. 14.8%). The days of recatheterisation were not statistically different between the two groups (11.40 +/- 6.75 vs. 9.42 +/- 5.23). However, the residual urine volume 24 hours after removal was higher in the clamping group than that in the control group. CONCLUSIONS: Bladder recondition through indwelling urinary catheter clamping may not restore bladder function in patients after radical hysterectomy. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: As indwelling urinary catheter clamping may increase the residual urine volume after indwelling urinary catheter removal and lead to an increased nursing workload, it should not be recommended in patients with cervical cancer postoperatively.
27624110	[Inflammatory Myofibroblastic Tumor of the Bladder : A Case Report].	A 39-year-old female visited our hospital because of a bladder tumor. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging showed a retrovesical tumor in dome of the bladder. Cystoscopy showed edematous inflammatory changes of the mucosa of the bladder wall. We diagnosed her with urachal carcinoma from cystoscopy finding and image inspections. She received partial cystectomy with pelvic lymphadenectomy. Histopathological examination revealed inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor because these specimens presented positive for anaplastic lymphoma kinase in immunohistochemical studies. She has been followed up for 16 months without any evidence of local recurrence.
27619525	A simple, fast, label-free colorimetric method for detection of telomerase activity in urine by using hemin-graphene conjugates.	Telomerase, a widely accepted cancer biomarker for early cancer diagnostics, is considered as an important therapeutic target. To now, it is still a challenging subject to develop a simple and sensitive strategy for telomerase activity detection. Herein, we reported a simple colorimetric strategy for label-free quantification of human telomerase activity in urine by using hemin-graphene nanomaterial (H-GNs). H-GNs possessed tailored dispersibility in the high salt concentration and highly active biomimetic oxidation catalyst property. In this strategy, H-GNs were adjusted to coagulate to appropriate degree by carefully selecting the contained NaCl amount in the presence of original TS primer. The supernatant of the solution contained few H-GNs and showed light blue color. Under the action of telomerase, TS primer was elongated with repeating sequences of (TTAGGG)n. These negatively charged DNA enhanced individual H-GNs electrostatic repulsion and resisted salt-induced H-GNs coagulation. As a result, the supernate of the corresponding solution containing more dispersed H-GNs and showed dark blue color after chromogenic reaction. Thus, telomerase activity could be quasi-quantified by naked eye and precise quantified by UV spectrometer. The proposed method has the linear range from 100 to 2300 HeLa cells/mL and the detection limit was 60 cells/mL. It has been successfully applied to detect telomerase activity in real urine samples. Obtained results were in good agreement with the clinical diagnosis. Therefore, this colorimetric approach affords simplicity, sensitivity and reliability in telomerase activity detection.
27617552	Failure of Bacillus Calmette-Guerin therapy in non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer: Definition and treatment options.	UNLABELLED: Adjuvant intravesical bacillus Calmette- Guerin (BCG) therapy is the standard conservative adjuvant treatment and the most effective regimen for patients with high-risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). The term "BCG failure" is generally used to refer to recurrence or progression following BCG therapy, as experienced by many patients. However, the term has been defined inconsistently, and several studies have indicated that patients with a particular pattern of BCG failure have a worse prognosis. There are many different treatment options for patients who experience BCG failure. OBJECTIVE: To summarize the different current definitions of BCG failure and the present treatment options available for patients with high-risk NMIBC who experience BCG failure. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Overall, the failure rate in response to BCG is about 40-50%. Most guidelines recommend that patients failing BCG should be offered radical cystectomy (RC). The significant potential for progression specific to high-risk NMIBC leads some clinicians to argue that immediate RC should be considered the preferred first-line treatment in high-risk patients, bearing in mind that it achieves a long-term survival rate in excess of 90% with ongoing improvements in morbidity. While other salvage intravesical treatments have to be considered oncologically inferior to RC, several therapies are now available if the patient is unfit to undergo RC or if bladder preservation is the objective, and some agents have shown promise in the context of BCG failure. CONCLUSIONS: The definition, prediction, and treatment of BCG failure remain topics of debate. Patients with BCG failure need carefully selected, individualized therapy in experienced hands. Stratification of patients with BCG failure into groups can identify those with a better or worse prognosis. RC should be the selected option if a patient experiences BCG failure, but several promising intravesical salvage options are available for those cases in which the patient is unfit for surgery or bladder preservation is preferred. Currently data are still inadequate to allow formulation of definitive recommendations, and larger and higher quality studies of salvage intravesical therapies are urgently required.
27614622	The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio as a predictor of intravesical recurrence in patients with upper urinary tract urothelial carcinoma treated with radical nephroureterectomy.	BACKGROUND: The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is a marker of systemic inflammation associated with recurrence and poor prognosis in numerous cancer types. The aim of this study was to evaluate the use of the NLR as a biomarker for intravesical recurrence (IVR) in patients undergoing radical nephroureterectomy (RNU) for upper urinary tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC) for the first time. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the records of 100 patients with UTUC who had undergone RNU between 1999 and 2015 at our institution. The association between the preoperative NLR and IVR were assessed using multivariate models. RESULTS: Among the 100 patients enrolled in the study, 33 developed IVR during a median follow-up of 34 months. The receiver operating characteristic analysis revealed that the optimum cut-off value for the preoperative NLR was >3.8. A high preoperative NLR (n = 21) was associated with a significantly increased risk of lymph node involvement (p = 0.036) and IVR (p = 0.034) compared with a low preoperative NLR (n = 79). IVR-free survival in patients with a high preoperative NLR was significantly worse than that of patients with a low preoperative NLR (p = 0.018). On multivariate analysis, the preoperative NLR [hazard ratio (HR) 2.49; p = 0.015] and tumor multifocality (HR 2.96; p = 0.024) were independent risk factors predictive of IVR. CONCLUSION: In our study population of patients with UTUC who had undergone RNU the preoperative NLR was associated with a significantly increased risk of IVR, suggesting that the NRL could be a useful biomarker for predicting IVR.
27614515	[Clinical to planning target volume margins in prostate cancer radiotherapy].	The knowledge of inter- and intrafraction motion and deformations of the intrapelvic target volumes (prostate, seminal vesicles, prostatectomy bed and lymph nodes) as well as the main organs at risk (bladder and rectum) allow to define rational clinical to planning target volume margins, depending on the different radiotherapy techniques and their uncertainties. In case of image-guided radiotherapy, prostate margins and seminal vesicles margins can be between 5 and 10mm. The margins around the prostatectomy bed vary from 10 to 15mm and those around the lymph node clinical target volume between 7 and 10mm. Stereotactic body radiotherapy allows lower margins, which are 3 to 5mm around the prostate. Image-guided and stereotactic body radiotherapy with adequate margins allow finally moderate or extreme hypofractionation.
27609792	Impact of 18F-Fluciclovine PET on Target Volume Definition for Postprostatectomy Salvage Radiotherapy: Initial Findings from a Randomized Trial.	The purpose of this study was to evaluate the role of the synthetic amino acid PET radiotracer 18F-fluciclovine in modifying the defined clinical and treatment-planning target volumes in postprostatectomy patients undergoing salvage radiotherapy and to evaluate the resulting dosimetric consequences to surrounding organs at risk. Methods: Ninety-six patients were enrolled in a randomized, prospective intention-to-treat clinical trial for potential salvage radiotherapy for recurrent prostate cancer after prostatectomy. The initial treatment plan was based on the results from conventional abdominopelvic CT and MRI. The 45 patients in the experimental arm also underwent abdominopelvic 18F-fluciclovine PET/CT, and the images were registered with the conventional images to determine whether the results would modify the initial treatment plan. The 51 patients in the control arm did not undergo 18F-fluciclovine PET/CT. For each patient, the clinical and treatment-planning target volumes that would have been treated before 18F-fluciclovine registration were compared with those after registration. For organs at risk (rectum, bladder, and penile bulb), the volumes receiving 40 Gy and 65 Gy before registration were compared with those after registration. Statistical comparisons were made using the paired t test. Acute genitourinary and gastrointestinal toxicity as defined by the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group was compared between the control and experimental arms using the chi2 test. Results: In 24 cases, radiotherapy was planned to a clinical target volume consisting of the prostate bed alone (CTV) (64.8-66.6 Gy). In 21 cases, radiotherapy was planned to a clinical target volume consisting of the pelvis (CTV1) (45.0 Gy) followed by a boost to the prostate bed (CTV2) (19.8-25.2 Gy). In each case, the respective treatment-planning target volume expansion (PTV, PTV1, or PTV2) was 0.8 cm (0.6 cm posterior). With the exception of PTV2, all postregistration volumes were significantly larger than the corresponding preregistration volumes. Analysis of the rectum, bladder, and penile bulb volumes receiving 40 Gy and 60 Gy demonstrated that only the penile bulb volumes were significantly higher after registration. No significant differences in acute genitourinary or gastrointestinal toxicity were observed. Conclusion: Including information from 18F-fluciclovine PET in the treatment-planning process led to significant differences in the defined target volume, with higher doses to the penile bulb but no significant differences in rectal or bladder dose or in acute genitourinary or gastrointestinal toxicity. Longer follow-up is needed to determine the impact of 18F-fluciclovine PET on cancer control and late toxicity endpoints.
27609788	Safety, Dosimetry, and Tumor Detection Ability of 68Ga-NOTA-AE105: First-in-Human Study of a Novel Radioligand for uPAR PET Imaging.	The overexpression of urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptors (uPARs) represents an established biomarker for aggressiveness in most common malignant diseases, including breast cancer (BC), prostate cancer (PC), and urinary bladder cancer (UBC), and is therefore an important target for new cancer therapeutic and diagnostic strategies. In this study, uPAR PET imaging using a 68Ga-labeled version of the uPAR-targeting peptide (AE105) was investigated in a group of patients with BC, PC, and UBC. The aim of this first-in-human, phase I clinical trial was to investigate the safety and biodistribution in normal tissues and uptake in tumor lesions. Methods: Ten patients (6 PC, 2 BC, and 2 UBC) received a single intravenous dose of 68Ga-NOTA-AE105 (154 +/- 59 MBq; range, 48-208 MBq). The biodistribution and radiation dosimetry were assessed by serial whole-body PET/CT scans (10 min, 1 h, and 2 h after injection). Safety assessment included measurements of vital signs with regular intervals during the imaging sessions and laboratory blood screening tests performed before and after injection. In a subgroup of patients, the in vivo stability of 68Ga-NOTA-AE105 was determined in collected blood and urine. PET images were visually analyzed for visible tumor uptake of 68Ga-NOTA-AE105, and SUVs were obtained from tumor lesions by manually drawing volumes of interest in the malignant tissue. Results: No adverse events or clinically detectable pharmacologic effects were found. The radioligand exhibited good in vivo stability and fast clearance from tissue compartments primarily by renal excretion. The effective dose was 0.015 mSv/MBq, leading to a radiation burden of 3 mSv when the clinical target dose of 200 MBq was used. In addition, radioligand accumulation was seen in primary tumor lesions as well as in metastases. Conclusion: This first-in-human, phase I clinical trial demonstrates the safe use and clinical potential of 68Ga-NOTA-AE105 as a new radioligand for uPAR PET imaging in cancer patients.
27609194	Vesigenurtacel-L (HS-410) in the management of high-grade nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer.	Unlike other malignancies, the death rate of bladder cancer has not declined in several decades, highlighting the need for new treatment options. In the emerging era of immunotherapy, therapeutic cancer vaccines are an attractive option to cure, control and prevent cancer. Despite this, finding a feasible and efficacious vaccine platform has proven elusive across all malignancies. Vesigenurtacel-L is the first whole cell, allogeneic vaccine intended to treat high-grade, nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer. This type of vaccine technology for bladder cancer is novel, and has the potential to be both economically and logistically feasible.
27604669	Prospective Evaluation of Genito-Urinary Function after Laparoscopic Rectal Resection in the Elderly.	Laparoscopic anterior rectal resection with total mesorectal excision is related to sexual and urinary disorders. Anastomotic leak and neo-adjuvant radiation therapy are effective factors in worsening pelvic function. We report a series of 50 elderly (age 70) patients who underwent laparoscopic total mesorectal excision inquired about pre and post-operative genito-urinary function. Patients were interviewed preoperatively, 1 and 9 months post-operatively with validated questionnaires about sexual and urinary function and quality of life. They also underwent urofluximetric test with ultrasound measurement of the bladder remnant volume. The geriatric assessment was performed with the BARTHEL index. Urinary and sexual function slightly worsened after surgery although not significantly. Mean Gastrointestinal Quality of Life Indicator score decreased significantly from pre operative levels at 1 month from surgery. BARTHEL index did not change significantly across surgery. Maximum urinary flow, mean urinary flow, bladder residual volume worsened after surgery although not significantly. Laparoscopic anterior rectal resection with total mesorectal excision affects the genito-urinary status of elderly patients. Incidence of severe dysfunctions is similar to normal aged population.
27603401	Comparison of postoperative acute kidney injury between ileal conduit and neobladder urinary diversions after radical cystectomy: A propensity score matching analysis.	Ileal conduit and neobladder urinary diversions are frequently performed after radical cystectomy. However, complications after radical cystectomy may be different according to the type of urinary diversion. Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common complication after surgery and increases costs, morbidity, and mortality of hospitalized patients. This study was performed to compare the incidence of postoperative AKI between ileal conduit and neobladder urinary diversions after radical cystectomy.All consecutive patients who underwent radical cystectomy in 2004 to 2014 in a single tertiary care center were identified. The patients were divided into the ileal conduit and ileal neobladder groups. Preoperative variables, including demographics, cancer-related data and laboratory values, as well as intraoperative data and postoperative outcomes, including AKI, intensive care unit admission rate, and the duration of hospital stay, were evaluated between the groups. Postoperative AKI was defined according to the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcome criteria. Propensity score matching analysis was performed to reduce the influence of possible confounding variables and adjust for intergroup differences.After performing 1:1 propensity score matching, the ileal conduit and ileal neobladder groups each included 101 patients. The overall incidence of AKI after radical cystectomy was 30.7% (62 out of 202) and the incidences did not significantly differ between the groups (27 [26.7%], ileal conduit group vs 35 [34.7%], ileal neobladder group, P = 0.268). Intraoperative data, intensive care unit admission rate, and the duration of hospital stay were not significantly different between the groups.Postoperative AKI did not significantly differ between ileal conduit and neobladder urinary diversions after radical cystectomy. This finding provides additional information useful for appropriate selection of the urinary diversion type in conjunction with radical cystectomy.
27601215	Application of The Paris System to atypical urine cytology samples: correlation with histology and UroVysion(R) FISH.	OBJECTIVES: To evaluate whether atypical urine cytology cases may be stratified more objectively using The Paris System (TPS) and whether reclassified cases correlate with histology and UroVysion(R) results. METHODS: Atypical urine cytology cases subjected to UroVysion(R) testing over a period of 6 years were reviewed. Each case was reclassified according to TPS and correlated with histology and UroVysion(R) results. RESULTS: A total of 91 cases were identified; 70.3% were reclassified as 'negative for high-grade urothelial carcinoma (HGUC)' and 14.3% as 'atypical urothelial cells (AUC)'. The histological correlation was available in 45 cases. In the 'negative for HGUC' category, 67.9% had no histological evidence of malignancy, but 17.9% were diagnosed as HGUC. In the 'AUC' category, histology revealed urothelial carcinoma in 70% of the cases (of these, 71.4% were high grade). There was no histological evidence of malignancy in 30% of cases; notably, all of which were from patients under surveillance. The sensitivity and specificity of UroVysion(R) were 85.7% and 33.3% in the 'AUC' group and 62.5% and 100% in the 'negative for HGUC' group. CONCLUSIONS: The Paris System is an objective template for reporting urine cytology specimens, and is particularly useful in identifying HGUC cases and refining the category of 'AUC'.
27598027	Dogs'olfactory diagnostics applied on human species: state of the art and clinical perspectives.	Dogs'smell ability is about 10000-100000 more developed than humans' one. Dogs smell is usually exploited in forensic medicine, to find missing people and specific substances showing peculiar sensorial features. In clinic, there is the possibility to take advantage of dogs smell, which are conveniently trained, for the screening of cancers and other diseases. The common feature is the presence of molecules in organic samples that may be considered as biomarkers of a specific pathology. In cancer, scientific evidences exist about screening of melanoma, lung, breast, rectum, ovarian, prostate and bladder cancer. Instead, other pathologies manifest the presence of organic volatile compounds in biologic materials, such as spit, faeces and urine that may be studied by dogs smell in order to identify the presence of a specific disease. This review shows the state of the art of actual dogs' olfactory ability based on scientific principles and the advantages and the disadvantages of this method. The authors also reveal some potential pathologies joined by the presence of organic volatile compounds, which may be investigated by dogs smell.
27594736	New Progress of Epigenetic Biomarkers in Urological Cancer.	Urological cancers consist of bladder, kidney, prostate, and testis cancers and they are generally silenced at their early stage, which leads to the loss of the best opportunity for early diagnosis and treatment. Desired biomarkers are scarce for urological cancers and current biomarkers are lack of specificity and sensitivity. Epigenetic alterations are characteristic of nearly all kinds of human malignances including DNA methylation, histone modification, and miRNA regulation. Besides, the detection of these epigenetic conditions is easily accessible especially for urine, best target for monitoring the diseases of urinary system. Here, we summarize some new progress about epigenetic biomarkers in urological cancers, hoping to provide new thoughts for the diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of urological cancers.
27594510	A combination of p40, GATA-3 and uroplakin II shows utility in the diagnosis and prognosis of muscle-invasive urothelial carcinoma.	Recently developed antibodies against uroplakin II and DeltaNp63 (p40) show utility in diagnosing primary bladder urothelial carcinoma, although application in metastatic bladder cancer and patient outcomes has been less well defined. We evaluated these antibodies by immunostain intensity and H-score, in conjunction with GATA-3 immunoreactivity, in 89 patients with muscle-invasive urothelial carcinoma and 35 paired metastasis. The maintenance of immunoreactivity in metastatic lesions and the association to disease recurrence and survival was assessed. Bladder urothelial carcinoma showed immunoreactivity for GATA-3 in 99% (88/89), p40 in 87% (77/89) and uroplakin II in 80% (71/89) of cases, with a positive correlation between GATA-3 and uroplakin II H-score (0.44; p < 0.0001). All lesions were positive for at least one marker, reinforcing the use of these markers as a panel. In 35 patients with paired lymph node metastasis, uroplakin II and GATA-3 were retained in 90% and 75% of patients, respectively, suggesting these markers may have relatively high sensitivity in diagnosing metastatic urothelial carcinoma. High intensity p40 immunostain (3+), however, was significantly associated with reduced patient survival (p = 0.03). These results suggest that whereas GATA-3 and uroplakin II may be most useful in the diagnosis of urothelial carcinoma metastasis, p40 may be additionally suited as a prognostic marker.
27592258	Myopodin methylation is a prognostic biomarker and predicts antiangiogenic response in advanced kidney cancer.	Myopodin is a cytoskeleton protein that shuttles to the nucleus depending on the cellular differentiation and stress. It has shown tumor suppressor functions. Myopodin methylation status was useful for staging bladder and colon tumors and predicting clinical outcome. To our knowledge, myopodin has not been tested in kidney cancer to date. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether myopodin methylation status could be clinically useful in renal cancer (1) as a prognostic biomarker and 2) as a predictive factor of response to antiangiogenic therapy in patients with metastatic disease. Methylation-specific polymerase chain reactions (MS-PCR) were used to evaluate myopodin methylation in 88 kidney tumors. These belonged to patients with localized disease and no evidence of disease during follow-up (n = 25) (group 1), and 63 patients under antiangiogenic therapy (sunitinib, sorafenib, pazopanib, and temsirolimus), from which group 2 had non-metastatic disease at diagnosis (n = 32), and group 3 showed metastatic disease at diagnosis (n = 31). Univariate and multivariate Cox analyses were utilized to assess outcome and response to antiangiogenic agents taking progression, disease-specific survival, and overall survival as clinical endpoints. Myopodin was methylated in 50 out of the 88 kidney tumors (56.8 %). Among the 88 cases analyzed, 10 of them recurred (11.4 %), 51 progressed (57.9 %), and 40 died of disease (45.4 %). Myopodin methylation status correlated to MSKCC Risk score (p = 0.050) and the presence of distant metastasis (p = 0.039). Taking all patients, an unmethylated myopodin identified patients with shorter progression-free survival, disease-specific survival, and overall survival. Using also in univariate and multivariate models, an unmethylated myopodin predicted response to antiangiogenic therapy (groups 2 and 3) using progression-free survival, disease-specific, and overall survival as clinical endpoints. Myopodin was revealed hypermethylated in kidney cancer. Myopodin methylation status identified which patients showed a more aggressive clinical behavior and predicted antiangiogenic response. These observations support the clinical utility of an unmethylated myopodin as a prognostic and predictive biomarker in kidney cancer.
27591565	Antitumor activity evaluation of meso-tetra (pyrrolidine substituted) pentylporphin-mediated photodynamic therapy in vitro and in vivo.	Photodynamic therapy is a minimally invasive and promising new method in cancer treatment and has attracted considerable attention in recent years. An ideal photosensitizer is a crucial element to photodynamic therapy. In the present paper, a novel porphyrin derivative, 5, 10, 15, 20-tetrakis (5-(pyrrolidin-1-yl) pentyl) porphin (TPPP) was synthesized. Its spectroscopic and physicochemical properties, therapeutic efficacy as a photosensitizer in photodynamic therapy for human bladder cancer in vitro and in vivo were investigated. TPPP had strong absorption at 648nm (epsilon=1.75x10(4)M(-1)cm(-1)), and two fluorescence emission peaks at 652nm and 718nm. PDT with TPPP showed low dark toxicity and high phototoxicity to human bladder cancer T24 cells in vitro. In bearing T24 tumor nude mice, the growth of tumor was significantly inhibited by combining use of 5mg/kg TPPP with 100J/cm(2) (650nm, 180mW/cm(2)) laser irradiation at 3h following injection of TPPP. The antitumor effect was also confirmed with histopathological assay. The histopathological study results revealed that PDT using TPPP and 100J/cm(2) (650nm, 180mW/cm(2)) laser irradiation induced tumor cells shrunken and necrotic. These results indicate that TPPP is useful as a new photosensitizer in PDT for cancer, and deserves further investigation.
27590380	Long-term survival outcomes of laparoscopic staging surgery in treating endometrial cancer: 20 years of follow-up.	OBJECTIVE: To assess the long-term outcomes of laparoscopic staging surgery (LSS) in treating patients with endometrial carcinoma. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with endometrial cancer who underwent LSS between June 1995 and June 2014 were prospectively registered. Perioperative data, complications, disease recurrence, and long-term survival were measured. RESULTS: The study included 287 consecutive patients [mean age (+/- standard deviation), 53+/-10.4 years; mean body mass index, 27.3+/-6.7 kg/m(2)] with a median follow-up ranging from 1 to 216 months. No laparotomy conversion was recorded for any patient. The mean operative time was 207+/-63.5 minutes, and the mean blood loss was 183+/-166.7 mL. The mean numbers of pelvic nodes and para-aortic nodes removed were 18+/-4.8 and 8+/-5, respectively. More than 80% of the patients had an International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) Stage 1 disease. The overall complication rate was 3.1%, including two patients of bladder injuries and one with bowel injury intraoperatively, and postoperatively one patient with pelvic abscess, three with urinary tract infection, one with voiding difficulty, and one with bowel perforation. The overall survival rates were 94% in 5 years and 92.7% in 20 years. No port-site metastasis was recorded in this study. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with endometrial carcinoma treated by LSS had compatible or even better long-term survival outcomes and less complication in comparison with the published data, in addition to the benefits of its minimally invasive characteristics. LSS should be the treatment of choice for endometrial cancer.
27590100	[Oncologic and perioperative outcomes of robot-assisted radical cystectomy: A single-center prospective series].	INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to report perioperative and oncological outcomes of robot-assisted radical cystectomy (RARC) in a single-center series and to evaluate the impact of the experience on perioperative outcomes. METHODS: Between March 2012 and January 2016, 41 patients underwent RARC associated with extended pelvic lymphadenectomy for muscle-invasive bladder cancer. All RARC included were performed by a single-surgeon in one center. Perioperative and oncological datas were collected prospectively. Recurrence-free (RFS), overall (OS) and cancer-specific survivals (CSS) were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier Method. The impact of the experience on perioperative data was estimated using Spearman's correlation test. RESULTS: Mean age was 67,7years (+/-10.6). Most patients underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy (73.2%). Mean operative time and mean estimated blood loss were respectively 319.5minutes (+/-85.3) and 662.5mL (+/-360.9). Eight patients needed perioperative blood transfusion (19.5%). Conversion to open surgery was necessary in 3 cases (7.3%). Ileal neobladder was performed in 26.8% of the cases (54.5% being performed intracorporeal), and non-continent urinary diversion in 73.2%. Mean nodal yield was 17.7 (+/-9.3). Positive surgical margins were observed in 1 patient (2.3%). Mean length of stay was 13.2 days (+/-9.8). Postoperative complication rate was 46,3%. After a median follow-up of 16months, estimated 2 year-OS and CSS were respectively 62 and 76.1%. Estimated 2-year RFS was 67.6%. Perioperative outcomes improved with experience with a significant decrease in operative time (P=0.04) and a significant increase of nodal yield (P=0.05). CONCLUSION: In this single-center prospective study, satisfactory perioperative and oncological outcomes after RARC were observed despite the learning curve. Perioperative outcomes improved with surgeon's experience. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 4.
27589936	Perioperative change in neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio predicts the overall survival of patients with bladder cancer undergoing radical cystectomy.	OBJECTIVE: To assess the prognostic value of perioperative changes in the neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio in patients with bladder cancer undergoing radical cystectomy. METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of 323 patients who had undergone radical cystectomy at our institutions. Overall survival was assessed with the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression analysis. RESULTS: Preoperative and postoperative neutrophil-lymphocyte ratios were significantly correlated with overall survival (both P = 0.0001). Changes in perioperative neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio stratified the patients into two groups, designated favorable- and poor-risk groups, with significantly different 5-year overall survival rates (75.1% and 41.4%, respectively; P < 0.0001). Multivariate Cox regression analyses showed that the perioperative change in neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio was an independent prognostic factor for overall survival (hazard ratio 2.56, 95% confidence interval 1.75-3.73; P < 0.001). Moreover, a decrease in neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio after adjuvant chemotherapy was associated with favorable overall survival in patients with high postoperative neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (P < 0.001), indicating that neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio may be a predictive factor for the efficacy of adjuvant chemotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: Perioperative changes in neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio are significantly associated with overall survival in patients with bladder cancer undergoing radical cystectomy. Follow-up of the neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio change may be useful for the clinical management of patients after surgery.
27586407	Assessment of 10B concentration in boron neutron capture therapy: potential of image-guided therapy using 18FBPA PET.	OBJECTIVES: In boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) for cancer, the accurate estimation of 10B tissue concentrations, especially in neighboring normal organs, is important to avoid adverse effects. The 10B concentration in normal organs after loading with 10B, however, has not been established in humans. In this study, we performed 4-borono-2-[18F]-fluoro-phenylalanine (18FBPA) PET in healthy volunteers and estimated the chronological changes in the 10B concentrations of normal organs. METHODS: In 6 healthy volunteers, whole-body 18FBPA PET scans were repeated 7 times during 1 h, and the mean 18FBPA distributions of 13 organs were measured. Based on the 18FBPA PET data, we then estimated the changes in the 10B concentrations of the organs when the injection of a therapeutic dose of 10BPA-fructose complex (10BPA-fr; 30 g, 500 mg/kg body weight) was assumed. RESULTS: The maximum mean 18FBPA concentrations were reached at 2-6 min after injection in all the organs except the brain and urinary bladder. The mean 18FBPA concentration in normal brain plateaued at 24 min after injection. When the injection of a therapeutic dose of 10BPA-fr was assumed, the estimated mean 10B concentration in the kidney increased to 126.1 +/- 24.2 ppm at 3 min after injection and then rapidly decreased to 30.9 +/- 7.4 ppm at 53 min. The estimated mean 10B concentration in the bladder gradually increased and reached 383.6 +/- 214.7 ppm at 51 min. The mean 10B concentration in the brain was estimated to be 7.6 +/- 1.5 ppm at 57 min. CONCLUSIONS: 18FBPA PET has a potential to estimate 10B concentration of normal organs before neutron irradiation of BNCT when several assumptions are validated in the future studies.
27586262	microRNA expression profiles as decision-making biomarkers in the management of bladder cancer.	Bladder cancer (BC) is generally divided into non-muscle-invasive BC (NMIBC) and muscle-invasive BC (MIBC). The standard treatment protocol for MIBC patients is radical cystectomy preceded by neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). About one-half of the MIBC patients show a priori resistance to chemotherapy, and are therefore exposed to the risks of disease progression and toxicity from ineffective NAC. The discovery of microRNA (miRNA) regulation in tumorigenesis has provided new directions for the development of a new type of BC biomarkers. In this review, we describe the emerging miRNAs as BC biomarkers for different purposes, including diagnosis, prognosis and therapeutic response. miRNA expression profile changes with alteration of the tissue phenotype. This phenomenon is utilized to predict tumor diagnosis, cancer subclass, disease stage, prognosis and therapeutic response. We classified the miRNAs which are involved in bladder cancer according to malignant potential, chemoresistance, discrimination between normal to cancerous and clinical outcome. Focusing on the major obstacle regarding MIBC patient's NAC response, we summarized the miRNAs that are deregulated and have the potential to identify the patients resistant to NAC, such as miR-34, miR-100, miR-146b and miR-9 and miR-193a-3p. In conclusion, miRNAs expression profile of bladder cancer patient is a promising tool that can serve as biomarker for different aims. Based on this profile we propose upfront radical cystectomy instead of standard NAC to those MIBC patients who are at higher risk for chemoresistance and poor response.
27585438	Severe Fournier's gangrene in a patient with rectal cancer: case report and literature review.	BACKGROUND: Fournier's gangrene in the setting of rectal cancer is rare. Treatment for Fournier's gangrene associated with rectal cancer is more complex than other cases of Fournier's gangrene. We report on a patient with severe Fournier's gangrene in the setting of locally advanced rectal cancer who was treated with a combined modality therapy. CASE PRESENTATION: A 65-year-old man presented with general fatigue and anal pain. The medical and surgical histories were unremarkable. A black spot on the perineal skin surrounded by erythema was found on physical examination, suspicious for Fournier's gangrene. Computed tomography scan showed a rectal tumor invading into the bladder (clinically T4bN2M0) and abscess formation with emphysema around the rectum. He was thus diagnosed with locally advanced rectal cancer and Fournier's gangrene with a severity index score of 12 points. We created a diverting loop colostomy of the transverse colon and performed extensive debridement of the perineum and perianal area. Fifty days later, the patient underwent radical total pelvic exenteration with sacrectomy. In addition, reconstruction of the soft tissue defect was performed using the rectus muscle, the gluteus maximus muscle, and the femoral muscle. Histopathological findings of the specimen were as follows: the tumor was a moderately adenocarcinoma with invasion to the bladder and the prostate (T4b), metastases to four resected lymph nodes (N2), and lymphovascular invasion. There were no major postoperative complications, and the patient was discharged 108 days postoperatively. CONCLUSIONS: We report a rare case of locally invasive rectal cancer associated with Fournier's gangrene. This case highlights a usual cause of Fournier's gangrene. Physicians should be cognizant not only of the more common condition but also of the rare presentations including those associated with rectal cancer.
27583877	Urachal adenocarcinoma that metastasized to breast was misinterpreted as primary breast mucinous carcinoma: A rare case report and literature review.	BACKGROUND: The urachus is a vestigial tubular structure that connects the urinary bladder to the allantois during early embryonic development. Urachal carcinoma develops in the urachus, which is an embryological remnant of the urogenital sinus and allantois. The estimated annual incidence of urachal carcinoma in the general population is 0.01% of all cancers in adults. Moreover, urachal carcinoma accounts for 0.34% to 0.7% of all bladder carcinoma cases. And breast metastasis is extremely rarer. METHODS AND RESULTS: A 42-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital with a palpable mass in the outer upper quadrant of the right breast, which was misinterpreted as a carcinoma that originated from the breast. Subsequently, she underwent surgery without any further meticulous examination. Immunohistochemistry analysis revealed positivity for CK20, Villin, and CDX-2 and negativity for CK7. After further inspection, a mass was found in the bladder dome using 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography and computed tomography. The mass was surgically removed. CONCLUSION: Pathologic and immunohistochemical examination confirmed that the mass was urachal mucinous adenocarcinoma and mucinous adenocarcinoma to the right breast. The patient has been followed up without recurrence for 8 months.
27583074	[Leiomyoma of the bladder causing the destruction of a kidney].	Leiomyoma of the bladder is a rare benign tumor deemed to have a good prognosis after surgical treatment. This is unfortunately not always true. We report the case of a 33 year-old patient who consulted for lumbar pain on right side. Exploration of patient revealed bladder floor solid tumor with non-functioning right kidney and left urinary tract dilation. Cystoscopy objectified solid tumor of the right perimeatal bladder. Tumor biopsies were performed together with the insertion of a left double J stent. Anatomo-pathologic study showed leiomyoma of the bladder. The patient underwent laparoscopic myomectomy. The postoperative course was uneventful. Pathological effect and sequelae was complete distruction of kidney.
27580549	Unusual Development of Pulmonary Tumor Embolism from Controlled Liver Metastases of Transitional Cell Carcinoma: An Autopsy Case.	Clinicians generally suspect pulmonary tumor embolism (PTE) with uncontrolled carcinomas which often spread to lungs. We, however, experienced an autopsy case of diffuse microscopic PTE despite controlled liver metastases of transitional cell carcinoma (TCC). A 66-year-old man with progressing respiratory symptoms showed almost normal chest findings on computed tomography. Although liver metastases were successfully shrunk by chemotherapy, the patient died from aggressive respiratory failure. An autopsy revealed small pulmonary vessels showing diffuse tumor emboli. TCC can cause PTE even if liver metastases are controlled. We must therefore be aware that PTE can manifest as respiratory symptoms without any computed tomography findings.
27578166	Clinical significance of CDH13 promoter methylation as a biomarker for bladder cancer: a meta-analysis.	BACKGROUND: Methylation of the tumor suppressor gene H-cadherin (CDH13) has been reported in many cancers. However, the clinical effect of the CDH13 methylation status of patients with bladder cancer remains to be clarified. METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed to identify eligible studies in the PubMed, Embase, EBSCO, CKNI and Wanfang databases. The pooled odds ratio (OR) and the corresponding 95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) was calculated and summarized. RESULTS: Nine eligible studies were included in the present meta-analysis consisting of a total of 1017 bladder cancer patients and 265 non-tumor controls. A significant association was found between CDH13 methylation levels and bladder cancer (OR = 21.71, P < 0.001). The results of subgroup analyses based on sample type suggested that CDH13 methylation was significantly associated with bladder cancer risk in both the tissue and the urine (OR = 53.94, P < 0.001; OR = 7.71, P < 0.001; respectively). A subgroup analysis based on ethnic population showed that the OR value of methylated CDH13 was higher in Asians than in Caucasians (OR = 35.18, P < 0.001; OR = 8.86, P < 0.001; respectively). The relationships between CDH13 methylation and clinicopathological features were also analyzed. A significant association was not observed between CDH13 methylation status and gender (P = 0.053). Our results revealed that CDH13 methylation was significantly associated with high-grade bladder cancer, multiple bladder cancer and muscle invasive bladder cancer (OR = 2.22, P < 0.001; OR = 1.45, P = 0.032; OR = 3.42, P < 0.001; respectively). CONCLUSION: Our study indicates that CDH13 methylation may play an important role in the carcinogenesis, development and progression of bladder cancer. In addition, CDH13 methylation has the potential to be a useful biomarker for bladder cancer screening in urine samples and to be a prognostic biomarker in the clinic.
27576884	The Prevalence and Prognostic Significance of Polyomavirus Infection in Patients with Urothelial Carcinoma of the Bladder.	PURPOSE: Human polyomaviruses (PV) has been associated with oncogenicity; however, the association between human bladder cancer and PV remains inconclusive. Moreover, whether PV has the interaction with p53 in tumorigenesis and their prognostic significance on human bladder cancer has yet to be determined. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Bladder tumor specimens and clinical parameters from 74 patients with urothelial carcinoma were collected. Immunohistochemical analysis using monoclonal antibodies specific to PV large tumor antigen (TAg) and p53 protein was performed to investigate the involvement of PV in human bladder tumorigenesis and the prognostic significance of TAg and p53 expressions using Cox proportional hazards model. RESULTS: The mean age of the 74 patients at diagnosis was 64 years and 61 (82.4%) were male. The expression of PV TAg protein was found in 45 (60.8%) tumor samples, but was not correlated with the expression of p53 (P = .280). The detection of PV TAg was significantly associated with tumor stage (P = .001) but not decreased overall survival (OS) or cancer-specific survival (CSS) (P = .661 and .738, respectively). However, the p53 overexpression was significantly associated with decreased CSS (P = .028). In multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis, age and p53 overexpression were predictors of OS (P = .026) independently of tumor stage and CSS (P = .042), respectively. CONCLUSION: We found that PV, which was detected in a significant percentage of tumor specimens, may be an important co-factor in the tumorigenesis of the bladder in humans. However, only p53 overexpression was associated with predicting CSS independently of tumor stage.&nbsp.
27576438	Changes in oncological outcomes after radical nephroureterectomy in patients with upper urinary tract urothelial carcinoma treated in the last two decades: a retrospective analysis based on a multicenter collaborative study.	OBJECTIVE: We investigated chronological changes in the outcomes of patients with upper urinary tract urothelial carcinoma treated in the past two decades, during which there was an important change in treatment paradigm. METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted of 1180 urinary tract urothelial carcinoma patients who underwent radical nephroureterectomy in multicenter collaborative institutions between 1996 and 2015. The patients were divided into four groups according to the year when radical nephroureterectomy was performed, as follows: 1996-2000 (period 1; P1), 2001-05 (P2), 2006-10 (P3) and 2011-15 (P4). Variables including tumor grade, T and N categories, administration of perioperative chemotherapy and treatment outcomes were compared among the four groups. RESULTS: There were 146 (12%), 312 (27%), 459 (39%) and 263 (22%) patients in the P1, P2, P3 and P4 groups, respectively. The proportion of patients harboring pT2/3 and Grade 3 tumors increased gradually from 42% (P1) to 58% (P4) and from 49% (P1) to 65% (P4), respectively. The 5-year disease-free survival rates were 74%, 74%, 73% and 75%, and the 5-year overall survival rates were 74%, 65%, 67% and 72% for the P1, P2, P3, and P4 groups, respectively. Multivariate analysis with adjustment for possible confounding factors revealed no significant differences in disease-specific survival, overall survival or intravesical recurrence-free survival among the four groups. CONCLUSIONS: Despite advances in diagnostic instruments, surgery and systemic chemotherapy, the clinical outcome of urinary tract urothelial carcinoma after radical surgery has not significantly improved over the last two decades, and further research is therefore required.
27573985	Clinical significance of alpha and betaKlotho in urothelial carcinoma of the bladder.	Non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) accounts for ~70% of all bladder cancers. One of the serious clinical issues related to the management of NMIBC is that it has significant potential to progress to muscle invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) after initial treatments. alphaKlotho (KLalpha), originally identified as an antiaging gene, has recently been reported to have antitumor effects in various malignancies. In contrast, betaKlotho (KLbeta) has been reported to have protumoral functions. However, the associations between KLalpha/KLbeta and the biological behavior of urothelial carcinoma remain unclear. In the present study, we evaluated the association between clinicopathological background factors of NMIBC and the expression levels of KLalpha or KLbeta. A high expression level of KLbeta, but not KLalpha, was an independent predictive factor of short progressionfree survival for NMIBC. An elevated level of KLbeta correlated with a higher incidence of lymphovascular invasion (LVI). We added in vitro assays using human bladder cancer cell lines to investigate the role of KLbeta. Treatment with exogenous KLbeta protein increased the proliferation, migration, transendothelial migration abilities and anchorageindependent growth of the cell lines. In addition, the KLbeta concentration in voided urine samples obtained before initial transurethral surgery was quantitated with enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The urine KLbeta concentration was found to be higher in patients with bladder cancer than that in healthy volunteers. Our results suggest that KLbeta plays important roles in tumor invasion and progression, and its concentration may be a valuable urinebased marker for the detection of bladder cancer.
27573859	MicroRNA-892b influences proliferation, migration and invasion of bladder cancer cells by mediating the p19ARF/cyclin D1/CDK6 and Sp-1/MMP-9 pathways.	Cancers often utilize microRNAs to suppress tumor suppressor genes, thus facilitating their potential for growth and invasion. In the present study, we report the novel findings that miR-892b inhibits proliferation, migration and invasion of bladder cancer cells. The basal expression level of miR892b was significantly lower in 3 different bladder cancer cell lines than in normal human urothelial cells. Transfection of miR-892b mimics to bladder cancer cells resulted in dosedependent growth arrest. Flow cytometric analysis of the cell cycle showed that miR-892b-transfected bladder cancer cells were subject to arrest in the G1 phase, which was due to the downregulation of cyclin D1 and CDK6 followed by upregulation of p19ARF. In addition, overexpression of miR-892b impeded the migration and invasion of EJ cells. Expression of MMP-9 in EJ cells was blocked by transfection of miR-892b; the effect was regulated, at least in part, by activation of the Sp-1 transcription factor. Overall, we verified that miR-892b regulates the p19ARF/cyclin D1/CDK6 and Sp-1/MMP-9 signaling networks in bladder cancer cells and may provide a treatment option for advanced-stage bladder cancers.
27573550	miR-194 is a negative regulator of GEF-H1 pathway in melanoma.	The incidence and associated mortality of melanoma continues to increase worldwide. At present, there is no curative therapy for advanced stage of melanoma. It is necessary to find new indicators of prognosis and therapeutic targets. Increasing evidence shows that miRNA can provide potential candidate biomarkers for melanoma and therapeutic targets. GEF-H1, a regulator of RhoA, as oncogenic driver in melanoma, promotes the growth and invasion of melanoma. miR-194 is a tumor-suppressor gene in multiple tumors, such as bladder and non-small cell lung cancer, and clear cell renal cell carcinoma. In the present study, we demonstrated that GEF-H1 serves as target of miR-194. Overexpression of miR-194 downregulates the GEF-H1/RhoA pathway, inhibits melanoma cancer cell proliferation and metastasis. Furthermore, miR-194 expression is negatively associated with tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stages. Briefly, our findings provided new theoretical basis for melanoma treatment.
27571890	Baicalein induces apoptosis via ROS-dependent activation of caspases in human bladder cancer 5637 cells.	Baicalein is a flavonoid derived originally from the root of Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi, which has been used in Oriental medicines for treating various diseases. Although this compound has been reported to have anticancer activities in several human cancer cell lines, the therapeutic effects of baicalein on human bladder cancer and its mechanisms of action have not been extensively studied. This study investigated the proapoptotic effects of baicalein in human bladder cancer 5637 cells. For this study, cell viability and apoptosis were evaluated using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthia-zol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay, trypan blue dye exclusion assay 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole staining, and flow cytometry. Measurements of the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), caspase activity assays and western blots were conducted to determine whether 5637 cell death occurred by apoptosis. Treatment with baicalein resulted in a concentration-dependent growth inhibition coupled with apoptosis induction, as indicated by the results of nuclei morphology examination and flow cytometry analyses. The induction of the apoptotic cell death of 5637 cells by baicalein exhibited a correlation with the downregulation of members of the inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP) family, including cIAP-1 and cIAP-2, and the activation of caspase-9 and -3 accompanied by proteolytic degradation of poly(ADP-ribose)-polymerase. The study also showed that baicalein decreases the expression of the proapoptotic protein Bax, increases antiapoptotic Bcl-2 expression, and noticeably aggravates the loss of MMP. Concomitantly, the data showed that baicalein increases the levels of death receptors and their associated ligands and enhances the activation of caspase-8 and truncation of Bid. However, the pan-caspase inhibitor can reverse baicalein-induced apoptosis, demonstrating that it is a caspase-dependent pathway. Moreover, it was found that baicalein can induce the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and that pretreatment with the antioxidant N-acetyl-L-cysteine significantly attenuates the baicalein effects on the loss of MMP and activation of caspase. In addition, the blocking of ROS generation decreases the apoptotic activity and antiproliferative effect of baicalein, indicating that baicalein induces apoptosis of 5637 cells through the ROS-dependent activation of caspases.
27571748	miR-451 suppresses bladder cancer cell migration and invasion via directly targeting c-Myc.	MicroRNA (miRNA) expression is shown dysregulated in tumors. It has been reported that miR-451 alters gene expression and regulates tumorigenesis in various cancer tissues. However, its underlying biological significance in bladder cancer remains to be clarified. In the present study, we investigated the function and molecular mechanism of miR-451 involved in bladder cancer cell migration and invasion. Our results showed that miR-451 was downregulated in clinical bladder carcinoma tissues compared with adjacent bladder tissues. Overexpression of miR-451 significantly retarded the proliferation, migration and invasion of bladder cancer T24 and 5637 cells in vitro. Moreover, the attenuated cell migration and invasion by miR-451 was correlated with increased apoptosis. However, our dual-luciferase reporter assay validated that c-Myc, an oncogene in many tumors, was a direct target gene of miR-451 in bladder cancer. The expression of c-Myc was repressed by miR-451 in bladder cancer cells, and knockdown of c-Myc mimicked the effects of miR-451 overexpression. This discovery suggested that miR-451 is a tumor suppressor modulating bladder cancer cell migration and invasion by directly targeting c-Myc. In addition, apoptosis promoted by miR-451 may participates in this biological behavior. Therefore, target miR-451 may be a novel therapeutic intervention for bladder cancer.
27570122	Bladder spatial-dose descriptors correlate with acute urinary toxicity after radiation therapy for prostate cancer.	PURPOSE: To assess bladder spatial-dose parameters predicting acute urinary toxicity after radiotherapy for prostate cancer (PCa) through a pixel-wise method for analysis of bladder dose-surface maps (DSMs). MATERIALS & METHODS: The final cohort of a multi-institutional study, consisting of 539 patients with PCa treated with conventionally (CONV:1.8-2Gy/fr) or moderately hypo-fractionated radiotherapy (HYPO:2.2-2.7Gy/fr) was considered. Urinary toxicity was evaluated through the International Prostate Symptoms Score (IPSS) administered before and after radiotherapy. IPSS increases 10 and 15 points at the end of radiotherapy (DeltaIPSS10 and DeltaIPSS15) were chosen as endpoints. Average DSMs (corrected into 2Gy-equivalent doses) of patients with/without toxicity were compared through a pixel-wise method. This allowed the extraction of selected spatial descriptors discriminating between patients with/without toxicity. Previously logistic models based on dose-surface histograms (DSH) were considered and replaced with DSM descriptors. Discrimination power, calibration and log-likelihood were considered to evaluate the impact of the inclusion of spatial descriptors. RESULTS: Data of 375/539 patients were available. DeltaIPSS10 was recorded in 76/375 (20%) patients, while 30/375 (8%) experienced DeltaIPSS15. The posterior dose at 12mm from the bladder base (roughly corresponding to the trigone region) resulted significantly associated to toxicity in the whole/HYPO populations. The cranial extension of the 75Gy isodose along the bladder central axis was the best DSM-based predictor in CONV patients. Multi-variable models including DSM descriptors showed better discrimination (AUC=0.66-0.77) when compared to DSH-based models (AUC=0.58-0.71) and higher log-likelihoods. CONCLUSION: DSMs are correlated with the risk of acute GU toxicity. The incorporation of spatial descriptors improves discrimination and log-likelihood of multi-variable models including dosimetric and clinical parameters.
27569947	Adjuvant Chemotherapy With Gemcitabine Plus Cisplatin for Kidney Transplant Patients With Locally Advanced Transitional Cell Carcinoma: A Single-center Experience.	BACKGROUND: The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the effects and safety of adjuvant chemotherapy with gemcitabine plus cisplatin in kidney transplant patients with locally advanced transitional cell carcinoma. METHODS: A total of 22 kidney transplant patients with locally advanced transitional cell carcinoma were assessed. Eleven patients who underwent surgery and received adjuvant chemotherapy were enrolled in the study. They were compared with 11 matched patients who were treated with surgery alone. The chemotherapy regimen was gemcitabine 800 mg/m(2) on days 1, 8, and 15 and cisplatin 70 mg/m(2) on day 2. A single treatment cycle lasted 28 days. Because of the potential concerted reaction between the immunosuppressant regimen and the chemotherapeutic agents, drug toxicities were closely observed, and a dose reduction of the chemotherapeutic agents was planned according to the toxicity grade. There was a 75% drug dose reduction for grade 2 hematologic toxicities and grade 1 nephrotoxicity, and there was a 50% drug dose reduction for grade 3 hematologic toxicity and grade 2 nephrotoxicity. Patients who developed grade 4 hematologic toxicity or grade 3 to 4 nephrotoxicities were withdrawn. RESULTS: Eleven patients completed a total of 29 cycles. At a median follow-up time of 21 months, the mean overall survival time was longer than that of the observation group (P = .043). The incidence of hematologic toxicities was higher, resulting in a dose reduction of the chemotherapeutic agents in 45.5% of patients. Gastrointestinal reactions were most common in patients with nonhematologic toxicities. Grade 1 nephrotoxicity was reported in 3 patients; no other grade of nephrotoxicity was observed. Levels of serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen were not obviously reduced during chemotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: Our study data suggest that kidney transplant patients with locally advanced transitional cell carcinoma may derive an overall survival benefit from the administration of adjuvant chemotherapy with gemcitabine plus cisplatin after surgery. The drug toxicities were acceptable, and nephrotoxicity was mild.
27569360	[Liposarcoma of the Spermatic Cord : A Case Report and Review of the Literature].	A 92-year-old man had noticed enlargement of a mass in the right scrotum and inguinal region for nine months. The patient was introduced to our department for right testicular tumor. Physical examination showed an over fist-sized, hard mass in the right scrotum. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed the mass, which consisted of fatty and solid contents. In addition, MRI revealed a bladder tumor simultaneously. Computed tomography revealed no distant metastases. The patient underwent right high orchiectomy with the mass resection and transurethral resection of the bladder tumor (TURBT). Pathological examination revealed well- and dedifferentiated liposarcoma of the right spermatic cord, and urothelial cancer of the bladder. Liposarcoma of the spermatic cord is a rare neoplasm. To the best of our knowledge, the present case was the 114 th reported case and oldest in Japan.
27569354	[Severe Hyponatremia after Cisplatin-Based Chemotherapy : Two Case Reports].	Hyponatremia is one of the common electrolyte disorders associated with cisplatin (CDDP) administration. We report here two cases of hyponatremia associated with CDDP. Case 1 : A 75-year-old man with urothelial carcinoma of bladder (cT3N1M0) underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy with CDDP and gemcitabine. He lost consciousness on the eighth day after the chemotherapy. Blood tests showed severe hyponatremia (Na 113 mEq/l), low plasma osmolality and high level of plasma vasopressin. Urine tests showed low osmolality. These findings were consistent with the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone hypersecretion (SIADH). His consciousness level was improved after saline infusion and fluid restriction. Case 2 : A 54-year-old man with penile cancer (cT3N2M0) underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy with CDDP, paclitaxel and fluorouracil. He lost consciousness on the seventh day after the chemotherapy. Blood tests showed hyponatremia(Na 121 mEq/l) with renal dysfunction. We concluded that the hyponatremia is due to the renal salt wasting syndrome (RSWS) based on renal dysfunction and high urinary sodium excretion. His consciousness level was improved after saline infusion. Although it is difficult to distinguish between SIADH and RSWS, correct evaluation is necessary for appropriate management of hyponatremia after CDDP administration.
27568660	Common Polymorphisms in GSTA1, GSTM1 and GSTT1 Are Associated with Susceptibility to Urinary Bladder Cancer in Individuals from Balkan Endemic Nephropathy Areas of Serbia.	Balkan endemic nephropathy (BEN) is a chronic familial form of interstitial nephritis that might eventually lead to end stage renal disease. This nephropathy affects individuals living along of the Danube River and its tributaries in Serbia, Bosnia, Croatia, Bulgaria and Romania. The increased incidence of urinary tract tumors in the BEN areas is well described, but its specific genetic predisposition is still unclear. Certain nephrocarcinogenic compounds, including those associated with BEN, are metabolized by glutathione S-transferase (GST) superfamily of phase II detoxication enzymes. Importantly, the GST-mediated detoxification may result in formation of more toxic compounds. We examined the association of common GST polymorphisms and bladder cancer (BC) risk in individuals from BEN areas in Serbia. A hospital-based case-control study included 201 BC cases (67 from BEN region) and 122 controls. Each polymorphism was identified by a PCR-based method. Individuals from BEN region with low-expression GSTA1 genotype (AB+BB) exhibited a 2.6-fold higher BC risk compared to those with GSTA1 (AA) genotype who were from non-BEN region (OR = 2.60, p = 0.015). In contrast, carriers of GSTM1-active genotype from BEN region had a 2.9-fold increased BC risk compared to those with GSTM1-active genotype from non-BEN region (OR = 2.90, p = 0.010). Likewise, carriers with GSTT1-active genotype from BEN region exhibited 2.1-fold higher BC risk compared to those from non-BEN region with GSTT1-active genotype (OR = 2.10, p = 0.027). Thus, common polymorphisms in GSTA1, GSTM1 and GSTT1 are associated with susceptibility to BC in individuals from BEN areas of Serbia.
27566035	A systematic review and meta-analysis of quality of life outcomes after radical cystectomy for bladder cancer.	BACKGROUND: Radical cystectomy and urinary diversion is the treatment of choice for invasive bladder cancer. Quality of life (QOL) is an important outcome of surgery. This review compares the QOL after continent and incontinent urinary diversion in radical cystectomy for patients with primary invasive bladder cancer. METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical studies published after January 2000 was performed according to the PRISMA guidelines. Quality appraisal and data tabulation were performed using pre-determined forms. Data were synthesised by narrative review and random-effects meta-analysis using standardized response means. Heterogeneity and bias was assessed by Tau(2) and I(2) values and Funnel plots. RESULTS: Twenty-nine studies (3754 patients) were included for review. Pooled post-operative FACT and SF-36 scores showed no difference in overall QOL between continent and incontinent diversion (p = 0.31). Subgroup analysis demonstrated greater improvement in physical health for incontinent (p = 0.002) compared to continent diversions, but no differences in mental health (p = 0.35) and social health (p = 0.81). Qualitative analysis showed patients with neobladder had superior emotional function and body image compared to cutaneous diversion. QOL may improve to similar or better levels compared to baseline after 1 year, but data remains scarce. Patients report poor urinary and sexual function after surgery compared the general population. Long-term QOL is unclear. Levels of heterogeneity and bias were low. CONCLUSIONS: QOL after radical cystectomy is comparable after either continent or incontinent urinary diversion. Post-operative QOL may improve, but urinary and sexual dysfunction remains inferior to the general population. Patient choice is key to selection of reconstruction method.
27565154	Recurrent bladder carcinoma: clinical and prognostic role of 18 F-FDG PET/CT.	AIM: A small number of studies evaluated the detection rate of lesions from bladder carcinoma (BC) of 18 F-FDG PET/CT in the restaging process. However, the prognostic role of FDG PET/CT still remains unclear. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the accuracy, the effect upon treatment decision, and the prognostic value of FDG PET/CT in patients with suspected recurrent BC. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-one patients affected by BC underwent FDG PET/CT for restaging purpose. The diagnostic accuracy of visually interpreted FDG PET/CT was assessed compared to histology (n = 8), other diagnostic imaging modalities (contrast-enhanced CT in 38/41 patients and MRI in 15/41) and clinical follow-up (n = 41). Semiquantitative PET values (SUVmax, SUVmean, SUL, MTV, TLG) were calculated using a graph-based method. Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were assessed by using Kaplan-Meier curves. The risk of progression (hazard ratio, HR) was computed by Cox regression analysis by considering all the available variables. RESULTS: PET was considered positive in 21 of 41 patients. Of these, recurrent BC was confirmed in 20 (95 %). Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy of FDG PET/CT were 87 %, 94 %, 95 %, 85 %, 90 %. AUC was 0.9 (95 %IC 0.8-1). Bayesian positive and negative likelihood ratios were 14.5 and 0.13, respectively. FDG PET/CT findings modified the therapeutic approach in 16 patients (modified therapy in 10 PET-positive patients, watch-and-wait in six PET-negative patients). PFS was significantly longer in patients with negative scan vs. those with pathological findings (85 % vs. 24 %, p < 0.05; HR = 12.4; p = 0.001). Moreover, an unremarkable study was associated with a longer OS (88 % vs. 47 % after 2 years and 87 % vs. 25 % after 3 years, respectively, p < 0.05). Standardized uptake value (SUV)max > 6 and total lesion glycolysis (TLG) > 8.5 were recognized as the most accurate thresholds to predict PFS (2-year PFS 62 % for SUVmax < 6 vs. 15 % for SUVmax > 6, p = 0.018; 2-year PFS 66 % for TLG < 8.5 vs. 18 % for TLG > 8.5, p = 0.09). CONCLUSION: A very good diagnostic performance for FDG PET/CT was confirmed in patients with suspected recurrent BC. FDG PET/CT allowed for a change in treatment decision in about 40 % of cases and showed an important prognostic value in assessing PFS and OS.
27563235	Design and characteristics of cytotoxic fibroblast growth factor 1 conjugate for fibroblast growth factor receptor-targeted cancer therapy.	Fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs) are attractive candidate cancer therapy targets as they are overexpressed in multiple types of tumors, such as breast, prostate, bladder, and lung cancer. In this study, a natural ligand of FGFR, an engineered variant of fibroblast growth factor 1 (FGF1V), was conjugated to a potent cytotoxic drug, monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE), and used as a targeting agent for cancer cells overexpressing FGFRs, similar to antibodies in antibody-drug conjugates. The FGF1V-valine-citrulline-MMAE conjugate showed a favorable stability profile, bound FGFRs on the cell surface specifically, and efficiently released the drug (MMAE) upon cleavage by the lysosomal protease cathepsin B. Importantly, the conjugate showed a prominent cytotoxic effect toward cell lines expressing FGFR. FGF1V-vcMMAE was highly cytotoxic at concentrations even an order of magnitude lower than those found for free MMAE. This effect was FGFR-specific as cells lacking FGFR did not show any increased mortality.
27560546	Long non-coding RNA UCA1 contributes to the progression of oral squamous cell carcinoma by regulating the WNT/beta-catenin signaling pathway.	With the development of functional genomics studies, a mass of long non-coding RNAs (LncRNA) were discovered from the human genome. Long non-coding RNAs serve as pivotal regulators of genes that are able to generate LncRNA-binding protein complexes to modulate a great number of genes. Recently, the LncRNA urothelial carcinoma-associated 1 (UCA1) has been revealed to be dysregulated, which plays a critical role in the development of a few cancers. However, the role of the biology and clinical significance of UCA1 in the tumorigenesis of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) remain unknown. We found that UCA1 expression levels were upregulated aberrantly in tongue squamous cell carcinoma tissues and associated with lymph node metastasis and TNM stage. We explored the expression, function, and molecular mechanism of LncRNA UCA1 in OSCC. In the present work, we revealed that UCA1 silencing suppressed proliferation and metastasis and induced apoptosis of OSCC cell lines in vitro and in vivo, which might be related to the activation level of the WNT/beta-catenin signaling pathway. Our research results emphasize the pivotal role of UCA1 in the oncogenesis of OSCC and reveal a novel LncRNA UCA1-beta-catenin-WNT signaling pathway regulatory network that could contribute to our understanding in the pathogenesis of OSCC and assist in the discovery of a viable LncRNA-directed diagnostic and therapeutic strategy for this fatal disease.
27557899	MicroRNA epigenetic signatures in human disease.	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short non-coding RNAs that act as important regulators of gene expression as part of the epigenetic machinery. In addition to posttranscriptional gene silencing by miRNAs, the epigenetic mechanisms also include DNA methylation, histone modifications and their crosstalk. Epigenetic modifications were reported to play an important role in many disease onsets and progressions and can be used to explain several features of complex diseases, such as late onset and fluctuation of symptoms. However, miRNAs not only function as a part of epigenetic machinery, but are also epigenetically modified by DNA methylation and histone modification like any other protein-coding gene. There is a strong connection between epigenome and miRNome, and any dysregulation of this complex system can result in various physiological and pathological conditions. In addition, miRNAs play an important role in toxicogenomics and may explain the relationship between toxicant exposure and tumorigenesis. The present review provides information on 63 miRNA genes shown to be epigenetically regulated in association with 21 diseases, including 11 cancer types: cardiac fibrosis, cardiovascular disease, preeclampsia, Hirschsprung's disease, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, temporal lobe epilepsy, autism, pulmonary fibrosis, melanoma, acute myeloid leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, colorectal, gastric, cervical, ovarian, prostate, lung, breast, and bladder cancer. The review revealed that hsa-miR-34a, hsa-miR-34b, and hsa-miR-34c are the most frequently reported epigenetically dysregulated miRNAs. There is a need to further study molecular mechanisms of various diseases to better understand the crosstalk between epigenetics and gene expression and to develop new therapeutic options and biomarkers.
27549183	Metachronous bladder metastases of a type 2 papillary renal cell carcinoma: a case report and review of the literature.	BACKGROUND: Renal cell carcinoma developing metastases in the bladder is rare. Bladder metastasis due to a papillary type of renal cell carcinoma is rarer. Such metastases could be synchronous or metachronous. CASE PRESENTATION: Here we present a 55-year-old female patient with haematuria who underwent left nephro-ureterectomy for a suspected urothelial tumour. Histopathology revealed it to be a type 2 papillary renal cell carcinoma. Eighteen months later, she developed metachronous bladder metastasis of the papillary renal cell carcinoma which was treated with total cystectomy. Currently, she is on interferon therapy. CONCLUSIONS: These bladder metastases from renal cell carcinoma could be due to drop metastases, lymphatic spread or haematogenous spread. The exact mechanism in a given case appears to be unpredictable.
27543983	Impact of Implementing the Paris System for Reporting Urine Cytology in the Performance of Urine Cytology: A Correlative Study of 124 Cases.	OBJECTIVES: We assessed the performance of urine cytology using the Paris System for Reporting Urine Cytology (PSRUC) in comparison to our current system. METHODS: In total, 124 specimens with histologic correlation were reviewed and assigned to the PSRUC categories: benign, atypical urothelial cells (AUCs), suspicious for high-grade urothelial carcinoma (SHGUC), and high-grade urothelial carcinoma (HGUC). Original cytological diagnoses were recorded. RESULTS: Fewer cases were given an AUC diagnosis using the PSRUC in comparison to the original diagnoses (26% vs 39%), while the association of AUCs with subsequent HGUC increased from 33% to 53% with the PSRUC. Using the PSRUC resulted in a higher number of low-grade carcinomas assigned to the benign (40%) rather than the AUC (22%) category. The performance of SHGUC/HGUC diagnoses was similar in both systems (predictive value = 94%). CONCLUSIONS: The PSRUC seems to improve the performance of urine cytology by limiting the AUC category to cases that are more strongly associated with HGUC.
27543866	Clinical value of digital image analysis in the diagnosis of urinary bladder cancer, particularly in aggressive tumors: a preliminary report.	The aim of the project was to evaluate the clinical value of a computer analysis of cytological specimen images obtained from urine and bladder washing samples. Three sample types (voided urine, catheterized urine and bladder washing) from 59 patients with primary or recurrent tumor were analyzed. All patients underwent cystoscopy and biopsy or resection. The histological results were compared with the results of the image analyzing computer system of collected urine samples. The consistency between the computer diagnosis and the clinical or histological diagnosis both in the presence and absence of cancer was as follows: 77% for voided urine samples, 72.5% for catheterized urine samples and 78% for bladder washing samples. The specificity of the method at the standard pathology level was 71%, and the sensitivity was 83%. The positive and negative predictive values (PPV and NPV) were 87.5% and 63% respectively. The sensitivity for G3 or CIS or T2 or T3 tumors reached nearly 100%. Computer analysis of urine provided correct diagnoses in cancer and control patients with the sensitivity of 83% and specificity of 71% and gave excellent results in aggressive tumors such as T2, T3, G3 and in CIS.
27542841	Higher expression of XPF is a critical factor in intrinsic chemotherapy resistance of human renal cell carcinoma.	Human renal cancer is extremely resistant to chemotherapy and radiation therapy. This clinical characteristic reduces the efficacy of chemotherapeutic agents in the treatment of recurrence or metastasis following surgical resection. Understanding the mechanism of chemotherapy resistance in renal cell carcinoma remains a significant challenge. In this study, we have shown that varied level of XPF expression was organ-tissue specific by comparing human renal cancer, bladder cancer, testicular cancer and their normal tissue counterparts, respectively. The expression of XPF was significantly higher in renal cancer than in bladder cancer and testicular cancer and correlated with the clinical characteristic of their chemotherapeutics sensitivity. These novel findings proposed that the intrinsic chemoresistance of human renal cell carcinomas might be derived from the high level of XPF expression. In a panel of five cancer cell lines, decreasing cisplatin sensitivity correlated with increasing levels of XPF expression. Knockdown of XPF expression not only increased sensitivity of renal carcinoma cells to cisplatin treatment by affecting the DNA damage response, including DNA repair, cell cycle regulation and apoptosis, but also increased senescence of renal cancer cell. Furthermore, experiment in vivo confirmed that silenced XPF significantly increased the sensitivity and survival following treatment with cisplatin in xenograft mice bearing renal cell tumor. These findings firstly uncover a partial mechanism of intrinsic chemoresistance in renal cancer and may provide a new approach to break through the obstacle of intrinsic chemoresistance by targeting the XPF protein with a potential new inhibitor.
27539291	Molecular Targeted Fluorescence-Guided Intraoperative Imaging of Bladder Cancer Nodal Drainage Using Indocyanine Green During Radical and Partial Cystectomy.	Optical imaging is a relatively inexpensive, fast, and sensitive addition to a surgeon's arsenal for the non-invasive detection of malignant dissemination. Optical cameras in the near infrared spectrum are able to successfully identify injected indocyanine green in lymphatic channels and sentinel lymph nodes. The use of this technology is now being used in the operating room to help with lymph node dissection and improve the prognosis of patients diagnosed with muscle invasive bladder cancer. Indocyanine green has the potential for many more applications due to its versatility. In the future, there is a potential to use it for lymphangiography during nephroureterctomy for upper tract urothelial carcinoma, adrenal surgery for partial or radical adrenalectomy. Further investigations at multiple centers will validate this technique and its efficiency.
27538431	Applying a RapidPlan model trained on a technique and orientation to another: a feasibility and dosimetric evaluation.	BACKGROUND: The development of a dose-volume-histogram (DVH) estimation model for knowledge-based planning is very time-consuming and it could be inefficient if it was only used for similar upcoming cases as supposed. It is clinically desirable to explore and validate other potential applications for a configured model. This study tests the hypothesis that a supine volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) model can optimize intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) plans of other patient setup orientations. METHODS: Based on RapidPlan, a DVH estimation model was trained using 81 supine VMAT rectal plans and validated on 10 similar cases to ensure the robustness of its designed purpose. Attempts were then made to apply the model to re-optimize the dynamic MLC-sequences of the duplicated IMRT plans from 30 historical patients (20 prone and 10 supine) that were treated with the same prescription as for the model (50.6 and 41.8 Gy to 95 % of PGTV and PTV simultaneously/22 fractions). The performance of knowledge-based re-optimization and the impact of setup orientations were evaluated dosimetrically. RESULTS: The VMAT model validation on similar cases showed comparable target dose distribution and significantly improved organ sparing (by 10.77 ~ 18.65 %) than the original plans. IMRT plans of either setup can be re-optimized using the supine VMAT model, which significantly reduced the dose to the bladder (by 25.88 % from 33.85 +/- 2.96 to 25.09 +/- 1.32 Gy for D50 %; by 22.77 % from 33.99 +/- 2.77 to 26.25 +/- 1.22 Gy for mean dose) and femoral head (by 12.27 % from 15.65 +/- 3.33 to 13.73 +/- 1.43 Gy for D50 %; by 10.09 % from 16.26 +/- 2.74 to 14.62 +/- 1.10 Gy for mean dose), all P < 0.01. Although the dose homogeneity and PGTV conformity index (CI_PGTV) changed slightly (</=0.01), CI_PTV of IMRT plans was significantly increased (Delta = 0.17, P < 0.01) by the manually defined target-objectives in the VMAT optimizer. The semi-automated IMRT planning increased the global maximum dose and V107 % due to the missing of hot spot suppression by specific manual optimizing or fluence map editing. CONCLUSIONS: The Varian RapidPlan model trained on a technique and orientation can be used for another. Knowledge-based planning improves organ sparing and quality consistency, yet the target-objectives defined for VMAT-optimizer should be readapted to IMRT planning, followed by manual hot spot processing.
27534866	The utility of neoadjuvant gemcitabine plus carboplatin followed by immediate radical cystectomy in patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer who are ineligible for cisplatin-based chemotherapy.	BACKGROUND: There are currently no data supporting carboplatin-based regimens in muscle-invasive bladder cancer patients who are unsuitable for neoadjuvant cisplatin treatment. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential benefit of carboplatin-based regimens in patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer who were unsuitable for cisplatin. METHODS: We focused on 171 patients ineligible for cisplatin, including 98 patients who received neoadjuvant gemcitabine and carboplatin (GCarbo) followed by immediate radical cystectomy (GCarbo cohort) and 73 patients who underwent radical cystectomy (RC alone cohort) at Hiroaki University or Aomori Prefectural Hospital. In the neoadjuvant GCarbo cohort, patients underwent two 21-day cycles of GCarbo the two courses of neoadjuvant chemotherapy were followed by radical cystectomy at an interval of 1 month. RESULTS: Of the enrolled patients, 165 (95.3 %) had renal impairment. The median age of the enrolled patients was 71 years, and the median follow-up period was 63 months. The 5-year overall survival rates for the GCarbo and the RC-alone cohorts were 79.5 and 53.8 %, respectively (P < 0.001), while the 5-year disease-free survival rates were 75.5 and 55.4 %, respectively (P = 0.013). Surgical specimens of 16 (16.3 %) patients in the GCarbo cohort indicated stage pT0 disease. The rate of positive surgical margins in the RC-alone cohort was significantly higher than that in the GCarbo cohort (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In this study, the oncological outcomes were significantly improved in cisplatin-unfit patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer who received neoadjuvant GCarbo chemotherapy, compared with those in patients who underwent RC alone. The standard of care for muscle-invasive bladder cancer, especially for patients who are unfit for cisplatin, may include neoadjuvant carboplatin chemotherapy followed by radical cystectomy.
27531258	Elevated connexin 43 expression in arsenite-and cadmium-transformed human bladder cancer cells, tumor transplants and selected high grade human bladder cancers.	Connexin 43 has been shown to play a role in cell migration and invasion; however, its role in bladder cancer is not well defined. Previous studies from our laboratory have shown that the environmental pollutants arsenite and cadmium can cause malignant transformation of the immortalized urothelial cell line UROtsa. These transformed cells can form tumors in immune-compromised mice. The goal of the present study was to determine if connexin 43 is expressed in the normal human bladder, the arsenite and cadmiun-transformed UROtsa cells as well as human urothelial cancer. The results obtained showed that connexin 43 is not expressed in the epithelial cells of the human bladder but is expressed in immortalized cultures of human urothelial cells and the expression is variable in the arsenite and cadmium- transformed urothelial cell lines derived from these immortalized cells. Tumor heterotransplants generated from the transformed cells expressed connexin 43 and the expression was localized to areas of squamous differentiation. Immuno-histochemical analysis of human bladder cancers also showed that the expression of connexin 43 was localized to areas of the tumor that showed early features of squamous differentiation. Treatment of UROtsa cells with various concentrations of arsenite or cadmium did not significantly alter the expression level of connexin 43. In conclusion, our results show that the expression of connexin 43 is localized to the areas of the tumor that show squamous differentiation, which may be an indicator of poor prognosis. This suggests that connexin 43 has the potential to be developed as a biomarker for bladder cancer that may have the ability to invade and metastasize.
27531091	Disseminated Mycotic Aneurysms following Intravesical Bacillus Calmette-Guerin Therapy for Bladder Cancer: Case Discussion and Systematic Treatment Algorithm.	Numerous case reports have highlighted the relationship between bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) therapy and development of systemic mycotic aneurysms but none have established a management algorithm in patients with suspected vascular dissemination of Mycobacterium bovis. Delay in diagnosis of this disease process will lead to delays in initiation of antimycobacterium treatment to prevent dissemination into other arterial beds and potentially complicate effective surgical treatment leading to aneurysmal rupture and other devastating vascular consequences. Given the increasing number of reported cases in the literature and the ongoing, standard of care utilization of BCG for bladder cancer, we believe that a systematic approach to the management of patients with suspected BCG-related mycotic aneurysms should be set in place to prevent misdiagnosis and delays in treatment. In this report, we discuss the presentation, work-up, and report our treatment algorithm of a patient who developed diffuse peripheral mycotic aneurysms following BCG therapy for bladder cancer.
27530399	Pioglitazone use and risk of bladder cancer in patients with type 2 diabetes: retrospective cohort study using datasets from four European countries.	OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between pioglitazone use and bladder cancer risk in patients with type 2 diabetes. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study using propensity score matched cohorts. SETTINGS: Healthcare databases from Finland, the Netherlands, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. Data comprised country specific datasets of linked records on prescriptions, hospitals, general practitioners, cancer, and deaths. PARTICIPANTS: Patients with type 2 diabetes who initiated pioglitazone (n=56 337) matched with patients with type 2 diabetes in the same country exposed to diabetes drug treatments other than pioglitazone (n=317 109). Two matched cohorts were created, using a 1:1 fixed ratio (nearest match cohort) and a 1:10 variable ratio (multiple match cohort). Patients were matched on treatment history and propensity scores accounting for several variables associated with pioglitazone initiation. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals were estimated by Cox's proportional hazards model with adjustments for relevant confounders. To assess the robustness of the findings, several sensitivity and stratified analyses were performed. RESULTS: In the cohort exposed to pioglitazone treatment, 130 bladder cancers occurred over a mean follow-up time of 2.9 years. In the nearest match and multiple match cohorts not exposed to pioglitazone treatment, 153 and 970 bladder cancers were recorded, with a mean followup time of 2.8 and 2.9 years, respectively. With regards to bladder cancer risk, the adjusted hazard ratio for patients ever exposed versus never exposed to pioglitazone was 0.99 (95% confidence interval 0.75 to 1.30) and 1.00 (0.83 to 1.21) in the nearest and multiple match cohorts, respectively. Increasing duration of pioglitazone use and increasing cumulative dose were not associated with risk of bladder cancer (>48 months of pioglitazone use, adjusted hazard ratio 0.86 (0.44 to 1.66); >40 000 mg cumulative dose, 0.65 (0.33 to 1.26) in the nearest match cohort). CONCLUSIONS: This study shows no evidence of an association between ever use of pioglitzone and risk of bladder cancer compared with never use, which is consistent with results from other recent studies that also included a long follow-up period. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Registered to the European Union electronic register of post-authorisation studies (EU PAS register no EUPAS3626).
27521030	[Radiotherapy of bladder cancer].	Surgery (radical cystectomy) is the standard treatment of muscle-invasive bladder cancer. Radiochemotherapy has risen as an alternative treatment option to surgery as part as organ-sparing combined modality treatment or for patients unfit for surgery. Radiochemotherapy achieves 5-year bladder intact survival of 40 to 65% and 5-year overall survival of 40 to 50% with excellent quality of life. This article introduces the French recommendations for radiotherapy of bladder cancer: indications, exams, technique, dosimetry, delivery and image guidance.
27520411	High prevalence of TERT promoter mutations in micropapillary urothelial carcinoma.	Somatic activating mutations in the promoter of the telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) gene are the most common genetic alterations in urothelial carcinoma (UC) of the bladder and upper urinary tract. Little is known, however, about TERT-mutation status in the relatively uncommon but clinically aggressive micropapillary (MPC) variant. We evaluated the presence of TERT promoter mutations in MPC of the bladder and upper urinary tract. A retrospective search of our archives for MPC and UC with micropapillary features (2005-2014) was performed. All slides were reviewed to confirm the histologic diagnosis. Thirty-three specimens from 31 patients had FFPE blocks available for DNA analysis and were included in the study. Intratumoral areas of non-micropapillary histology were also evaluated when present. Samples were analyzed with Safe-SeqS, a sequencing error reduction technology, and sequenced using the Illumina MiSeq platform. TERT promoter mutations were detected in all specimens with pure MPC (18 of 18) and UC with focal micropapillary features (15 of 15). Similar to conventional UC, the predominant mutations identified occurred at positions -124 (C228T) (85 %) and -146 (C250T) (12 %) bp upstream of the TERT ATG start site. In heterogeneous tumors with focal variant histology, intratumoral concordant mutations were found in variant (MPC and non-MPC) and corresponding conventional UC. We found TERT promoter mutations, commonly found in conventional UC, to be frequently present in MPC. Our finding of concordant intratumoral mutational alterations in cases with focal variant histology lends support to the common oncogenesis origin of UC and its variant histology.
27515689	Meta-analysis of Genome Wide Association Studies Identifies Genetic Markers of Late Toxicity Following Radiotherapy for Prostate Cancer.	Nearly 50% of cancer patients undergo radiotherapy. Late radiotherapy toxicity affects quality-of-life in long-term cancer survivors and risk of side-effects in a minority limits doses prescribed to the majority of patients. Development of a test predicting risk of toxicity could benefit many cancer patients. We aimed to meta-analyze individual level data from four genome-wide association studies from prostate cancer radiotherapy cohorts including 1564 men to identify genetic markers of toxicity. Prospectively assessed two-year toxicity endpoints (urinary frequency, decreased urine stream, rectal bleeding, overall toxicity) and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) associations were tested using multivariable regression, adjusting for clinical and patient-related risk factors. A fixed-effects meta-analysis identified two SNPs: rs17599026 on 5q31.2 with urinary frequency (odds ratio [OR] 3.12, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.08-4.69, p-value 4.16x10(-8)) and rs7720298 on 5p15.2 with decreased urine stream (OR 2.71, 95% CI 1.90-3.86, p-value=3.21x10(-8)). These SNPs lie within genes that are expressed in tissues adversely affected by pelvic radiotherapy including bladder, kidney, rectum and small intestine. The results show that heterogeneous radiotherapy cohorts can be combined to identify new moderate-penetrance genetic variants associated with radiotherapy toxicity. The work provides a basis for larger collaborative efforts to identify enough variants for a future test involving polygenic risk profiling.
27513725	MicroRNA-106a suppresses proliferation, migration, and invasion of bladder cancer cells by modulating MAPK signaling, cell cycle regulators, and Ets-1-mediated MMP-2 expression.	Despite the clinical significance of tumorigenesis, little is known about the cellular signaling networks of microRNAs (miRs). Here we report a new finding that mir106a regulates the proliferation, migration, and invasion of bladder cancer cells. Basal expression levels of mir106a were significantly lower in bladder cancer cells than in normal urothelial cells. Overexpression of mir106a suppressed the proliferation of bladder cancer cell line EJ. Transient transfection of mir106a into EJ cells led to downregulation of ERK phosphorylation and upregulation of p38 and JNK phosphorylation over their levels in the control. Flow cytometry analysis revealed that mir106a-transfected cells accumulated in the G1-phase of the cell cycle, and cyclin D1 and CDK6 were significantly downregulated. This G1-phase cell cycle arrest was due in part to the upregulation of p21CIP1/WAF1. In addition, mir106a overexpression blocked the wound-healing migration and invasion of EJ cells. Furthermore, mir106a transfection resulted in decreased expression of MMP-2 and diminished binding activity of transcription factor Ets-1 in EJ cells. Collectively, we report the novel mir106a-mediated molecular signaling networks that regulate the proliferation, migration, and invasion of bladder cancer cells, suggesting that mir106a may be a therapeutic target for treating advanced bladder tumors.
27512574	Adaptive radiation therapy for bladder cancer: a review of adaptive techniques used in clinical practice.	Significant changes in the shape, size and position of the bladder during radiotherapy (RT) treatment for bladder cancer have been correlated with high local failure rates; typically due to geographical misses. To account for this, large margins are added around the target volumes in conventional RT; however, this increases the volume of healthy tissue irradiation. The availability of cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) has not only allowed in-room volumetric imaging of the bladder, but also the development of adaptive radiotherapy (ART) for modification of plans to patient-specific changes. The aim of this review is to: (1) identify and explain the different ART techniques being used in clinical practice and (2) compare and contrast these different ART techniques to conventional RT in terms of target coverage and dose to healthy tissue: A literature search was conducted using EMBASE, MEDLINE and Scopus with the key words 'bladder, adaptive, radiotherapy/radiation therapy'. 11 studies were obtained that compared different adaptive RT techniques to conventional RT in terms of target volume coverage and healthy tissue sparing. All studies showed superior target volume coverage and/or healthy tissue sparing in adaptive RT compared to conventional RT. Cross-study comparison between different adaptive techniques could not be made due to the difference in protocols used in different studies. However, one study found daily re-optimisation of plans to be superior to plan of the day technique. The use of adaptive RT for bladder cancer is promising. Further study is required to assess adaptive RT versus conventional RT in terms of local control and long-term toxicity.
27511986	Clinical predictors for high-grade bladder cancer before first-time transurethral resection of the bladder tumor: a retrospective cohort study.	The aim of this study was to identify the clinical predictors related to the risk of high-grade bladder cancer before first-time transurethral resection of the bladder tumor (TUR-Bt) and to externally validate the accuracy of Shapur's nomogram predicting the risk of high-grade bladder cancer in Japanese patients. As a result, episode of gross hematuria (odds ratio: 2.68, P = 0.02), larger tumor size (odds ratio: 1.89, P < 0.01) and positive urinary cytology (odds ratio: 8.34, P < 0.01) were found to be significant predictors for high-grade bladder cancer. Furthermore, the nomogram showed a high predictive accuracy in our Japanese population (area under the curve: 0.79). Clinicians will be able to predict high-grade bladder cancer using the common factors in Shapur's study and ours, such as tumor size and urinary cytology, and gross hematuria as the additional factor first identified here to decide priorities for the treatment of patients diagnosed with bladder cancer.
27510007	Risk Factors for Upper and Lower Urinary Tract Cancer Death in a Japanese Population: Findings from the Japan Collaborative Cohort Study for Evaluation of Cancer Risk (JACC Study).	BACKGROUND: The incidence of bladder cancer is lower in Asian than in Western countries. However, the crude incidence and mortality of bladder cancer have recently increased in Japan because of the increased number of senior citizens. We have already reported risk factors for urothelial cancer in a large populationbased cohort study in Japan (JACC study). However, we did not evaluate the cancer risk in the upper and lower urinary tract separately in our previous study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Here we evaluated the risk of cancer death in the upper and lower urinary tracts, separately, using the database of the JACC study. The analytic cohort included 46,395 males and 64,190 females aged 40 to 79 years old. The Cox proportional hazard model was used to determine hazard ratios and their 95% confidence intervals. RESULTS: Current smoking increased the risk of both upper and lower urinary tract cancer deaths. A history of kidney disease was associated with an increased risk of bladder cancer death, even after controlling for age, sex and smoking status. CONCLUSIONS: The present study confirmed that current smoking increases the risk of both upper and lower urinary tract cancer deaths and indicated the possibility that a history of kidney disease may be a risk factor for bladder cancer death in the Japanese population.
27509990	Risk Factors for Gallbladder Cancer in Nepal a Case Control Study.	BACKGROUND: Gall bladder cancer (GBC) is highly fatal disease with poor prognosis, with a 5 year survival rate of <10%. It is relatively rare cancer worldwide; however it is the sixth cancer and second most common gastrointestinal tract cancer in Nepalese women. The study focused on associations of certain demographic, lifestyle, dietary, and reproductive factors with gall bladder cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a hospitalbased matched case control study on newly diagnosed cases of primary GBC at BP Koirala Institute of Health Sciences and BP Koirala Memorial Cancer Hospital. Controls were healthy nonGBC relatives of cancer patients, matched for age, sex and marital status (in case of females) with cases at a ratio of 1:2. Data were collected between April 2012April 2013 by semi structured interview from both cases and controls. Analyses were carried out with SPSS. Conditional logistic regression was used to find odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for bivariate and multivariate analysis. RESULTS: A total of 50 cases and 100 controls were enrolled in this study. On bivariate analysis, factors found to be significantly associated with gallbladder cancer were illiteracy (OR= 3.29, CI= 1.0610.2), history of gallstone disease (OR=27.6, CI=6.57, 115.6), current smoker (OR=2.42, CI=1.005 5.86), early menarche <13 years (OR=2.64, CI=1.096.44), high parity more than 3 (OR=3.12, CI=1.25,7.72), and use of mustard oil (OR=3.63, CI=1.40, 9.40). A significant protective effect was seen with high consumption of fruits at least once a week (OR=0.101, CI=0.030.35). On multivariate analysis, history of gallstone disease, early menarche, current smoker and high consumption of fruits persisted as significant factors. CONCLUSIONS: History of gallstone disease, cigarette smoking and early menarche were associated with increased risk of gallbladder cancer while high consumption of fruits was found to have a protective effect.
27503809	Metastatic prostatic adenocarcinoma with neuroendocrine differentiation to meningioma.	The diagnosis of a tumor-to-tumor metastasis in the central nervous system most commonly involves metastasis to a meningioma. These combined lesions are often radiographically unsuspected and mimic a meningioma. Most commonly, the source of metastatic disease are carcinomas from the lung and breast. To our knowledge, fewer than a half dozen cases of metastatic prostatic adenocarcinoma to a meningioma have been documented in the literature. This report documents a 67-year-old man who presented with worsening confusion and altered mental status, accompanied by symptoms of increased urinary frequency, incontinence, and difficulty urinating. Imaging revealed a mass at the base of the bladder and an intracranial lesion, surrounded by edema, which was initially suspicious for intracranial metastasis of prostate cancer. Due to worsening neurological symptoms, the patient underwent craniotomy to remove the intracranial mass. The mass was comprised of a meningothelial meningioma, World Health Organization Grade I, accompanied by atypical epithelioid cells which demonstrated immunoreactivity to prostate specific antigen, chromogranin and neuron specific enolase antibodies, consistent with a metastatic prostatic adenocarcinoma with neuroendocrine differentiation. The patient suffered severe neurological complications post-operatively, developed multiple metastases and expired 12months later. The report reviews current theories as to why meningiomas are the most common host tumor for tumor-to-tumor metastases in the brain and reviews the literature on previously reported cases involving metastatic prostatic adenocarcinoma.
27501594	Preoperative Nutritional Status and The Impact on Radical Cystectomy Recovery: An International Comparative Study.	In radical cystectomy, under-nutrition is common and has detrimental physiological and clinical effects, which can lead to increased complications and prolonged recovery. This article compares measurements and outcomes across continents in this patient population with advanced bladder cancer. The association of preoperative nutritional risk, nutritional status, and length of stay is equal across continents, and the results promote increased clinical awareness that women at severe risk should be identified preoperatively.
27500710	Proton radiotherapy for gynecologic neoplasms.	BACKGROUND: Proton beam therapy (PBT) is increasingly being used globally to treat a variety of malignancies. This is the first review assessing PBT for gynecologic neoplasms. Dose distribution to organs-at-risk (OARs), particularly bone marrow (BM), is addressed. Clinical outcomes and toxicity data are detailed. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Systematic searches of PubMed, EMBASE, abstracts from meetings of the American Society for Radiation Oncology, Particle Therapy Co-Operative Group, and American Society of Clinical Oncology were conducted for publications. There were no restrictions on publication dates. Sixteen original investigations were identified and analyzed for this review. RESULTS: The available evidence for PBT in treating gynecologic cancers is of both low quantity and quality. The most studied scenarios for PBT include treatment of para-aortic lymph nodes, re-irradiation, and as an alternative to brachytherapy, and these also represent indications with the greatest opportunity for demonstrating as yet unproven toxicity reductions. Dosimetric studies have shown significantly decreased dose to OARs, such as the rectum, bladder, bowel, kidneys, BM, and femoral heads. This dose reduction to OARs with PBT is more pronounced within the low-dose volumes than the higher dose volumes, which radiobiologically could be expected to lower second malignancy rates. Clinical data, though no level 1 evidence, show appropriate stage-specific tumor control and outcomes with PBT treatment, along with low toxicity rates. CONCLUSION: The existing data, albeit limited, warrant and can help guide larger scale and higher quality studies addressing whether PBT could provide clinically meaningful differences in toxicities and outcomes in women with gynecologic neoplasms.
27498452	Pheochromocytoma of the urinary bladder--A case report.	INTRODUCTION: Pheochromocytoma of the urinary bladder is a rare tumor and presents less than 0.06% of all urinary bladder tumors. CASE REPORT: We presented a 49-year-old female patient with a history of daily paroxysmal hypertension accompanied with flushing of the face and upper chest, palpitations and excessive sweating prior to micturition. Ultrasonography reported a 3 cm bladder wall tumor. The 131I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (131I-MIBG) scan showed a pathological isotope accumulation in the projection of the bladder. The patient underwent a partial cystectomy. One year following the operation the patient was normotensive and without recurrence. CONCLUSION: The most efficient treatment option for bladder pheochromocytoma is surgical resection. The most important fact in the diagnostics is suspicion on this rare condition.
27495099	Comparison between whole mount tissue preparations and virtual tissue microarray samples for measuring Ki-67 and apoptosis indices in human bladder cancer: A cross-sectional study.	Recent tissue microarray (TMA)-based studies have shown that cell proliferation- and apoptosis-related biomarkers are associated with clinical outcomes in patients with bladder urothelial carcinoma. However, little is known about the differences in these biomarker measurements between whole mount tissue preparations and TMAs. This study aimed to elucidate the discrepancy in the measurements of Ki-67 indices (KIs) and apoptosis indices (AIs) between whole mount tissue preparations and TMAs of bladder urothelial carcinoma samples.Whole mount tissue preparations for Ki-67 immunohistochemistry and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling were made from 30 patients who underwent transurethral resection of bladder urothelial carcinoma. Digital microscopy-assisted virtual TMAs, consisting of 3 small round areas (1 or 0.6 mm in diameter), were generated from the same whole mount tissue preparations. The measurement results in highly reactive areas of biomarkers were compared between the whole mount tissue preparation- and the TMA-based methods. Bland-Altman plot analysis, regression analysis, and Kendall tau were performed to investigate differences in the measurement results, systematic biases, and correlations between biomarkers.Although the Bland-Altman plot analysis demonstrated that almost all the plots were within the limits of agreement, fixed biases were detected in the 1- and 0.6-mm TMAs for the KI (0.181 and 0.222, respectively) and the AI (0.055 and 0.063, respectively). Proportional biases were also detected in the 1- and 0.6-mm TMAs for the AI (P < 0.001 and P < 0.001, respectively). Furthermore, positive correlations between KIs and AIs were observed in whole mount tissue preparations (r = 0.260, P = 0.044) and in the 1 mm TMAs (r = 0.375, P = 0.004); however, no such correlation was observed in the 0.6 mm TMAs.Our study suggests that the measurement results for certain biomarkers of bladder urothelial carcinoma obtained from TMA-based samples can be susceptible to systematic bias, and the lack of correlation between biomarkers cannot be avoided as it is in whole mount tissue preparations. Virtual TMAs can help identify systematic bias and establish a better sampling strategy prior to performing high-throughput TMAs for biomarker studies.
27495060	rs1495741 as a tag single nucleotide polymorphism of N-acetyltransferase 2 acetylator phenotype associates bladder cancer risk and interacts with smoking: A systematic review and meta-analysis.	Rs1495741 has been identified to infer N-acetyltransferase 2 (NAT2) acetylator phenotype, and to decrease the risk of bladder cancer. However, a number of studies conducted in various regions showed controversial results. To quantify the association between rs1495741 and the risk of bladder cancer and to estimate the interaction effect of this genetic variant with smoking, we performed a systematic literature review and meta-analysis involving 14,815 cases and 58,282 controls from 29 studies. Our results indicates rs1495741 significantly associated with bladder cancer risk (OR = 0.85, 95% CI = 0.82-0.89, test for heterogeneity P = 0.36, I = 7.0%). And we verified this association in populations from Europe, America, and Asia. Further, our stratified meta-analysis showed rs1495741's role is typically evident only in ever smokers, which suggests its interaction with smoking. This study may provide new insight into gene-environment study on bladder cancer.
27492610	High-Risk Non-Muscle-Invasive Bladder Cancer-Therapy Options During Intravesical BCG Shortage.	Bladder cancer is the second commonest urinary tract malignancy with 70-80 % being non-muscle invasive (NMIBC) at diagnosis. Patients with high-risk NMIBC (T1/Tis, with high grade/G3, or CIS) represent a challenging group as they are at greater risk of recurrence and progression. Intravesical Bacilli Calmette-Guerin (BCG) is commonly used as first line therapy in this patient group but there is a current worldwide shortage. BCG has been shown to reduce recurrence in high-risk NMIBC and is more effective that other intravesical agents including mitomycin C, epirubicin, interferon-alpha and gemcitabine. Primary cystectomy offers a high change of cure in this cohort (80-90 %) and is a more radical treatment option which patients need to be counselled carefully about. Bladder thermotherapy and electromotive drug administration with mitomycin C are alternative therapies with promising short-term results although long-term follow-up data are lacking.
27486640	Empagliflozin (Jardiance). Type 2 diabetes: no rush to use this drug.	* In early 2016, metformin monotherapy remains the treatment of choice for most patients with type 2 diabetes. There are several alternatives for patients in whom metformin is poorly tolerated or ineffective. However, dapagliflozin and canagiflozin have an unfavourable harm-benefit balance and should not be used to enhance the action of metformin. Empagliflozin is the third glifozin to be authorised in the European Union for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of empaglifloznin, in combination with other glucose-lowering drugs, involved 7020 patients with type 2 diabetes, an average glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) concentration of about 8%, and a history of at least one cardiovascular event. After about 3 years of follow-up, overall mortality was lower with empagliflozin (5.7% versus 8.3%, p < 0.001), mainly due to a reduction in cardiovascular mortality, particularly due to heart failure. This benefit does not seem due to efficacy in preventing the cardiovascular complications of diabetes, as there was no difference between the groups in terms of myocardial infarction or stroke. The most likely explanation is an effect in preventing other cardiovascular disorders, such as heart failure, in patients with a history of cardiovascular disorders. This is consistent with the diuretic effect of empagliflozin and its rapid impact on mortality (within a matter of months in the trial), as well as with lower exposure to cardiovascular drugs and reduction in the risk of hospital admission for heart failure. In seven comparative trials, empagliflozin had only a moderate glucose-lowering action: among patients with an average baseline HbA1c of about 8%, the HbA1c fell by about 0.5% more with empagliflozin than with placebo. An even smaller effect was reported in patients with renal impairment. Empagliflozin shares the adverse effects of other gliflozins, including genital infections, kidney failure, and diabetic ketoacidosis. Empagliflozin may also be hepatotoxic. A risk of cancer (especially bladder cancer) cannot be ruled out. Empagliflozin interacts with nephrotoxic drugs, which aggravate its adverse effects and decrease its hypoglycaemic potency. The diuretic action of empagliflozin can lead to volume depletion and a fail in blood pressure, especially during co-administration with other diuretics or antihypertensive drugs. In practice, empagliflozin was found to reduce mortality in a clinical trial involving patients with type 2 diabetes and significant cardiovascular risk factors. This benefit does not seem to be related to the hypoglycaemic effect of empagliflozin or to prevention of the cardiovascular complications of diabetes, but rather to prevention of heart failure in patients with history of cardiovascular disease. In early 2016, it is unclear which patients are most likely to derive a concrete benefit from empagliflozin therapy. Comparative evaluation must continue, especially in patients with heart failure.
27485637	Dosimetric impact of different bladder and rectum filling during prostate cancer radiotherapy.	BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to analyze the influence of volumetric changes of bladder and rectum filling on the 3D dose distribution in prostate cancer radiotherapy. METHODS: A total of 314 cone-beam CT (CBCT) image data sets from 19 patients were enrolled in this study. For each CBCT, the bladder and rectum were contoured and volume sizes were normalized to those on their original CT. The daily delivered dose was recalculated on the CBCT images and the doses to bladder and rectum were investigated. Linear regression analysis was performed to identify the mean dose change of the volume change using SPSS 19. RESULTS: The data show that the variances of the normalized volume of the bladder and the rectum are 0.13-0.58 and 0.12-0.50 respectively. The variances of V70Gy, V60Gy, V50Gy, V40Gy and V30Gy of bladder are bigger than those of rectum for 17 patients. The linear regression analysis indicates a 10 % increase in bladder volume will cause a 5.6 % (+/-4.9 %) reduction in mean dose (p <0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The bladder's volume change is more significant than that of the rectum for the prostate cancer patient. The rectum volume variations are not significant except for air bubbles, which change the shape and the position of the rectum. The bladder volume variations may cause dose changes proportionately. Monitoring the bladder's volume before fractional treatment delivery will be crucial for accurate dose delivery.
27485165	MicroRNA-101 inhibits the proliferation and invasion of bladder cancer cells via targeting c-FOS.	MicroRNAs (miRs) have important roles in the parthenogenesis of malignancies. While it has been suggested that deregulation of miR101 is involved in bladder cancer, the underlying mechanisms have remained largely elusive. The present study aimed to investigate the roles of miR101 in the regulation of bladder cancer cell proliferation and invasion. Reversetranscription quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed that the expression of miR101 was significantly reduced in the HT1376, BIU87, T24 and 5637 several human bladder cancer cell lines compared to that in the SVHUC1 normal bladder epithelial cell line. Furthermore, a Targetscan search and a luciferase assay were used to identify cFOS as a novel target of miR101, and western blot analysis indicated that the protein expression of cFOS was shown to be negatively regulated by miR101 in bladder cancer T24 cells; however, cFOS mRNA expression was not affected. In addition, plasmidmediated overexpression of miR101 and small hairpin RNAmediated inhibition of cFOS significantly inhibited the proliferation and invasive capacity of T24 cells, as indicated by an MTT and a Transwell assay, respectively. However, plasmidmediated overexpression of cFOS reversed the inhibitory effects of miR101 overexpression on T24cell proliferation and invasion. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that miR101 inhibits the proliferation and invasion of bladder cancer cells, at least partly via targeting cFOS, suggesting that miR-101/cFOS signaling may represent a potential therapeutic target for bladder cancer.
27483723	ADENOCARCINOMA AND TUBERCULOSIS OF THE SIGMOID COLON AND FALLOPIAN TUBE--A RARE ASSOCIATION. A CASE REPORT AND REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE.	Association of adenocarcinoma and tuberculosis (TB) of the sigmoid colon is a rare clinical condition even in an endemic country as Romania, with challenging diagnosis and treatment. Case report. We present the case of a 57-year-old female patient who was admitted on emergency basis for a diagnosis of obstructive sigmoid adenocarcinoma. The patient was operated on and it an obstructive sigmoid tumor with serosal invasion, adherent (invading) to the body of uterus and left adnexa and urinary bladder serosa, no liver or peritoneal metastases. A sigmoidectomy was performed "en bloc" with subtotal hysterectomy, left adnexectomy and extramucosal cistectomy. The histopathological exam showed a moderately differentiated, ulcerated adenocarcinoma, widely infiltrating the colon wall invading the myometrium. Ziehl Neelsen (ZN) stain identified the presence of metachromatic bacillary structures in the colonic wall, lymph nodes and adnexal areas. Postoperative course was uneventful and the patient was discharged 10 days postoperatively in good clinical condition. After one year when the patient completed the full course of anti-tubercular drugs, a thorough work-up was performed. Colonoscopy, CT of the thorax, abdomen, pelvis showed no signs of recurrence while tumoral marker CEA (1.62 ng/ml - n<3.4) and QFT (Quantiferon-TB Gold) test were within normal range. Discussion and conclusion. Although digestive tuberculosis is included in differential diagnosis for those patients presenting abdominal pain or obstructive digestive symptoms in endemic regions, in this case the absence of TB infection criteria and positive endoscopic biopsy for colonic adenocarcinoma did not allow a complete pre- or perioperative diagnosis.
27476131	Robotic-Assisted Simple Prostatectomy: An Overview.	Despite widespread use of medical therapy for benign prostatic hyperplasia, a need remains for robust surgical therapy in select patients. Robotic-assisted simple prostatectomy (RASP) is an efficacious and safe therapy for patients with bladder outlet obstruction owing to large volume prostates. Data from 13 published cohorts suggest functional outcomes equivalent to open simple prostatectomy with substantially decreased length of hospital stay and risk of transfusion. However, there are few longer term data.
27476121	Review of Prostate Anatomy and Embryology and the Etiology of Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia.	Prostate development follows a common pattern between species and depends on the actions of androgens to induce and support ductal branching morphogenesis of buds emerging from the urogenital sinus. The human prostate has a compact zonal anatomy immediately surrounding the urethra and below the urinary bladder. Rodents have a lobular prostate with lobes radiating away from the urethra. The human prostate is the site of benign hyperplasia, prostate cancer, and prostatitis. The rodent prostate has little naturally occurring disease. Rodents can be used to model aspects of human benign hyperplasia, but care should be taken in data interpretation and extrapolation to the human condition.
27475647	Quantification of Circulating Free DNA as a Diagnostic Marker in Gall Bladder Cancer.	Gall bladder Carcinoma (GBC) is the fifth most common cancer of the digestive tract and frequently diagnosed in late stage of disease. Estimation of circulating free DNA (cfDNA) in serum has been applied as a "liquid biopsy" in several deep seated malignancies. Its value in diagnosis of gall bladder carcinoma has not been studied. The present study was designed to assess the role of cfDNA in the diagnosis of GBC and correlate levels with the TNM stage. Serum was collected from 34 patients with GBC and 39 age and sex matched controls including 22 cholecystitis and 17 healthy individuals. Serum cfDNA levels were measured through quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) by amplification of beta-globin gene. Performance of the assay was calculated through the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. The cfDNA level was significantly lower in healthy controls and cholecystitis (89.32 +/- 59.76 ng/ml, 174.21 +/- 99.93 ng/ml) compared to GBC (1245.91 +/- 892.46 ng/ml, p = <0.001). The cfDNA level was significantly associated with TNM stage, lymph node involvement and jaundice (0.002, 0.027, and 0.041, respectively). Area under curve of ROC analysis for cancer group versus healthy and cholecystitis group was 1.00 and 0.983 with sensitivity of 100 %, 88.24 % and specificity of 100 % respectively. Quantitative analysis of cfDNA may distinguish cholecystitis and gall bladder carcinoma and may serve as new diagnostic, noninvasive marker adjunct to imaging for the diagnosis of GBC.
27474270	Post-Irradiation Bladder Syndrome After Radiotherapy of Malignant Neoplasm of Small Pelvis Organs: An Observational, Non-Interventional Clinical Study Assessing VESIcare(R)/Solifenacin Treatment Results.	BACKGROUND Radiotherapy is explicitly indicated as one of the excluding factors in diagnosing overactive bladder syndrome (OAB). Nevertheless, symptoms of OAB such as urgent episodes, incontinence, pollakiuria, and nocturia, which are consequences of irradiation, led us to test the effectiveness of VESIcare(R)/Solifenacin in patients demonstrating these symptoms after radiation therapy of small pelvis organs due to malignant neoplasm. MATERIAL AND METHODS We conducted an observatory clinical study including 300 consecutive patients with symptoms of post-irradiation bladder; 271 of those patients completed the study. The observation time was 6 months and consisted of 3 consecutive visits taking place at 12-week intervals. We used VESIcare(R) at a dose of 5 mg a day. Every sixth patient was examined urodynamically at the beginning and at the end of the observation period, with an inflow speed of 50 ml/s. RESULTS We noticed improvement and decline in the average number of episodes a day in the following parameters: number of micturitions a day (-36%, P<0.01), nocturia (-50%, P<0.01), urgent episodes (-41%, P<0.03), and episodes of incontinence (-43%, P<0.01). The patients' quality of life improved. The average maximal cystometric volume increased by 34 ml (21%, p<0.01), average bladder volume of "first desire" increased by 42 ml (49%, P<0.01), and average detrusor muscle pressure at maximal cystometric volume diminished by 9 cmH2O (-36%, P<0.03). CONCLUSIONS The substance is well-tolerated. Solifenacin administered long-term to patients with symptoms of OAB after radiotherapy of a malignant neoplasm of the small pelvis organs has a daily impact in decreasing number of urgent episodes, incontinence, pollakiuria, and nocturia.
27473739	A Review of Outcomes for Stage Ta Bladder Tumors.	OBJECTIVES: Using data from former reports, this study reviews and analyzes the outcomes of tumor recurrence, tumor progression, and tumor-specific survival of patients with stage Ta bladder tumors. METHODS: Data were collected from 19 longitudinal studies of outcomes after the first diagnosis of tumor and collected as individual patient results, that is, as failure times from the first tumor to any of the three outcomes. Altogether, there were 14,252 patients, including 4,050 for the outcome of tumor recurrence, 2,937 for the outcome of tumor progression, and 11,595 for the outcome of disease-specific survival (some patients were available for more than one outcome). RESULTS: In these data, the mean time to additional tumors was 7.8 years, the mean time to an invasive tumor was 19.5 years, and the mean tumor-specific survival time was 27.2 years. All three outcomes were significantly related to the 2004 World Health Organization (WHO) tumor grades. CONCLUSIONS: Although greater than 50% of those with stage Ta bladder tumors have additional bladder tumors, approximately 80% appear to follow a benign course without developing invasive tumors or dying of bladder cancer. The 2004 WHO grading scheme accounts for some but not all of the prognostic information.
27472455	Aminoglycoside-derived amphiphilic nanoparticles for molecular delivery.	The development of effective drug carriers can lead to improved outcomes in a variety of disease conditions. Aminoglycosides have been used as antibacterial therapeutics, and are attractive as monomers for the development of polymeric materials in various applications. Here, we describe the development of novel aminoglycoside-derived amphiphilic nanoparticles for drug delivery, with an eye towards ablation of cancer cells. The aminoglycoside paromomycin was first cross-linked with resorcinol diglycidyl ether leading to the formation of a poly (amino ether), PAE. PAE molecules were further derivatized with methoxy-terminated poly(ethylene glycol) or mPEG resulting in the formation of mPEG-PAE polymer, which self-assembled to form nanoparticles. Formation of the mPEG-PAE amphiphile was characterized using (1)H NMR, (13)C NMR, gel permeation chromatography (GPC) and FTIR spectroscopy. Self-assembly of the polymer into nanoparticles was characterized using dynamic light scattering, zeta potential analyses, atomic force microscopy (AFM) and the pyrene fluorescence assay. mPEG-PAE nanoparticles were able to carry significant amounts of doxorubicin (DOX), presumably by means of hydrophobic interactions between the drug and the core. Cell-based studies indicated that mPEG-PAE nanoparticles, loaded with doxorubicin, were able to induce significant loss in viabilities of PC3 human prostate cancer, MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer, and MB49 murine bladder cancer cells; empty nanoparticles resulted in negligible losses of cell viability under the conditions investigated. Taken together, our results indicate that the mPEG-PAE nanoparticle platform is attractive for drug delivery in different applications, including cancer.
27466547	Investigating Urinary Conditions Prior to Robot-assisted Radical Prostatectomy in Search of a Desirable Method for Evaluating Post-prostatectomy Incontinence.	The aims of the study were to investigate desirable evaluation methods for post-prostatectomy incontinence (PPI) by analyzing the urinary status before robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP).Questionnaires were evaluated from 155 patients prior to operation. The 24-h pad test before RARP revealed a weight of 1.1 g. The mean scores were as follows: total International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire-Short Form (ICIQ-SF) score, 1.2; total International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), 10.0; IPSS quality of life, 2.7; Overactive Bladder Symptom Score (OABSS), 2.9; and Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite urinary summary, 92.8. The abdominal leak point pressure test in 111 patients before RARP was negative in all cases. Desirable evaluation methods for PPI should be based on a combination of subjective and objective evaluations and comparisons between pre- and post-RP. ICIQ-SF is considerably convenient for evaluating incontinence, and the 24-h pad test enables evaluation of the incontinence volume in a highly objective manner.
27466512	Effect of Adjuvant Radiotherapy on Survival in Patients with Locoregional Urothelial Malignancies of the Upper Urinary Tract.	BACKGROUND: While radical nephroureterectomy is the treatment of choice for localized or regional urothelial carcinoma of the upper urinary tract (UTUC), the role of adjuvant radiotherapy is unclear, with conflicting data from various small studies. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We sought to study the impact of adjuvant radiotherapy on UTUC by utilizing the Survelliance, Epidemiolgy, and End Results (SEER) 9 database from 1998-2011. RESULTS: Of 2,572 identified cases, 113 patients (4.4%) received adjuvant radiotherapy, with a median age of 74 years (range=22-100 years). In univariate analysis, patients treated with adjuvant radiation therapy seemed to have a lower survival time than those without radiation therapy (19 months versus 31 months, p<0.05). However, after adjusting for covariates, including age at diagnosis, gender, race, year of diagnosis, stage, histological grade and surgery, radiation therapy did not seem to influence survival (hazard ratio=0.68; 95% confidence interval=0.68-1.06, p=0.85). CONCLUSION: This hypothesis-generating, population-based analysis shows that adjuvant radiotherapy may not influence survival among patients with locoregional UTUC.
27466500	Evaluation of Global Histone Acetylation Levels in Bladder Cancer Patients.	BACKGROUND/AIM: Alterations of global histone modification levels have been identified in various tumor entities, including bladder cancer (BCA). Our study was designed to investigate the value of global histone acetylation levels as diagnostic and prognostic biomarker for BCA patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A tissue microarray with formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues (271 BCA and 29 normal urothelial samples) was used to determine global histone acetylation levels (histone H3 acetylation (H3Ac); histone H3 lysine 18 acetylation (H3K18Ac); histone H4 acetylation (H4Ac)). RESULTS: Global H3Ac levels were decreased in BCA patients, whereas H3K18Ac and H4Ac levels were similar in both groups. All studied histone acetylation markers were lower in muscle-invasive BCA compared to non-muscle invasive BCA and normal urothelial tissue, thereby indicating a possible prognostic relevance. CONCLUSION: Global histone acetylation levels undergo quantitative alterations during bladder cancer progression and could be helpful to identify patients at risk for early cancer recurrence.
27462702	Oncological Outcomes of Patients with Concomitant Bladder and Urethral Carcinoma.	INTRODUCTION: The study aimed to investigate oncological outcomes of patients with concomitant bladder cancer (BC) and urethral carcinoma. METHODS: This is a multicenter series of 110 patients (74 men, 36 women) diagnosed with urethral carcinoma at 10 referral centers between 1993 and 2012. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to investigate the impact of BC on survival, and Cox regression multivariable analysis was performed to identify predictors of recurrence. RESULTS: Synchronous BC was diagnosed in 13 (12%) patients, and the median follow-up was 21 months (interquartile range 4-48). Urethral cancers were of higher grade in patients with synchronous BC compared to patients with non-synchronous BC (p = 0.020). Patients with synchronous BC exhibited significantly inferior 3-year recurrence-free survival (RFS) compared to patients with non-synchronous BC (63.2 vs. 34.4%; p = 0.026). In multivariable analysis, inferior RFS was associated with clinically advanced nodal stage (p < 0.001), proximal tumor location (p < 0.001) and synchronous BC (p = 0.020). CONCLUSION: The synchronous presence of BC in patients diagnosed with urethral carcinoma has a significant adverse impact on RFS and should be an impetus for a multimodal approach.
27461832	Urinary bladder carcinoma with divergent differentiation featuring small cell carcinoma, sarcomatoid carcinoma, and liposarcomatous component.	Both small cell carcinoma and sarcomatoid carcinoma of the urinary bladder are highly aggressive tumors, and a concurrence of these tumors is extremely rare. We report a case of urinary bladder cancer with small cell carcinoma as a predominant component, accompanied by sarcomatoid carcinoma and conventional urothelial carcinoma (UC). Although the small cell carcinoma component had resolved on receiving chemoradiotherapy, rapid growth of the residual tumor led to a fatal outcome. A 47-year-old man presented with occasional bladder irritation and had a 2-year history of asymptomatic hematuria. Cystoscopy revealed a huge mass in the urinary bladder, and transurethral resection was performed. Microscopically, small cell carcinoma was detected as the major tumor component. Spindle-shaped sarcomatoid cells were also observed that were intermingled with small cell carcinoma and conventional UC. In addition, a sheet-like growth of the lipoblast-like neoplastic cells was observed focally. Initially, by providing chemoradiotherapy, we achieved a marked tumor regression; however, the tumor rapidly regrew after the completion of chemoradiotherapy, and the patient underwent radical cystectomy. Only conventional UC and sarcomatoid carcinoma were identified in the cystectomy specimen. The patient died of the disease 4 months after cystectomy. Urinary bladder cancer may include a combination of multiple aggressive histologies as in the present case. Because the variation in the tumor components may affect the efficacy of therapy, a correct diagnosis of every tumor component is necessary.
27461691	Predicting genitourinary toxicity in three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy for localized prostate cancer: A dose-volume parameters analysis of the bladder.	PURPOSE: In prostate cancer radiotherapy, the relationship between genitourinary (GU) toxicity and clinical-dosimetric parameters is debated. We report our analysis of the parameters associated with GU toxicity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighty-six consecutive patients treated with conformal radiotherapy for localized prostate cancer were retrospectively analyzed; the bladder was delineated both as "whole bladder" (WB: Defined in its entirety as a solid organ) and "inferior bladder" (IB: Corresponding to the distal part of the bladder). GU toxicity and dose-volume parameters were correlated using the point biserial correlation coefficient. The normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) cut-off volume model was fitted to toxicity data; univariate analysis between GU toxicity and clinical parameters was done. RESULTS: Acute GU toxicity was correlated to doses higher than 80 Gy (P < 0.05) while late GU was correlated to doses higher than 77 Gy for WB and from 77.5 Gy for IB. The NTCP cut-off volume model identified for both WB and IB a bladder volume of 6 cc receiving a dose >/=77 Gy corresponding to a 50% probability of GU toxicity. At univariate analysis, acute GU toxicity was correlated with smoke (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Bladder maximal doses quantified as hotspots show a correlation to GU toxicity.
27461684	Dosimetric comparison of different treatment planning techniques with International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements Report-83 recommendations in adjuvant pelvic radiotherapy of gynecological malignancies.	AIM: The study evaluates the different treatment planning techniques according to three recommendation levels of the International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements Report-83 in gynecologic cancer patients treated with adjuvant pelvic radiotherapy (APR). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Computerized tomography images of ten endometrial and cervical cancer patients who were treated with APR were assessed. For each patient, five different treatment plans were created. One homogeneity index and four different conformity indexes (CIs) were calculated for three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT), field-in-field (FIF), seven-field intensity modulated radiotherapy (7-IMRT) with two different degrees beginning (7A-IMRT, 7B-IMRT) and 9-IMRT treatment plans. Dose volume histogram parameters and normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) were compared for organs at risk (OAR). RESULTS: The CI values of the IMRT were closer to 1 with respect to other plans (P < 0.05). The rectum and the bladder volumes which received more than 40 Gy were decreased with IMRT compared to 3D-CRT (P < 0.05). Doses received by the 195 cc volume of the small intestine and NTCP values were significantly decreased with IMRT (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: IMRT provided more protection than FIF plans at high dose volumes of the OAR; however, it did not show any superiority at low-dose volumes. The NTCP results supported IMRT for only small intestine protection. Because IMRT is increasingly used clinically, the comparison of NTCP will become more common in the near future. Therefore, new prospective studies with sufficient number of patients and appropriate NTCP models are needed for this treatment modality.
27461645	A clinicoepidemiological study of young age bladder tumors: An eastern Indian scenario.	INTRODUCTION: Though, bladder cancer is one of the most common urological malignancies, studies addressing the young age group bladder tumors are rare. Present study was done to determine the clinicoepidemiological aspects of bladder tumor diagnosed in young age patients and to compare these aspects with elderly patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with urinary bladder tumor were selectively divided into two groups; young (<40 years) and elderly (>60 years). Groups were compared on various parameters and statistically analyzed using Fisher's exact two-tailed test. RESULTS: Smoking, tea and coffee intake and exposure of dye were found significantly associated with development of bladder tumor. Most of the tumors in young age were small, solitary, and papillomatous. Transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) was the most common histological subtype, though most were of low grade and were non-muscle invasive in comparison to the tumors in elderly group. CONCLUSION: The incidence of bladder cancer is common in younger age group. Active and passive cigarette smoking, tea, coffee intake, and exposure to organic dyes are major risk factor for younger age group bladder tumor in this part of world. TCC is most common histological subtype and most of them are in low grade without muscle invasion.
27461617	Association of ABO blood types and clinicopathological features of ureteral transitional cell carcinoma in a single-center in China.	PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the correlation of ABO blood types and clinicopathological characteristics of patients with ureteral transitional cell carcinoma. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In our study, an entire cohort of 239 patients who were pathological diagnosed as ureteral transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) between February 2002 and March 2010 were reviewed retrospectively. Variables including demographic features, tumor grades, tumor stages, type of surgery and number of tumors as well as ABO blood types status were evaluated. The relationship between the ABO blood group and clinicopathological variables was assessed by Chi-squared analysis. RESULTS: The ratio of male to female was 1: 1.12. The median age at diagnosis was 68.5 years. A total of 111 neoplasms located in the right ureter. A total of 218 patients had radical nephroureterectomy (RNU). Multifocality was observed in 32 patients. The pathology was as follow: Grade 1 (seven cases), Grade 2 (110 cases) and Grade 3 (122 cases); Ta and T1 (83 cases), T2-T4 (156 cases). The distribution of ABO blood types was A, B, O and AB in 70 (29.3%), 76 (31.8%), 66 (27.6%) and 27 (11.3%), respectively. There were no significant differences in the clinicopathological variables among individuals with different ABO blood types. In a subgroup analysis, B and O group showed a worse tumor stage compared with A and AB groups (P = 0.01). CONCLUSION: B and O blood types are at higher risk of muscle invasive ureteral TCC as compared with A and AB blood types. We suggest ABO blood types to be taken into consideration when urologists select therapeutic schemes for individuals with ureteral TCC.
27460088	Overexpression of long non-coding RNA TUG1 predicts poor prognosis and promotes cancer cell proliferation and migration in high-grade muscle-invasive bladder cancer.	Long non-coding RNA TUG1 is involved in the development and progression of a variety of tumors. Little is known about TUG1 function in high-grade muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC). The aims of our study were to determine expression levels of long non-coding RNA TUG1 in tumor tissue, to evaluate its relationship with clinico-pathological features of high-grade MIBC, and to describe its function in MIBC cells in vitro. TUG1 expression levels were determined in paired tumor and adjacent non-tumor bladder tissues of 47 patients with high-grade MIBC using real-time PCR. Cell line T-24 and siRNA silencing were used to study the TUG1 function in vitro. We observed significantly increased levels of TUG1 in tumor tissue in comparison to adjacent non-tumor bladder tissue (P < 0.0001). TUG1 levels were significantly increased in metastatic tumors (P = 0.0147) and were associated with shorter overall survival of MIBC patients (P = 0.0241). TUG1 silencing in vitro led to 34 % decrease in cancer cell proliferation (P = 0.0004) and 23 % reduction in migration capacity of cancer cells (P < 0.0001). We did not observe any significant effects of TUG1 silencing on cell cycle distribution and number of apoptotic cells. Our study confirmed overexpression of TUG1 in MIBC tumor tissue and described its association with worse overall survival in high-grade MIBC patients. Together with in vitro observations, these data suggest an oncogenic role of TUG1 and its potential usage as biomarker or therapeutic target in MIBC.
27457483	Ct2 Bladder Cancer.	The patient is an 80-year-old man who presented with gross hematuria. His past medical history indicates he was a cigarette smoker with 50 pack/years. He was successfully treated for carcinoma of the lung 7 years ago. He received chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery. He has mild COPD but has a good performance status. His laboratory studies do not indicate any abnormalities in terms of renal function. He does not have any significant cardiac disease. He has a medium build. He had prostate cancer and underwent a successful radical prostatectomy 10 years ago. His PSA is undetectable. He has some urinary incontinence and wears two pads/day. He underwent the appropriate investigations for gross hematuria. A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis was normal with the exception of a 4-cm posterior mass in the bladder. There was no hydronephrosis and no enlarged lymph nodes. He underwent a transurethral resection of a solitary bladder tumor performed by another urologist. The tumor was described as large and sessile. It was located on the posterior wall and was approximately 4 cm. The bimanual examination did not reveal a mass. The pathology report stated that the tumor was a high-grade urothelial carcinoma with invasion into the muscularis propria. There was no lymphovascular invasion. I performed a reTURBT, and at that procedure, I did not identify any obvious tumor but the prior resection site was evident. I resected the prior tumor site quite extensively both in depth and width. The pathology revealed only focal carcinoma in situ. There was ample muscle in the specimen and there was some fat as well. As stated, they were free of any cancer. The patient is receptive to any treatment approach.
27456363	Reprogramming bladder cancer cells for studying cancer initiation and progression.	The induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology is the forced expression of specific transcription factors in somatic cells resulting in transformation into self-renewing, pluripotent cells which possess the ability to differentiate into any type of cells in the human body. While malignant cells could also be reprogrammed into iPSC-like cells with lower efficiency due to the genetic and epigenetic barriers in cancer cells, only a limited number of cancer cell types could be successfully reprogrammed until today. In the present study, we aimed at reprogramming two bladder cancer cell lines HTB-9 and T24 using a non-integrating Sendai virus (SeV) system. We have generated six sub-clones using distinct combinations of four factors-OCT4, SOX2, KLF4 and c-MYC-in two bladder cancer cell lines. Only a single sub-clone, T24 transduced with 4Fs, gave rise to iPSC-like cells. Bladder cancer cell-derived T24 4F cells represent unique features of pluripotent cells such as epithelial-like morphology, colony-forming ability, expression of pluripotency-associated markers and bearing the ability to differentiate in vitro. This is the first study focusing on the reprogramming susceptibility of two different bladder cancer cell lines to nuclear reprogramming. Further molecular characterisation of T24 4F cells could provide a better insight for biomarker research in bladder carcinogenesis and could offer a valuable tool for the development of novel therapeutic approaches in bladder carcinoma.
27455559	[THE SOMATIC MUTATIONS AND ABERRANT METHYLATION AS POTENTIAL GENETIC MARKERS OF URINARY BLADDER CANCER].	All around the world, more than 330 thousands cases of bladder cancer are registered annually hence representing actual problem of modern oncology. Still in demand are search and characteristic of new molecular markers of bladder cancer detecting in tumor cells from urinary sediment and having high diagnostic accuracy. The studies of last decade, especially using methods of genome-wide sequencing, permitted to receive a large amount of experimental data concerning development and progression of bladder cancer The review presents systematic analysis of publications available in PubMed data base mainly of last five years. The original studies of molecular genetic disorders under bladder cancer and meta-analyzes were considered This approach permitted to detected the most common local alterations of DNA under bladder cancer which can be detected using routine genetic methods indifferent clinical material and present prospective interest for development of test-systems. The molecular genetic markers of disease can be activating missense mutations in 7 and 10 exons of gene of receptor of growth factor of fibroblasts 3 (FGFR3), 9 and 20 exons of gene of Phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bi-phosphate-3-kinase (PIK3CA) and mutation in -124 and -146 nucleotides in promoter of gene of catalytic subunit telomerase (TERT). The development of test-systems on the basis of aberrant methylation of CpG-islets of genes-suppressors still is seemed as a difficult task because of differences in pattern of methylation of different primary tumors at various stages of clonal evolution of bladder cancer though they can be considered as potential markers.
27453746	Outcome of urinary bladder cancer after combined therapies.	RATIONALE: Urinary bladder cancer is the fourth most common cancer in men and the eighth in women, being an important public health issue. OBJECTIVE: to assess the outcome of patients with urinary bladder cancer treated in an oncologic center. METHODS: Medical files of 155 patients (132M/ 23F) with urinary bladder cancer treated between 2006 and 2012 were retrospectively analyzed. The median age at diagnosis was 65 years (range: 19-85 years). Disease free survival (DFS) for patients with complete tumor resection receiving adjuvant treatment and progression free survival (PFS) for patients with post-operative residual disease was estimated. RESULTS: Stage disease's distribution was: 50 patients (32.2%) stage II, 47 (30.3%) stage III, 58 (37.4%) stage IV. Radical cystectomy was performed in 56 patients (36.1%), while 99 patients (63.9%) underwent repeated transurethral resection of the urinary bladder tumor (TURBT). The postoperative treatment included multimodal therapy in 47 patients (30.3%) (chemotherapy and external beam radiation), external beam radiation alone in 57 patients (36.8%) and chemotherapy alone (methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin, and cisplatin-MVAC or gemcitabine + platinum) in 51 patients (32.9%). After a median follow-up of 31 months (range: 3-79 months), 51 patients (32.9%) presented local recurrence, 32 patients (21%) distant recurrence (metastases), 10 patients (6.4%) both local and distant recurrence, and 62 patients (40%) were free of disease. The median duration until progression was of 27 months. DISCUSSION: Despite combined therapy approaches, urinary bladder carcinoma remains an aggressive disease, with high relapse rate. Earlier diagnosis and an aggressive radical surgery with the intention to cure (cystectomy), and adjuvant multimodal treatment (radiotherapy and chemotherapy) are needed for survival improvement.
27451077	Common and differentially expressed long noncoding RNAs for the characterization of high and low grade bladder cancer.	Our study aimed to explore long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) contributing to the development of bladder cancer, as well as to identify more critical DEGs and lncRNAs that would characterize low- and high-grade bladder cancer. The microarray data of GSE55433 was downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus database, including 57 urothelial cancer samples (23 low-grade NMI, 14 high-grade NMI and 20 invasive tumors) and 26 normal controls. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and differentially expressed lncRNAs were identified in 3 groups (low-grade NMI vs. normal, high-grade NMI vs. normal and invasive UC vs. normal). Functional enrichment analysis was performed upon the DEGs in different groups. Besides, protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed based on common DEGs and remaining DEGs in each group. Co-expression analysis was performed to identify the co-expressed DEG-lncRNAs pairs. Different number of DEGs and differentially expressed lncRNAs were respectively identified from those 3 groups. NONHSAG013805 (down-regulated) and NONHSAG009271 (down-regulated) were common lncRNAs. NONHSAG013805 was connected with the down-regulated gene EIF3E and NONHSAG009271 was linked to MYL12A (down-regulated). Moreover, NONHSAG034203 (up-regulated) was co-expressed with ADM5 (up-regulated) in low-grade NMI cancer, while the down-regulated NONHSAG045391 was connected with the down-regulated DEGs DAD1 and STUB1 in high-grade NMI cancer and invasive bladder cancer. Our study indicates that NONHSAG013805 and NONHSAG009271 may play key roles in bladder cancer via co-expressing with EIF3E and MYL12A, respectively. Moreover, NONHSAG034203 may be involved in low-grade NMI bladder cancer via targeting ADM5, while NONHSAG045391 may contribute to high-grade NMI and invasive bladder cancer via targeting DAD1 and STUB1.
27450420	Template-based lymphadenectomy reduces the risk of regional lymph node recurrence among patients with upper/middle ureteral cancer.	BACKGROUND: Our previous nonrandomized prospective study showed that template-based lymphadenectomy improved survival among patients with renal pelvic cancer but not among patients with ureteral cancer. However, regional node sites vary according to the tumor's location in relation to the ureter. Therefore, this retrospective study examined the therapeutic role of lymphadenectomy for ureteral cancer according to tumor location. METHODS: Between January 1988 and September 2015, we performed nephroureterectomy for 154 patients with nonmetastatic urothelial carcinoma of the ureter at two Japanese institutions. The tumors' locations were classified as the lower ureter or the upper/middle ureter (before the cranial crossing of the common iliac artery). The appropriate regional nodes were identified based on our previous mapping study. Dissection was classified as complete lymphadenectomy (all regional sites were dissected), incomplete lymphadenectomy (not all sites were dissected), or no lymphadenectomy. We focused the analyses on patients with >/=pT2 disease to clarify the effect of the lymphadenectomy. RESULTS: Among the 48 patients with upper/middle ureteral cancer, recurrence-free and cancer-specific survival were significantly higher in the complete lymphadenectomy group (vs. the incomplete or no lymphadenectomy groups). However, there were no differences in recurrence-free and cancer-specific survivals among the 56 patients with lower ureteral cancer. In the patients with upper/middle ureteral cancer, multivariate analysis revealed that template-based lymphadenectomy was independently associated with a reduced risk of cancer-specific mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Template-based lymphadenectomy has a therapeutic benefit for treating patients with upper/middle ureteral cancer but not for treating patients with lower ureteral cancer.
27448817	Cytokeratin-19 fragment in the diagnosis of bladder carcinoma.	The results of previous studies evaluated the accuracy of serum, and urinary measurements of cytokeratin-19 fragment (CYFRA 21-1) for the diagnosis of bladder cancer were inconsistent. We read with great interest the recent systematic review of diagnostic accuracy of CYFRA 21-1 for bladder cancer by Huang et al. The systematic analysis demonstrated that the pooled sensitivities and specificities for serum and urine CYFRA 21-1 were 0.42 (95 % confidence interval (CI), 0.33-0.51), 0.82 (95 % CI, 0.70-0.90), 0.94 (95 % CI, 0.90-0.96), and 0.80 (95 % CI, 0.73-0.86), respectively. Areas under the summary receiver-operating-characteristic curves for serum and urine CYFRA 21-1 were 0.88 (95 % CI, 0.85-0.91) and 0.87 (95%CI, 0.84-0.90), respectively. The authors considered that both serum and urine CYFRA 21-1 served as efficient indexes for bladder-cancer diagnosis. We congratulate and applaud their important work, but several important issues should be noted.
27446968	Seminal Fluid-Mediated Inflammation in Physiology and Pathology of the Female Reproductive Tract.	Inflammation is a multifaceted process involving a host of resident and recruited immune cells that eliminate the insult or injury and initiate tissue repair. In the female reproductive tract (FMRT), inflammation-mediated alterations in epithelial, vascular, and immune functions are important components of complex physiological processes and many local and systemic pathologies. It is well established that intracoital and postcoital function of seminal fluid (SF) goes beyond nutritive support for the spermatozoa cells. SF, in particular, the inflammatory bioactive lipids, and prostaglandins present in vast quantities in SF, have a role in localized immune modulation and regulation of pathways that can exacerbate inflammation in the FMRT. In sexually active women SF-mediated inflammation has been implicated in physiologic processes such as ovulation, implantation, and parturition while also enhancing tumorigenesis and susceptibility to infection. This review highlights the molecular mechanism by which SF regulates inflammatory pathways in the FMRT and how alterations in these pathways contribute to physiology and pathology of the female reproductive function. In addition, based on findings from TaqMan(R) 96-Well Plate Arrays, on neoplastic cervical cells treated with SF, we discuss new findings on the role of SF as a potent driver of inflammatory and tumorigenic pathways in the cervix.

27441528	THE FIRST REPORT OF LAPAROSCOPIC RADICAL CYSTECTOMY IN GEORGIA.	Bladder cancer is the ninth most commonly diagnosed malignant tumor worldwide. Radical cystectomy is the standard surgical treatment for non-metastatic, muscle-invasive bladder cancer and a recommended treatment of choice in a subset of highest-risk patients with non-muscle invasive disease. Recently, laparoscopic radical cystectomy has become an attractive alternative to an open counterpart and many centers worldwide have reported their early experiences with the technique. Laparoscopic radical cystectomy is a technically challenging procedure and current recommendations still consider it, with or without robotic assistance, to be experimental due to absence of long-term data on oncological and functional outcomes and possible selection bias in the reported series. In this paper, we report the case of a 61 year-old male with a muscle-invasive recurrence of bladder cancer, who underwent laparoscopic radical cystectomy at the National Centre of Urology in Tbilisi, Georgia. This is the first such procedure performed in Georgia and most of the former Soviet countries, with the exception, to our knowledge, of only the Russian Federation. The technique of laparoscopic radical cystectomy with simultaneous prepubic urethrectomy, extended pelvic lymph node dissection, and extracorporeal urinary diversion in the form of an ileal conduit is described. Laparoscopic radical cystectomy is a feasible minimally-invasive alternative to the standard open surgery when performed by experienced surgeons in selected patients. We deem the introduction of the technique a step forward in the field of minimally invasive urology in Georgia.
27435953	A20 SNP rs77191406 may be related to secondary cancer for rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus patients.	AIM: An increased risk for malignancy for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients may be related to factors that play a critical role in the regulation of T-cell activation. A20 is an important negative immunoregulatory factor that was found to be associated with lymphoma and the development of numerous solid tumors. Previous studies have implicated the A20 locus in RA susceptibility. In this study, we investigated polymorphisms in the A20 3' UTR and explored whether there was an association between these polymorphisms and malignancy risk in autoimmune diseases. METHODS: PCR and sequencing were used to identify A20 gene polymorphisms in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 99 RA cases, 37 SLE cases and 99 healthy individuals. Pearson's Chi square test was used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: Only one SNP (rs77191406) and one new mutation (20132 A>G) in A20 gene were identified in RA and SLE patients and healthy individuals. Heterozygous rs77191406 was identified in just 1 of 99 RA patients and 2 of 37 SLE patients. More importantly, a RA patient who was heterozygous for rs77191406 developed colon cancer 10 years after the RA diagnosis. Similarly, two SLE patients carrying rs77191406 (heterozygous) had severe disease or developed bladder cancer 5 years after SLE diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that rs77191406 may be a prognostic marker for a high risk for rapid malignancy progression, poor survival and refractory disease and a new molecular marker associated with autoimmune diseases transforming into a secondary cancer.
27435583	Hemorrhagic Complications of Percutaneous Cryoablation for Renal Tumors: Results from a 7-year Prospective Study.	PURPOSE: Cryoablation of renal tumors is assumed to have a higher risk of hemorrhagic complications compared to other ablative modalities. Our purpose was to establish the exact risk and to identify hemorrhagic risk factors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This IRB approved, 7-year prospective study included 261 renal cryoablations. Procedures were under conscious sedation and CT guidance. Pre- and postablation CT was obtained, and hemorrhagic complications were CTCAE tabulated. Age, gender, tumor size, histology, and probes number were tested based on averages or proportions using their exact permutation distribution. "High-risk" subgroups (those exceeding the thresholds of all variables) were tested for each variable alone, and for all combinations of variable threshold values. We compared the subgroup with the best PPV using one variable, with the subgroup with the best PPV using all variables (McNemmar test). RESULTS: The hemorrhagic complication rate was 3.5 %. Four patients required transfusions, two required emergent angiograms, one required both a transfusion and angiogram, and two required bladder irrigation for outlet obstruction. Perirenal space hemorrhage was more clinically significant than elsewhere. Univariate risks were tumor size >2 cm, number of probes >2, and malignant histology (P = 0.005, 0.002, and 0.033, respectively). Multivariate analysis showed that patients >55 years with malignant tumors >2 cm requiring 2 or more probes yielded the highest PPV (7.5 %). CONCLUSIONS: Although older patients (>55 years old) with larger (>2 cm), malignant tumors have an increased risk of hemorrhagic complications, the low PPV does not support the routine use of embolization. Percutaneous cryoablation has a 3.5 % risk of significant hemorrhage, similar to that reported for other types of renal ablative modalities.
27434291	Decreased expression of LncRNA MIR31HG in human bladder cancer.	OBJECTIVE: In this study, we examined the relationships between the expression level of long non-coding RNA MIR31HG in bladder cancer and the clinical characteristics. METHODS: A total of 55 tissue samples from patients with bladder cancer were collected, and the lncRNA MIR31HG levels in cancer, paired non-cancer tissues and BC cell lines were detected by real-time quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR). The relationships between MIR31HG level and the clinical characteristics were evaluated. RESULTS: MIR31HG expression was remarkably decreased in bladder cancer tissues compared with adjacent noncancerous tissues (P < 0.05). MIR31HG expression was also significantly down-regulated in four bladder cancer cell lines (P < 0.001). Clinicopathologic analysis revealed that MIR31HG expression was negatively associated with TNM stage (P = 0.010), but not with other clinicopathological characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: These findings revealed that MIR31HG may function as a cancer-suppressor gene to participate in the bladder cancer carcinogenesis and development.
27434279	Metastatic urinary tract cancers in pap test: Cytomorphologic findings and differential diagnosis.	Although the cervical Pap test was devised for the detection of primary cervical neoplasia, it can provide additional diagnostic information, and in some cases, be diagnostic for noncervical processes. The diagnosis of metastatic extrauterine cervical cancers on the Pap test is extremely rare; and in most cases, it is the result of an ovarian or fallopian tube primary. Further, urinary tract cancers, including renal and urinary primaries are exceedingly rare. To our knowledge, six surgical cases of metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC) have been described. We report the first case of metastatic clear cell RCC detected on the cervical Pap test. Additionally, to our knowledge, we report the second case of metastatic high-grade urothelial carcinoma detected on the cervical Pap test. Both patients had a history of malignancy, which underscore the importance of broadening the differential diagnosis to rule out cytomorphologic features consistent with a patient's primary diagnosis when interpreting the cervical Pap test.

27432454	Smoking effect on secondary bladder cancer after external beam radiotherapy for prostate cancer.	OBJECTIVE: Although it is well known that radiotherapy for prostate cancer increases comorbid rate of secondary bladder cancer, the effect of aging and smoking with radiotherapy on incidence rate of secondary bladder cancer remains unknown. Then, this study investigated the combinational effect of external beam radiotherapy for prostate cancer and aging or smoking on comorbid rate of secondary bladder cancer. METHODS: This study included 754 Japanese patients with prostate cancer treated with radiotherapy (n = 319) and radical prostatectomy (n = 435) from 2000 through 2013. The relationship between therapeutic modality for prostate cancer as well as age or smoking status and comorbid rate of secondary bladder cancer was examined. RESULTS: During the median follow-up period of 4.3 and 3.1 years, secondary bladder cancer occurred in 11 (3.4%) and 5 (1.1%) of patients with prostate cancer treated with external beam radiotherapy and radical prostatectomy, respectively. The 5-year bladder cancer-free survival rate was 97.3% in the external beam radiotherapy group and 99.4% in the radical prostatectomy group. Age (hazard ratio = 1.15, P = 0.027) and ever smoking (hazard ratio = 5.65, P = 0.011) were significant predictive factors of secondary bladder cancer incidence in the external beam radiotherapy cohort, but not in the radical prostatectomy cohort. Inversely, among men with ever smoking, but not among older men, external beam radiotherapy (hazard ratio = 9.64, P = 0.0052) was a significant risk factor of secondary bladder cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these findings suggest that smoking history might be one of criteria to choose radical prostatectomy than external beam radiotherapy for prostate cancer, and that age would not be a criterion for therapeutic selection in terms of secondary bladder cancer.
27432379	Preoperative Imaging for Clinical Staging Prior to Radical Cystectomy.	The importance of patient selection for quality outcomes following radical cystectomy is critical. Clinical staging is one of the key elements necessary for patient selection, and staging relies on accurate preoperative imaging. Many imaging modalities are available and have been utilized for preoperative staging with published operating characteristics. In this update, we review recently published literature for advances in preoperative imaging prior to radical cystectomy.
27431499	PSA nadir as a predictive factor for biochemical disease-free survival and overall survival following whole-gland salvage HIFU following radiotherapy failure.	BACKGROUND: Treatment options for radio-recurrent prostate cancer are either androgen-deprivation therapy or salvage prostatectomy. Whole-gland high-intensity focussed ultrasound (HIFU) might have a role in this setting. METHODS: An independent HIFU registry collated consecutive cases of HIFU. Between 2005 and 2012, we identified 50 men who underwent whole-gland HIFU following histological confirmation of localised disease following prior external beam radiotherapy (2005-2012). No upper threshold was applied for risk category, PSA or Gleason grade either at presentation or at the time of failure. Progression was defined as a composite with biochemical failure (Phoenix criteria (PSA>nadir+2 ng ml(-1))), start of systemic therapies or metastases. RESULTS: Median age (interquartile range (IQR)), pretreatment PSA (IQR) and Gleason score (range) were 68 years (64-72), 5.9 ng ml(-1) (2.2-11.3) and 7 (6-9), respectively. Median follow-up was 64 months (49-84). In all, 24/50 (48%) avoided androgen-deprivation therapies. Also, a total of 28/50 (56%) achieved a PSA nadir <0.5 ng ml(-1), 15/50 (30%) had a nadir 0.5 ng ml(-1) and 7/50 (14%) did not nadir (PSA non-responders). Actuarial 1, 3 and 5-year progression-free survival (PFS) was 72, 40 and 31%, respectively. Actuarial 1, 3 and 5-year overall survival (OS) was 100, 94 and 87%, respectively. When comparing patients with PSA nadir <0.5 ng ml(-1), nadir 0.5 and non-responders, a statistically significant difference in PFS was seen (P<0.0001). Three-year PFS in each group was 57, 20 and 0%, respectively. Five-year OS was 96, 100 and 38%, respectively. Early in the learning curve, between 2005 and 2007, 3/50 (6%) developed a fistula. Intervention for bladder outlet obstruction was needed in 27/50 (54%). Patient-reported outcome measure questionnaires showed incontinence (any pad-use) as 8/26 (31%). CONCLUSIONS: In our series of high-risk patients, in whom 30-50% may have micro-metastases, disease control rates were promising in PSA responders, however, with significant morbidity. Additionally, post-HIFU PSA nadir appears to be an important predictor for both progression and survival. Further research on focal salvage ablation in order to reduce toxicity while retaining disease control rates is required.
27430325	MicroRNA-497 inhibits the proliferation, migration and invasion of human bladder transitional cell carcinoma cells by targeting E2F3.	Accumulating evidence indicates that microRNAs (miRNAs) play critical roles in regulating cellular processes, such as cell growth and apoptosis, as well as cancer progression and metastasis. Low expression of miR-497 has been observed in breast, colorectal and cervical cancers. Human bladder transitional cell carcinoma (BTCC) progression typically follows a complex cascade from primary malignancy to distant metastasis, but whether the aberrant expression of miR-497 in BTCC is associated with malignancy, metastasis or prognosis remains unknown. In the present study, we found that miR-497 was markedly downregulated in BTCC tissue samples when compared with that noted in adjacent normal tissues, and low expression of miR-497 was correlated with poor prognosis in BTCC patients. We also found that overexpression of miR-497 inhibited the proliferation, migration and invasion of bladder cancer cells by downregulating E2F3 (an miR-497 target gene) mRNA and protein and that siRNA against E2F3 inhibited cell proliferation, migration and invasion, which was similar to the effect of miR-497 overexpression in the BTCC cells. Our experimental data indicated that miR-497 mediates the in vitro proliferation, migration and invasion of BTCC cells. Together, these results suggest that miR-497 may represent a novel prognostic indicator, a biomarker for the early detection of metastasis and a target for gene therapy of BTCC.
27430302	miR-92b targets DAB2IP to promote EMT in bladder cancer migration and invasion.	Muscle-invasive or metastatic bladder cancer (BCa) has a very poor prognosis; however, its mechanisms remain largely unknown. Previous studies have discovered multiple microRNAs (miRs) that are involved in BCa progression and regarded as potential biomarkers or therapeutic targets. In this study, we demonstrated that miR-92b could uniquely promote cell migration and invasion of BCa cells, but had no effect on cell proliferation. Mechanistically, our data provided evidence to verify that miR-92b was able to directly target DAB2IP, a well-known tumor suppressor, and inhibit epithelialmesenchymal transition of BCa cells. Moreover, the increased expression levels of miR-92b were negatively correlated with DAB2IP, and predicted poor prognosis of patients with BCa. Overall, this study reveals a new promising biomarker and its mechanisms contributing to BCa invasion or metastasis.
27430247	SnoN suppresses TGF-beta-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition and invasion of bladder cancer in a TIF1gamma-dependent manner.	The transcriptional regulator SnoN (also known as SKI-like proto-oncogene, SKIL), a member of the Ski family, has been reported to influence epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in response to TGF-beta. In the present study, we investigated the role of SnoN in bladder cancer (BC). Differential expression of SnoN was not detected in BC tissues compared with that noted in adjacent non-cancerous tissues. SnoN was upregulated in response to TGF-beta treatment, but had no effect on the TGF-beta pathway, which may be explained by the low level of SnoN SUMOylation. TIF1gamma, which catalyzes the SUMOylation of SnoN, was downregulated in BC tissues. Overexpression of TIF1gamma restored the ability of SnoN to suppress the TGF-beta pathway. Furthermore, TGF-beta-induced EMT and invasion of BC cells were suppressed by TIF1gamma in the presence of SnoN. Collectirely, our data suggest that SnoN suppresses TGF-betainduced EMT and invasion of BC cells in a TIF1gammadependent manner and may serve as a novel therapeutic option for the treatment of BC.
27430156	Identifying the role of Wilms tumor 1 associated protein in cancer prediction using integrative genomic analyses.	The Wilms tumor suppressor, WT1 was first identified due to its essential role in the normal development of the human genitourinary system. Wilms tumor 1 associated protein (WTAP) was subsequently revealed to interact with WT1 using yeast two-hybrid screening. The present study identified 44 complete WTAP genes in the genomes of vertebrates, including fish, amphibians, birds and mammals. The vertebrate WTAP proteins clustered into the primate, rodent and teleost lineages using phylogenetic tree analysis. From 1,347 available SNPs in the human WTAP gene, 19 were identified to cause missense mutations. WTAP was expressed in bladder, blood, brain, breast, colorectal, esophagus, eye, head and neck, lung, ovarian, prostate, skin and soft tissue cancers. A total of 17 out of 328 microarrays demonstrated an association between WTAP gene expression and cancer prognosis. However, the association between WTAP gene expression and prognosis varied in distinct types of cancer, and even in identical types of cancer from separate microarray databases. By searching the Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer database, 65 somatic mutations were identified in the human WTAP gene from the cancer tissue samples. These results suggest that the function of WTAP in tumor formation may be multidimensional. Furthermore, signal transducer and activator of transcription 1, forkhead box protein O1, interferon regulatory factor 1, glucocorticoid receptor and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma transcription factor binding sites were identified in the upstream (promoter) region of the human WTAP gene, suggesting that these transcription factors may be involved in WTAP functions in tumor formation.
27428950	Immunogenic Human Papillomavirus Pseudovirus-Mediated Suicide-Gene Therapy for Bladder Cancer.	Bladder cancer is the second most common urological malignancy in the world. In 70% of cases it is initially diagnosed as non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) and it is amenable to local treatments, with intravesical (IVES) Bacillus-Calmette-Guerin (BCG) immunotherapy being routinely used after transurethral resection of the lesion. However, this treatment is associated with significant side-effects and treatment failures, highlighting the necessity of novel strategies. One potent approach is the suicide-gene mediated therapy/prodrug combination, provided tumor-specificity can be ensured and anti-tumor immune responses induced. Using the mouse syngeneic orthotopic MB49-bladder tumor model, here we show that IVES human papillomavirus non-replicative pseudovirions (PsV) can pseudoinfect tumors with a ten-fold higher efficacy than normal bladders. In addition, PsV carrying the suicide-gene herpes-simplex virus thymidine kinase (PsV-TK) combined to Ganciclovir (GCV) led to immunogenic cell-death of tumor cells in vitro and to MB49-specific CD8 T-cells in vivo. This was associated with reduction in bladder-tumor growth and increased mice survival. Altogether, our data show that IVES PsV-TK/GCV may be a promising alternative or combinatory treatment for NMIBC.
27428195	Positive association of female overactive bladder symptoms and estrogen deprivation: A nationwide population-based cohort study in Taiwan.	OBJECTIVE: Estrogen is considered to be a unique hormone in females that has an impact on voiding function. Animal models and clinical epidemiologic studies showed high correlation between estrogen deficiency and female overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms. We designed a population-based cohort study from a national health database to assess the association of estrogen deprivation therapy and female OAB. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study examined the records of 16,128 patients ranging in age from 18 to 40 that were included in the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) in the years between 2001 and 2010. Of these, 1008 had breast cancer with hormone therapy only and the other 15,120 controls did not have breast cancer or hormone therapy. All patients with neurologic diseases and those with pre-existing OAB identified by information in the NHIRD database were excluded. OAB was defined by medications prescribed for at least 1 month. Risk of new onset OAB in the breast cancer and nonbreast cancer groups was estimated. Fourteen patients (1.4%) experienced OAB in the breast cancer group. Overall, breast cancer with estrogen deprivation therapy increased the risk of OAB by 14.37-fold (adjusted hazard ratio, 95% confidence interval 7.06-29.27). Subgroup analysis showed that in the older age breast cancer group (36-40), a lower Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) score and antidepressant medication use for at least 30 days had an impact on the increase of OAB risk. After adjustment of variables, the higher CCI and the use of antipsychotic drugs increased risk of OAB 3.45-fold and 7.45-fold, respectively. The Kaplan-Meier analysis of OAB-free survival in the breast cancer group showed a significant time-dependent increase in incidence of OAB. CONCLUSION: Estrogen deprivation in young patients with breast cancer increased the risk of OAB. The OAB development rate was steady and fast in the beginning 3 years after estrogen deprivation. This result indicates a role of estrogen in the modulation of female voiding function.
27428187	Bladder leiomyoma presenting as dyspareunia: Case report and literature review.	INTRODUCTION: Leiomyoma of the bladder is a rare tumor arising from the submucosa. Most patients with bladder leiomyoma may present with urinary frequency or obstructive urinary symptoms. However, there are a few cases of bladder leiomyoma coexisting with uterine leiomyoma presenting as dyspareunia. We herein report an unusual case of coexisting bladder leiomyoma and uterine leiomyoma presenting as dyspareunia. CASE PRESENTATION: A 44-year-old Asian female presented to urologist and complained that she had experienced dyspareunia over the preceding several months. A pelvic ultrasonography revealed a mass lesion located in the trigone of urinary bladder. The mass lesion was confirmed on contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT). The CT scan also revealed a lobulated and enlarged uterus consistent with uterine leiomyoma. Then, the biopsies were then taken with a transurethral resection (TUR) loop and these biopsies showed a benign proliferation of smooth muscle in a connective tissue stroma suggestive of bladder leiomyoma. An open local excision of bladder leiomyoma and hysteromyomectomy were performed successfully. Histological examination confirmed bladder leiomyoma coexisting with uterine leiomyoma. CONCLUSION: This case highlights a rare presentation of bladder leiomyoma, dyspareunia, as the chief symptom in a patient who had coexisting uterine leiomyoma. Bladder leiomyomas coexisting with uterine leiomyomas are rare and can present with a wide spectrum of complaints including without symptoms, irritative symptoms, obstructive symptoms, or even dyspareunia.
27428185	Opium use, cigarette smoking, and alcohol consumption in relation to pancreatic cancer.	BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Although several studies have suggested opium as a risk factor for cancers of the esophagus, stomach, larynx, lung, and bladder, no previous study has examined the association of opium with pancreatic cancer. We aimed to study the association between opium use and risk of pancreatic cancer in Iran, using a case-control design. We also studied the association of cigarette smoking and alcohol consumption with pancreatic cancer, for which little information was available from this population. METHODS: Cases and controls were selected from patients who were referred to 4 endoscopic ultrasound centers in Tehran, Iran. We recruited 316 histopathologically (all adenocarcinoma) and 41 clinically diagnosed incident cases of pancreatic cancer, as well as 328 controls from those with a normal pancreas in enodosonography from January 2011 to January 2015. We used logistic regression models to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: After adjustment for potential confounders, opium use (OR 1.91; 95% CI 1.06-3.43) and alcohol consumption (OR 4.16; 95% CI 1.86-9.31) were significantly associated with an increased risk of pancreatic cancer. We did not find an association between ever tobacco smoking and pancreatic cancer risk (OR 0.93; 95% CI 0.62-1.39). CONCLUSION: In our study, opium use and alcohol consumption were associated with an increased risk of pancreatic cancer, whereas cigarette smoking was not.
27427143	Risk continues: Very late manifestation of helicobacter pylori at gastric augmented bladder.	Helicobacter Pylori was previously demonstrated at gastric patch after gastrocystoplasty and a possible relationship with acid-haematuria syndrome was established after symptomatic relief by medical treatment. We present the long term outcome of a male bladder exstrophy patient after gastrocystoplasty. There was past history of bladder perforation, acid haematuria syndrome and treatment of HP and recurrent urinary tract infections, noncompliance on regular follow-up and cadaveric renal transplantation. At the preoperative evaluation for renal transplantation HP was present in the biopsy samples collected during gastroscopy and cystoscopy. The significance of persistant HP after gastrocystoplasty in the long term follow-up was discussed.
27422469	Clear Cell Urothelial Carcinoma.	Clear cell urothelial carcinoma (CCUC) is a rare variant of urothelial carcinoma (UC) and its clinical significance has not been well elucidated. Consecutive cases of UC over a period of 5 years were reviewed. Histopathological tumor parameters, including the proportion of tumor cells with clear cell change, and patient outcomes were recorded. Expression of the following immunohistochemical markers was investigated: CK7, CK20, CK5, CD44, and PAX8. We also conducted a review of the literature for case reports/series of CCUC. Ten CCUCs were identified out of a total of 872 cases of UC. The clear cell component was characterized by prominent cytoplasmic membranes and voluminous clear cytoplasm, and accounted for 30% to 90% of the invasive tumor component. Of all the non-CCUC cases reviewed, at least 50% (noninvasive or invasive UC) showed focal areas of clear cell change that accounted for less than 5% of the neoplastic cells. Immunohistochemically, CCUC exhibited positive reactivity for CK5/CD44 (n = 9); CK20 (n = 5), PAX8 (very focal to extensive) (n = 6), and GATA3/CK7 (n = 10). Eight of 10 CCUC were of advanced clinical stage (pT3/pT4) and 6 of 10 experienced tumor recurrence and/or death due to disease. In conclusion, CCUC can be distinguished from non-CCUC by the extensive clear cell change in more than 30% of cells. This variant is associated with rapid progression to muscle invasion and metastasis, with an aggressive clinical course. Expression of CK5/CD44 may represent basal cell features in most CCUC cases, while PAX8 expression is suggestive of mesonephric derivation.
27422388	Sarcopenia predicts survival outcomes among patients with urothelial carcinoma of the upper urinary tract undergoing radical nephroureterectomy: a retrospective multi-institution study.	BACKGROUND: We aimed to evaluate the effect of sarcopenia, a condition of low muscle mass, on the survival among patients who were undergoing radical nephroureterectomy (RNU) for urothelial carcinoma of the upper urinary tract (UCUT). METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed consecutive patients with UCUT (cT[any]N0M0) who underwent RNU between 2003 and 2013 at our department and its affiliated institutions. Preoperative computed tomography images were used to calculate each patient's skeletal muscle index, an indicator of whole-body muscle mass. Sarcopenia was defined according to the sex-specific consensus definitions, based on the patient's skeletal muscle and body mass indexes. We analyzed the relapse-free survival (RFS), cancer-specific survival (CSS), and overall survival (OS) after RNU to identify factors that predicted patient survival. RESULTS: A total of 137 patients were included, and 90 patients (65.7 %) were diagnosed with sarcopenia. Compared to the non-sarcopenic patients, the sarcopenic patients had a significant inferior 5-year RFS (48.8 vs. 79.6 %, p = 0.0002), CSS (57.1 vs. 92.6 %, p < 0.0001), and OS (48.2 vs. 90.6 %, p < 0.0001). Multivariate analyses revealed that sarcopenia was an independent predictor of shorter RFS, CSS, and OS (all, p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Sarcopenia was an independent predictor of survival among patients with UCUT who were undergoing RNU.
27420147	[Vaginal Follicular dendritic cell sarcoma in patient with previous urinary tract carcinoma. Case Report].	INTRODUCTION: follicular dendritic cell sarcoma (FDC sarcoma) is an uncommon neoplasm derived from FDC present in lymphoid follicles. It usually presents in lymph nodes, being extranodal location a very unusual event. CASE REPORT: A 78 year old female, with prior left nephrectomy for invasive urothelial carcinoma, consulted for genitorragia. At examination, a polypoid vaginal lesion, measuring 3.5 cm in diameter was discovered. It was reported as squamous cell carcinoma in incisional biopsy. A polipectomy was performed. Examination of resected specimen showed a tumor having pushing edges, arranged in a solid pattern with spindle and epithelioid cells, having a syncytial appearance, diffusely sprinkled with numerous lymphocytes and granulocytes. At immunohistochemistry neoplastic cells were positive for vimentin, CD 68, CD 21 and fascine, and focally positive for S-100 and CD45. Occasional scattered neoplastic cells expressed CD30 and CD 23. They were negative for CD3, CD20, myeloperoxidase, AE1 / AE3, EMA, HMB45, Melan A, desmin, Chromogranin, CD1a and CD35. Infiltrating lymphocites were mainly of T cell lineage (CD3 +). DISCUSSION: We report a case of FDC sarcoma in an unusual location, being to our knowledge, the first one at this site. The fact of having a prior neoplasia posed additional difficulties in differential diagnosis. Histological findings with expression of a specific marker of FDC (in this case CD21) allowed us to establish an accurate diagnosis.
27417990	BCG-osis following intravesical BCG treatment leading to miliary pulmonary nodules, penile granulomas and a mycotic aortic aneurysm.	A 69-year-old male patient who was treated with intravesical BCG for carcinoma in situ of the bladder, went on to develop systemic features of BCG-osis. This diagnosis was supported by significant radiological and clinical findings. These systemic features include pulmonary miliary lesions, a mycotic abdominal aortic aneurysm and penile lesions. Owing to a breakdown in the relationship between the patient and the National Health Service, the patient has declined BCG treatment. This case highlights the potential rare side effects of intravesical BCG treatment and the risk associated with non-treatment of BCG-osis.

27411767	[Frequency, Intensity and Daily Life Distress of Urinary Dysfunction in Women with Cervical Cancer after Radical Hysterectomy].	PURPOSE: This study was done to identify frequency, intensity of urinary dysfunction and daily life distress in women after a radical hysterectomy for cervical cancer. METHODS: One hundred and fifty seven women who had undergone a radical hysterectomy and one hundred and sixty five women as healthy controls completed questionnaires on intensity of urinary dysfunction and daily life distress caused by urinary dysfunction. RESULTS: Women with cervical cancer showed higher frequency of urinary dysfunction than healthy controls. Major urinary dysfunction for women with cervical cancer in order of frequency were night-time incontinence (odds ratio=10.39, p<.001), difficulty in starting urination, weak urine stream and sense of incomplete emptying of bladder. The highest score on intensity was difficulty in starting urination, followed by urgency, weak urine stream, daytime frequency and sense of incomplete emptying. Night-time incontinence was the urinary symptom causing the most daily life distress for cervical cancer women followed by difficulty in starting urination, urgency, sense of incomplete emptying, and night-time frequency. CONCLUSION: Results suggest that nurses should address the potential postoperative urinary complications and develop long term interventions to decrease urinary dysfunction and daily life distress for women who have had a radical hysterectomy for cervical cancer.
27411578	Molecular Subtypes of Non-muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer.	In this issue of Cancer Cell, Hedegaard et al. report a comprehensive multi-center transcriptional analysis of non-muscle invasive urothelial bladder cancer. They describe three molecular subtypes similar to those seen in other cohorts, as well as a unique CIS signature associated with risk of progression to muscle invasive cancer.
27403419	Potential Roles of Amiloride-Sensitive Sodium Channels in Cancer Development.	The ENaC/degenerin ion channel superfamily includes the amiloride-sensitive epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) and acid sensitive ionic channel (ASIC). ENaC is a multimeric ion channel formed by heteromultimeric membrane glycoproteins, which participate in a multitude of biological processes by mediating the transport of sodium (Na(+)) across epithelial tissues such as the kidney, lungs, bladder, and gut. Aberrant ENaC functions contribute to several human disease states including pseudohypoaldosteronism, Liddle syndrome, cystic fibrosis, and salt-sensitive hypertension. Increasing evidence suggests that ion channels not only regulate ion homeostasis and electric signaling in excitable cells but also play important roles in cancer cell behaviors such as proliferation, apoptosis, invasion, and migration. Indeed, ENaCs/ASICs had been reported to be associated with cancer characteristics. Given their cell surface localization and pharmacology, pharmacological strategies to target ENaC/ASIC family members may be promising cancer therapeutics.
27402371	Systemic therapy for bladder cancer finally comes into a new age.	Systemic therapy for bladder cancer, both localized muscle-invasive disease and metastatic disease, has seen minimal progress over the past two decades. Current approaches rely upon cytotoxic chemotherapy combinations aimed at increasing cure rates or achieving palliation and disease control, but these regimens are fraught with short- and long-term toxicities and outcomes remain suboptimal. The emergence of systemic immunotherapies that can provide durable remissions in subsets of patients with other malignancies has the potential to transform the field, and early phase trials have begun to demonstrate activity in some patients with metastatic bladder cancer. In this article, we review the current state of systemic therapy for bladder cancer and discuss the current literature and ongoing trials utilizing various immunotherapies.
27401645	Urinary Continence after Robot-Assisted Laparoscopic Radical Prostatectomy: The Impact of Intravesical Prostatic Protrusion.	PURPOSE: To assess the impact of intravesical prostatic protrusion (IPP) on the outcomes of robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy (RALP). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The medical records of 1094 men who underwent RALP from January 2007 to March 2013 were analyzed using our database to identify 641 additional men without IPP (non-IPP group). We excluded 259 patients who presented insufficient data and 14 patients who did not have an MRI image. We compared the following parameters: preoperative transrectal ultrasound, prostate specific antigen (PSA), clinicopathologic characteristics, intraoperative characteristics, postoperative oncologic characteristics, minor and major postoperative complications, and continence until postoperative 1 year. IPP grade was stratified by grade into three groups: Grade 1 (IPP</=5 mm), Grade 2 (5 mm<IPP</=10 mm), and Grade 3 (IPP>10 mm). RESULTS: Of the 821 patients who underwent RALP, 557 (67.8%) experienced continence at postoperative 3 months, 681 (82.9%) at 6 months, and 757 (92.2%) at 12 months. According to IPP grade, there were significant differences in recovering full continence at postoperative 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months (p<0.001). On multivariate analysis, IPP was the most powerful predictor of postoperative continence in patients who underwent RALP (p<0.001). Using a generalized estimating equation model, IPP also was shown to be the most powerful independent variable for postoperative continence in patients who underwent RALP (p<0.001). CONCLUSION: Patients with low-grade IPP have significantly higher chances of recovering full continence. Therefore, the known IPP grade will be helpful during consultations with patients before RALP.
27401634	Intraductal Carcinoma of the Prostate Gland: Recent Advances.	Intraductal carcinoma of the prostate (IDC-P) is characterized by prostatic carcinoma involving ducts and/or acini. The presence of IDC-P is usually associated with a high-grade Gleason score, large tumor volume, and adverse prognostic parameters, including extraprostatic extension and seminal vesicle invasion. When present, IDC-P is associated with worse outcomes, regardless of treatment status. IDC-P is included in a broader diagnostic category of atypical cribriform lesions of the prostate gland. This category of lesions also includes high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN), urothelial carcinoma involving prostatic ducts or acini, and prostatic ductal adenocarcinoma, amongst other intraductal proliferations. Differentiating between these entities is important as they have differing therapeutic and prognostic implications for patients, although differential diagnosis thereof is not always straightforward. The present review discusses IDC-P in regards to its morphological characteristics, molecular features, and clinical outcomes. Given the current state of knowledge, the presence of IDC-P should be evaluated and documented correctly in both radical prostatectomy and needle biopsy specimens, and the clinical implications thereof should be taken into consideration during treatment and follow up.
27395802	Mapping the interactions and bioactivity of quercetin-(2-hydroxypropyl)-beta-cyclodextrin complex.	Natural products have served as a rich source for drug discovery and development. In the last decade their fruitful integration in the drug discovery pipeline declined due to their reduced bioavailability, mainly attributed to their poor aqueous solubility. We synthesized a quercetin (QUE)-(2-hydroxypropyl)-beta-cyclodextrin (HP-beta-CD) complex that enabled amplification of its solubility and in the same time retained its bioactivity in T24 human bladder cancer cell line. The stability of the complex and the molecular basis of the interactions developed in this host-guest complex were assayed by incorporating an array of analytical techniques and Molecular Dynamics (MD) experiments. 2D DOSY NMR experiment revealed that the diffusion coefficient of free HP-beta-CD was 3.55x10(-10)m(2)s(-1) while that of QUE-HP-beta-CD inclusion complex 3.09x10(-10)m(2)s(-1), indicating the formation of a complex. Solid and liquid high resolution NMR spectroscopy data showed that the most pronounced differences in chemical shifts at carbons and protons correspondingly during complexation occur in the aromatic ring Alpha (bearing the two phenolic hydroxyl groups meta to each other). The chemical shift differences in the aromatic ring Beta (bearing the two phenolic hydroxyl groups ortho to each other) were less pronounced. The MD results confirmed the experimental data.
27394047	An integrated proteomic and peptidomic assessment of the normal human urinome.	BACKGROUND: Urine represents an ideal source of clinically relevant biomarkers as it contains a large number of proteins and low molecular weight peptides. The comprehensive characterization of the normal urinary proteome and peptidome can serve as a reference for future biomarker discovery. Proteomic and peptidomic analysis of urine can also provide insight into normal physiology and disease pathology, especially for urogenital diseases. METHODS: We developed an integrated proteomic and peptidomic analytical protocol in normal urine. We employed ultrafiltration to separate protein and peptide fractions, which were analyzed separately using liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) on the Q-Exactive mass spectrometer. RESULTS: By analyzing six urines from healthy individuals with advanced age, we identified 1754 proteins by proteomic analysis and 4543 endogenous peptides, arising from 566 proteins by peptidomic analysis. Overall, we identified 2091 non-redundant proteins by this integrated approach. In silico protease activity analysis indicated that metalloproteases are predominantly involved in the generation of the endogenous peptide signature. In addition, a number of proteins that were detected in normal urine have previously been implicated in various urological malignancies, including bladder cancer and renal cell carcinoma (RCC). CONCLUSIONS: We utilized a highly sensitive proteomics approach that enabled us to identify one of the largest sets of protein identifications documented in normal human urine. The raw proteomics and peptidomics data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE partner repository with the dataset identifier PXD003595.
27392930	Micropapillary morphology is an indicator of poor prognosis in patients with urothelial carcinoma treated with transurethral resection and radiochemotherapy.	Purpose of this study was to evaluate prognostic impact of rare variants of urothelial bladder cancer (BC) after treatment with combined radiochemotherapy (RCT). To this end tumour tissue of 238 patients with urothelial carcinoma (UC) treated with transurethral resection of the bladder (TUR-B) and RCT with curative intent was collected. Histomorphological analysis included re-evaluation and semi-quantitative assessment of rare UC subtypes. Additionally, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) chromogenic in situ hybridisation (CISH) was performed in tumours with a micropapillary component exceeding 30 %. Long-term follow-up was available for 200 patients (range 3-282 months). Variant UC histology was found in 45 of 238 tumours, most frequently micropapillary UC (N = 17) including cases with a small fraction of tumour with micropapillary morphology. The mere presence of micropapillary morphology did not affect prognosis. In tumours with extensive (>/=30 %) micropapillary morphology (N = 8) Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed significantly worse cancer specific survival (CSS) (P = 0.002) compared to conventional UC (mean survival times 97 months and 229 months, respectively). Univariate Cox regression analysis of cases with >/=30 % micropapillary morphology revealed a hazard ratio of 4.726 (95 % CI 1.629-13.714) for CSS (P = 0.004). CISH revealed HER2 gene amplification in 3/10 tumours with >/=30 % micropapillary component. In conclusion, for BC treated with TUR-B and RCT, the presence of micropapillary morphology in more than 30 % of the tumour is an adverse prognostic factor. Further studies are needed to evaluate a potential benefit of different, especially multimodal treatment strategies for micropapillary UC and also other subtypes of UC. Her2 represents a promising therapeutic target in a subset of micropapillary UC.
27389519	Outcomes of preoperative chemoradiotherapy followed by surgery in patients with unresectable locally advanced sigmoid colon cancer.	BACKGROUND: Complete resection of locally advanced sigmoid colon cancer (LASCC) is sometimes difficult. Patients with LASCC have a dismal prognosis and poor quality of life, which has encouraged the evaluation of alternative multimodality treatments. This prospective study aimed to assess the feasibility and efficacy of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (neoCRT) followed by surgery as treatment of selected patients with unresectable LASCC. METHODS: We studied the patients with unresectable LASCC who received neoCRT followed by surgery between October 2010 and December 2012. The neoadjuvant regimen consisted of external-beam radiotherapy to 50 Gy and capecitabine-based chemotherapy every 3 weeks. Surgery was scheduled 6-8 weeks after radiotherapy. RESULTS: Twenty-one patients were included in this study. The median follow-up was 42 months (range, 17-57 months). All patients completed neoCRT and surgery. Resection with microscopically negative margins (R0 resection) was achieved in 20 patients (95.2%). Pathologic complete response was observed in 8 patients (38.1%). Multivisceral resection was necessary in only 7 patients (33.3%). Two patients (9.5%) experienced grade 2 postoperative complications. No patients died within 30 days after surgery. For 18 patients with pathologic M0 (ypM0) disease, the cumulative probability of 3-year local recurrence-free survival, disease-free survival and overall survival was 100.0%, 88.9% and 100.0%, respectively. For all 21 patients, the cumulative probability of 3-year overall survival was 95.2% and bladder function was well preserved. CONCLUSION: For patients with unresectable LASCC, preoperative chemoradiotherapy and surgery can be performed safely and may result in an increased survival rate.
27389415	Asynchronous bilateral anastomosis site sigmoid colon cancer after ureterosigmoidostomy: a case report.	BACKGROUND: We present a case of asynchronously occurring adenocarcinomas 29 and 36 years after ureterosigmoidostomy for bladder cancer, respectively, at both anastomosis sites. CASE PRESENTATION: A colonoscopy that was performed on a 69-year-old man because of bloody stool and an elevated carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level revealed a polypoid lesion at the right ureterosigmoid anastomosis site 29 years after the patient's ureterosigmoidostomy. Endoscopic resection was performed, and the lesion was diagnosed as adenocarcinoma. Seven years later (36 years after ureterosigmoidostomy), an elevated lesion was detected at the left ureterosigmoid anastomosis site by colonoscopy performed after detection of high CEA levels. Biopsy revealed an adenocarcinoma that was immunohistologically positive for CDX2; sigmoidectomy and ureterectomy were subsequently performed. The pathological diagnosis of the second tumor was adenocarcinoma arising in the ureterosigmoid anastomosis site and invading the left ureter. CONCLUSIONS: Diligent long-term follow-up of patients who underwent ureterosigmoidostomy is essential.
27388198	Complete Tissue Submission to Increase Lymph Node Detection in Pelvic Lymph Node Packets Submitted for Patients Undergoing Radical Prostatectomy and Radical Cystectomy.	BACKGROUND: Pelvic lymphadenectomy has prognostic and therapeutic implications in both bladder and prostate cancer. Pelvic lymphadenectomy specimens are fatty and identification of lymph nodes (LNs) can be difficult during the grossing process. We investigated the benefit of a new grossing method requiring entire LN packet submission. MATERIALS/METHODS: We introduced a new grossing protocol requiring total submission of LN packets for patients undergoing radical prostatectomy (RP) or radical cystectomy (RC). A retrospective review was performed to evaluate clinical and pathologic data for RP (n = 59) and RC (n = 56) cases performed 18 months prior to and 18 months following implementation of the new lymphadenectomy grossing protocol. RESULTS: For RP and RC cases, significantly more LNs were found when total LN packets were submitted with the new technique: mean 14.1 versus 8.7, and mean 25.2 versus 15.9, respectively ( P = .007, P = .011). For RP cases, there was no significant change in the number of LN packets submitted for evaluation from the operating room ( P = .76). For RC cases, more LNs were found with the new technique despite a significantly fewer number of LN packets sent from the operating room in the cohort that were processed with the new technique: mean 2.2 versus 4.0 LN packets ( P < .001). Significantly more paraffin blocks were required using the new grossing method for both RP and RC: mean 13.53 versus 6.9 and mean 19.0 versus 12.4, respectively ( P < .001, P = .018). CONCLUSIONS: Submitting all additional fatty tissue after palpable identification of LNs can significantly increase the detection of LNs in RP and RC cases.
27385133	The functional results of radical rectal cancer surgery: review of the literature.	Introduction For more than the last 20 years, low anterior resection with total mesorectal excision (TME) is a gold standard for rectal cancer treatment. Oncological outcomes have improved significantly and now more and more reports of functional outcomes appear. Due to the close relationship between the rectum and pelvic nerves, bowel, bladder, and sexual function are frequently affected during TME. Methods A search for published data was performed using the MEDLINE database (from 1 January 2005 to 31 January 2015) to perform a systematic review of the studies that described anorectal, bladder, and sexual dysfunction following rectal cancer surgery. Methodological quality of the included studies was assessed using the MINORS criteria. Results Eighty-nine studies were eligible for analysis. Up to 76% of patients undergoing sphincter preserving surgery will have changes in bowel habits, the so-called "low anterior resection syndrome" (LARS). The duration of LARS varies between a few months and several years. Pre-operative radiotherapy, damage of anal sphincter and pelvic nerves, and height of the anastomosis are the risk factors for LARS. There is no evidence-based treatment available for LARS. Sexual function is more commonly affected after rectal surgery than after urinary function. The main cause of dysfunction is damage to pelvic nerves. Sexual and bladder functional outcomes in females are less well reported. Laparoscopic and robotic surgery allows better visualization of autonomic nerves and, therefore, more precise dissection and preservation. Conclusions It is important that rectal resection is standardized as much as possible, and that new functional outcome research use the same validated outcome questionnaires. This would allow for a high-quality meta-analysis.
27384201	Paradox of life among survivors of bladder cancer and treatments.	OBJECTIVE: To interpret the meanings attributed to the experience of bladder cancer among survivors in therapeutic follow-up. METHOD: Qualitative methodological approach, based on medical anthropology and narrative methodology. After approval by the research ethics committee of a public university hospital, data were collected from January 2014 to February 2015, by means of recorded semi-structured interviews, direct observation and field journal entries on daily immersion with a group of six men and six women, aged between 57 and 82 years, in therapeutic follow-up. Narratives were analyzed by means of inductive thematic analysis. RESULTS: The meanings revealed difficulties with the processes of disease and treatment, such as breakdown of normal life, uncertainty about the future due to possible recurrence of the disease, difficulty with continuity of care and emotional control, relating it to conflicting ways of understanding the present life. Thus, the meaning of this narrative synthesis is paradox. CONCLUSION: Interpretation of the meaning of experience with bladder cancer among patients provides nurses with a comprehensive view of care, which encompasses biological, psychological and social dimensions, and thereby systematizes humanized care. OBJETIVO: Interpretar o significado atribuido a experiencia do cancer de bexiga entre sobreviventes em seguimento terapeutico. METODO: Empregou-se a abordagem metodologica qualitativa, embasado pela antropologia medica e metodo narrativo. Apos aprovacao do Comite de Etica, os dados foram coletados de janeiro 2014 a fevereiro de 2015, por meio de entrevistas semiestruturadas gravadas, observacao direta e registros no diario de imersao com grupo de seis homens e seis mulheres, entre 57 e 82 anos, em seguimento terapeutico em um hospital publico universitario. As narrativas foram analisadas por meio da analise tematica indutiva. RESULTADOS: Os sentidos revelam as dificuldades com o processo da doenca e do tratamento, como rupturas na vida, futuro incerto pela possibilidade de recidiva da doenca, continuidade do tratamento e controle emocional, relacionando-se com as ponderacoes contraditorias da vida atual. Assim, o significado desta sintese narrativa e de paradoxo. CONCLUSAO: A interpretacao do significado da experiencia com cancer de bexiga entre os adoecidos permite ao enfermeiro um olhar integralizado do cuidado que perpasse as dimensoes biopsicossociais dos adoecidos e, com isso, sistematize a assistencia de maneira humanizada.
27381689	Urology pertinent neuroendocrine tumors: focusing on renal pelvis, bladder, prostate located sympathetic functional paragangliomas.	Urology pertinent neuroendocrine neoplasias are more and more driving to research attractive contributions mainly as regards the urinary tract paragangliomas, besides the prostate cancer neuroendocrine differentiation. About such visceral sympathetic paragangliomas, a considerable attention is aroused by those concerning the renal pelvis, urinary bladder and, particularly, the prostate gland. Essential catecholamine/adrenergic signal-mediated pathophysiological implications and outlined diagnostic approaches are here taken into consideration. Particularly, to reach an accurate functional diagnostic assessment, both plasma and urine catecholamine level tests are required together with (1)(2)(3)I or (1)(3)(1)I-meta-iodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scan while (1)(3)(1)I-, instead of (1)(2)(3)I-, labeled MIBG, proving to be also useful to targeted radionuclide therapy of sympathetic paragangliomas. Nevertheless, a thorough diagnostic confirmation should be obtained by a proper histologic/ immunohistochemical study, so that it respectively highlighting the typical "zellballen" cell setting and neuroendocrine tumor cell specific biomarkers such as chromogranin-A, synaptophysin, neuron-specific enolase. Open/laparoscopic/robot-assisted surgical procedures are performed under alpha1 (doxazosin, prazosin) - and beta(propranolol)-adrenergic blockade to avoid the risk of an intraoperative adrenergic signal-triggered hypertensive crisis, what moreover may occur also during cystoscopy and biopsy in case of bladder or prostate paraganglioma. Given a conceivable likeness, about some adrenergic-mediated pathophysiological implications, between prostate paraganglioma and prostate cancer neuroendocrine transdifferentiation - although as regards two obviously different diseases - a reliable pathogenetic matter concerning prostate paraganglioma is requiring novel research approaches.
27381494	A place for precision medicine in bladder cancer: targeting the FGFRs.	Bladder tumors show diverse molecular features and clinical outcome. Muscle-invasive bladder cancer has poor prognosis and novel approaches to systemic therapy are urgently required. Non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer has good prognosis, but high recurrence rate and the requirement for life-long disease monitoring places a major burden on patients and healthcare providers. Studies of tumor tissues from both disease groups have identified frequent alterations of FGFRs, including mutations of FGFR3 and dysregulated expression of FGFR1 and FGFR3 that suggest that these may be valid therapeutic targets. We summarize current understanding of the molecular alterations affecting these receptors in bladder tumors, preclinical studies validating them as therapeutic targets, available FGFR-targeted agents and results from early clinical trials in bladder cancer patients.
27381065	Carcinoma of Gall bladder with distant metastasis to breast parenchyma. Report of a case and review of literature.	BACKGROUND: Gall bladder carcinoma is one of the most common cancers in India. Gall bladder cancer with metastasis to the breast is very rare. Herein we intend to report a case of carcinoma gall bladder with breast metastasis and a short review of the literature. METHODS: This report describes an interesting and unusual case of gall bladder carcinoma presenting with breast metastasis. CASE REPORT: A 38-year lady presented with complaints of right abdominal pain. Bilateral breast examination showed 2x2cm palpable lump in the upper outer quadrant of the left breast. Contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen and pelvis showed circumferential thickening of gall bladder with the loss of fat plane with the adjacent liver parenchyma. Biopsy from the breast lump was reported as metastatic adenocarcinoma compatible with primary in the gall bladder. Whole body PET-CT showed gall bladder mass with abdominal and pelvic nodes with metastasis to liver, left breast, C7 vertebral body and left supra-clavicular node. She was diagnosed to have disseminated carcinoma gall bladder with liver, breast and supraclavicular nodal metastasis. She received palliative chemotherapy with gemcitabine and carboplatin and radiotherapy to C7 vertebra. After receiving 3 cycles of chemotherapy, chemotherapy was changed to the second line with single agent capecitabine. In spite of two lines of chemotherapy, she succumbed to disease progression and expired. CONCLUSION: There are limited examples of gall bladder adenocarcinoma with simultaneous metastasis to breast in the English literature. Our case showed an unusual dissemination of gall bladder cancer.
27380800	Whole-pelvic radiotherapy with spot-scanning proton beams for uterine cervical cancer: a planning study.	The aim of this study was to compare the dosimetric parameters of whole-pelvic radiotherapy (WPRT) for cervical cancer among plans involving 3D conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT), intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), or spot-scanning proton therapy (SSPT). The dose distributions of 3D-CRT-, IMRT-, and SSPT-based WPRT plans were compared in 10 patients with cervical cancer. All of the patients were treated with a prescribed dose of 50.4 Gy in 1.8-Gy daily fractions, and all of the plans involved the same planning target volume (PTV) constrictions. A 3D-CRT plan involving a four-field box, an IMRT plan involving seven coplanar fields, and an SSPT plan involving four fields were created. The median PTV D95% did not differ between the 3D-CRT, IMRT and SSPT plans. The median conformity index 95% and homogeneity index of the IMRT and SSPT were better than those of the 3D-CRT. The homogeneity index of the SSPT was better than that of the IMRT. SSPT resulted in lower median V20 values for the bladder wall, small intestine, colon, bilateral femoral heads, skin, and pelvic bone than IMRT. Comparing the Dmean values, SSPT spared the small intestine, colon, bilateral femoral heads, skin and pelvic bone to a greater extent than the other modalities. SSPT can reduce the irradiated volume of the organs at risk compared with 3D-CRT and IMRT, while maintaining excellent PTV coverage. Further investigations of SSPT are warranted to assess its role in the treatment of cervical cancer.
27379458	Risk estimation of second primary cancers after breast radiotherapy.	AIMS: There is evidence towards the induction of second primary cancers (SPCs) after breast radiotherapy (RT). Organs, such as the lungs and the esophagus, have been identified as common sites for SPC formation. As a result, the current study investigated the risk of secondary carcinogenesis associated with particular RT techniques for breast cancer; including whole breast, segmented breast, partial breast and mammosite brachytherapy. METHODS: In this study, seven breast cancer patients had all major organs contoured on their planning computed tomography (CT) images. Whole breast, segmented breast, accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) and mammosite boost treatment plans were generated for each patient using Pinnacle3 treatment planning system. Differential dose-volume histograms were generated for a number of critical structures: bladder, brain and central nervous system (CNS), breast, colon, liver, lung, mouth and pharynx, esophagus, ovary, salivary gland, small intestine, stomach, and uterus. The lifetime attributed risk (LAR) of cancer induction was estimated using the Schneider et al. excess absolute risk models and dose-volume histograms for the above organs. RESULTS: The sites with the highest LAR estimates were the ipsilateral and contralateral lungs, and contralateral breast for all treatment techniques. For all sites, the LAR estimates for the segmented breast and mammosite treatments were lower than those for the whole breast and APBI treatments. For right-sided target volumes the liver also resulted in high LAR estimates, with all techniques having a LAR greater than 20 per 10 000 person-years (PY), except for mammosite with a mean LAR estimate of 13.2 per 10 000 PY. For left-sided target volumes the stomach also resulted in high LAR estimates, with both whole breast and APBI having a LAR greater than 20 per 10 000 PY, and mammosite the lowest with a LAR of 8.3 per 10 000 PY. CONCLUSION: It is concluded that the lungs and contralateral breast showed high LAR estimates.
27377847	Can the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio be used to predict recurrence and progression of non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer?	The aim of our study was to evaluate whether neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is a predictor of disease progression and recurrence in patients with primary non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). This was a prospective study of 86 patients with newly diagnosed NMIBC. The patients were classified by the number of points assigned by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer risk tables. The correlation between progression score, recurrence score, age, mean platelet volume, red blood cell distribution width and NLR was assessed statistically. The same parameters were compared between the risk groups. A significant difference in NLR and age values was observed between recurrence and progression risk score groups. The relationships between NLR and recurrence and progression risk scores were no longer significant after correcting for the statistical effect of age on scores. Age was significantly different between groups after adjusting for NLR. Our study revealed that NLR and age were associated with patient age and bladder tumor progression and recurrence risk scores. After correcting for age, the significant relationship with NLR was lost, in contrast to some previous studies. We recommend that patient age should be corrected to avoid misleading results in NLR studies.
27377094	Malignant priapism due to penile metastases: Case series and literature review.	Malignant priapism secondary to penile metastases is a rare condition. This term was originally used by Peacock in 1938 to describe a condition of painful induration and erection of the penis due to metastatic infiltration by a neoplasm. In the current literature there are 512 case reports. The primary tumor sites are bladder, prostate and rectum. The treatment has only palliative intent and consists of local tumor excision, penectomy, radiotherapy and chemotherapy. We present one case of malignant priapism originated from prostate cancer, and two from urothelial carcinoma of the bladder. Different approaches in diagnosis and therapy were performed. The entire three patient reported a relief of the pain following the treatment, with an improvement of their quality of life, even though it was only temporary as a palliative. Malignant priapism is a rare medical emergency. Penile/pelvis magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan and corporal biopsies are considered an effective method of diagnosis of the primary organ site.
27377093	Lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma of the bladder: A case report.	type of low differentiated carcinoma of the nasopharyngeal region characterized by marked infiltration of lymphocytes in the area involved by tumor. However, carcinomas with this peculiar morphologic feature have been also described in various anatomic locations and they are generally designated <<lymphoepithelioma-like carcinomas>>. Those of the urinary bladder are uncommon as they account of 0.4%-1.3% of all bladder carcinomas. They may coexist with the conventional urothelial carcinoma. Given their rarity, there is poor information regarding their behaviour. Here we present a new case of lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma in the bladder and we discuss its characteristics and prognosis.
27377080	Is a second look necessary in multiple and/or large Ta tumors?	INTRODUCTION: Most of the bladder cancers are tumors without muscle invasion at the time of diagnosis. Transurethral resection is the standard treatment in bladder tumors without muscle invasion. Proper review of transurethral resection is important for correct risk classification. In this study, our main objective was to show that a "second look" in patients with multiple and/or &gt; 3 cm tumors regardless of T stage during the early term can be helpful in detection of possible residues and determining risk classification. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 156 patients with primary, multiple and/or &gt; 3 cm tumors were included in the study. Patients were divided into 3 groups as Group 1 (Ta), Group 2 (T1 without second TUR) and Group 3 (T1 with second TUR). Macroscopic tumor occurrence rates were compared in their 3rd month control cystoscopy. RESULTS: Macroscopic tumor detection rates in patients' 3rd month control cystoscopy were 21 (46.7%) in Group 1, 18 (30%) in Group 2 and 4 (7.8%) in Group 3. When compared with Group 3 patients, Group 1 and Group 2 had higher statistically significant macroscopic tumor detection rates (p = 0.001) CONCLUSION: A second look in patients with multiple and/or &gt; 3 cm tumors during early term will enable the surgeons to detect possible tumors and do a better job in risk classification.
27377079	Prognostic impact of ReTURB in high grade T1 primary bladder cancer.	PURPOSE: To evaluate whether pathological outcomes of ReTURB have a prognostic impact on recurrence and progression of primitive T1HG bladder cancer. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Patients affected by primitive T1HG TCC of bladder underwent restaging TURB (ReTURB). Patients with muscle invasive disease at ReTURB underwent radical cystectomy; those with non-muscle invasive residual (NMI-RT) and those with no residual tumour (NRT) received an intravesical BCG therapy. We compared recurrence and progression in NMIRT patients and NRT patients at restaging TURB. Patients were followed every 3-6 months with cystoscopy and urine cytology. RESULTS: 212 patients were enrolled in the study. At ReTURB, residual cancer was detected in 92 of 196 (46.9%) valuable patients: 14.3% of these were upstaged to T2. At follow up of 26.3 +/- 22.8 months, there were differences in recurrence and progression rates between NRT and NMIRT patients: 26.9% and 45.3% (p &lt; 0.001), 10.6% and 23.4% (p 0.03), respectively. Recurrence-free and progression-free survivals were significantly higher in NRT compared to NMIRT patients: 73.1% and 54.7% (p &lt; 0.001), 89.4% and 76.6 (p 0.03), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: ReTURB allows to identify a considerable number of residual and understaged cancer. Patients with NMIRT on ReTURB have worse prognosis than those with NRT in terms of recurrence and progression free survival. These outcomes seem to suggest a prognostic impact of findings on ReTURB that could be a valid tool in management of high grade T1 TCC.
27374712	Germline TP53 Mutation and Clinical Characteristics of Korean Patients With Li-Fraumeni Syndrome.	BACKGROUND: Little is known of the mutation and tumor spectrum of Korean patients with Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS). Owing to the rarity of LFS, few cases have been reported in Korea thus far. This study aimed to retrospectively review the mutations and clinical characteristics of Korean patients with LFS. METHODS: TP53 mutation was screened in 89 unrelated individuals at the Samsung Medical Center in Korea, from 2004 to 2015. Six additional mutation carriers were obtained from the literature. RESULTS: We identified nine different mutations in 14 Korean patients (male to female ratio=0.3:1). Two such frameshift mutations (p.Pro98Leufs*25, p.Pro27Leufs*17) were novel. The recurrent mutations were located at codons 31 (n=2; p.Val31Ile), 175 (n=3; p.Arg175His), and 273 (n=4; p.Arg273His and p.Arg273Cys). The median age at the first tumor onset was 25 yr. Ten patients (71%) developed multiple primary tumors. A diverse spectrum of tumors was observed, including breast (n=6), osteosarcoma (n=4), brain (n=4), leukemia (n=2), stomach (n=2), thyroid (n=2), lung (n=2), skin (n=2), bladder (n=1), nasal cavity cancer (n=1), and adrenocortical carcinoma (n=1). CONCLUSIONS: There was considerable heterogeneity in the TP53 mutations and tumor spectrum in Korean patients with LFS. Our results suggest shared and different LFS characteristics between Caucasian and Korean patients. This is the first report on the mutation spectrum and clinical characteristics from the largest series of Korean LFS patients.
27374452	[A case of Mullerian duct cyst torsion combined with bladder cancer].	The diagnosis and treatment of a patient with Mullerian duct cyst torsion combined with bladder cancer were retrospectively analyzed. The patient received an open abdominal operation with right accessory resection plus pelvic adhesion release, and conducted microscopic examination for the bladder under general anesthesia. The results of histopathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of Mullerian duct cyst and papillary urothelial carcinoma at low level. After surgery, the patient received chemotherapy and follow-up observation, and all the indices for the patient were normal and no obvious discomfort. Although the final diagnosis of Mullerian duct cysts is based on histopathological examination, ultrasonography, CT scan and MRI can also detect it. Most of the Mullerian duct cysts are benign, and surgical excision is safe and effective.
27374192	Optimal bladder volume at treatment planning for prostate cancer patients receiving volumetric modulated arc therapy.	PURPOSE: To investigate optimal bladder volumes at treatment planning (TP) in prostate cancer patients who undergo volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT). METHODS AND MATERIALS: To determine the minimum value, 122 patients were classified into 6 groups according to the bladder volume at TP: <100 mL (group 1), 100-149 mL (group 2), 150-199 mL (group 3), 200-249 mL (group 4), 250-299 mL (group 5), and >/=300 mL (group 6). Bladder volumes receiving more than 70 Gy (V70Gy) and V50Gy were calculated in each subgroup and compared with the bladder dose-volume constraints specified in our institution. To determine the maximum value, 64 patients who underwent uniform nursing interventions were classified into the same 6 groups. Bladder volumes on cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) images were measured once weekly during treatment, for a total of 8 measurements. Relative bladder volumes (bladder volume on CBCT image [mL]/bladder volume at TP [mL] x 100%) were evaluated in each of the 6 subgroups. RESULTS: The upper bounds of the 95% confidence intervals of the mean V70Gy and V50Gy values in group 1 exceeded the dose constraints at our institution. The mean relative bladder volumes were 104%, 91%, 77%, 81%, 63%, and 59% in groups 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, respectively. The institutional criterion of 70% for the mean relative bladder volume was achieved in groups 1-4, but it could not be achieved in groups 5-6. Therefore, the patients in groups 2-4 met both institutional dose constraints for the bladder at TP and the institutional criterion for the mean relative bladder volume during treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The optimal bladder volumes at TP were between 100 and 250 mL in this setting. Nursing intervention needs to be implemented before treatment planning to ensure that patients achieve the optimal bladder volume range.
27373362	[Analysis of treatment and prognosis in post-operative patients with urachal carcinoma].	OBJECTIVE: Urachal carcinoma is a kind of urogenital tract malignancy with a very low incidence. The objective of this study was to observe the clinical presentation, pathological condition, treatment method and outcome of patients with urachal carcinoma. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of thirty-six cases of urachal carcinoma diagnosed over a period of 10 years from 2003 to 2013 was carried out. All pathologic specimens were reviewed by two separate pathologists. Clinical and histological features, treatment condition, patient follow-up and survival outcome was reviewed and calculated. RESULTS: The mean age at diagnosis was 53 years. Of the thirty-six patients, twenty-five were male. All patients underwent partial cystectomy with bilateral pelvic lymph node dissection. All cases were adenocarcinoma, including 20 mucinous adenocarcinoma, 7 moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma, 5 poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma, 1 signet ring cell carcinoma, 3 hybrid adenocarcinoma. The Sheldon pathologic stage was stage in 11, in 16 and a in 9 cases. All patients received medical oncological therapy. The median follow-up period was 27 months. The median overall survival was 36 months. One-year survival rate was 70% and five-year survival rate was 28%. CONCLUSIONS: Urachal carcinomas are rare and usually at locally advanced stage at diagnosis with a high tendency of metastases. Surgery is a key method of primary treatment and medical oncological therapy may play a role in decreasing the chances of recurrence which still needs to be explained by prospective clinical trials.
27373212	Targeting of MCT1 and PFKFB3 influences cell proliferation and apoptosis in bladder cancer by altering the tumor microenvironment.	Phosphofructokinase-2/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase 3 (PFKFB3) and monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT1) play important roles in tumor endothelial cells (ECs) and several biological processes. The present study was conducted to study the effects of PFKFB3 and MCT1 on cell proliferation and apoptosis in the tumor microenvironment by co-culture of HUVECs and T24, a bladder cancer (BC) cell line, using a microfluidic device. Immunofluorescence assay showed that HUVEC activity was significantly enhanced under co-culture with T24 cells, according to the stronger fluorescence intensity of CD31 and CD105 than that in the signalcultured cells. Quercetin treatment inhibited MCT1 expression but did not affect PFKFB3 expression. Knockdown of MCT1 or/and PFKFB3 increased the apoptosis rate of the HUVECs under single-culture and co-culture situations by staining with calcein and propidium iodide. Meanwhile, cell proliferation and lactic concentration were significantly decreased after the blocking of MCT1 or/and PFKFB3, as compared with that in the control group. No obvious differences in the effects on apoptosis, proliferation and lactic concentration were found between cells treated with quercetin and siMCT1. Thus, we concluded that the targeting of MCT1 and PFKFB3 regulated cell proliferation and apoptosis in BC cells by altering the tumor microenvironment, and quercetin exhibited a potential antitumor effect by targeting MCT1.
27372200	Immunotherapy advances in uro-genital malignancies.	Immunotherapy for the treatment of cancer has made significant progresses over the last 20 years. Multiple efforts have been attempted to restore immune-mediated tumor elimination, leading to the development of several targeted immunotherapies. Data from recent clinical trials suggest that these agents might improve the prognosis of patients with advanced genito-urinary (GU) malignancies. Nivolumab has been the first immune checkpoint-inhibitor approved for pre-treated patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma. Pembrolizumab and atezolizumab have shown promising results in both phase I and II trials in urothelial carcinoma. Brentuximab vedotin has demonstrated early signals of clinical activity and immunomodulatory effects in highly pre-treated patients with testicular germ cell tumors. In this review, we have summarized the major clinical achievements of immunotherapy in GU cancers, focusing on immune checkpoint blockade as well as the new immunomodulatory monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) under clinical evaluation for these malignancies.
27371842	[The establishment of 5637 bladder cancer cell line with stable overexpression of miR-449c].	Objective To establish a human bladder cancer cell line that stably overexpresses miR-449c. Methods The DNA fragments encoding pre-miR-449c were amplified from genomic DNA templates of HEK293 cells using high-fidelity PCR and cloned into FtetUGW-T vector. The recombinant plasmid was verified by sequencing and applied for lentivirus packaging. Human bladder cancer 5637 cells were infected with the lentivirus and the infected cells after selection with puromycin were observed using an inverted fluorescent microscope for enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) expression, real-time quantitative PCR for miR-449c expression and Western blotting for the expression of its downstream target C-myc. Results The FtetUGW-T/miR-449C lentivirus was successfully established. The human 5637 bladder cancer cells infected with the lentivirus expressed EGFP and overexpressed miR-449c. The expression of c-myc in the cells that stably overexpressed miR-449c was significantly reduced compared with control cells. Conclusion 5637 bladder cancer cell line that stably overexpresses miR-449c is successfully established.
27370898	[Cancer immunotherapy: Rational and recent breakthroughs].	Cancer immunotherapy has occupied a marginal therapeutic option in cancer despite strong arguments documenting the role of the immune system in controlling the proliferation of cancers. The recent success of immunotherapy results from a change in the past paradigm. From now on, the goal is not only to activate the immune system against tumor, but also to take account of the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment Among these mechanisms, negative costimulatory molecules (CTLA-4, PD-1, etc.) expressed by T cells in the tumor could explain their lack of effectiveness in inhibiting tumor growth. Blocking these molecules allowed the reactivation of anti-tumor T cells. Clinically, the administration of anti-CTLA-4 antibody (ipilimumab: Yervoy(R)) was granted marketing authorization for patients with metastatic melanoma. The anti-PD-1 antibodies (nivolumab: Opdivo(R), pembrolizumab: Keytruda(R)) have demonstrated clinical efficacy when compared to the standard therapy in metastatic melanomas, advanced lung cancers and metastatic renal cell carcinoma. In phase I and II clinical trials, other tumors (Hodgkin's disease, head and neck cancers, bladder cancer, gastric cancer, etc.) appear to be responsive to these immunomodulators. These treatments were associated with the occurrence of side effects dominated by autoimmunity predictable by unlocking the breaks exerted by immune system to maintain tolerance against self-antigen. The optimization of therapeutic combination based on these molecules and the search for biomarkers associated with these treatments constitute a challenge for the future for this new therapeutic class of drugs for oncology.
27370156	Interfractional variation in bladder volume and its impact on cervical cancer radiotherapy: Clinical significance of portable bladder scanner.	PURPOSE: A constant bladder volume (BV) is essential to direct the radiotherapy (RT) of pelvic tumors with precision. The purpose of this study was to investigate changes in BV and their impact on cervical cancer RT and to assess the clinical significance of a portable bladder scanner (BS) in achieving a constant BV. METHODS: A standard bladder phantom (133 ml) and measurements of actual urine volume were both used as benchmarks to evaluate the accuracy of the BS. Comparisons of BS with computed tomography (CT), cone-beam CT (CBCT), and an ultrasound diagnostic device (iU22) were made. Twenty-two consecutive patients with cervical cancer treated with external beam radical RT were divided into an experimental group (13 patients) and a control group (9 patients). In the experimental group, the BV was measured multiple times by BS pre-RT until it was consistent with that found by planning CT. Then a CBCT was performed. The BV was measured again immediately post-RT, after which the patient's urine was collected and recorded. In the control group, CBCT only was performed pre-RT. Interfractional changes in BV and their impact on cervical cancer RT were investigated in both groups. The time of bladder filling was also recorded and analyzed. RESULTS: In measuring the volume of the standard bladder phantom, the BS deviated by 1.4% in accuracy. The difference between the measurements of the BS and the iU22 had no statistical significance (linear correlation coefficient 0.96, P < 0.05). The BV measured by the BS was strongly correlated with the actual urine volume (R = 0.95, P < 0.05), planning CT (R = 0.95, P < 0.05), or CBCT (R = 0.91, P < 0.05). Compared with the BV at the time of CT, its value changed by -36.1% [1 SD (standard deviation) 42.3%; range, -79.1%-29.4%] in the control group, and 5.2% (1 SD 21.5%; range, -13.3%-22.1%) in the experimental group during treatment. The change in BV affected the target position in the superior-inferior (SI) direction but had little or no effect in the anterior-posterior and right-left directions. Based on the collected data, the target displacement in the SI direction was reduced from 2.0 to 0.4 mm, while the CTV-to-PTV (CTV: clinical target volume; PTV: planning target volume) margin in the SI direction was reduced from 11.1 to 6.4 mm. The BV increased by 3.7 +/- 1.0 ml/min (range, 1.7-4.7 ml/min), which depended on the amount of water ingested by the patient (R = 0.96, P < 0.05). No correlation was found between the rate of urinary inflow and the patient's body mass. The authors were able to reduce the workload of measuring by using individual patient information including the patient's age, the water-drinking amount, time at which water-drinking began, and patient's diet. CONCLUSIONS: Changes in the BV have an influence on the RT of cervical cancer. A consistent and reproducible BV is acquired by using a portable BS, whereby the target displacement and CTV-to-PTV margin can be both reduced in the SI direction.
27368915	Comparison of dosimetric parameters and acute toxicity of intensity-modulated and three-dimensional radiotherapy in patients with cervix carcinoma: A randomized prospective study.	PURPOSE: The use of intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) to treat cervix carcinoma has increased, however prospective randomized trials are still lacking. AIM: To compare the dosimetric parameters and associated acute toxicity in patients with cervix carcinoma treated with three-dimensional (3D) conformal radiotherapy and IMRT. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty patients were randomized in two arms each consisting of 20 patients. Patients in both arms received concurrent chemoradiation (cisplatin 40mg/m(2) weekly; 50Gy/25 fractions). Patients were treated with 3D conformal radiotherapy in one arm and with IMRT in another arm. After external beam radiotherapy, all patients received brachytherapy (21Gy/3 fractions at weekly interval). For dosimetric comparison, both kinds of the plans were done for all the patients. All patients were assessed throughout and until 90 days after completion of treatment for acute gastrointestinal, genitourinary and hematologic toxicities. RESULTS: Both plans achieved adequate planning target volume coverage, while mean conformity index was found significantly better in IMRT plans (P-value=0.001). D35 (dose to 35% volume) and D50 for bladder was reduced by 14.62 and 32.57% and for rectum by 23.82 and 43.68% in IMRT. For IMRT, V45 (volume receiving 45Gy) of bowel were found significantly lesser (P-value=0.0001), non-tumour integral dose was found significantly higher (P-value=0.0240) and V20 of bone marrow was found significantly reduced (P-value=0.019) in comparison to that in 3D conformal radiotherapy. Significant reduction of grade 2 or more (20 vs 45%; P-value=0.058) and grade>/=3 (5 vs 15%, P-value=0.004) acute genitourinary toxicity and grade 2 or more (20 vs 45%, P-value=0.003) and grade 3 or more (5 vs. 20%, P-value=0.004) acute gastrointestinal toxicity while no significant difference for grade 2 and 3 or more haematological toxicity was noted in patients treated with IMRT compared to 3D conformal radiotherapy. CONCLUSION: IMRT provide a good alternative for treatment of cervix carcinoma with lower acute gastrointestinal and acute genitourinary toxicity with similar target coverage compared to 3D conformal radiotherapy.
27368099	EMT: 2016.	The significant parallels between cell plasticity during embryonic development and carcinoma progression have helped us understand the importance of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in human disease. Our expanding knowledge of EMT has led to a clarification of the EMT program as a set of multiple and dynamic transitional states between the epithelial and mesenchymal phenotypes, as opposed to a process involving a single binary decision. EMT and its intermediate states have recently been identified as crucial drivers of organ fibrosis and tumor progression, although there is some need for caution when interpreting its contribution to metastatic colonization. Here, we discuss the current state-of-the-art and latest findings regarding the concept of cellular plasticity and heterogeneity in EMT. We raise some of the questions pending and identify the challenges faced in this fast-moving field.
27367652	Capsaicin Inhibits Multiple Bladder Cancer Cell Phenotypes by Inhibiting Tumor-Associated NADH Oxidase (tNOX) and Sirtuin1 (SIRT1).	Bladder cancer is one of the most frequent cancers among males, and its poor survival rate reflects problems with aggressiveness and chemo-resistance. Recent interest has focused on the use of chemopreventatives (nontoxic natural agents that may suppress cancer progression) to induce targeted apoptosis for cancer therapy. Capsaicin, which has anti-cancer properties, is one such agent. It is known to preferentially inhibit a tumor-associated NADH oxidase (tNOX) that is preferentially expressed in cancer/transformed cells. Here, we set out to elucidate the correlation between tNOX expression and the inhibitory effects of capsaicin in human bladder cancer cells. We showed that capsaicin downregulates tNOX expression and decreases bladder cancer cell growth by enhancing apoptosis. Moreover, capsaicin was found to reduce the expression levels of several proteins involved in cell cycle progression, in association with increases in the cell doubling time and enhanced cell cycle arrest. Capsaicin was also shown to inhibit the activation of ERK, thereby reducing the phosphorylation of paxillin and FAK, which leads to decreased cell migration. Finally, our results indicate that RNA interference-mediated tNOX depletion enhances spontaneous apoptosis, prolongs cell cycle progression, and reduces cell migration and the epithelial-mesenchymal transition. We also observed a downregulation of sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) in these tNOX-knockdown cells, a deacetylase that is important in multiple cellular functions. Taken together, our results indicate that capsaicin inhibits the growth of bladder cancer cells by inhibiting tNOX and SIRT1 and thereby reducing proliferation, attenuating migration, and prolonging cell cycle progression.
27366009	Febrile Urinary Tract Infection after Radical Cystectomy and Ileal Neobladder in Patients with Bladder Cancer.	Urinary tract infection (UTI) is one of the most common complications after radical cystectomy and orthotopic neobladder reconstruction. This study investigated the incidence and implicated pathogen of febrile UTI after ileal neobladder reconstruction and identify clinical and urodynamic parameters associated with febrile UTI. From January 2001 to May 2015, 236 patients who underwent radical cystectomy and ileal neobladder were included in this study. Fifty-five episodes of febrile UTI were identified in 46 patients (19.4%). The probability of febrile UTI was 17.6% and 19.8% at 6 months and 24 months after surgery, respectively. While, Escherichia coli was the most common implicated pathogen (22/55, 40.0%), Enterococcus spp. were the most common pathogen during the first month after surgery (18/33, 54.5%). In multivariate logistic regression analysis, ureteral stricture was an independent risk factor associated with febrile UTI (OR 5.93, P = 0.023). However, ureteral stricture accounted for only 6 episodes (10.9%, 6/55) of febrile UTI. Most episodes of febrile UTI occurred within 6 months after surgery. Thus, to identify risk factors associated with febrile UTI in the initial postoperative period, we assessed videourodynamics within 6 months after surgery in 38 patients. On videourodyamic examination, vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) was identified in 16 patients (42.1%). The rate of VUR presence in patients who had febrile UTI was not significantly different from those in patients without febrile UTI (50% vs. 39.3%, P = 0.556). Patients with febrile UTI had significantly larger residual urine volume (212.0 +/- 193.7 vs. 90.5 +/- 148.2, P = 0.048) than those without. E. coli and Enterococcus spp. are common pathogens and ureteral stricture and residual urine are risk factors for UTI after ileal neobladder reconstruction.
27364153	Cytotoxicity of the Roots of Trillium govanianum Against Breast (MCF7), Liver (HepG2), Lung (A549) and Urinary Bladder (EJ138) Carcinoma Cells.	Trillium govanianum Wall. (Melanthiaceae alt. Trilliaceae), commonly known as 'nag chhatri' or 'teen patra', is a native species of the Himalayas. It is used in various traditional medicines containing both steroids and sex hormones. In folk medicine, the rhizomes of T. govanianum are used to treat boils, dysentery, inflammation, menstrual and sexual disorders, as an antiseptic and in wound healing. With the only exception of the recent report on the isolation of a new steroidal saponin, govanoside A, together with three known steroidal compounds with antifungal property from this plant, there has been no systematic pharmacological and phytochemical work performed on T. govanianum. This paper reports, for the first time, on the cytotoxicity of the methanol extract of the roots of T. govanianum and its solid-phase extraction (SPE) fractions against four human carcinoma cell lines: breast (MCF7), liver (HEPG2), lung (A549) and urinary bladder (EJ138), using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazoliumbromide cytotoxicity assay and liquid chromatography and electrospray ionization quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry analysis of the SPE fractions. The methanol extract and all SPE fractions exhibited considerable levels of cytotoxicity against all cell lines, with the IC50 values ranging between 5 and 16 microg/mL. Like other Trillium species, presence of saponins and sapogenins in the SPE fractions was evident in the liquid chromatography mass spectrometry data. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
27363067	Inverted Papilloma of the Bladder Coexisting with Urothelial Carcinoma. A Case Report.	BACKGROUND: Inverted papilloma (IP) is an unusual benign neoplasm, most commonly found in the bladder. Cases of malignant transformation have been reported in the past, although most of them are now considered to be urothelial carcinomas with an inverted growth pattern. CASE: A 54-year-old man was diagnosed with urothelial carcinoma in situ (UCIS), high-grade papillary urothelial carcinoma (HGPUC), and IP by transurethral resection specimen of the bladder. The urothelial carcinoma cells were seen colonizing the inverted papilloma. CONCLUSION: The coexistence of IP with UCIS and HGPUC is rare. Immunohistochemistry helps distinguish between IP and UC in difficult cases such as this one. A brief review of other reported cases of inverted papilloma coexisting with urothelial carcinoma in the English literature over the past 25 years is presented.
27363065	Diagnostic Value of Urine Cytology in Bladder Cancer. A Meta-Analysis.	OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the diagnostic value of urine cytology in detecting bladder cancer using meta-analysis. STUDY DESIGN: Public databases, including PubMed, Embase, Springer, Elsevier Science Direct, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar, were searched before February 2015. Sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio (LR), negative LR, and diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) of urine cytology in individual studies were calculated using random effects model or fixed effect model. The summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC) curve was applied for performance of urine cytology. Publication bias of the included studies was evaluated by Egger's test. RESULTS: A total of 17 separate studies consisting of 5,908 patients with bladder cancer were included in the meta-analysis. Significant heterogeneity between the studies (I2 = 98.6%, p < 0.01) and effect sizes were pooled using random effects model. Overall sensitivity, specificity, positive LR, negative LR, and DOR of urine cytology were 0.37 (95% CI 0.35-0.39), 0.95 (95% CI 0.94-0.95), 7.39 (95% CI 4.97-10.98), 0.56 (95% CI 0.47-0.68), and 15.76 (95% CI 9.03-27.50), respectively. The area under the curve (AUC) and Q* index were 0.80 and 0.74, respectively. No publication bias was observed (p = 0.12). CONCLUSION: Our data indicate that urine cytology might be more suitable as an assistant method in bladder cancer detection by combining with other diagnostic methods with high sensitivity.
27363063	Prognostic Significance of Mitotic Activity in Noninvasive, Low-Grade, Papillary Urothelial Carcinoma.	OBJECTIVE: To identify the most useful method to detect the mitotic count (MC) by comparing different techniques, to determine a cutoff value for mitotic activity (MA), and to evaluate the correlation of this value with the recurrence of noninvasive low-grade papillary urothelial neoplasm (LGPUC). STUDY DESIGN: Hematoxylin and eosin-stained slides of 55 LGPUC cases were evaluated for their MA. MC was determined using 4 different methods. In Method 1, cases with 3 mitoses in 1 single focus of a high-power field (HPF x 400) were found, and in Method 2, cases with >/= 5 mitoses in 1 singlefocus of an HPF, in any level of the neoplastic epithelium, were determined. The areas with the highest MA values in the lower third and those with the highest MA values in the upper two-thirds of the neoplastic epithelium were marked in Methods 3 and 4, respectively. Then, mitotic figures were counted in these fields, and cases with 5 mitoses were determined. RESULTS: In the recurrent group the number of cases with >/= 5 mitoses, as detected by Methods 2 and 4, was significantly higher than that found for the nonrecurrent group (p = 0.0001 and p = 0.002, respectively). The number of mitoses, as detected by Methods 1 and 3, was not significantly different between the groups. CONCLUSION: We suggest that determining MC may be used as a prognostic marker to predict LGPUC recurrence and that the mitotic numbers should be included in the initial pathology report to guide the clinician in patient management.
27362898	Intravesical Hemostatic Clip Migration After Robotic Prostatectomy: Case Series and Review of the Literature.	INTRODUCTION: The Weck Hem-o-lok Ligating clip is a routinely used hemostatic tool in robotic and laparoscopic surgery. It has been the practice in our institution to use such clips for hemostasis of the vascular bundles during robotic prostatectomy. Migration of such clips has been reported in the literature as single case reports. In this study, we present a case series of intravesical Weck clip extrusions presenting as bladder calculi. Such events have led to a change in our practice, and more research is needed to assess the impact of this change. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective chart review was conducted over the period 2006-2011. Patients included in the study required cystoscopic intervention for removal of encrusted or impacted Weck clips. Primary data points included type of intervention required, time to presentation, and number of presentations. Postoperative anastomotic leak, duration of postoperative hospital stay, and initial operative time were also investigated. RESULTS: Out of 570 total men undergoing robotic-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (RALRP), eight required return to the operating room for clip extraction (1.4%). Extraction methods included laser lithotripsy, blunt litholapaxy, and grasper extraction. Men experiencing clip migration were hospitalized for a longer period of time (7.6 days vs. 2.1 days, P < .01) and they required more blood transfusions (1.4 units vs. 0.05 units, P < .01) than men who did not experience clip migration. The most common site for clip intrusion was the bladder neck. Average time to presentation was 1.75 years. DISCUSSION: Weck clip migration is a recognized complication of robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy. Men with recurrent urinary tract infection, bothersome voiding symptoms, or hematuria following RALRP should be considered for cystoscopic evaluation. Increased length of hospital stays and the need for a larger volume blood transfusion following prostatectomy were significant predictors of clip migration. More research is needed to determine if implemented changes to our surgical technique have mitigated these risks.
27362572	Primary Neuroendocrine Tumors of the Ureter: A Short Review.	Neuroendocrine tumors represent 0.05% of urinary tract malignancies, and most originate in the bladder. Their pathogenesis is debated, since ureters are thought to lack neuroendocrine cells. Morphologically, most ureteral neuroendocrine tumors demonstrate the typical small cell neuroendocrine appearance, are immunohistochemically positive for synaptophysin/chromogranin A/CD56, and show electron-dense granules by electron microscopy. Clinical presentation is similar to that of other more common ureteral neoplasms. Prognosis is usually dismal, but a multimodal treatment approach including platinum-based adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy seems to be beneficial.
27362418	A Powerful Procedure for Pathway-Based Meta-analysis Using Summary Statistics Identifies 43 Pathways Associated with Type II Diabetes in European Populations.	Meta-analysis of multiple genome-wide association studies (GWAS) has become an effective approach for detecting single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) associations with complex traits. However, it is difficult to integrate the readily accessible SNP-level summary statistics from a meta-analysis into more powerful multi-marker testing procedures, which generally require individual-level genetic data. We developed a general procedure called Summary based Adaptive Rank Truncated Product (sARTP) for conducting gene and pathway meta-analysis that uses only SNP-level summary statistics in combination with genotype correlation estimated from a panel of individual-level genetic data. We demonstrated the validity and power advantage of sARTP through empirical and simulated data. We conducted a comprehensive pathway-based meta-analysis with sARTP on type 2 diabetes (T2D) by integrating SNP-level summary statistics from two large studies consisting of 19,809 T2D cases and 111,181 controls with European ancestry. Among 4,713 candidate pathways from which genes in neighborhoods of 170 GWAS established T2D loci were excluded, we detected 43 T2D globally significant pathways (with Bonferroni corrected p-values < 0.05), which included the insulin signaling pathway and T2D pathway defined by KEGG, as well as the pathways defined according to specific gene expression patterns on pancreatic adenocarcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, and bladder carcinoma. Using summary data from 8 eastern Asian T2D GWAS with 6,952 cases and 11,865 controls, we showed 7 out of the 43 pathways identified in European populations remained to be significant in eastern Asians at the false discovery rate of 0.1. We created an R package and a web-based tool for sARTP with the capability to analyze pathways with thousands of genes and tens of thousands of SNPs.
27358136	BLCA-4 and UBC combined detection for early diagnosis of bladder cancer.	The objective of the present study was to report the clinical significance of bladder cancer specific nuclear matrix protein 4 (BLCA-4) and urinary bladder cancer (UBC) on early diagnosis of bladder cancers. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to detect BLCA-4 and UBC of 56 bladder cancer patients and 26 patients with urinary tract benign diseases, serving as controls. Urine exfoliated cell test was performed, and then the significance of BLCA-4 and UBC on the diagnosis of bladder cancers was analyzed. The sensitivity of BLCA-4 and UBC of the bladder cancer patients was significantly higher than that of the urine exfoliated cell test (P less than 0.05). The difference of BLCA-4 and UBC was not significant (P >0.05). The difference of BLCA-4 and UBC in the tumors with different gradings and stagings was not significant (P >0.05). Combined detection of BLCA-4 and UBC could improve the diagnosis sensitivity and specificity of bladder cancers with the advantages of high maneuverability, repeatability and objective results.
27357719	Nuclear size measurement for distinguishing urothelial carcinomas from reactive urothelium on tissue sections.	BACKGROUND: Pathological diagnosis of urothelial carcinoma (UC) is primarily based on cytological atypia. It has previously been shown that high-grade (HG) UC, particularly UC in situ cells (CIS), can be over five times the size of a lymphocyte. However, this has not been demonstrated in comparison to reactive urothelium. The objective of this study was to empirically compare the difference in nuclear size of UC cells with reactive urothelial cells. METHODS: Using CellSens imaging software, we measured urothelial nuclear length (l) and width (w) on digital images of H&E sections. The area (a) of a nucleus was calculated based on the oval shape of most urothelial cells. Lymphocytes were measured to calculate normalized urothelial linear and area ratios. RESULTS: A total of 1085 urothelial cell nuclei from 60 cases were measured from reactive urothelium, low grade (LG) UC, HG UC and CIS. CIS nuclei were found to have an a 2.75 times larger than reactive nuclei (p < 0.001). A nuclear size cut-off of 11 um for l and 7 um for w was found to be sensitive [98.09 % (95 % CI: 95.60-99.38 %) and 89.31 % (95 % CI: 83.6-91.82 %) for l and w, respectively] and specific [92.60 % (95 % CI: 87.13-95.82 %) and 85.71 % (95 % CI: 79.49-90.63 %) for l and w, respectively] for distinguishing CIS from reactive atypia. CONCLUSIONS: Nuclear morphometry can be used to differentiate CIS from reactive atypia. A l over 11 um and a w over 7 um and is highly sensitive and specific for CIS compared to reactive urothelium. This difference in nuclear size may be used as a tool for differentiating the flat urothelial lesions from reactive urothelium in daily practice.
27357429	Aberrantly expressed microRNAs in bladder cancer and renal cell carcinoma.	Bladder cancer (BC) and renal cell carcinoma (RCC) are frequently diagnosed urinary tract cancers. Recently developed molecular-targeted therapies for RCC have shown remarkable therapeutic efficacy; however, no targeted therapeutics are currently approved for the treatment of BC, and few effective treatment options exist. Current studies have shown that small noncoding RNA molecules have major roles in cancer cells. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous small noncoding RNA molecules that regulate protein-/nonprotein-coding RNAs in human cells. A large body of evidence suggests that aberrantly expressed miRNAs are deeply involved in the pathogenesis of human cancers. In this paper, we review recently published miRNA expression signatures of BC and RCC. We focus on downregulated or upregulated miRNAs in multiple signatures and discuss putative target genes of miRNAs. Comparisons of RCC and BC expression signatures revealed that the two types of cancer showed opposite expression patterns for miR-200 family miRNAs (i.e., miR-141/200c and miR-200a/200b/429). We discuss in silico analysis of genes targeted by miR-200 family miRNAs and the molecular mechanisms underlying BC and RCC.
27357064	Evaluation of RNA and DNA extraction from liquid-based cytology specimens.	Molecular diagnosis using DNA and RNA derived from malignant tumors and molecular biological tools such as the quantitative polymerase-chain-reaction (qPCR) is a commonly used technique in clinical pathology. In this report, we compared the qualitative extraction of RNA and DNA from cancer cells fixed using several liquid-based cytology (LBC) kits. Ten to 1,000 cells from the T24 urinary bladder cancer cell line and SKG-II cervical cancer cell line were fixed with 55% methanol and three different methanol-based LBC solutions. The mRNA levels of CD44 in T24 cells and E7 in SKG-II cells and DNA levels of p53 in T24 cells and E7 in SKG-II cells were analyzed by qPCR. mRNA and DNA extracted from T24 and/or SKG-II cells fixed with methanol-based LBC solutions were efficiently detected, but to differing degrees, by qPCR. mRNA, and DNA from cells fixed with a formaldehyde-containing fixative liquid were detected at significantly low copy numbers by qPCR. Our results demonstrate that LBC systems are powerful tools for cytopathology and immunocytochemistry applications. However, the appropriate fixative must be selected for cell preservation when a small number of LBC samples is used for molecular testing, particularly in RNA-based molecular analyses. Diagn.

27356780	Biological effects of eukaryotic recombinant plasmid pReceiver-M61-BAI-1 transfection on T24 cells and HUVECs.	The aim of the current study was to investigate the biological effect on T24 cells and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) of transfection with brain-specific angiogenesis inhibitor-1 (BAI-1). The recombinant plasmid pReceiver-M61-BAI-1 was transfected into human superficial bladder tumor cells (T24) and HUVECs, in parallel with the vector control. mRNA and protein expression levels of BAI1 were then detected by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and western blotting, respectively. Cell apoptosis of T24 cells and HUVECs prior and subsequent to transfection with BAI1 was analyzed by flow cytometric analysis. Proliferation of T24 cells and HUVECs prior and subsequent to transfection of BAI-1 was assessed by the MTT method. T24 cells and HUVECs transfected with pReceiverM61BA11 were classed as the experimental group; T24 cells and HUVECs transfected with pReceiverM61 were the control group. qPCR and western blotting methods confirmed that there was positive expression of BAI1 in T24 cells and HUVECs transfected with pReceiverM61BAI1, however BAI1 was not expressed in T24 cells and HUVECs transfected with pReceiverM61. The results of the MTT assay demonstrated that absorbance was markedly reduced in HUVECs at 12, 48 and 72 h subsequent to transfection with pReceiver-M61-BAI-1 when compared with that of the control group and in T24 cells transfected with pReceiver-M61-BAI-1. Furthermore, flow cytometry results also indicated that the apoptotic rate of HUVECs transfected with pReceiverM61BAI1 was significantly increased compared with that of the control group and T24 cells transfected with pReceiverM61BAI1. BAI1 was observed to markedly inhibit the proliferation of vascular endothelial cells in vitro, however, no direct inhibition by BAI1 was observed in T24 cells. In conclusion, BAI-1 is suggested to be a potential novel therapautic target for the inhibition of tumor neovascularization.
27356691	Oncogenic Activation of Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor-3 and RAS Genes as Non-Overlapping Mutual Exclusive Events in Urinary Bladder Cancer.	BACKGROUND: Urinary bladder cancer is a common malignancy in the West and ranks as the 7th most common cancer in our region of Kashmir, India. FGFR3 mutations are frequent in superficial urothelial carcinoma (UC) differing from the RAS gene mutational pattern. The aim of this study was to analyze the frequency and association of FGFR3 and RAS gene mutations in UC cases. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Paired tumor and adjacent normal tissue specimens of 65 consecutive UC patients were examined. DNA preparations were evaluated for the occurrence of FGFR3 and RAS gene mutations by PCR-SCCP and DNA sequencing. RESULTS: Somatic point mutations of FGFR3 were identified in 32.3% (21 of 65). The pattern and distribution were significantly associated with low grade/stage (<0.05). The overall mutations in exon 1 and 2 in all the forms of RAS genes aggregated to 21.5% and showed no association with any clinic-pathological parameters. In total, 53.8% (35 of 65) of the tumors studied had mutations in either a RAS or FGFR3 gene, but these were totally mutually exclusive in and none of the samples showed both the mutational events in mutually exclusive RAS and FGFR3. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that RAS and FGFR3 mutations in UC are mutually exclusive and non-overlapping events which reflect activation of oncogenic pathways through different elements.
27356628	MicroRNA335 inhibits bladder cancer cell growth and migration by targeting mitogenactivated protein kinase 1.	The abnormal expression of microRNAs (miRs) as oncogenes or tumorsuppressor genes has been widely investigated in various tumor types. However, the roles of miR335 in bladder cancer cells have remained elusive. The aim of the present study was to assess the expression of miR335 in bladder cancer as well as the effects of miR335 on bladder cancer cell proliferation, metastasis and apoptosis. PCR and western blot analyses revealed that miR335 was significantly downregulated in bladder cancer tissues, and low levels of miR335 were associated with more aggressive phenotypes of bladder cancer. Overexpression of miR335 in T24 cells inhibited cell proliferation and induced apoptosis as indicated by an MTT assay and flow cytometric analysis, respectively. Furthermore, overexpression of miR335 significantly suppressed cell migration, as indicated by a Transwell assay. The expression of mitogenactivated protein kinase (MAPK)1 was decreased after overexpression of miR335, indicating that MAPK1 may be a target gene of miR335. In addition, silencing of MAPK1 inhibited the proliferation and migration of bladder cancer cells. In conclusion, the results of the present study demonstrated that miR335 was significantly downregulated in bladder cancer, and may act as a tumor suppressor through repression of MAPK1.
27355528	Dual tumor-suppressors miR-139-5p and miR-139-3p targeting matrix metalloprotease 11 in bladder cancer.	Our recent study of the microRNA (miRNA) expression signature of bladder cancer (BC) by deep-sequencing revealed that two miRNA, microRNA-139-5p/microRNA-139-3p were significantly downregulated in BC tissues. The aim of this study was to investigate the functional roles of these miRNA and their modulation of cancer networks in BC cells. Functional assays of BC cells were performed using transfection of mature miRNA or small interfering RNA (siRNA). Genome-wide gene expression analysis, in silico analysis and dual-luciferase reporter assays were applied to identify miRNA targets. The associations between the expression of miRNA and its targets and overall survival were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Gain-of-function studies showed that miR-139-5p and miR-139-3p significantly inhibited cell migration and invasion by BC cells. The matrix metalloprotease 11 gene (MMP11) was identified as a direct target of miR-139-5p and miR-139-3p. Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed that higher expression of MMP11 predicted shorter survival of BC patients (P = 0.029). Downregulated miR-139-5p or miR-139-3p enhanced BC cell migration and invasion in BC cells. MMP11 was directly regulated by these miRNA and might be a good prognostic marker for survival of BC patients.
27354552	Patient-Reported Convalescence and Quality of Life Recovery: A Comparison of Open and Robotic-Assisted Radical Cystectomy.	Background Robotic-assisted radical cystectomy (RARC) is gaining traction as a surgical approach, but there are limited data on patient-reported outcomes for this technique compared to open radical cystectomy (ORC). Objective To compare health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and short-term convalescence among bladder cancer patients who underwent ORC and RARC. Methods Review of a single-institution bladder cancer database was conducted. Baseline and postoperative HRQoL was evaluated using the Bladder Cancer Index (BCI) for 324 patients who had ORC (n = 267) or RARC (n = 57) between 2008 and 2012. The BCI assesses function and bother in urinary, bowel, and sexual domains. Among 87 distinct patients (ORC n = 67, RARC n = 20), we also evaluated short-term postoperative convalescence using the Convalescence and Recovery Evaluation (CARE) questionnaire. Our primary outcomes were HRQoL within 12 months and short-term convalescence within 6 weeks following cystectomy. We fit generalized estimating equation regression models to estimate longitudinal changes in BCI scores within domains, and CARE domain score differences were tested with Wilcoxon rank-sum tests. Results Clinical characteristics and baseline BCI/CARE scores were similar between the 2 groups (all P > .05). Within 1 year after surgery, recovery of HRQoL across all BCI domains was comparable, with scores nearly returning to baseline at 1 year for all patients. CARE scores at 4 weeks revealed that patients treated with ORC had better pain (29.1 vs 20.0, P = .02) domain scores compared to RARC. These differences abated by week 6. Conclusions HRQoL recovery and short-term convalescence were similar in this cohort following ORC and RARC.
27353172	Urachal adenocarcinoma incidentally discovered in a young woman at elective caesarean section.	Urachal adenocarcinoma is a rare non-urothelial malignancy that represents only 0.5% of all vesical cancers. Urachal adenocarcinoma most commonly occurs in the 5th to 7th decade. We describe a case of a 35-year-old woman (G3P1) who presented at 20 weeks pregnancy with two episodes of post-coital bleeding. Ultrasound demonstrated a uterine mass measuring 59x43x56 mm, presumed to be a leiomyoma. The decision was made to proceed to caesarean section at 38 weeks, given the progression of the presumed leiomyoma. A 2 cm bladder dome mass was incidentally discovered at the time of the caesarean section and an urgent intraoperative urology consult was sought. Resultantly, the bladder mass was dissected to the dome, and pathology returned urachal adenocarcinoma. This case report considers the treatment decisions involved when faced with urachal adenocarcinoma and reviews the literature surrounding this rare malignancy.
27352332	Ectopic WWOX Expression Inhibits Growth of 5637 Bladder Cancer Cell In Vitro and In Vivo.	WW domain-containing oxidoreductase (WWOX) gene located in the common fragile site FRA16D region exhibits loss or reduction of expression in multiple types of carcinomas including bladder cancer. However, the role of WWOX in the tumorigenesis and development of bladder cancer remains elusive. In this study, WWOX overexpression construct was transfected into 5637 bladder cancer cell line in which WWOX expression was compromised. Constitutive expression of ectopic WWOX in 5637 cells suppressed cell proliferation and cell cycle progression, which was associated with downregulation of Cyclin B, D1, and E. Moreover, WWOX overexpression promoted apoptosis in 5637 cells and resulted in upregulation of Bax, downregulation of Bcl-2, and elevated levels of cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved PARP, indicating activation of the intrinsic apoptosis pathway. Furthermore, WWOX overexpression suppressed tumorigenicity of 5637 cells and promoted apoptosis in the xenograft tumors as demonstrated in a xenograft mouse model. In summary, our data indicate that WWOX plays a critical role in the regulation of proliferation, cell cycle, apoptosis, and tumorigenesis of bladder cancer cells, suggesting that WWOX may have potential clinical implications in bladder cancer therapy.
27352265	Bladder Cancer and Genetic Mutations.	The most common type of urinary bladder cancer is called as transitional cell carcinoma. The major risk factors for bladder cancer are environmental, tobacco smoking, exposure to toxic industrial chemicals and gases, bladder inflammation due to microbial and parasitic infections, as well as some adverse side-effects of medications. The genetic mutations in some chromosomal genes, such as FGFR3, RB1, HRAS, TP53, TSC1, and others, occur which form tumors in the urinary bladder. These genes play an important role in the regulation of cell division which prevents cells from dividing too quickly. The changes in the genes of human chromosome 9 are usually responsible for tumor in bladder cancer, but the genetic mutation of chromosome 22 can also result in bladder cancer. The identification of p53 gene mutation has been studied at NIH, Washington, DC, USA, in urine samples of bladder cancer patients. The invasive bladder cancers were determined for the presence of gene mutations on p53 suppressor gene. The 18 different bladder tumors were evaluated, and 11 (61 %) had genetic mutations of p53 gene. The bladder cancer studies have suggested that 70 % of bladder cancers involve a specific mutation in a particular gene, namely telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) gene. The TERT gene is involved in DNA protection, cellular aging processes, and cancer. The Urothelial carcinomas of the bladder have been described in Atlas of genetics and cytogenetics in oncology and hematology. HRAS is a proto-oncogene and has potential to cause cancer in several organs including the bladder. The TSC1 c. 1907 1908 del (E636fs) mutation in bladder cancer suggests that the location of the mutation is Exon 15 with frequency of TSC1 mutation of 11.7 %. The recent findings of BAP1 mutations have shown that it contributes to BRCA pathway alterations in bladder cancer. The discoveries of more gene mutations and new biomarkers and polymerase chain reaction bioassays for gene mutations in bladder cancer need further research.
27351322	Clinical Use of Tumor Markers for the Detection and Prognosis of Bladder Carcinoma: A Comparison of CD44, Cytokeratin 20 and Survivin.	PURPOSE: To investigate the role of CD44, cytokeratin 20 (CK20) and survivin for the detection and prognosis of patients with urothelial carcinoma of the bladder. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included 82 patients who underwent transurethral resection of bladder tumors between 2009 and 2014. The patient and tumor characteristics with relevance to age, tumor size and focality, grade and stage, recurrence and progression were noted. Patients with carcinoma in situ, those who had at more than 3 sites of lesions and greater than 3 cm tumors were excluded. All cases were ex-smokers. All histological samples stained with hematoxylin and eosin were re-evaluated according to the 2004 World Health Organization/International Society of Urological Pathology (WHO/ISUP) classification system and immunohistochemically stained for CD44, CK20 and survivin. RESULTS: The study group comprised 57 (69.5%) males and 25 (30.5%) females with a mean age of 60 years (range, 26-87 years). All were newly-diagnosed patients with bladder tumors. Immunohistochemical evaluation revealed that there was a statistically significant correlation between the grade and stage of the tumor with CK20 and survivin positivity (P &lt; .05). As the grade and stage increased CD44 immunoreactivity significantly decreased (P = .002, P = .0001, respectively). However, relationship of protein expressions with recurrence and progression remained insignificant (P &gt; .05). CONCLUSION: In cases of bladder urothelial carcinoma positivity for CD44, CK20, and survivin has significant relation with the tumor grade and stage while no significant relationship was determined in terms of recurrence and progression&nbsp.
27350089	TGF-beta1 promotes the migration and invasion of bladder carcinoma cells by increasing fascin1 expression.	Transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) is a multifunctional cytokine that is reported to regulate cellular motility and invasive capability during tumor progression. Fascin1, an actin-bundling protein, increases cell motility, migration and adhesion. To investigate the function of TGF-beta1 and test whether fascin1 is an important mediator of the tumor response to TGF-beta1 in bladder carcinoma cells, real-time RT-PCR and western blot analysis were used to test changes in fascin1 expression after TGF-beta1 (10 ng/ml) treatment in T24 and BIU87 cells. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) technique was performed to silence fascin1. Cell viability and biological behavior changes were evaluated by cell growth (MTT), wound-healing and Matrigel invasion assays. In the present study, we found that the mRNA and protein levels of fascin1 in the T24 and BIU87 cells were significantly increased after 10 ng/ml TGF-beta1 treatment (p<0.05). The proliferation of T24 cells (p=0.005) was also significantly increased, while no significant change was observed in BIU87 cells (p=0.318). In addition, the migratory and invasive potential of the two cell lines were promoted. Furthermore, we successfully silenced fascin1, and observed that fascin1 siRNA significantly attenuated the migration and invasiveness induced by TGF-beta1. The findings suggested that TGF-beta1 can promote invasion and migration of T24 and BIU87 bladder carcinoma cells, and the increase in fascin1 expression may be the key point of this impact of TGF-beta1.
27349891	Comparison between completely and traditionally retroperitoneoscopic nephroureterectomy for upper tract urothelial cancer.	BACKGROUND: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of the completely retroperitoneoscopic nephroureterectomy (CRNU), a retrospectively comparative study between completely and traditionally retroperitoneoscopic nephroureterectomy (TRNU) was done in a single center. METHODS: From January 2014 to December 2014, 107 patients with upper tract urothelial cancer (UTUC) underwent CRNU. The kidney was retroperitoneoscopically dissected and the bladder cuff was cut by endoscopic gastrointestinal automatic stapler, and the specimen was removed from a 6-cm incision by posterior axillary line. Demographic, perioperative, and follow-up data were collected and compared retrospectively with 110 patients undergoing TRNU. RESULTS: The patients' characteristics between the two groups were not statistically different (p > 0.05), and all patients successfully received the procedure. The mean operative time (106 +/- 37.9 versus 199 +/- 69.1 min, p < 0.0001), the mean estimated blood loss (47.2 +/- 82.4 versus 166.9 +/- 250.9 ml, p = 0.002), and the mean hospital stay (6.1 +/- 3.5 versus 8.1 +/- 3.3 days, p = 0.03) of the CRNU group decreased significantly compared to the traditional group. The operative time was not affected by gender. No open conversion and major complications occurred. The surgical margin of the ureter was all negative. The mean follow-up time was 13.4 months for the CRNU group and 37.5 months for the TRNU group. All follow-up patients in the CRNU group were alive without local recurrence. No cases of port site metastasis and local recurrence were observed in both groups. Bladder tumor recurrence occurred in 4 patients of the CRNU group and 21 patients of the TRNU group. CONCLUSIONS: The CRNU using an endoscopic gastrointestinal automatic stapler to manage the bladder cuff is feasible and advantageous in decreasing the operative time, the blood loss, and the hospital stay. However, a larger sample and longer follow-up time will be still required.
27349431	Current status of systemic chemotherapy for octogenarians with advanced urothelial cancer in Japan: a Japanese multi-institutional study (CURE study).	BACKGROUND: The standard regimen of systemic chemotherapy for patients with advanced urothelial cancer (UC) changed from methotrexate, vinblastine, adriamycin, and cisplatin (MVAC) to gemcitabine and cisplatin (GC) in 2008 when the use of gemcitabine for UC began to be reimbursed by public health insurance in Japan. We examined its influence on the chemotherapy trend in elderly patients aged >/=80 years. METHODS: Among 345 patients included in our previous multicenter retrospective cohort study (chemotherapy for urothelial carcinoma: renal function and efficacy study; CURE study), the outcome of 30 patients aged >/=80 years was reviewed before and after 2008 and compared with 315 young patients. RESULTS: There were only 7 (4.6 %) elderly individuals among all registered patients before 2008, whereas the number increased to 23 (12 %) after 2008. Before 2008, only one elderly patient received MVAC, while GC (whose rate was similar to the rate in young patients) was administered to 13 patients (56.5 %) after 2008. The chemotherapeutic effect and overall survival (OS) rate was not significantly different between young and elderly patients. In the elderly treated with the GC regimen, the renal impairment rate after the first cycle was significantly higher, and the presence of distant metastases and renal impairment were independent prognostic factors in a multivariate analysis. CONCLUSION: Since GC was approved as the standard regimen for first-line chemotherapy in UC, selected elderly patients have been able to safely receive systemic chemotherapy like young patients. The clinical response rate and OS rate were similar to the young, but we need to monitor changes in renal function more closely in the elderly treated with GC.
27349281	RIP kinase-mediated ROS production triggers XAF1 expression through activation of TAp73 in casticin-treated bladder cancer cells.	The p53 family protein p73 plays an important role in apoptosis induced by chemotherapeutic drugs. Transcriptionally active (TA) p73 (TAp73) substitutes for p53 in the response to stress. XIAP associated factor 1 (XAF1) is a novel predictive and prognostic factor in patients with bladder cancer, but the association between TAp73 and XAF1 expression in bladder cancer cells is poorly understood. Here, we investigated the status of TAp73 and XAF1 in T24 bladder cancer cells to identify molecular mechanisms in casticinexposed T24 cells. Casticin induced activation of JNK/p38 MAPK that preceded activation of the caspase cascade and disruption of the mitochondria membrane potential (psim). Expression of XAF1 and TAp73 was also upregulated in casticin-treated T24 cells. Casticin treatment of T24 cells induced receptor-interacting protein (RIP) kinase expression and increased intracellular production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Casticin-mediated ROS induced an increase in phosphorylated JNK/p38 MAPK, resulting in progressive upregulation of TAp73, which in turn led to XAF1 expression. Our data suggest that the apoptotic activity of casticin in T24 cells is mediated by activation of the TAp73-XAF1 signaling pathway through RIP kinase-mediated ROS production.
27346472	[Changes in radiotherapy indication for early-stage operated endometrial cancer. Revised staging, predictive factors. Conclusions from our own results].	Optimal postoperative radiotherapy indications for early-stage operated endometrial cancers have drastically changed with the new imaging generation (magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography/computed tomography) and more detailed pathomorphology. The depth and growth of tumor invasion, presence or absence of the lymph node metastases, grading and lymphovascular invasion are the most important factors to predict the progression and to influence the prognosis. In 2016, on the basis of these, the European Gynecologist Oncology and Radiotherapy Society published a report in which they proposed unanimously indications for postoperative radio- and/or radiochemotherapy. The basis of their work was prospective multilevel randomized investigations which could avoid over- or undertreatment hazards. The results obtained by the authors of this article from 164 operated patients in early-stage endometrium carcinoma seem to be acceptable, in spite of the fact that their earlier radiotherapy indication was different and in the pathological description lymphovascular invasion was not included and the grading was not always applied.
27345655	Bladder cancer.	Bladder cancer is a complex disease associated with high morbidity and mortality rates if not treated optimally. Awareness of haematuria as the major presenting symptom is paramount, and early diagnosis with individualised treatment and follow-up is the key to a successful outcome. For non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer, the mainstay of treatment is complete resection of the tumour followed by induction and maintenance immunotherapy with intravesical BCG vaccine or intravesical chemotherapy. For muscle-invasive bladder cancer, multimodal treatment involving radical cystectomy with neoadjuvant chemotherapy offers the best chance for cure. Selected patients with muscle-invasive tumours can be offered bladder-sparing trimodality treatment consisting of transurethral resection with chemoradiation. Advanced disease is best treated with systemic cisplatin-based chemotherapy; immunotherapy is emerging as a viable salvage treatment for patients in whom first-line chemotherapy cannot control the disease. Developments in the past 2 years have shed light on genetic subtypes of bladder cancer that might differ from one another in response to various treatments.
27344535	[Expected benefit of lymph node and seminal vesical dissection to decrease high-risk prostate cancer radiotherapy].	PURPOSE: In case of pelvic lymph node and seminal vesicle dissection followed by prostate cancer intensity-modulated radiotherapy, the objective of the study was to evaluate the dosimetric benefit of reducing the target volume. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 25 patients with high-risk prostate cancer had surgery first followed by intensity-modulated radiotherapy and androgen deprivation. Four treatment planning were simulated for each patient, based on two CT scans performed before and after surgery. The target volumes were: prostate-seminal vesicles-lymph nodes, prostate-lymph nodes, prostate-seminal vesicles and prostate only. The total dose was 46Gy in the seminal vesicles and lymph nodes, and 80Gy in the prostate. RESULTS: Compared to prostate target volume only, the addition of seminal vesicles and lymph nodes multiplied by a factor of 1.6 and 6.5 the target volume, respectively. Decreasing the target volume from prostate-seminal vesicles-lymph nodes to prostate-seminal vesicles, to prostate only decreased the rectal wall mean dose from 49Gy to 42Gy, to 36Gy, and the risk of late rectal bleeding from 4.4% to 3.2%, to 2.4% (P<0.05), respectively. The bladder wall mean dose decreased from 51Gy to 40Gy, to 35Gy (P<0,05), respectively. Not irradiating the lymph nodes decreased the absolute risk of diarrhea by 11%. CONCLUSION: Lymph node and seminal vesicle dissection before prostate cancer intensity-modulated radiotherapy allows decreasing moderately the risk of digestive toxicity.
27343313	Posterior pelvic exenteration and retrograde total hysterectomy in patients with locally advanced ovarian cancer: Clinical and functional outcome.	OBJECTIVE: To evaluate clinical outcomes and postoperative quality of life in patients affected by locally advanced ovarian cancer who underwent pelvic posterior exenteration with Hudson-Delle Piane radical retrograde hysterectomy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our study was done on a retrospective cohort using data from 22 patients who underwent surgery between 2010 and 2014 at the Gynecological Oncologic Center of Parma, Parma, Italy. RESULTS: Residual disease after surgery (Sugarbacker index) was absent (CC-0) in 68% of cases. Tumor size was < 2.5 mm (CC-1) in 14% of cases and between 2.5 mm and 2.5 cm (CC-2) in 18% of cases. Complications during surgical procedure occurred in 64% of patients (14/22), but without severe consequences. Immediate postoperative complications (</= 30 days) occurred in 82% of patients (18/22), and delayed complications (> 30 days) occurred in 23% (5/22) of patients. No patient died because of a complication. Urinary and rectal incontinence occurred in 5% and 16% of patients, respectively. Disease recurrence occurred in 58% of patients, median disease-free survival was 14 months (range, 6-36 months), and median overall survival was 21 months (range, 6-42 months). CONCLUSION: Our study confirmed that pelvic posterior exenteration associated with retrograde radical hysterectomy represents the safest radical surgical approach to advanced ovarian cancer, which permits preservation of the pelvic autonomic nerve plexus and, therefore, bladder and colorectal functions.
27339553	TUG1: a pivotal oncogenic long non-coding RNA of human cancers.	Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a group greater than 200 nucleotides in length. An increasing number of studies has shown that lncRNAs play important roles in diverse cellular processes, including proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, invasion and chromatin remodelling. In this regard, deregulation of lncRNAs has been documented in human cancers. TUG1 is a recently identified oncogenic lncRNA whose aberrant upregulation has been detected in different types of cancer, including B-cell malignancies, oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma, bladder cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma and osteosarcoma. In these malignancies, knock-down of TUG1 has been shown to suppress cell proliferation, invasion and/or colony formation. Interestingly, TUG1 has been found to be downregulated in non-small cell lung carcinoma, indicative of its tissue-specific function in tumourigenesis. Pertinent to clinical practice, TUG1 may act as a prognostic biomarker for tumours. In this review, we summarize current knowledge concerning the role of TUG1 in tumour progression and discuss mechanisms associated with it.
27339451	Loss of expression of the SWI/SNF complex is a frequent event in undifferentiated/dedifferentiated urothelial carcinoma of the urinary tract.	Loss of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex has been recently implicated in the pathogenesis of dedifferentiated carcinomas from different organs, but its possible role in undifferentiated urothelial carcinoma (UC) has not been studied to date. In this study, we analyzed by immunohistochemistry 14 undifferentiated UCs (11 from bladder and 3 from renal pelvis) with a nondescript anaplastic or rhabdoid morphology, using commercially available antibodies against the SWI/SNF components SMARCB1 (INI1), SMARCA2, SMARCA4, SMARCC1, SMARCC2, and ARID1A. Patients were eight females and six males aged 40 to 84 years (median, 65). All tumors were muscle-invasive (9 were T3-4). A conventional UC component was seen in eight cases and varied from in situ to papillary. The undifferentiated component comprised 60-100 % of the tumors. Histologically, most tumors showed diffuse dyscohesive or pseudoalveolar growth of variably sized cells with frequent rhabdoid features. Transition from conventional to undifferentiated UC was abrupt, except in one case. The undifferentiated component almost always expressed pan-cytokeratin AE1/AE3 (13/14) and variably vimentin (8/14) and GATA3 (9/14). Complete loss of at least one SWI/SNF subunit limited to the undifferentiated component was detected in 10/14 cases (71 %). SMARCA2 was most frequently lost (six) followed by ARID1A (four), SMARCB1/INI1 (two), SMARCA4 (one), and SMARCC1 (one). This is the first study exploring SWI/SNF expression in undifferentiated UC of the urinary tract. Our results are in line with recent studies reporting involvement of the SWI/SNF complex in the dedifferentiation process of a variety of epithelial neoplasms in different organs, including the urinary tract, and association with aggressive clinical course.
27338241	High expression of karyopherin-alpha2 and stathmin 1 is associated with proliferation potency and transformation in the bile duct and gall bladder epithelia in the cases of pancreaticobiliary maljunction.	BACKGROUNDS AND OBJECTIVES: Pancreaticobiliary maljunction (PBM) may be associated with an increased frequency of gall bladder cancer with no bile duct dilation. Karyopherin-alpha2 (KPNA2) and stathmin 1 (STMN1) were reported to play important roles in carcinogenesis and cancer progression. METHODS: Fifteen patients with PBM who underwent surgical resection between 1999 and 2014 were included in this study. Using immunohistochemistry, we investigated the expression of p53, Ki-67, KPNA2, and STMN1 in normal biliary tract epithelium, hyperplastic epithelium, and cholangiocarcinoma (CC) tissues. RESULTS: Nuclear expression of KPNA2, p53, and Ki-67 expression was detected in hyperplastic epithelium and CC tissues. High KPNA2 expression was significantly associated with gender (P = 0.04), p53 nuclear accumulation (P = 0.00435), and Ki-67 expression (P = 0.0443) in the gall bladder and bile duct of PBM. On the other hand, STMN1 was only expressed in CC tissues and was not observed in normal bile duct and hyperplastic epithelia. CONCLUSIONS: KPNA2 might be a useful marker of hyperplasia, dysplasia, and carcinogenicity in patients with PBM. STMN1 evaluation might be a cancer-specific marker for CC patients with PBM similar as that for other cancers. J. Surg. Oncol. 2016;114:462-468. (c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
27336876	Clinical outcomes in cervical cancer patients treated by FDG-PET/CT-based 3-dimensional planning for the first brachytherapy session.	The aim of the study was to evaluate the treatment outcomes in cervical cancer patients treated with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT)-guided 3-dimensional brachytherapy (3D-BT) planning for the first brachytherapy session.We retrospectively analyzed 87 patients with cervical cancer who received definitive radiotherapy (RT). Primary tumor size was </=4 cm in 22 patients (25.3%), >4 cm and </=6 cm in 45 patients (51.7%), and >6 cm in 20 patients (23.0%). The median total dose of external beam RT was 50.4 (50.4-60.4) Gy. FDG-PET/CT-guided 3D-BT with an iridium-192 source was performed. The clinical target volume (CTV) for 3D-BT included the entire cervix and the abnormal FDG-uptake with a 1-cm expansion. A planned total dose was 24 Gy at 4 Gy per insertion 3 times per week using a tandem and 2 ovoids.The mean D95 and D90 for the CTV were 73.4 (+/-5.9) Gy and 77.9 (+/-6.9) Gy, respectively (EQD2, alpha/beta=10). The D2cc for the rectum and bladder was 374 (+/-97.4) cGy and 394 (+/-107.6) cGy per fraction, respectively. The EQD2 (alpha/beta=3) for the D2cc was 74.5 (+/-12.4) Gy for the rectum and 77.3 (+/-14.6) Gy for the bladder. The median follow-up period was 40 (8-61) months. The 3-year overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and local control (LC) rates were 84.7%, 72.1%, and 89.2%, respectively. The 3-year LC rate was 100% for tumors </= 4 cm, 91.1% for tumors > 4 cm and </= 6 cm, and 70.5% for tumors > 6 cm (P = 0.014). Local failure developed in 9 patients. Three patients had local failures outside of the CTV. Grade 1, 2, and 3 rectal bleeding developed in 5, 4, and 2 patients, respectively. One patient experienced rectovaginal fistula.FDG-PET/CT-guided 3D-BT planning is a feasible approach, which showed favorable clinical outcomes.
27334654	Neuroendocrine Tumors of the Urinary Bladder According to the 2016 World Health Organization Classification: Molecular and Clinical Characteristics.	Neuroendocrine neoplasms of the urinary bladder are a rare type of tumor that account for a small percentage of urinary bladder neoplasms. These tumors of the urinary bladder range from well-differentiated neuroendocrine neoplasms (carcinoids) to the more aggressive subtypes such as small cell carcinoma. Despite the rarity of the neuroendocrine tumors of the bladder, there has been substantial investigation into the underlying genomic, molecular, and the cellular alterations within this group of neoplasms. Accordingly, these findings are increasingly incorporated into the understanding of clinical aspects of these neoplasms. In this review, we provide an overview of recent literature related to the 2016 World Health Organization Classification of Neuroendocrine Tumors of the Urinary Bladder. Particular emphasis is placed on molecular alterations and recently described gene expression. The neuroendocrine tumors of the urinary bladder are subdivided into four subtypes. Similar to their pulmonary and other extrapulmonary site counterparts, these have different degrees of neuroendocrine differentiation and morphological features. The clinical aspects of four subtypes of neuroendocrine tumor are discussed with emphasis of the most recent developments in diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis. An understanding of molecular basis of neuroendocrine tumors will provide a base of knowledge for future investigations into this group of unusual bladder neoplasms.
27333889	Generalized enrichment analysis improves the detection of adverse drug events from the biomedical literature.	BACKGROUND: Identification of associations between marketed drugs and adverse events from the biomedical literature assists drug safety monitoring efforts. Assessing the significance of such literature-derived associations and determining the granularity at which they should be captured remains a challenge. Here, we assess how defining a selection of adverse event terms from MeSH, based on information content, can improve the detection of adverse events for drugs and drug classes. RESULTS: We analyze a set of 105,354 candidate drug adverse event pairs extracted from article indexes in MEDLINE. First, we harmonize extracted adverse event terms by aggregating them into higher-level MeSH terms based on the terms' information content. Then, we determine statistical enrichment of adverse events associated with drug and drug classes using a conditional hypergeometric test that adjusts for dependencies among associated terms. We compare our results with methods based on disproportionality analysis (proportional reporting ratio, PRR) and quantify the improvement in signal detection with our generalized enrichment analysis (GEA) approach using a gold standard of drug-adverse event associations spanning 174 drugs and four events. For single drugs, the best GEA method (Precision: .92/Recall: .71/F1-measure: .80) outperforms the best PRR based method (.69/.69/.69) on all four adverse event outcomes in our gold standard. For drug classes, our GEA performs similarly (.85/.69/.74) when increasing the level of abstraction for adverse event terms. Finally, on examining the 1609 individual drugs in our MEDLINE set, which map to chemical substances in ATC, we find signals for 1379 drugs (10,122 unique adverse event associations) on applying GEA with p < 0.005. CONCLUSIONS: We present an approach based on generalized enrichment analysis that can be used to detect associations between drugs, drug classes and adverse events at a given level of granularity, at the same time correcting for known dependencies among events. Our study demonstrates the use of GEA, and the importance of choosing appropriate abstraction levels to complement current drug safety methods. We provide an R package for exploration of alternative abstraction levels of adverse event terms based on information content.
27323074	ERCC1 C118T polymorphism has predictive value for platinum-based chemotherapy in patients with late-stage bladder cancer.	This study aims to investigate the association between ERCC1 codon C118T polymorphism and the response rate of platinum-based chemotherapy in patients with late-stage bladder cancer. A total of 41 eligible patients histologically confirmed as having stage IV muscle-invasive transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder were treated with platinum-based chemotherapy for 2-6 cycles. The genotypes of patients were determined by PCR amplification of genomic DNA followed by restriction enzyme digestion. Positive responses were categorized as complete and partial responses. In addition, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were also determined as indicators of long-term outcomes. The genotype frequencies of C/C, C/T and T/T genotypes were 56.1, 34.1, and 9.8%, respectively. Positive response was observed in 14 patients (34.1%), while 27 patients (65.9%) were negative responders. As compared with individuals carrying the C/T and T/T genotypes, those with the C/C genotype had significantly improved short-term treatment responses (P = 0.018). The median PFS of patients carrying the C/C genotype was 6.3 months, while that of patients with C/T and T/T genotypes was 4.2 months (P = 0.023). Moreover, the median OS for patients carrying the C/C genotype was also longer as compared with that of patients carrying C/T and T/T (11.7 months vs 8.5 months, P = 0.040). Our results indicated that the ERCC1 codon 118 polymorphism may have predictive potential for chemotherapy treatment responses in late-stage bladder cancer patients.
27322648	Mutant p53 Gain of Function and Chemoresistance: The Role of Mutant p53 in Response to Clinical Chemotherapy.	PURPOSE: To review mechanisms underlying mutant p53 (mutp53) gain of function (GOF) and mutp53-induced chemoresistance, and to investigate the role of mutp53 in response to clinical chemotherapy. METHODS: We searched the PubMed database for clinical studies from the past decade, including data evaluating the impact of mutp53 in clinical chemotherapy response. RESULTS: Interactions between mutp53 and transcriptional factors, proteins or DNA structures, as well as epigenetic regulation, contribute to mutp53 GOF. Major mechanisms of mutp53-induced chemoresistance include enhanced drug efflux and metabolism, promoting survival, inhibiting apoptosis, upregulating DNA repair, suppressing autophagy, elevating microenvironmental resistance and inducing a stem-like phenotype. Clinically, mutp53 predicted resistance to chemotherapy in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, and esophageal and oropharyngeal cancers, but its impact on chronic lymphocytic leukemia was unclear. In bladder cancer, mutp53 did not predict resistance, whereas in some breast and ovarian cancers, it was associated with sensitivity to certain chemotherapeutic agents. CONCLUSION: mutp53 has an intricate role in the response to clinical chemotherapy and should not be interpreted in isolation. Furthermore, when predicting tumor response to chemotherapy based on the p53 status, the drugs used should also be taken into consideration. These concepts require further investigation.
27321955	Comprehensive Transcriptional Analysis of Early-Stage Urothelial Carcinoma.	Non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) is a heterogeneous disease with widely different outcomes. We performed a comprehensive transcriptional analysis of 460 early-stage urothelial carcinomas and showed that NMIBC can be subgrouped into three major classes with basal- and luminal-like characteristics and different clinical outcomes. Large differences in biological processes such as the cell cycle, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and differentiation were observed. Analysis of transcript variants revealed frequent mutations in genes encoding proteins involved in chromatin organization and cytoskeletal functions. Furthermore, mutations in well-known cancer driver genes (e.g., TP53 and ERBB2) were primarily found in high-risk tumors, together with APOBEC-related mutational signatures. The identification of subclasses in NMIBC may offer better prognostication and treatment selection based on subclass assignment.
27321059	Epidemiological evidence on environmental tobacco smoke and cancers other than lung or breast.	We reviewed 87 epidemiological studies relating environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) exposure to risk of cancer other than lung or breast in never smoking adults. This updates a 2002 review which also considered breast cancer. Meta-analysis showed no significant relationship with ETS for nasopharynx cancer, head and neck cancer, various digestive cancers (stomach, rectum, colorectal, liver, pancreas), or cancers of endometrium, ovary, bladder and brain. For some cancers (including oesophagus, colon, gall bladder and lymphoma) more limited data did not suggest a relationship. An increased cervix cancer risk (RR 1.58, 95%CI 1.29-1.93, n = 17 independent estimates), reducing to 1.29 (95%CI 1.01-1.65) after restriction to five estimates adjusting for HPV infection or sexual activity suggests a causal relationship, as do associations with nasosinus cancer observed in 2002 (no new studies since), and less so kidney cancer (RR 1.33, 95%CI 1.04-1.70, n = 6). A weaker association with total cancer (RR 1.13, 95%CI 1.03-1.35, n = 19) based on heterogeneous data is inconclusive. Inadequate confounder control, recall bias, publication bias, and occasional reports of implausibly large RRs in individual studies contribute to our conclusion that the epidemiological evidence does not convincingly demonstrate that ETS exposure causes any of the cancers studied.
27321030	PET Imaging Toward Individualized Management of Urologic and Gynecologic Malignancies.	Advances in the understanding of cellular and molecular basis of tumor progression have spurred interest in the development of new targeted agents that are changing the therapeutic management of patients with cancer. In parallel to progression in the therapeutic area, new PET radiopharmaceuticals are being developed to guide the use of such targeted therapies. This article aims to give an overview on the role of PET imaging in the individualized management of patients affected by urologic and gynecologic malignancies, focusing on the most promising targets for therapies and for molecular imaging using PET.
27320827	Preliminary study of diffusion-weighted MRI in the preoperative diagnosis of cystitis glandularis.	AIM: To assess the efficacy of diffusion-weighted (DWI) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in distinguishing cystitis glandularis (CG) from bladder urothelial carcinoma. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ultrasound, computed tomography (CT), conventional MRI, and DWI of 30 patients with histopathologically confirmed CG were analysed retrospectively and the imaging findings were correlated to the findings at histology. RESULTS: Ultrasound was non diagnostic in 11/18 and misdiagnosed malignancy in 7/18; CT was non diagnostic in 6/10 and misdiagnosed malignancy in 4/10; MRI was non diagnostic in 0 and misdiagnosed malignancy in 4/5 respectively. One patient with diffuse bladder wall thickening was correctly diagnosed as CG at MRI. All six patients who underwent additional DWI were accurately diagnosed as having CG with no or minimal reduction of diffusion. CONCLUSIONS: Diffusion is not reduced or shows minimal reduction in CG. DWI may aid the differential diagnosis of CG.
27320118	[Primary Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Prostate in which Docetaxel Therapy was Effective : A Case Report].	The patient was a 73-year-old man who visited our hospital with asymptomatic gross hematuria. Cystoscopy revealed a bladder tumor in two places. Serum prostatic specific antigen was normal (2.535 ng/ml). Transurethral resection of bladder tumors was performed. In order to complete resection of bladder tumor, transurethral resection of right lobe of the prostate whitch had protruded into the bladder, was needed. Histology of the prostatic tissue revealed squamous cell carcinoma with no grandular and acinar structures. Serum SCC-antigen level was evaluated (6.2 ng/ml) after establishment of the diagnosis. Thoraco-abdominal computed tomography and 18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/ computed tomography ((18)F-FDG PET/CT) showed prostate cancer and multiple metastases in the lymph nodes, such as right external iliac, right common iliac, para-aortic and left supraclavicular region. The patient received external radiation therapy to the prostate and underwent systemic chemotherapy using docetaxel. After 2 courses of docetaxel therapy, multiple lymph nodes metastases were reduced and serum SCC-antigen level was normalized. Docetaxel therapy could not be continued because of a side effect of interstitial pneumonia.
27319973	iTRAQ-based quantitative proteomic analysis reveals potential early diagnostic markers of clear-cell Renal cell carcinoma.	Early detection is the key to improve the prognosis of kidney cancer. This study profiled and identified differentially expressed serum proteins in stage T1a renal cell carcinoma (RCC) using isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ)-based mass spectrometry. A total amount of 99 serum samples including 29 patients with ccRCC, 24 patients with a benign kidney mass, 28 patients with another type of urological tumor (20 cases of transitional cell carcinoma and 8 cases of prostate cancer or a male genital tumor), and 18 healthy controls were subjected to iTRAQ-based mass spectrometry. ProteinPilot software was used to identify the differentially expressed serum proteins in RCC compared to the other three populations. Hierarchical clustering analysis according to The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) RCC database was then performed as the cross-platform validation. Immunohistochemistry was performed to verify the expression of selected proteins in tissue samples from these subjects. iTRAQ identified 27 differentially expressed serum proteins in the RCC patients, and 11 of these proteins were cross validated in RCC tissues from the TCGA database. The expression of C1QC, C1QB, S100A8, S100A9, ceruplasmin, and lumican was verified and associated with the tumor stage and/or grade. There were 27 differentially expressed proteins in early-stage RCC identified by iTRAQ; among them, the expression of C1QC, C1QB, S100A8, S100A9, ceruplasmin, and lumican were associated with the tumor stage and/or grade. Further studies are needed to confirm these data for their use as biomarkers for the early detection of RCC.
27318895	The Paris System for Reporting Urinary Cytology: The Quest to Develop a Standardized Terminology.	The main purpose of urine cytology is to detect high-grade urothelial carcinoma (HGUC). With this principle in mind, The Paris System (TPS) Working Group, composed of cytopathologists, surgical pathologists, and urologists, has proposed and published a standardized reporting system that includes specific diagnostic categories and cytomorphologic criteria for the reliable diagnosis of HGUC. This paper outlines the essential elements of TPS and the process that led to the formation and rationale of the reporting system. The Paris System Working Group, organized at the 2013 International Congress of Cytology, conceived a standardized platform on which to base cytologic interpretation of urine samples. The widespread dissemination of this approach to cytologic examination and reporting of urologic samples and the scheme's universal acceptance by pathologists and urologists is critical for its success. For urologists, understanding the diagnostic criteria, their clinical implications, and the limitations of TPS is essential if they are to utilize urine cytology and noninvasive ancillary tests in a thoughtful and practical manner. This is the first international/inclusive attempt at standardizing urinary cytology. The success of TPS will depend on the pathology and urology communities working collectively to improve this seminal paradigm shift, and optimize the impact on patient care.
27318857	Malignancies in Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Single-Centre Experience.	BACKGROUND: Gastrointestinal and extraintestinal malignancies are long-term complications in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), likely as a result of chronic inflammation and the use of immunosuppressive medications used to control inflammation. Here, we assessed the frequency of malignancies in a large tertiary IBD centre at the University Hospital Zurich. METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of data from 1,026 patients from our IBD clinic treated between 2007 and 2014. RESULTS: Twenty two of the 1,026 patients developed 28 cases of malignancies, 14 patients were male and 8 patients female. The median latency between IBD diagnosis and first malignancy was 13 years (range 2-27 years). Most common malignancies were non-Hodgkin lymphoma, colorectal cancer (CRC), urothelial carcinoma, cholangiocellular carcinoma (CCC) and prostate cancer. The most common tumour type in Crohn's disease patients (13/22) was lymphoma (5 cases), in ulcerative colitis patients (9/22) CCC (2 cases) and CRC (2 cases). The observed incidence of lymphoma (32.5/100,000), bladder carcinoma (21.7/100,000) and CCC (10.8/100,000) was higher than expected and known from general population. All of the patients that developed a malignancy had received immunosuppressive therapy. Compared to a cohort of 927 IBD patients without malignancies there were no statistical differences regarding gender, antibodies targeting tumour necrosis factor and thiopurine use. CONCLUSION: Our data support the assumption that a long-standing disease course and immunosuppressive therapy increase the risk for developing malignancies in IBD patients.
27317460	Tumor budding, a novel prognostic indicator for predicting stage progression in T1 bladder cancers.	Tumor budding has been defined as an isolated single cancer cell or a cluster composed of fewer than five cancer cells scattered in the stroma. It is a strong predictor for lymph node metastasis in T1 colorectal cancer. We introduced this concept to T1 non-muscle invasive bladder cancer and evaluated whether tumor budding could have a prognostic impact on the clinical outcome. We identified 121 consecutive patients with newly diagnosed T1 bladder cancer between 1994 and 2014 at Keio University Hospital. All slides were re-reviewed by a dedicated uropathologist. Budding foci were counted under x200 magnification. When the number of budding foci was 10 or more, tumor budding was defined as positive. The relationship between tumor budding and clinical outcomes was assessed using a multivariate analysis. The median follow-up was 52 months. Tumor budding was positive in 21 patients (17.4%). Tumor budding was significantly associated with T1 substaging, tumor architecture and lymphovascular invasion. The 5-year progression-free survival rate in T1 bladder cancer patients with tumor budding was 53.8%, which was significantly lower than that in patients without tumor budding (88.4%, P = 0.001). A multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that tumor budding was independently associated with stage progression (P = 0.002, hazard ratio = 4.90). In a subgroup of patients treated with bacillus Calmette-Guerin instillation (n = 88), tumor budding was also independently associated with stage progression (P = 0.003, hazard ratio = 5.65). Tumor budding may be a novel indicator for predicting stage progression in T1 bladder cancer, and would likely be easily introduced in clinical practice.
27316642	Controversial roles played by toll like receptor 4 in urinary bladder cancer; A systematic review.	INTRODUCTION: Urinary bladder cancer (UBC) is a prevalent human cancer. The main mechanisms which lead to eradication or progression the disease has yet to be clarified. Toll like receptor (TLR) 4 is a membrane receptor which is expressed either on immune cells or tumor cells. This review article was aimed to clear the main mechanisms played by TLR4 and its related intracellular pathways on outcome of UBC. METHOD: PubMed, Scopus and Google scholar databases have been used for searching related research articles which have evaluated the roles played by TLR4 and its related intracellular pathways on outcome of UBC. RESULTS: Collected information from the related articles revealed that TLR4 either participates in induction of immune responses against UBC or development of the malignancy. There are limited investigations regarding the genetic variations of TLR4 in UBC. DISCUSSION: According to the results it seems that TLR4/ligands interaction outcome is dependent on several factors including TLR4 ligand doses, interaction of TLR4 with its ligands on immune cells or tumor cells, and other TLRs/ligand interaction simultaneously.
27316585	The potential effect of age on the natural behavior of bladder cancer: Does urothelial cell carcinoma progress differently in various age groups?	We aimed to evaluate the potential effect of age on the natural behavior of bladder cancer and to compare these findings between different age groups. The clinical and pathologic data of 239 patients treated at our institution between 1994 and 2014 were analyzed. The patients were classified into three groups according to age: </= 40 years (Group 1), 41-59 years (Group 2), and >/= 60 years (Group 3). The following data were collected: characteristics of the patients, initial pathological findings after transurethral resection, tumor stage and grade, tumor size and multiplicity, and disease recurrence and progression. The mean age of the patients at initial diagnosis was 34.2+/-5.5 years, 53+/-5.1 years, and 71.1+/-7 years in Groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively. There were 207 (86.6%) patients with nonmuscle-invasive urothelial bladder cancer and 32 (13.4%) patients with muscle-invasive disease. Tumor recurrence was significantly lower in Group 1 than in Group 2 (p=0.001) and Group 3 (p=0.001). Although the time to tumor recurrence was significantly different between the three groups (p=0.001), no significant difference was noted in the time to progression (p=0.349). Patients with urothelial cancer younger than 40 years tend to have single and small tumors. The tumor recurrence rate is lower in the younger age group, but tumor progression is similar in older and younger patients. Therefore, the findings indicate that clinicians should be careful when assessing the invasiveness of urothelial tumors in younger patients and start treatment as soon as possible.
27315446	Beyond Prostate Adenocarcinoma: Expanding the Differential Diagnosis in Prostate Pathologic Conditions.	Recent advances in magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of the prostate gland have dramatically improved the ability to detect and stage adenocarcinoma of the prostate, one of the most frequently diagnosed cancers in men and one of the most frequently diagnosed pathologic conditions of the prostate gland. A wide variety of nonadenocarcinoma diseases can also be seen with MR imaging, ranging from benign to malignant diseases, as well as infectious and inflammatory manifestations. Many of these diseases have distinctive imaging features that allow differentiation from prostate acinar adenocarcinoma. Early recognition of these entities produces a more accurate differential diagnosis and may enable more expeditious clinical workup. Benign neoplasms of the prostate include plexiform neurofibroma and cystadenoma, both of which demonstrate distinctive imaging features. Stromal neoplasms of uncertain malignant potential are rare tumors of uncertain malignant potential that are often difficult to distinguish at imaging from more-malignant prostate sarcomas. Other malignant neoplasms of the prostate include urothelial carcinoma, primary prostatic carcinoid, carcinosarcoma, endometrioid or ductal adenocarcinoma, and mucinous adenocarcinoma. Prostatic infections can lead to abscesses of pyogenic, tuberculous, or fungal origins. Finally, miscellaneous idiopathic disorders of the prostate include amyloidosis, exophytic benign prostatic hyperplasia, and various congenital cysts. Considerable overlap can exist in the clinical history and imaging findings associated with these prostate pathologic conditions, and biopsy is often required for ultimate confirmation of the diagnosis. However, many diagnoses, including cystadenoma, mucinous adenocarcinoma, sarcoma, and abscesses, have distinct imaging features, which can enable the informed radiologist to identify the diagnosis and recommend appropriate clinical workup and management.

27312035	Laparoscopic treatment of early-stage endometrial cancer with and without uterine manipulator: Our experience and review of literature.	OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to retrospectively compare in a series of 110 patients with early-stage endometrial cancer recurrence rate and surgical outcomes after total laparoscopic (LPS) hysterectomy with lymphadenectomy performed with or without uterine manipulator. STUDY DESIGN: 110 patients with clinical stage I endometrial cancer were enrolled in a retrospective study and underwent surgical staging comprised of LPS hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, and in all cases we performed systematic bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy with uterine manipulator (Group 1, 55 patients) or without (Group 2, 55 patients). RESULTS: The rate of positive cytology and LVSI did not significantly differ between Group 1 and Group 2. 1 patient of the Group 1 had a bladder injury and another patient of Group 2 had an ureteral stricture temporarily treated with a stent. 1 patient of the Group 1 had a bowel occlusion due to a port site hernia under the left 10 mm port, resolved with a bowel resection and an end-to-end anastomosis. In 1 patient of the Group 1 and 2 patients of Group 2 we observed a vaginal cuff dehiscence and in 1 case of Group 2 a pelvic lymphocyst was reported. Postoperative fever was reported in 3 patients of the Group 1 and in 5 patients of group 2 (p = 0.07). CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirms that use of uterine manipulator for laparoscopic treatment of endometrial cancer does not increase positive peritoneal citology, LVSI and recurrence rate.
27312033	Report on demographics of gall bladder cancer in Delaware and retrospective review of treatment strategies for gallbladder cancer in a large community cancer center.	BACKGROUND: GBC is frequently found incidentally on pathologic review of the removed gallbladder. NCCN guidelines have treatment recommendations based on specific stage of gallbladder cancer (GBC). However, there is limited information on the experience of community cancer centers in treating GBC based on these guidelines. OBJECTIVE: To utilize the Delaware cancer registry to describe patients with GBC in Delaware, and to conduct a review of the treatment strategies and outcomes of GBC at a large community cancer center. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of GBC cases in the state of Delaware utilizing the statewide cancer registry to gather useful demographic and treatment information, such as patient age, gender, date of diagnosis, type of surgeries, systemic or radiation therapy, and survival time. Analysis of surgical management of GBC at Delaware's largest community cancer center comparing their management of patients with different AJCC stages of GBC to the NCCN guidelines. RESULTS: Our analysis revealed that there were 109 patients diagnosed with GBC in Delaware from 1995 to 2012. The male to female ratio was 2.7:1 and average age at time of diagnosis was 68. Most of GBC diagnosed were stage T2. During this time period, there were 23 extended radical cholecystectomies done for stage T2 and above GBC. Most of the ERC surgeries were performed by fellowship trained surgical oncologists. Our results show that there was mortality benefit in all operable stages of GBC, and the average survival time was higher for all T2 and above stages of GBC. CONCLUSION: A statewide cancer registry is instrumental in retrospective review of demographics and treatment outcomes for rare and aggressive tumors such as GBC. We demonstrated that a large community cancer center, such as Christiana Care Health System, with on staff surgical oncologists is capable of providing GBC treatment that is according to NCCN guidelines and comparable to major academic centers based on mortality outcomes.
27309405	When a good call leads to a bad connection: colovesical fistula in colorectal cancer treated with bevacizumab.	INTRODUCTION: Colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer in the United States. The use of bevacizumab (Avastin), a vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitor, has been increasing due to observed improvement in metastatic colon cancer survival, but so has the incidence of bowel perforation. We present one unusual complication of bowel perforation, a colovesical fistula in a colorectal cancer patient treated with bevacizumab. CASE PRESENTATION: A 54-year-old white male diagnosed with Stage IV colorectal cancer was treated with folinic acid, leucovorin, fluorouracil, oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) and bevacizumab. Two months later, he developed pneumaturia and fecaluria. CT showed a rectosigmoid colovesical fistula. A laparoscopic diverting colostomy was created to overcome the proximal retention of feces and the fecaluria. DISCUSSION: Colovesical fistulas more commonly result from diverticulitis, cancer, or Crohn's, but rarely can arise from radiation or chemotherapy. Our patient had two risk factors, colorectal carcinoma and bevacizumab use. Although colon cancer itself can cause a colovesical fistula, at the time of diagnosis, our patient had an intact fat pad between the colon and bladder on CT and did not have symptoms consistent with a fistula, suggesting that bevacizumab was the culprit. The exact mechanism of action leading to bowel perforation is not completely understood. Three theories include first, the idea that bevacizumab increases the risk of thrombosis, second, that tumor destruction creates an area of weakness more prone to perforation, or third, it slows down wound healing, causing leakage at the anastomotic site following surgery. CONCLUSION: Hospitalists encounter patients with colorectal cancer on a regular basis, so clinicians must be aware of the uncommon but potentially serious side effect of bowel perforation when bevacizumab is used. This case has illustrated an even more rare complication, the formation of a colovesical fistula that was treated with laparoscopic surgical intervention with a diverting colostomy.
27307433	Recurrent verrucous carcinoma of the urinary bladder after transurethral resection followed by intravesical mitomycin, and a review of the literature.	Verrucous carcinoma (VC) is a locally invasive, non-metastasising well differentiated variant of squamous cell carcinoma. It is very rare in the urinary bladder and mostly associated with schistosomiasis. It has a characteristic multilobular appearance with small surface projections on contrast cystogram. Owing to its bland cytology, it is a challenging diagnosis. We report a case of VC of the bladder-unrelated to schistosomiasis and involving the prostate-that recurred after transurethral resection of the tumour and prostate followed by six doses of intravesical mitomycin. To the best of our knowledge, no such case has been reported from Pakistan.
27306712	New Agents for the Treatment of Advanced Bladder Cancer.	Despite recent advances in the management of a wide variety of solid tumors, the outcomes for patients with metastatic urothelial carcinoma (MUC) remain extremely poor. Cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy remains the standard of care for first-line systemic treatment of MUC, and for more than 20 years there have been no other US Food and Drug Administration-approved treatment options available for these patients. Finally there appears to be hope on the horizon, with an ever-increasing number of precisely targeted agents being developed for use in MUC, resulting in improved survival rates. These targeted agents have now entered the cancer treatment arena, a direct result of a greater understanding of the genetic background of MUC. In this review article, we summarize the current state of development of these targeted agents, used either alone or in combination with traditional chemotherapy in MUC. Our discussion focuses on the most promising novel agents, including therapies targeting receptors for fibroblast growth factor and endothelial growth factor; antiangiogenesis agents (bevacizumab); tyrosine kinase inhibitors (cabozantinib); and immune checkpoint inhibitors that target proteins in the immune checkpoint-regulation pathway (anti-programmed death 1 and anti-programmed death ligand 1).
27306417	Systemic therapy in muscle-invasive and metastatic bladder cancer: current trends and future promises.	Bladder urothelial cancers remain an important urologic cancer with limited treatment options in the locally advanced and metastatic setting. While neoadjuvant chemotherapy for locally advanced muscle-invasive cancers has shown overall survival benefit, clinical uptake in practice have lagged behind. Controversies surrounding adjuvant chemotherapy use are also ongoing. Systemic therapies for metastatic bladder cancer have largely used platinum-based therapies without effective standard second-line therapy options for those who fail, although vinflunine is approved in Europe as a second-line therapy based on a Phase III trial, and most recently, atezolizumab, a checkpoint inhibitor, was approved by the US FDA. Given increasing recognition of mutational signatures expressed in urothelial carcinomas, several promising agents with use of VEGF-targeted therapies, HER2-directed agents and immunotherapies with PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies in various settings are discussed herein.
27305940	CD138 Expression Is Observed in the Urothelial Epithelium and in Various Urothelial Carcinomas, and Cannot Be Evidence for Plasmacytoid Urothelial Carcinoma.	CD138 (syndecan-1) immunoexpression has been reported to be specific for the plasmacytoid variant of urothelial carcinomas (UCs). The aim of this study was to examine the utility of CD138 immunohistochemistry for diagnosing the plasmacytoid variant of UCs. The extent and intensity of CD138 immunostaining were evaluated in 22 infiltrating UCs, 2 other infiltrating carcinomas, 15 noninvasive urothelial lesions, 3 other benign lesions, and perilesional normal tissues. CD138 immunostaining of the normal urothelial epithelium was universally diffuse and strong. In addition, all 42 cases of urinary tract lesions exhibited positive CD138 immunostaining; however, 1 of 3 plasmacytoid variants exhibited focal CD138 expression. The frequency of CD138 positivity in plasmacytoid variants may be relatively low, compared with that observed in the conventional types and other variants; thus, it is not appropriate to assume that CD138 expression in UCs is specific for plasmacytoid variants.
27305883	T2 Gallbladder Cancer-Aggressive Therapy Is Warranted.	Treatment of gall bladder cancer (GBC) has traditionally been viewed with pessimism and lymph node positivity has been associated with worse prognosis. The aim of this study is to analyze the role of radical cholecystectomy in T2 tumors. All patients who underwent surgery for GBC between September 2005 and June 2014 were identified retrospectively. Data collected included clinical presentation, operative findings, and histopathological data. Twenty-five patients had incidental GBC diagnosis after cholecystectomy. Ten patients were T2 on initial cholecystectomy pathology and all underwent radical resection. Two patients were N1 on initial cholecystectomy pathology. Four were upstaged to N1 and two patients were upstaged to T3 after further surgery. Overall, 60 per cent patients with T2 disease had node positivity and 60 per cent were upstaged by further surgery. Eleven patients were diagnosed on imaging. Four of these patients were unresectable and six were either stage T3 or higher or node positive. Sixty per cent of T2 GBC was node positive and 60 per cent were upstaged with radical cholecystectomy. This finding supports the call for radical resection in patients with incidental diagnosis of T2 tumor on cholecystectomy. This study also emphasizes the role of radical surgery in accurate T staging.
27300339	Impact of photodynamic diagnosis-assisted transurethral resection of bladder tumors on the prognostic outcome after radical cystectomy: results from PROMETRICS 2011.	PURPOSE: Results of a retrospective single-institution study recently suggested improved prognostic outcomes in patients undergoing photodynamic diagnosis (PDD)-assisted transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) prior to radical cystectomy (RC). We sought to validate the prognostic influence of PDD-assisted TURBT on survival after RC by relying on a multi-institutional dataset. METHODS: To provide a homogeneous study population, patients with organ metastasis at the time of RC and/or after neoadjuvant chemotherapy were excluded from analysis, which resulted in overall 549 bladder cancer (BC) patients from 18 centers of the Prospective Multicenter Radical Cystectomy Series 2011 (PROMETRICS 2011). To evaluate the influence of PDD conducted during primary or final TURBT on cancer-specific mortality (CSM) and overall mortality (OM) after RC, bootstrap-corrected multivariate Cox proportional-hazards regression models were applied (median follow-up: 25 months; IQR: 19-30). Sensitivity analyses were performed for both patients with pure urothelial carcinoma and patients undergoing one single TURBT only. RESULTS: In 88 (16.0 %) and 100 (18.2 %) patients, PDD was used in primary and final TURBTs, respectively. In 335 (61.0 %) patients, a single TURBT was performed prior to RC; in 194 patients (35.3 %), TURBT had been performed in a different center. CSM and OM rates at 3 years were 32 and 40 %, respectively. Use of PDD during primary or final TURBT was no independent predictor of CSM or OM. These results were internally valid and were confirmed in sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS: PDD utilization during TURBT prior to RC does not independently impact the prognosis of BC patients after RC.
27296150	The diagnostic accuracy of urine-based tests for bladder cancer varies greatly by patient.	BACKGROUND: Spectrum effects refer to the phenomenon that test performance varies across subgroups of a population. When spectrum effects occur during diagnostic testing for cancer, difficult patient misdiagnoses can occur. Our objective was to evaluate the effect of test indication, age, gender, race, and smoking status on the performance characteristics of two commonly used diagnostic tests for bladder cancer, urine cytology and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). METHODS: We assessed all subjects who underwent cystoscopy, cytology, and FISH at our institution from 2003 to 2012. The standard diagnostic test performance metrics were calculated using marginal models to account for clustered/repeated measures within subjects. We calculated test performance for the overall cohort by test indication as well as by key patient variables: age, gender, race, and smoking status. RESULTS: A total of 4023 cystoscopy-cytology pairs and 1696 FISH-cystoscopy pairs were included in the analysis. In both FISH and cytology, increasing age, male gender, and history of smoking were associated with increased sensitivity and decreased specificity. FISH performance was most impacted by age, with an increase in sensitivity from 17 % at age 40 to 49 % at age 80. The same was true of cytology, with an increase in sensitivity from 50 % at age 40 to 67 % at age 80. Sensitivity of FISH was higher for a previous diagnosis of bladder cancer (46 %) than for hematuria (26 %). Test indication had no impact on the performance of cytology and race had no significant impact on the performance of either test. CONCLUSIONS: The diagnostic performance of urine cytology and FISH vary significantly according to the patient demographic in which they were tested. Hence, the reporting of spectrum effects in diagnostic tests should become part of standard practice. Patient-related factors must contextualize the clinicians' interpretation of test results and their decision-making.
27293204	Sacral Neuromodulation for the Treatment of Retention in Partial Sacrectomy Patients.	INTRODUCTION: Sacral chordoma is a rare malignant tumor arising from remnants of the notochord. Due to its propensity for recurrence, the treatment of choice is surgical resection. Orthopedic and neurosurgical literature describe bladder dysfunction as prevalent in these patients, specifically urinary incontinence, however urologic literature is lacking in the exact nature of this dysfunction. Thus far, Sacral Nerve Stimulation (SNS) has not been described as a treatment option for these patients. PRESENTATION OF CASE: We describe a 36-year-old female who underwent midsacral resection (S3 and below) for a sacrococcygeal chordoma. She suffered from postoperative urinary incontinence and incomplete emptying requiring intermittent catheterization. Urodynamic evaluation showed detrusor hyporeflexia with nonobstructive urinary retention. She underwent InterStim(R) (Minneapolis, MN) placement resulting in return of spontaneous voiding and resolution of retention. DISCUSSION: SNS has been FDA approved for treatment of nonobstructive urinary retention since 1999. It has yet to be described as an effective treatment option in patients who have undergone sacral resection and suffer from prolonged postoperative nonobstructive urinary retention. Operative reports may not contain sufficient detail to confirm whether one or both S3 nerve roots are intact. Thus, it is mandatory to perform a bilateral nerve evaluation to verify integrity of the S3 nerve roots in this cohort of patients. This can present a technical challenge, as some of the usual landmarks are surgically absent. However, we have shown that the procedure is feasible and effective after partial sacral resection. CONCLUSION: We are the first to report the successful use of SNS to treat nonobstructive urinary retention after partial sacral resection. Additional patients and long term follow-up will be required to support consistent usage of neuromodulation in this patient population.
27291558	Comparing the short-term outcomes and complications of monopolar and bipolar transurethral resection of non-muscle invasive bladder cancers: a prospective, randomized, controlled study.	OBJECTIVES: To compare perioperative outcomes and complications of plasmakinetic bipolar and monopolar transurethral resection of bladder tumors (TURBT) in patients with non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). METHODS: Between March and December 2015, a total of 130 consecutive patients underwent TURBT for NMIBC. Patients were equally randomized into monopolar TURBT (M-TURBT) and bipolar TURBT (B-TURBT) groups. Primary outcome of this study was safety of the procedures including obturator jerk, bladder perforation, clot retention, febrile urinary tract infection and TUR syndrome. The secondary outcome was efficacy of both TURBT procedures, including complete tumor resection, sampling of the deep muscle tissue and sampling of the qualified tissues that without any thermal damage. RESULTS: Complete tumor resection rate was higher in B-TURBT than M-TURBT (89.2% vs 78.5%, respectively), but the difference was not significant (p=0.152). No significant differences were found between the muscle tissue sampling rates (64.6% vs 72.3%, p=0.345) and the numbers of patients with thermal tissue damage (7 patients vs 3 patients, p=0.194). Obturator jerk was detected in 21.5% of the patients in M-TURBT group and 4.6% of the patients in B-TURBT group, and this difference was statistically significant (p=0.013). Bladder perforation was significantly higher in M-TURBT group than B-TURBT (21.5 % vs 6.1%, p=0.039). CONCLUSIONS: Bipolar TURBT had significantly lower obturator jerk and bladder perforation than monopolar. B- TURBT is a reasonable treatment modality in patients with NMIBC.
27290965	A case of scrotal pain associated with genitofemoral nerve injury following cystectomy.	The genitofemoral neuropathy is one of the most common causes of groin pain after surgery. Especially, the groin pain induced by genitofemoral nerve injury during herniorrhaphy is a well-known complication. In contrast, much attention is not paid for groin pain induced by genitofemoral nerve injury after pelvic surgery, and there have been few reports in males, although it has been reported in females. We report a 59-year-old male patient who suffered from scrotal pain caused by presumed genitofemoral nerve injury during radical cystectomy and bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy for bladder cancer. The surgical procedure was performed in a supine position under general anesthesia, without epidural anesthesia. Postoperatively, he complained of burning and lancinating pain in bilateral scrotal area. Abnormal findings were not evident using computed tomography and ultrasonography of the pelvis, including the scrotum and testicles. He had severe allodynia of the ventral scrotum and bilateral ventromedial thigh region, with absence of cremasteric reflex. We speculated that his pain might have been surgery-induced genitofemoral neuropathy, which was caused by nerve injury during lymphadenectomy near the external iliac vessels. His scrotal pain and allodynia following the cystectomy were partially and gradually relieved after administering pregabalin, further supporting the contention that his scrotal pain was a surgery-induced neuropathy.
27277599	Is it possible to stop follow-up of patients with primary T1G3 urothelial carcinoma of the bladder managed with intravesical bacille Calmette-Guerin immunotherapy?	BACKGROUND: Recurrence and progression of T1 grade 3 (T1G3) urothelial bladder carcinomas (UBCs) treated with bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) are common events, but the long-term follow-up of the disease remains controversial. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the long-term outcomes of BCG intravesical therapy in relation to disease recurrence and progression in primary T1G3 UBCs and upper tract disease. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A single-institution, retrospective, population-based analysis of 316 patients with primary T1G3 UBC treated with transurethral resection (TUR) and BCG induction intravesical instillations was performed. Response was determined and monitored by routine periodic urine cytology, cystoscopy, and upper tract imaging. RESULTS: The median follow-up was 70 months (maximum 210 months). Among all of the tumours, 49.4 % did not relapse, 48.7 % recurred in the bladder during the first 5 years of surveillance, and only 6 patients (1.9 %) recurred after being free of disease during the first 5 years of follow-up. Nineteen percentage of the UBCs progressed to stage T2, and only 2 patients (1.2 %) progressed after the first 5 years of surveillance. An upper urinary tract recurrence was detected in 9.2 % of the patients; 65.5 % were diagnosed within the upper urinary tract during the first 5 years of follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Following a 5-year tumour-free period, there is minimal risk of recurrence and progression in T1G3 UBCs treated with TUR and BCG induction intravesical instillations. This finding supports a less intensive and potentially less invasive surveillance scheme of bladder follow-up and upper urinary tract imaging in patients without any recurrence.
27276850	Laparoscopic Radical Cystoprostatectomy, Surgical Technique and Result: A Case Report.	OBJECTIVE: Laparoscopic radical cystoprostatectomy is a complicated operation. The objective of this study is to present our technique and results of laparoscopic radical cystoprostatectomy. MATERIAL AND METHOD: A 72-year-old Thai male presented with gross hematuria. Cystoscope was performed. Large bladder tumor near right ureteric orifice was observed. Then, transurethral resection of bladder tumor was performed. His tumor pathology was muscle invasive high grade urothelial carcinoma with clinical staging T2N0M0. Laparoscopic radical cystoprostatectomy was then conducted with bilateral pelvic nodes dissection and ileal conduit. RESULTS: Operation period was eight hours. Blood loss was 500 ml. In pathological results, tumor invaded bladder muscle into perivesical tissue. Tumor margin was free. Lymph nodes were positive for malignancy 5/7 for right side and 0/4 for left side. Pathological staging was T3aN1M0. After post-operative period, the patient was discharged from hospital uneventfully. CONCLUSION: Laparoscopic radical cystoprostatectomy in Maha Chakri Sirindhorn Medical Center is minimal invasive, feasible and safe. However, a longer follow-up period regarding long-term cancer control as well as functional and technical aspects will be required.
27275890	Prostate cancer.	Essential facts Prostate cancer starts in the prostate gland, at the base of the bladder in men. It surrounds the first part of the urethra, which carries urine from the bladder. The prostate gland helps in the production of semen, which is also carried in the urethra. It is the most common cancer in men - one in eight will develop it during their lifetime.
27275821	Intravenous Administration Is an Effective and Safe Route for Cancer Gene Therapy Using the Bifidobacterium-Mediated Recombinant HSV-1 Thymidine Kinase and Ganciclovir.	The herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase/ganciclovir (HSV TK/GCV) system is one of the best studied cancer suicide gene therapy systems. Our previous study showed that caspase 3 expression was upregulated and bladder tumor growth was significantly reduced in rats treated with a combination of Bifidobacterium (BF) and HSV TK/GCV (BF-rTK/GCV). However, it was raised whether the BF-mediated recombinant thymidine kinase combined with ganciclovir (BF-rTK/GCV) was safe to administer via venous for cancer gene therapy. To answer this question, the antitumor effects of BF-rTK/GCV were mainly evaluated in a xenograft nude mouse model bearing MKN-45 gastric tumor cells. The immune response, including analysis of cytokine profiles, was analyzed to evaluate the safety of intramuscular and intravenous injection of BF-rTK in BALB/c mice. The results suggested that gastric tumor growth was significantly inhibited in vivo by BF-rTK/GCV. However, the BF-rTK/GCV had no effect on mouse body weight, indicating that the treatment was safe for the host. The results of cytokine profile analysis indicated that intravenous injection of a low dose of BF-rTK resulted in a weaker cytokine response than that obtained with intramuscular injection. Furthermore, immunohistochemical analysis showed that intravenous administration did not affect the expression of immune-associated TLR2 and TLR4. Finally, the BF-rTK/GCV inhibited vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression in mouse model, which is helpful for inhibiting of tumor angiogenesis. That meant intravenous administration of BF-rTK/GCV was an effective and safe way for cancer gene therapy.
27272502	HER2 overexpression is associated with worse outcomes in patients with upper tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC).	PURPOSE: The aim of our study was to evaluate the expression pattern of HER2 overexpression in patients with upper tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC) and to evaluate its association with clinical outcomes. METHODS: This multicenter retrospective study included 732 patients treated with radical nephroureterectomy for UTUC. HER2 expression was assessed using immunohistochemistry and scored according to the HercepTest: Scores of 0 or 1 were considered negative and 2 or 3 as positive. To qualify for 2 scoring, complete membrane staining of more than 10 % of tumor cells at a moderate intensity had to be observed. RESULTS: HER2 was overexpressed in 262 (35.8 %) patients. It was associated with pathologic characteristics such as more advanced T stage (p < 0.001), presence of lymph node metastasis (p = 0.006), high-grade tumor (p < 0.001), tumor necrosis (p = 0.01) and lymphovascular invasion (p = 0.02). Patients with HER2 overexpression had a 1.66-fold increased risk of experiencing disease recurrence (95 % CI 1.24-2.24, p = 0.001), 1.55-fold increased risk of death (95 % CI 1.21-1.99, p = 0.001) and 1.81-fold increased risk of cancer-specific death (95 % CI 1.33-2.48, p < 0.001). On multivariable analysis that adjusted for the effects of standard clinicopathologic variables, HER2 overexpression remained associated with disease recurrence (p = 0.04), overall (p = 0.02) and cancer-specific mortality (p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Approximately, one-third of UTUC patients overexpressed HER2. HER2 overexpression was associated with features of clinically and biologically aggressive disease as well as prognosis. HER2 may represent a good marker for therapeutic risk stratification and potentially a target for therapy in some UTUC tumors.
27272203	Impact of body mass index on the oncological outcomes of patients treated with radical cystectomy for muscle-invasive bladder cancer.	PURPOSE: Body mass index (BMI) has been associated with worse outcomes in several solid malignancies. We aimed to evaluate the association between BMI and oncological outcomes in patients treated with radical cystectomy (RC) for muscle-invasive urothelial carcinoma of the bladder (UCB). METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 701 consecutive patients treated with RC and pelvic lymphadenectomy for UCB at our institution between 1995 and 2011. Univariable and multivariable Cox regression models investigated the association of BMI with disease recurrence and cancer-specific mortality. BMI was analyzed as both continuous and categorical variable (<25 vs. 25-29 vs. >/=30 kg/m2). RESULTS: From the 701 patients, 275 (39.2 %) had a BMI < 25 kg/m2, 280 (39.9 %) had a BMI between 25 and 29.9 kg/m2, and 146 (20.9 %) had a BMI 30 kg/m2. Within a median follow-up of 45 months (IQR 23-75), 163 patients (23.3 %) experienced a disease recurrence and 127 (18.1 %) died from the disease. In univariable analyses, BMI 30 kg/m2 was associated with a higher risk of disease recurrence and cancer-specific mortality (both p values <0.01). In multivariable analyses that adjusted for the effects of standard clinicopathological features, BMI 30 kg/m2 was associated with both higher risks of disease recurrence (HR 1.58; 95 % CI 1.06-2.34, p = 0.02) and cancer-specific mortality (HR 1.58; 95 % CI 1.01-2.48; p = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Obesity was independently associated with higher risks of disease recurrence and cancer-specific mortality in patients treated with RC for muscle-invasive UCB. BMI is a modifiable feature that may have significant individual and public health implications in patients with muscle-invasive UCB.
27272173	Clinical practice patterns for upper tract urothelial carcinoma: a nationwide survey in Japan.	OBJECTIVE: A comprehensive survey has not yet been conducted to investigate care patterns by urologists for the management of upper tract urothelial carcinoma. METHODS: We conducted a nationwide survey for urologists treating upper tract urothelial carcinoma patients. The questionnaire was approved by the Japanese Urological Association and sent by mail in February 2014 to 1119 institutes in Japan. We identified 627 responders for this study. RESULTS: Our survey demonstrated that (i) the mean number of radical nephroureterectomy cases per institution in 2013 was 7.6, (ii) the main detecting tool for upper tract urothelial carcinoma is contrast-enhanced computed tomography, (iii) the need for ureteroscopic evaluations is highly dependent on voiding urine cytology results, (iv) 67% of urologists always or often perform radical nephroureterectomy by laparoscopic surgery, (v) more than half of the urologists do not aggressively perform lymph node dissection, (vi) 75% of the urologists perform bladder cuff incision through an extravesical approach, (vii) urologists perform kidney-sparing surgery following various indications, (viii) 59% of the urologists always perform adjuvant systemic chemotherapy for high-risk upper tract urothelial carcinoma patients, (ix) the combination of gemcitabine and cisplatin is the most frequent chemo-regimen for metastatic upper tract urothelial carcinoma, and gemcitabine and cisplatin with dose reductions is also the first choice even in patients with impaired renal function and (x) 10.5% of urologists always or sometimes perform single intravesical chemotherapy immediately after radical nephroureterectomy. CONCLUSIONS: The management strategy for upper tract urothelial carcinoma has changed with the introduction of new devices and development of instruments. The lack of clear evidence for relatively uncommon upper tract urothelial carcinoma affects the consistency of its treatment strategies.
27272172	Clinical significance of a second-line chemotherapy regimen with paclitaxel, ifosfamide and nedaplatin for metastatic urothelial carcinoma after failure of cisplatin-based chemotherapy.	OBJECTIVE: Cisplatin-based chemotherapy has been commonly used as the first-line chemotherapy for metastatic urothelial carcinoma. However, after failure of the first-line cisplatin-based chemotherapy, there is no established standard second-line chemotherapy. Starting in 2006, paclitaxel, ifosfamide and nedaplatin chemotherapy has been performed as the second-line chemotherapy in our institution. Here, we report the treatment results of paclitaxel, ifosfamide and nedaplatin chemotherapy. METHODS: From 2006 to 2015, 33 patients with metastatic urothelial carcinoma were treated with paclitaxel, ifosfamide and nedaplatin chemotherapy after failure of first-line cisplatin-based chemotherapy in our institution. We retrospectively examined the treatment outcome and predictive factors for therapeutic effects of paclitaxel, ifosfamide and nedaplatin. The median age, treatment cycle and follow-up period were 62.5 years, 3 cycles and 10.4 months, respectively. RESULTS: The median overall survival and progression-free survival were 10.4 and 3.5 months, respectively. Complete and partial responses were found in 3 and 7 patients, respectively, with an overall response rate of 30%. All patients developed grade 3-4 neutropenia, but there was no treatment-related death. In multivariate analysis, the only prognostic factor for progression-free survival was 24-hour urinary creatinine clearance. CONCLUSIONS: A paclitaxel, ifosfamide and nedaplatin regimen as second-line chemotherapy for metastatic urothelial carcinoma was effective and tolerable. Moreover, paclitaxel, ifosfamide and nedaplatin chemotherapy may be more effective in patients with satisfactory renal function.
27270540	A Dosimetric Comparison between Conventional Fractionated and Hypofractionated Image-guided Radiation Therapies for Localized Prostate Cancer.	BACKGROUND: Image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT) is the preferred method for curative treatment of localized prostate cancer, which could improve disease outcome and reduce normal tissue toxicity reaction. IGRT using cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) in combination with volumetric-modulated arc therapy (VMAT) potentially allows smaller treatment margins and dose escalation to the prostate. The aim of this study was to compare the difference of dosimetric diffusion in conventional IGRT using 7-field, step-and-shoot intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and hypofractionated IGRT using VMAT for patients with localized prostate cancer. METHODS: We studied 24 patients who received 78 Gy in 39 daily fractions or 70 Gy in 28 daily fractions to their prostate with/without the seminal vesicles using IMRT (n = 12) or VMAT (n = 12) for prostate cancer between November 2013 and October 2015. Image guidance was performed using kilovoltage CBCT scans equipped on the linear accelerator. Offline planning was performed using the daily treatment images registered with simulation computed tomography (CT) images. A total of 212 IMRT plans in conventional cohort and 292 VMAT plans in hypofractionated cohort were enrolled in the study. Dose distributions were recalculated on CBCT images registered with the planning CT scanner. RESULTS: Compared with 7-field, step-and-shoot IMRT, VMAT plans resulted in improved planning target volume (PTV) D95% (7663.17 +/- 69.57 cGy vs. 7789.17 +/- 131.76 cGy, P < 0.001). VMAT reduced the rectal D25 (P < 0.001), D35 (P < 0.001), and D50 (P < 0.001), bladder V50 (P < 0.001), D25 (P = 0.002), D35 (P = 0.028), and D50 (P = 0.029). However, VMAT did not statistically significantly reduce the rectal V50, compared with 7-field, step-and-shoot IMRT (25.02 +/- 5.54% vs. 27.43 +/- 8.79%, P = 0.087). CONCLUSIONS: To deliver the hypofractionated radiotherapy in prostate cancer, VMAT significantly increased PTV D95% dose and decreased the dose of radiation delivered to adjacent normal tissues comparing to 7-field, step-and-shoot IMRT. Daily online image-guidance and better management of bladder and rectum could make a more precise treatment delivery.
27267922	Intestinal metaplasia of the bladder in 89 patients: a study with emphasis on long-term outcome.	BACKGROUND: Intestinal metaplasia of the bladder is an uncommon glandular proliferation. We examined a large series of intestinal metaplasia for the clinicopathological features and discuss the significance of this lesion. METHODS: All cases of intestinal metaplasia diagnosed in our institution between 1990 and 2014 were retrospectively reviewed. Patients with a history of urothelial carcinoma or concurrent adenocarcinoma were excluded. Patient characteristics, pathological features, and follow-up outcomes were obtained. RESULTS: We identified 89 patients with intestinal metaplasia during this period. Sixty seven were men and 22 were women. Mean age at diagnosis was 57 years (range 23-81). Common presenting complaints included haematuria (73 cases), mucosuria (13 cases), and irritative voiding symptoms (seven cases). The majority of intestinal metaplasias located on or near the trigone (67 cases). Eighty-two patients underwent transurethral resection of their lesions. Partial cystectomy was performed in the remaining seven patients. The mean follow-up of 78 patients was 105 months (range 6-255). One case of bladder adenocarcinoma was indentified 6 months later. The initial histologic findings had revealed intestinal metaplasia with severe dysplasia. Four patients presented recurrence during the follow-up, and this occurred 9, 13, 17 and 24 months after the surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Although intestinal metaplasia can be treated effectively by transurethral resection in most cases, its potential malignancy need to be taken into consideration after the evidence of recurrences and its association with bladder adenocarcinoma. Therefore, it is necessary to perform close surveillance following the surgery, particularly in patients with dysplastic changes.
27266688	[Clinical research of second resection on early stage primary bladder adenocarcinoma and literature review].	OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical and pathological characteristics, as well as the diagnosis and treatment of primary bladder adenocarcinoma in the early stage. METHODS: The clinical features, pathological results, diagnosis and treatment profiles of 7 cases of primary bladder adenocarcinoma admitted in Affiliated Hospital of Nantong University from January 2010 to July 2015 were analyzed ret rospectively. RESULTS: All seven cases were diagnosed pathologically as primary bladder adenocarinoma.Histological staging T1 was revealed in six cases, while T2 in one case after the first resection.After four weeks, all patients received the second resection while one patient underwent immediately radical cystectomy. Multimodality therapy such as radiotherapy or chemotherapy was performed for longer postoperative survival.only one man died while another patient had been healthy for 6 years till January 2016. CONCLUSION: Primary bladder adenocarcinoma is a highly malignant disease in bladder cancer.According to the results of the second resection, multimodality therapy for patients in early stage with no lymph node or other organs metastasis can improve the quality of life without affectiong their lives.
27265606	Imaging of Extranodal Genitourinary Lymphoma.	The genitourinary (GU) system is commonly affected by disseminated lymphoma. Rarely, lymphoma can originate from and remain localized to one of the GU organs and thus presents as primary extranodal disease. Up to 40% of lymphomas present as extranodal disease, with only 3% having the GU system as the primary site of involvement. This article describes and correlates the radiologic and pathologic features of extranodal lymphomatous disease affecting the GU system with specific focus on the kidneys, adrenal glands, testicles, and ovaries. Lymphoma of the uterine body and cervix, external female genitalia, urinary bladder, and prostate gland is briefly discussed.
27265581	[Rectal prolapse revealing a tumor: The role of abdominal ultrasound].	Rectal prolapse is rare in children and usually benign. However, there are various diseases that can be associated with it, such as cystic fibrosis or other causes of increased abdominal pressure. Here, we review the various underlying conditions that pediatricians or pediatric gastroenterologists should consider in the case of rectal prolapse. We report on three cases of children with a rectal prolapse and intra-abdominal tumors. Current recommendations and practice do not include a systematic check via abdominal imaging in cases of rectal prolapse. However, in some situations, imaging is indicated to detect a possible expansive process. Thus, in the presence of recurrent prolapse or of associated urinary or neurological signs, imaging is justified so as to allow for an early diagnosis and treatment of these neoplasms. Given its lack of radiation exposure and good sensitivity in children, ultrasound imaging is the first choice.
27265130	Loss of Cell Differentiation in HPV-Associated Bladder Cancer.	Medical histories of 101 urothelial bladder cancer patients were compared with the results of morphological analysis and biomolecular detection of human papilloma viruses (HPV) in the tumor specimens. DNA of HPV16 (the major type of virus responsible for appearance of cervical carcinoma) was detected in 38 specimens, while mRNA of E6 and E7 oncogenes and E7 oncoprotein of HPV16 were observed in 13 specimens. HPV-positive bladder cancer was characterized by higher degree of cell anaplasia than HPV-negative cancer; in the primary bladder tumor, HPV was detected more often than in recurrent bladder cancer. These data attest to involvement of HPV16 in the genesis of bladder cancer. No correlations of HPV status of bladder tumor with patient's sex, age, and invasion into the muscle layer were revealed.
27263536	Post Pelvic Radiotherapy Affectation of the Lower Urinary Tract Peripheral Innervation in Men.	INTRODUCTION: The periurethral electromyography (EMGs) alterations in men who underwent pelvic radiotherapy (RT), either isolated or combined with surgery, have not been frequently described in the literature. OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to compare the EMG's data in men undergoing RT versus the non-irradiated control group. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study included 61 consecutive males, who had undergone RT (27 of them had been operated) and 99 control consecutive patients who underwent a retrospective assessment. The EMGs were performed using a concentric electrode needle perineally, localizing the sphincter by visual and auditory signal (electromyograph MMS Solar Active). RESULTS: 14.8% denervation, 62.9% reinnervation, 14.9% denervation + reinnervation and 7.4% EMG normal. The age (p < 0.001) and neurogenic bladder data (p < 0.001) are risk factors. The smaller the prostate size (obtained by rectal examination) post-RT, the more the chance for an abnormal EMG (p < 0.001). The fact of having had received RT (p < 0.001) is the only risk factor. CONCLUSION: RT produces lesions over the pudendal nerve, showing denervation even in late periods. The surgery did not behave as a risk factor.
27262318	Urinary Bladder Paragangliomas: Analysis of Succinate Dehydrogenase and Outcome.	Paragangliomas of the urinary bladder can arise sporadically or as a part of hereditary syndromes including those with underlying mutations in the succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) genes, which serve as tumor suppressors. SDH deficiency can be screened for by absence of immunohistochemical detection of SDHB. In this study of 11 cases, clinical follow-up was available for 9/11 cases. The cases were reviewed and graded based on the grading system for adrenal pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas (GAPP) criteria. Immunohistochemistry was performed for Ki67 and SDHB. Proliferative index was calculated by quantification of Ki67-positive cells at hot spots. The medical record was accessed for documentation of germline SDH mutations. Urinary bladder paragangliomas had a female predilection (8/11 cases), and 5/11 cases exhibited metastatic behavior. Patients with metastatic disease tended to be younger (mean age 43 vs 49 years), have larger lesions (5.8 vs 1.5 cm), and presented with catecholamine excess (4/4 vs 2/6 patients with non-metastatic lesions). Patients with metastatic disease had a higher mean Ki67 proliferation rate (4.9 vs 1.3 %) and GAPP score (mean of 5.8 vs 3.8) (p = 0.01). IHC for SDHB expression revealed loss of expression in 2/6 cases of non-metastatic paragangliomas compared to 4/5 patients with metastatic paragangliomas. Interestingly, of these four patients, two had a documented mutation of SDHB, one patient had a SDHC mutation, and another patient had a history of familial disease without mutation analysis being performed. Our study, suggests that SDH loss was suggestive of metastatic behavior in addition to younger age at diagnosis, larger tumor size, and higher Ki67 proliferation rate and catecholamine type.
27260521	Radiation dosimetry of (68)Ga-PSMA-11 (HBED-CC) and preliminary evaluation of optimal imaging timing.	PURPOSE: The clinical introduction of (68)Ga-PSMA-11 ("HBED-CC") ligand targeting the prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) has been regarded as a significant step forward in the diagnosis of prostate cancer (PCa). In this study, we provide human dosimetry and data on optimal timing of PET imaging after injection. METHODS: Four patients with recurrent PCa were referred for (68)Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT. Whole-body PET/CTlow-dose scans were conducted at 5 min, and 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 h after injection of 152-198 MBq (68)Ga-PSMA-11. Organs of moderate to high uptake were used as source organs; their total activity was determined at all measured time points. Time-activity curves were created for each source organ as well as for the remainder. The radiation exposure of a (68)Ga-PSMA-11 PET was identified using the OLINDA-EXM software. In addition, tracer uptake was measured in 16 sites of metastases. RESULTS: The highest tracer uptake was observed in the kidneys, liver, upper large intestine, and the urinary bladder. Mean organ doses were: kidneys 0.262 +/- 0.098 mGy/MBq, liver 0.031 +/- 0.004 mGy/MBq, upper large intestine 0.054 +/- 0.041 mGy/MBq, urinary bladder 0.13 +/- 0.059 mGy/MBq. The calculated mean effective dose was 0.023 +/- 0.004 mSv/MBq (=0.085 +/- 0.015 rem/mCi). Most tumor lesions (n = 16) were visible at 3 h p.i., while at all other time points many were not qualitatively present (10/16 visible at 1 h p.i.). CONCLUSIONS: The mean effective dose of a (68)Ga-PSMA-11 PET is 0.023 mSv/MBq. A 3-h delay after injection was optimal timing for (68)Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT in this patient cohort.
27259667	Fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 and cytokeratin 20 expressions and their relation to prognostic variables in bladder cancer.	BACKGROUND: Tumor grade and stage are currently the most important prognostic variables in bladder cancer but establishing additional criteria is still needed for effective treatment. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to assess the expression of fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) and cytokeratin 20 (CK20) in cancer bladder (CB) and to evaluate their association with the clinicopathological features of the disease. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study included 80 patients diagnosed as bladder cancer of different stages and grades and 80 patients with nonmalignant urothelial diseases of matched age and sex to the malignant group. The expressions of FGFR1 and CK20 in tissue samples were determined by RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: The expression levels of FGFR1 and CK20 were increased in the malignant group when compared to the control group (P<0.001 for each). Analysis of their expression showed that levels of FGFR1 and CK20 were significantly higher in invasive tumor stages (pT2-pT4) than in non-invasive stages (pTis, pTa, pT1) (P<0.001). Interestingly, the sensitivity and specificity of combined detection with CK20 and FGFR1 for the differentiation between invasive and non-invasive stages of bladder cancer reached 97.5% and 92.5%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Our results determined overexpression of both FGFR1 and CK20 in CB specimens. The alterations in the expression of FGFR1 and CK20 were associated with disease stage and grade. Lastly, combined detection of FGFR1 and CK20 had a high predictive prognostic value in differentiating invasive from non-invasive carcinoma.
27256496	Amyopathic Dermatomyositis: A Concise Review of Clinical Manifestations and Associated Malignancies.	Amyopathic dermatomyositis is a rare, idiopathic, connective tissue disease that presents with dermatologic lesions of classic dermatomyositis but lacks the myopathy of this disease. Cutaneous manifestations may include Gottron's sign, heliotrope rash, and characteristic patterns of poikiloderma. There is a substantial risk for developing interstitial lung disease or malignancy in patients with amyopathic dermatomyositis. A literature review of amyopathic dermatomyositis was performed using the PubMed medical database. The key features of amyopathic dermatomyositis, including autoantibodies, clinical presentation and dermatologic manifestations, epidemiology, history, associated malignancies, management, and pathogenesis, are summarized in this review. Cancer (solid tumor) (73/79, 89 %) and hematologic malignancies (9/79, 11 %) were reported in 79 patients, with three patients having more than one malignancy. In addition, there were six patients with amyopathic dermatomyositis who had tumor of unknown primary, and eight patients with cancer-associated amyopathic dermatomyositis for whom no additional details were provided. From the group of 73 tumors for whom primary origin and sex were available, malignancy of the genitourinary organs (24/73, 33 %), aerorespiratory organs (15/73, 21 %), and breast (14/73, 19 %) were the most commonly observed solid organ tumors. Tumors of the genitourinary organs (15/48, 31 %) and breast (14/48, 29 %) were the most frequent neoplasms in women, accounting for 29 of 48 (60 %) cancers, with the most common sites being breast (14/48, 29 %), ovary (8/48, 17 %), and cervix or uterus (5/48, 10 %). In men, tumors of the aerorespiratory (9/25, 36 %) and genitourinary (9/25, 36 %) tracts were the most common neoplasms, accounting for 72 % (18/25) of cancers; the most common sites of primary malignancy were nasopharyngeal (6/25, 24 %), bladder (4/25, 16 %), and either colorectal, lung or prostate cancer (three cancers each, 12 %). In summary, the search for an undiagnosed associated malignancy in patients with amyopathic dermatomyositis should focus towards the organs most frequently affected. Similar to classic dermatomyositis, ovarian and nasopharyngeal cancers are also common in amyopathic dermatomyositis. However, in contrast to lung cancer, which is the most frequent malignancy associated with classic dermatomyositis, breast cancer was the most common type of malignancy reported in patients with amyopathic dermatomyosotis.
27256178	Low grade urothelial carcinoma mimicking basal cell hyperplasia and transitional metaplasia in needle prostate biopsy.	PURPOSE: The vast majority of urothelial carcinomas infiltrating the bladder are consistente with high-grade tumors that can be easily recognized as malignant in needle prostatic biopsies. In contrast, the histological changes of low-grade urothelial carcinomas in this kind of biopsy have not been studied. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We describe the clinicopathologic features of two patients with low-grade bladder carcinomas infiltrating the prostate. They reported dysuria and hematuria. Both had a slight elevation of the prostate specific antigen and induration of the prostatic lobes. Needle biopsies were performed. At endoscopy bladder tumors were found in both cases. RESULTS: Both biopsies showed nests of basophilic cells and cells with perinuclear clearing and slight atypia infiltrating acini and small prostatic ducts. The stroma exhibited extensive desmoplasia and chronic inflammation. The original diagnosis was basal cell hyperplasia and transitional metaplasia. The bladder tumors also showed low-grade urothelial carcinoma. In one case, the neoplasm infiltrated the lamina propria, and in another, the muscle layer. In both, a transurethral resection was performed for obstructive urinary symptoms. The neoplasms were positive for high molecular weight keratin (34BetaE12) and thrombomodulin. No metastases were found in either of the patients, and one of them has survived for five years. CONCLUSIONS: The diagnosis of low-grade urothelial carcinoma in prostate needle biopsies is difficult and may simulate benign prostate lesions including basal cell hyperplasia and urothelial metaplasia. It is crucial to recognize low-grade urothelial carcinoma in needle biopsies because only an early diagnosis and aggressive treatment can improve the prognosis for these patients.
27256177	Urothelial neoplasm of the bladder in childhood and adolescence: a rare disease.	PURPOSE: Bladder tumors are rare in children and adolescents. For this reason, the diagnosis is sometimes delayed in pediatric patients. We aimed to describe the diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up methods of bladder urothelial neoplasms in children and adolescents. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We carried out a retrospective multicenter study involving patients who were treated between 2008 and 2014. Eleven patients aged younger than 18 years were enrolled in the study. In all the patients, a bladder tumor was diagnosed using ultrasonography and was treated through transurethral resection of the bladder (TURBT). RESULTS: Nine of the 11 patients (82%) were admitted with gross hematuria. The average delay in diagnosis was 3 months (range, 0-16 months) until the ultrasonographic diagnosis was performed from the first episodes of macroscopic hematuria. A single exophytic tumor (1-4cm) was present in each patient. The pathology of all patients was reported as superficial urothelial neoplasm: two with papilloma, one with papillary urothelial neoplasm of low malignant potential (PUNLMP), four with low grade pTa, and four with low grade pT1. No recurrence was observed during regular cystoscopic and ultrasonographic follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Regardless of the presence of hematuria, bladder tumors in children are usually not considered because urothelial carcinoma in this population is extremely rare, which causes a delay in diagnosis. Fortunately, the disease has a good prognosis and recurrences are infrequent. Cystoscopy may be unnecessary in the follow-up of children with bladder tumors. We believe that ultrasonography is sufficient in follow-up.
27256176	Is [F-18]-fluorodeoxyglucose FDG-PET/CT better than ct alone for the preoperative lymph node staging of muscle invasive bladder cancer?	OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether the use of [F-18]-FDG-PET/CT can accurately predict pelvic lymph node metastasis in patients with muscle invasive TCC of the bladder undergoing radical cystectomy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifteen patients with muscle invasive bladder cancer had undergone FDG-PET/CT scan from the skull base to the mid-thighs after IV injection of 6.5MBq (Mega-Becquerel)/Kg of FDG. After intravenous hydration IV furosemide was given to overcome the difficulties posed by urinary excretion of 18F-FDG. PET/ CT data were analyzed as PET and CT images studied separately as well as fused PET/ CT images. The imaging findings were correlated with the histopathology of the nodes (gold standard). RESULTS: CT and FDG-PET had demonstrated positive lymph nodes in 9 & 8 patients respectively. Among the 15 patients 3 had documented metastasis on histopathology. Both CT and PET could detect the nodes in all these 3 patients (100% sensitivity). Nodes were histologically negative amongst 6&5 patients who had node involvement by CT and PET respectively. Therefore, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) & negative predictive value (NPV) for CT and PET/CT were 50%, 33.3%, 100% and 58.3%, 37.5%, 100% respectively. CONCLUSION: The theoretical advantage of this cutting edge technology for whole body imaging has not been translated into clinical practice as we found minimal advantage of combined FDG-PET/CT over CT alone for nodal staging of muscle invasive bladder cancer. This may be due to substantial overlap between standardized uptake values (SUVs) from active inflammatory processes with those of malignant lesion.
27256174	"Total reconstruction" of the urethrovesical anastomosis contributes to early urinary continence in laparoscopic radical prostatectomy.	PURPOSE: To demonstrate the effect of total reconstruction technique on postoperative urinary continence after laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (LRP). MATERIAL AND METHODS: LRP was performed using a standard urethrovesical anastomosis in 79 consecutive patients (Group-A) from June 2011 to October 2012, and a total reconstruction procedure in 82 consecutive patients (Group-B) from June 2012 to June 2013. The primary outcome measurement was urinary continence assessed at 1, 2, 4, 12, 24 and 52 weeks after catheter removal. Other data recorded were patient age, body mass index, International Prostate Symptoms Score, prostate volume, preoperative PSA, Gleason score, neurovascular bundle preservation, operation time, estimated blood loss, complications and pathology results. RESULTS: In Group-A, the continence rates at 1, 2, 4, 12, 24 and 52 weeks were 7.59%, 20.25%, 37.97%, 58.22%, 81.01% and 89.87% respectively. In Group-B, the continence rates were 13.41%, 32.92%, 65.85%, 81.71%, 90.24% and 95.12% respectively. Group-B had significantly higher continence rates at 4 and 12 weeks after surgery (P<0.001 and P=0.001). There were no significant differences between the groups with respect to patient's age, body mass index, prostate-specific antigen level, prostate volume, IPSS, estimated blood loss, number of nerve-sparing procedures and postoperative complications. CONCLUSIONS: Total reconstruction technique in the procedure of urethrovesical anastomosis during LRP improved early recovery of continence.
27255805	Neoadjuvant chemotherapy in urothelial bladder cancer: impact of regimen and variant histology.	AIM: We compared the efficacy of methotrexate/vinblastine/doxorubicin/cisplatin (MVAC) versus gemcitabine/cisplatin in urothelial cancer and neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) efficacy in variant histology (VH). MATERIALS & METHODS: Radical cystectomy patients were retrospectively compared with those who received NACT. Factors associated with survival, pathologic complete response (pCR) and downstaging (pDS) were evaluated in multivariable models. RESULTS: 9% of radical cystectomy patients (84/919) received NACT, with improved survival, pCR and pDS on both regimens. MVAC lead to higher pDS without an increase in pCR. On multivariable analysis, there was a nonsignificant increase in pDS with MVAC. NACT conferred similar responses in squamous and glandular differentiation VH. CONCLUSION: NACT was associated with improved survival, pCR and pDS. Furthermore, responses to NACT were not dependent on presence of VH.
27255731	Prognostic factors in children undergoing salvage surgery for bladder/prostate rhabdomyosarcoma.	BACKGROUND: Prognostic factors have been studied in patients with rhabdomyosarcoma in general, but little is known about prognostic factors in the subgroup of patients with bladder/prostate rhabdomyosarcoma (BP-RMS) requiring salvage surgery after failure of chemotherapy +/- radiotherapy to achieve local control. We reviewed the 28-year Italian experience with BP-RMS requiring salvage surgery after failure of nonsurgical management indicated by evidence of disease persistence after chemotherapy +/- radiotherapy. Our hypothesis was that the same variables identified as prognostic factors in the general population with RMS could have prognostic value in this subgroup. METHOD: Between 1986 and 2014, 108 patients with a histological diagnosis of BP-RMS were registered into three consecutive protocols. Patients undergoing salvage surgery after failure of chemotherapy +/- radiotherapy and follow-up >5 years were considered for study. Variables related to the patient, to treatment, and to the surgical specimen were compared using the log-rank test in patients who achieved and failed to achieve 5-year progression-free survival (5-yr PFS). Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated for significant variables. RESULTS: Of the 108 patients enrolled in the protocols, 33 (30.6%) underwent salvage surgery and 26 matched study criteria. Seventeen patients were disease-free after a median follow-up of 125 months (range 65.5-311.7 months), 5-yr PFS 65.4%. Nine events were registered after a median follow-up of 5.4 months (range 1.9-27.5 months). Among the variables assessed (Table), only an undifferentiated histology proved to be significantly associated with a poorer 5-yr PFS, whereas a tumor size above 5 cm in the removed specimen approached significance. The OR (95% CI) for failure of 5-yr PFS was 28 (2.4-326.8) and 8.3 (1.03-67.1), respectively. CONCLUSION: 5-yr PFS proved unrelated to excision margins of the surgical specimen, that is on whether there was evidence of microscopic residues left behind during surgery. These data suggest that the outcome is more influenced by the biological properties of the tumor. If small foci of differentiated cells are left behind, these probably do not compromise final prognosis. In our patients requiring salvage bladder-prostate surgery after failure of chemotherapy +/- radiotherapy, long-term progression-free survival seemed unrelated to patient/tumor characteristics at presentation and preoperative management. Regarding the characteristics of the removed specimen, instead, an undifferentiated tumor histology and a diameter of the removed tumor >5 cm negatively influenced prognosis, whereas the presence of positive excision margins did not.
27249762	Real-World Conundrums and Biases in the Use of White Cell Growth Factors.	We present the 2015 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) white cell growth factors, or colony-stimulating factor (CSF), guidelines, updated from 2006. One new indication has been added-dose-intense chemotherapy for bladder cancer-to accompany the existing use for dose-dense breast cancer chemotherapy. Colony-stimulating factors remain appropriate for any regimen where the risk of febrile neutropenia is about 20% per cycle and dose reduction is not appropriate. Based on new evidence from multiple trials, CSF use is no longer indicated in treatment of lymphoma unless there are special risk factors. The United States accounts for 78% of the sales of CSF. The panel approved the use of all biosimilars, but the cost savings will be small as the price is about 80% of the branded CSFs. More biosimilars at lower cost are awaited. Methods to reduce use without harm to patients, by requiring justification according to accepted guidelines, are ongoing.
27249728	Treatment of Muscle-Invasive Bladder Cancer in Older Patients.	Treatment of muscle-invasive bladder cancer in older patients is challenging. Definitive therapy of localized disease requires either surgery or radiation therapy, ideally combined with systemic chemotherapy. However, current population data suggest that less than half of patients older than age 70 are offered such treatments. We will review tools available to assess the fitness of older patients for surgery, alternatives, and tips for perioperative patient treatment.
27241143	[Mechanisms for effect of osthole on inhibiting the growth and invasion of bladder cancer cells].	OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of osthole on epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase (EGFR-TPK), matrix-metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2), aminopeptidase N (APN) in bladder cancer cell and the underlying mechanism. METHODS: The T24 cell lines were cultured. The inhibitory effects of osthole on EGFR-TPK, APN and MMP-2 were evaluated by spectrophotometric and MTT assay. The caspase-3 activity and the expression COX-2 and VEGF in T24 were examined. The activity of NF-kappaB was determined by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. RESULTS: The half inhibition concentrations (IC50) of osthole on EGFR-TPK, APN and MMP-2 were (45.33+/-3.98), (28.21+/-3.23) and (8.11+/-0.54) micromol/L, respectively. The growth inhibitory rates for T24 cells were increased in a dose-dependent manner (P<0.05). The caspase-3 activities were significantly increased in T24 cells in the osthole group compared with control group, while the expression of angiogenesis related-protein COX-2, VEGF, and NF-kappaB in T24 cells were decreased. CONCLUSION: Through the inhibitory effect on EGFR-TPK, APN and MMP-2, osthole can decrease COX-2, VEGF and NF-kappaB expression while increase the activity of caspase-3, eventually blocking the growth and invasion of bladder cancer cell.
27236093	Endovascular Repair of an Iliac Ureteroarterial Fistula with Late Stent Thrombosis and Migration into the Bladder.	BACKGROUND: Ureteroarterial fistulas are rare. We describe a case of ureteral-arterial fistulas (UAF) repaired with an endovascular stent graft and examine late complications associated with the procedure. CASE REPORT: A 37-year-old woman with a history of complicated locally invasive cervical cancer treated with chemoradiation presented initially with right leg rest pain and chronic intermittent gross hematuria. She was found to have an ureteroarterial fistula and underwent successful endovascular exclusion with a covered stent with resolution of her symptoms. She returned 1 year later with stent-graft thrombosis manifesting as lower extremity rest pain, requiring a femoral-femoral bypass. She then returned 6 months later with imaging evidence of extravascular migration of the stent graft into the bladder. Because of a poor prognosis of recurrent gynecologic cancer, extraction was not attempted, and she underwent complete urinary diversion. CONCLUSIONS: UAFs are a rare occurrence but may be treated successfully with endovascular stent grafting. Despite technical success, late complications such as stent thrombosis may occur even with anticoagulation. Extravascular stent migration may occur in the presence of a chronically dilated ureter.
27234767	Prognosis of Kidney Transplant Recipients With Pretransplantation Malignancy: A Nationwide Population-Based Cohort Study in Taiwan.	OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate the prognosis of kidney transplant recipients with pretransplantation malignancy and the incidence of recurrent malignancy in kidney transplant recipients using claims data from Taiwan's universal health insurance program. METHOD: A total of 4350 transplant recipients were retrospectively analyzed. The rates of pretransplantation or recurrent malignancy, which was defined by their inclusion in the catastrophic illness patient registry using the International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, were evaluated. Cox proportional hazard regression and Kaplan-Meier curves were used for the analyses. RESULTS: In total, there were 4350 kidney transplant recipients, 52.1% of patients were male, the mean age at transplantation was 45.8 years old, and the percentages of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hepatitis B viral infection, and hepatitis C viral infection were 14%, 63.2%, 4.2%, and 2.4%, respectively. There were 95 patients (2.2%) with pretransplantation malignancy. The top 3 pretransplantation malignancies, in decreasing order, were urinary tract, kidney, and breast cancers. After kidney transplantation, 10 recipients had recurrent cancer. The overall cancer recurrence rate was 10.5%. These 10 cancers included urothelial carcinoma (n = 5), renal cell carcinoma (n = 3), breast cancer (n = 1), and thyroid cancer (n = 1). Eleven recipients had a secondary cancer. Patients without pretransplantation and post-transplantation malignancy had the best survival. Patients with pretransplantation malignancy had a greater occurrence of cancers and increased mortality regardless of whether or not they had recurrence of cancer. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest the higher risk of cancer, recurrent or secondary, and mortality after kidney transplantation. Adequate waiting time before transplantation and preventive strategies are strongly suggested in kidney transplant recipients with cancer history.
27233050	The Paris System for Reporting Urinary Cytology: The Quest to Develop a Standardized Terminology.	The main purpose of urine cytology is to detect high-grade urothelial carcinoma. With this principle in mind, The Paris System (TPS) Working Group, composed of cytopathologists, surgical pathologists, and urologists, has proposed and published a standardized reporting system that includes specific diagnostic categories and cytomorphologic criteria for the reliable diagnosis of high-grade urothelial carcinoma. This paper outlines the essential elements of TPS and the process that led to the formation and rationale of the reporting system. TPS Working Group, organized at the 2013 International Congress of Cytology, conceived a standardized platform on which to base cytologic interpretation of urine samples. The widespread dissemination of this approach to cytologic examination and reporting of urologic samples and the scheme's universal acceptance by pathologists and urologists is critical for its success. For urologists, understanding the diagnostic criteria, their clinical implications, and limitations of TPS is essential if they are to utilize urine cytology and noninvasive ancillary tests in a thoughtful and practical manner. This is the first international/inclusive attempt at standardizing urinary cytology. The success of TPS will depend on the pathology and urology communities working collectively to improve this seminal paradigm shift, and optimize the impact on patient care.
27232347	Role of Tetrasomy for the Diagnosis of Urothelial Carcinoma Using UroVysion Fluorescent In Situ Hybridization.	CONTEXT: -UroVysion fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) is routinely used to detect urothelial carcinoma (UC). A positive threshold is defined as chromosome polysomy in 4 or more cells, which also includes tetrasomy, a natural product of cell division. OBJECTIVES: -To evaluate tetrasomy for UC detection and explore the relation to the surgical diagnosis or patient history. DESIGN: -The FISH was performed on 1532 urine samples from patients with cytology results and 4 or more years of follow-up. We created separate polysomy and tetrasomy categories and constructed receiver operating curves to determine appropriate thresholds using biopsy (n = 194) as the gold standard. Standard FISH and a novel assay integrating cytomorphology and FISH (Target-FISH) were compared. Matching tissue biopsies of urine samples with 10 or more tetrasomy cells were analyzed. RESULTS: -No significant threshold was found for tetrasomy cells. Exclusion of tetrasomy from the polysomy category changed the threshold from 8.5 to 4.5 cells, increased specificity (59.2% to 78.9%), but reduced sensitivity (78.9% to 65.9%). In Target-FISH, the same approach yielded a specificity of 93.7% and sensitivity of 65.2%. Similarly, specificity improved significantly for low- and high-grade UC, but sensitivity decreased for low-grade UC. No evidence of UC was observed in 95% (52 of 55) of the patients referred for screening who had 10 or more tetrasomy cells by FISH. Matching biopsies for urines containing 10 or more tetrasomy cells showed few or no tetrasomy cells. CONCLUSIONS: -Tetrasomy is a nonspecific finding frequently encountered in urine FISH and should be excluded from the polysomy classification. Target-FISH is an optimal approach, offering the ability to detect rare tetrasomy tumors.
27231966	Management of non-muscle invasive bladder cancer: A comprehensive analysis of guidelines from the United States, Europe and Asia.	Bladder cancer is the 8th most common cancer with 74,000 new cases in the United States in 2015. Non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) accounts for 75% of all bladder cancer cases. Transurethral resection and intravesical treatments remain the main treatment modality. Up to 31-78% of cases recur, hence the need for intensive treatment and surveillance protocols which makes bladder cancer one of the most expensive cancers to manage. The purpose of this review is to compare contemporary guidelines from Europe, (European Association of Urology), the United States (National Comprehensive Cancer Network), the United Kingdom (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence), Japan (Japanese Urological Association) and the International Consultation on Bladder Cancer (ICUD). We compare and contrast the different guidelines and the evidence on which their recommendations are based.
27229745	Cancer Treatment with Anti-PD-1/PD-L1 Agents: Is PD-L1 Expression a Biomarker for Patient Selection?	Strategies to help improve the efficacy of the immune system against cancer represent an important innovation, with recent attention having focused on anti-programmed death (PD)-1/PD-ligand 1 (L1) monoclonal antibodies. Clinical trials have shown objective clinical activity of these agents (e.g., nivolumab, pembrolizumab) in several malignancies, including melanoma, non-small-cell lung cancer, bladder cancer, squamous head and neck cancer, renal cell cancer, ovarian cancer, microsatellite-unstable colorectal cancer, and Hodgkin's lymphoma. Expression of PD-L1 in the tumor microenvironment appears to be crucial for therapeutic activity, and initial trials suggested positive PD-L1 tumor expression was associated with higher response rates. However, subsequent observations have questioned the prospect of using PD-L1 expression as a biomarker for selecting patients for therapy, especially since many patients considered PD-L1-negative experience a benefit from treatment. Importantly, there is not yet a definitive test for determination of PD-L1 and a cut-off reference for PD-L1-positive status has not been established. Immunohistochemistry with different antibodies and different thresholds has been used to define PD-L1 positivity (1-50 %), with no clear superiority of one threshold over another for identifying which patients respond. Moreover, the type of cells on which PD-L1 expression is most relevant is not yet clear, with immune infiltrate cells and tumor cells both being used. In conclusion, while PD-L1 expression is often a predictive factor for treatment response, it must be complemented by other biomarkers or histopathologic features, such as the composition and amount of inflammatory cells in the tumor microenvironment and their functional status. Multi-parameter quantitative or semi-quantitative algorithms may become useful and reliable tools to guide patient selection.
27222134	P21 and p27 Immunoexpression in Upper Urinary Tract Urothelial Carcinomas.	p21 and p27 are members of cyclin-dependent kinase family, which function as tumor suppressors and they are involved in development and progression of several malignancies. We investigated their expression in upper urinary tract urothelial carcinoma (UUTUC). Radical nephroureterectomy materials of 34 patients were assessed by immunohistochemistry to evaluate expression of p21 and p27 in UUTUC. Results were correlated with various clinicopathological variables as age, gender, tumor grade and stage, tumor architecture, multifocality, subsequent bladder carcinoma development and clinical outcome.p21 and p27 expression was observed in 52.9 % (n = 18) and 88.2 % (n = 30), respectively. A total of 21 tumors (61.7 %) showed either total loss of p21 expression (n = 16, 47 %) or lower expression (n = 5, 14.7 %). No correlation was found between p21 expression and clinicopathologic variables. Cases showing total loss or lower p27 expression (11.7 % and <25.6 %, respectively) (n = 19, 55.8 %) constituted 67.6 % (n = 23) of the cases totally. This loss or lower p27 expression correlated with a shorter overall survival in both univariate and multivariate analysis (p = 0.039 and p = 0.037, respectively). None of the noninvasive tumors (papillary and nodular tumors) showed loss of p27 (p = 0.016) while 33.3 % of invasive ones showed p27 loss. Noninvasive tumor architecture also correlated with subsequent bladder carcinoma development (p = 0.032) while invasive tumor architecture correlated with advanced stage (T3 and T4) (p = 0.003). p27 is widely expressed in UUTUC, while p21 expression is observed in half of the cases. Loss of p27 expression correlated with tumor architecture and overall survival in UUTUC. However, further research is needed to assess their role in UUTUC.
27222017	[Tumors of the lacrimal drainage system].	BACKGROUND: The prevalence of tumors affecting the lacrimal drainage system is low, thus generating a risk of late diagnosis and treatment in clinical routine. However, these tumors can be potentially life-threatening, which emphasizes the relevance of early diagnosis and treatment. OBJECTIVE: This review focuses on the symptoms, incidence, management, and prognosis of the different tumor entities affecting the lacrimal drainage system. METHODS: The study provides a PubMed-based literature review and presents own clinical results. RESULTS: Alongside detailed medical history taking and comprehensive clinical examination, precise inspection during external dacryocystography is important for diagnosis of tumors affecting the lacrimal drainage system. There is a wide spectrum of tumor entities located in the lacrimal drainage system. The tumors are classified into three groups: primary epithelial, primary nonepithelial, and inflammatory lesions. The most common primary epithelial tumors include papilloma, squamous cell carcinoma, and transitional cell carcinoma. The most common nonepithelial tumors include fibrous histiocytoma, malignant lymphoma, and malignant melanoma; while the most common inflammatory lesions comprise sarcoidosis, Wegener granulomatosis, and pyogenic granuloma. Treatment depends on the entity and stage of the tumor. In the case of malignancy, a multimodal and interdisciplinary approach is usually indicated. CONCLUSION: Differential diagnostic signs in favor of a malignancy include a long medical history, predisposing conditions in the patient's history, a mass above the medial canthal ligament, teleangiectasis above the mass, and serosanguinous secretion.
27221939	Randomized-Control Screening Trials to Lower Gall Bladder Cancer Mortality in High Risk Populations.	Gall bladder cancer is generally fatal. The high morbidity and mortality due to gall bladder cancer exerts a significant impact on efforts towards cancer control in high risk populations of the World and a rationale program for control of gall bladder cancer mortality has remained as an unmet need in these populations. Currently there are no effective strategies for controlling gall bladder cancer mortality. This mini review is to highlight the need and feasibility for secondary prevention of gall bladder cancer by screening in high risk populations. A way forward is to assess the role of secondary prevention of gall bladder cancers by conducting randomized- controlled screening trials in high risk populations.
27221908	Radiological Downstaging with Neoadjuvant Therapy in Unresectable Gall Bladder Cancer Cases.	BACKGROUND: Gall bladder cancer (GBC) usually presents as unresectable or metastatic disease. We conducted a feasibility study to evaluate the effect of neoadjuvant therapy (NAT) on radiologic downstaging and resectability in unresectable GBC cases. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with locally advanced disease were treated with chemoradiotherapy [CTRT] ( external radiotherapy (45Gy) along with weekly concurrent cisplatin 35mg/ m2 and 5-FU 500 mg) and those with positive paraaortic nodes were treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy [NACT (cisplatin 25mg/m2 and gemcitabine 1gm/m2 day 1 and 8, 3 weekly for 3 cycles). Radiological assessment was according to RECIST criteria by evaluating downstaging of liver involvement and lymphadenopathy into complete response (CR), partial response (PR), stable disease (SD) and progressive disease (PD). RESULTS: A total of 40 patients were evaluated from January 2012 to December 2014 (CTRT=25, NACT=15). Pretreatment CT scans revealed involvement of hilum (19), liver infiltration (38), duodenum involvement (n=22), colon involvement (n=11), N1 involvement (n=11), N2 disease (n=8), paraaortic LN (n=15), and no lymphadenopathy (n=6). After neoadjuvant therapy, liver involvement showed CR in 11(30%), PR in 4 (10.5%), SD in 15 (39.4%) and lymph node involvement showed CR in 17 (50%), PR in 6 (17.6%), SD in 4 (11.7 %). Six patients (CTRT=2, NACT=4) with 66.6 % and 83% downstaging of liver and lymphnodes respectively underwent extended cholecystectomy. There was 16.6 % and 83.3% rates of histopathological CR of liver and lymph nodes. All resections were R0. CONCLUSIONS: Neoadjuvant therapy in unresectable gall bladder cancer results in a 15% resectability rate. This approach has a strong potential in achieving R0 and node negative disease. Radiologic downstaging (CR+PR) of liver involvement is 40.5% and lymphadenopathy is 67.5%. Nodal regression could serve as a predictor of response to neoadjuvant therapy.
27221850	Immunohistochemical Differentiation between Urothelial Papillomas and Papillary Neoplasms of Low Malignant Potential of the Urinary Bladder.	BACKGROUND: Urothelial papilloma and non-invasive papillary carcinoma are common neoplasms of the urinary bladder. Distinguishing papillomas and papillary carcinomas, especially the low grade type, is often debatable on the basis of histological features alone. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We investigated immunohistochemical expression of cytokeratin 20 (CK20), p53, and Ki-67 in a group of 20 urothelial papilloma cases and 30 noninvasive papillary neoplasms of low malignant potential (PNLMP) of the urinary bladder. Whole tissue sections were examined. RESULTS: Among the 30 carcinoma cases, 12 (40%) showed strong reactivity for the whole panel, 16 (53%) reacted positively for two markers, and 2 (7%) reacted just to one of them. Ki-67 was considered positive in 27 cases (90%) and p53 in 24 (80%), CK20 showed positive reactivity in 21 cases (70%). Only small percentages of papillomas were positive, and then only weakly. CONCLUSIONS: We concluded that the intense positivity of suspicious cells for at least one of these markers would confirm the presence of malignant changes and favours the diagnosis of carcinoma.
27221848	Predictive Effect of Preoperative Anemia on Long-Term Survival Outcomes with Non-Muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer.	BACKGROUND: Anemia is the most common hematologic abnormality in bladder cancer (BC) patients. We evaluated the impact of preoperative anemia on oncologic outcomes in BC undergoing transurethral resection of a bladder tumor (TURBT) for the first time diagnosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated the data collected from 639 patients who underwent TURBT between January 2006 and September 2014 in our department. Of these patients, 320 qualified for inclusion in the study. The primary efficacy endpoint was the effect of preoperative anemia status on cancer-specific and overall survival. Independent t-test and chi-square analyses were performed to assess the effects of anemia on oncologic outcomes. Survival was estimated by using the Kaplan-Meier test. RESULTS: There were 118 (36.9%) and 202 (63.1%) patients in the anemia (Group-1) and non-anemia groups (Group-2), respectively. The median follow-up duration was 68 months. Anemia was associated with decreased overall survival (<0.001). Comparison between cancer-specific survival of two groups did not show any statistically significant difference (p=0.17). CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative anemia status of BC patients according to World Health Organization classification is associated with decreased overall survival, but not with cancer-specific survival. We think that preoperative hemoglobin levels should be considered in patient counseling and decision-making for additional therapy.
27221781	Licochalcone A induces T24 bladder cancer cell apoptosis by increasing intracellular calcium levels.	Licochalcone A (LCA) has been reported to significantly inhibit cell proliferation, increase reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, and induce apoptosis of T24 human bladder cancer cells via mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-triggered signaling pathways. Based on these findings, the present study aimed to investigate the mechanisms by which LCA induces apoptosis of T24 cells. Cultured T24 cells were treated with LCA, and cell viability was measured using the sulforhodamine B assay. Apoptosis was detected by flow cytometry with Annexin V/propidium iodide staining, and by fluorescent microscopy with Hoechst 33258 staining. The levels of intracellular free calcium ions were determined using Fluo-3 AM dye marker. Intracellular ROS levels were assessed using the 2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate probe assay. The mitochondrial membrane potential was measured using 5,5',6,6'-tetrachloro-1,1',3,3'-tetraethyl benzimidazole carbocyanine iodide. Furthermore, the mRNA expression levels of Bcell lymphoma (Bcl)extra large, Bcl2associated X protein, Bcl2interacting mediator of cell death, apoptotic protease activating factor1 (Apaf1), calpain 2, cysteinyl aspartate specific proteinase (caspase)3, caspase4 and caspase9 were determined using reverse transcription semiquantitative and quantitative polymerase chain reaction analyses. Treatment with LCA inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis of T24 cells, and increased intracellular Ca2+ levels and ROS production. Furthermore, LCA induced mitochondrial dysfunction, decreased mitochondrial membrane potential, and increased the mRNA expression levels of Apaf1, caspase9 and caspase3. Exposure of T24 cells to LCA also triggered calpain 2 and caspase4 activation, resulting in apoptosis. These findings indicated that LCA increased intracellular Ca2+ levels, which may be associated with mitochondrial dysfunction. In addition, the ER stress pathway may be considered an important mechanism by which LCA induces apoptosis of T24 bladder cancer cells.
27221750	A review of the Paris system for reporting urinary cytology.	After the 2013 International Congress of Cytology in Paris, consensus groups were formed to establish an international reporting system for urinary tract (UT) specimens. The recommended guidelines, known as The Paris System (TPS) for Reporting Urinary Cytology, focus on reducing the rate of unnecessary indeterminate diagnoses while maintaining the excellent performance UT cytology has for identifying high-grade urothelial carcinoma. This review highlights the major features of TPS.
27221614	A new non-muscle-invasive bladder tumor-homing peptide identified by phage display in vivo.	Bladder cancer is common and widespread, and its incidence is increasing. Many new diagnostic methods combined with state-of-the-art technology have been introduced in cystoscopy to collect real-time images of the bladder mucosa for diagnosis, but often miss inconspicuous early-stage tumors. Fluorophore-labeled peptides with high sensitivity and specificity for cancer would be a desirable tool for the detection and treatment of tiny or residual bladder tumors. Phage display and the human non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer cell line BIU-87 were used to identify a peptide. The isolated phage display peptide (CSSPIGRHC, named NYZL1) was tested in vitro for its binding specificity and affinity. Accumulation into xenograft tumors in a nude mouse model was analyzed with FITC-labeled NYZL1. NYZL1, with strong tumorhoming ability, was identified by in vivo phage library selection in the bladder cancer model. The NYZL1 phage and synthetic FITC-labeled NYZL1 peptides bound to tumor tissues and cells, but were hardly detected in normal control organs. Notably, accumulation of FITC-NYZL1 in bladder tumor cells was time-dependent. Biodistribution studies of xenografts of BIU-87 cells showed accumulation of injected FITC-NYZL1 in the tumors, and the bound peptide could not be removed by perfusion after 24 h. The mouse model of bladder tumor showed increased fluorescence intensity in the tumor-bearing bladder in comparison with normal bladder tissues after 4-6 h. In conclusion, NYZL1 may represent a lead peptide structure applicable in the development of optical molecular imaging.
27221312	SHARP hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy is well tolerated in prostate cancer : Toxicity and quality of life assessment.	BACKGROUND: Quality of life (QoL) is one of the most significant issues in prostate cancer treatment decisions. This study aimed to investigate the toxicity of hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (SBRT) and QoL after treatment in localized prostate cancer patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective single-center clinical study was performed in low- and intermediate-risk prostate cancer patients. Patients received 33.5 Gy in 5 fractions (SHARP regimen). Acute and late toxicity was assessed according to RTOG/EORTC score. Patients filled out EORTC QLQ-C30 and prostate cancer-specific QLQ-PR25 questionnaires. RESULTS: The analysis included 68 prostate cancer patients (55-83 years, median 73) with clinical stage T1c-T2cN0M0, median combined Gleason score of 6 (3-8), and median prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level of 10 ng/mL (4-20 ng/mL). Neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy was given to 52 patients (76.5 %), and stopped in 31 patients (45.5 %) after 6 months; in 21 patients (31 %) after 2-3 years. Average and median follow-up was 24 months (18-45). Median nadir PSA level was 0.03 ng/mL for all patients and 0.6 ng/mL for patients without hormone treatment. No patients had PSA failure. There were no acute grade IV toxicities. One patient (1.5 %) developed grade III and 24 patients (35.3 %) grade II acute bladder toxicity. No one developed grade III and 7 patients (10.3 %) grade II acute rectal toxicity. No grade III or IV late gastrointestinal or genitourinary toxicities were reported. Grade II late urinary symptoms were observed in 8 patients (11.8 %) and gastrointestinal symptoms in 3 patients (4.4 %). Global health status/QoL was good and improved during the observational period. CONCLUSION: SBRT for prostate cancer patients is a well-tolerated treatment in terms of toxicity and QoL, has no negative impact on functioning and everyday life, with the important benefit of a short treatment period. However, long-term follow-up data are needed.
27220040	Vaginal fine-needle aspiration: A useful alternative to biopsy.	BACKGROUND: Vaginal fine-needle aspiration (FNA) is infrequently performed to assess palpable lesions. We perform the first multi-institutional study to evaluate this procedure. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed vaginal FNAs performed at two institutions for the past 27 years. Clinical, cytological and histological data were reviewed and tabulated. RESULTS: We identified 43 specimens from 39 patients (mean age 56 years, range 18-86 years). Twenty four patients (62%) had prior malignancies from the following sites: gynecologic tract (22), bladder (1), and breast (1). Twenty four specimens were malignant, 18 were benign (including eight cases from patients with prior malignancy) and one was unsatisfactory. Of 28 FNA specimens from patients with a malignant history, 18 (64%) were positive for malignancy. The most common malignancies were metastatic ovarian carcinoma (50%), squamous cell carcinoma (25%), and uterine cancer (17%). Mean time to metastasis/recurrence was 16 months and was longest in patients with ovarian metastasis (26 months) compared to other malignancies (P = 0.002). The most common benign diagnoses were cysts (33%) and inflammation (22%). In 27 cases with histological correlation, there were 20 true positives, six true negatives and one false negative (sensitivity =95%, specificity =100%). Seven patients had a recent Pap test with two true positives, two true negatives, and three false negatives (sensitivity = 40%, specificity = 100%). CONCLUSION: Vaginal FNA is usually performed to rule out a secondary malignancy, often of ovarian origin. Vaginal metastases from extra-gynecologic sites are rare. FNA is both highly sensitive and specific and may be a safe and effective alternative to biopsy. Diagn. Cytopathol. 2016;44:665-669. (c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
27219686	Diabetes and Cancer: a Review of Current Knowledge.	Diabetes mellitus (DM), one of the most common life-threatening illnesses worldwide, is a group of metabolic diseases, characterized by sustained hyperglycemia. The global prevalence of diabetes mellitus among adults reached 387 millions in 2014 and is still rising. It is suggested there is a strong association between diabetes mellitus (especially type 2 diabetes mellitus) and carcinogenesis. The possible biological links between diabetes mellitus and cancer comprise hyperinsulinemia, hyperglycemia and fat-induced chronic inflammation. Although, the strongest association refers to pancreas and liver, there are many other organs involved in carcinogenesis in diabetic patients including breast, endometrium, bladder and kidney.Recent studies suggest that there is also association between cancer incidence and anti-diabetic medications. It was observed that some medications decrease the risk of carcinogenesis and some increase that risk. The majority of studies concern metformin, a drug of choice in type 2 diabetes mellitus, and its anti-neoplastic and tumor-suppressing activity. The positive effect of metformin was found in numerous researches investigating breast, pancreas, liver, colon, ovaries and prostate tumors.Because a variety of studies have suggested that diabetes mellitus and cancer are frequently coexisting diseases, recently published studies try to explain the influence of diabetes mellitus and anti-diabetic medications on carcinogenesis in different organs.We present the review of the latest studies investigating the association between both diabetes mellitus and anti-diabetic medications and cancer incidence and prognosis.Particularly we highlight the problem of concomitant head and neck cancers in diabetics, rarely analysed and often omitted in studies.
27218105	MicroRNA Profiling in Patients with Upper Tract Urothelial Carcinoma Associated with Balkan Endemic Nephropathy.	Balkan endemic nephropathy (BEN) is a disease that affects people that live in the alluvial plains along the tributaries of the Danube River in the Balkan region. BEN is a chronic tubulointerstitial disease with a slow progression to terminal renal failure and has strong association with upper tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC). There are several hypotheses about the etiology of BEN, but only the toxic effect of aristolochic acid has been confirmed as a risk factor in the occurrence of the disease. Aberrantly expressed miRNAs have been shown to be associated with many types of cancers. A number of studies have investigated the expression of microRNAs in urothelial carcinoma, mainly on urothelial bladder cancer, and only a few have included patients with UTUC. Here we present the first study of microRNA profiling in UTUC tissues from patients with BEN (BEN-UTUC) and patients with UTUC from nonendemic Balkan regions (non-BEN-UTUC) in comparison to normal kidney tissues. We found 10 miRNAs that were differentially expressed in patients with BEN-UTUC and 15 miRNAs in patients with non-BEN-UTUC. miRNA signature determined in BEN-UTUC patients differs from the non-BEN-UTUC patients; only miR-205-5p was mutual in both groups.
27217902	[Primitive benign retrovesical schwannoma: an extremely rare tumor, a case report].	Schwannoma is usually a benign tumor of nervous origin arising from Schwann sheath cells. It is an extremely rare tumour because of its low incidence and its retrovescical localization. Histological and immunohistochemical examinations confirm the histological type as well as the benign or malignant origin of schwannoma. Because of the risk of recurrence and malignant transformation, excision must be complete. We report the case of a 39 years old patient, hospitalized for chronic pelvic pain accompanied by a sensation of heaviness, lower urinary tract irritation and urinary hesitancy. Diagnostic imaging (ultrasound, CT scan, MRI) of the pelvis showed a left-lateralized retrovescical mass with a thin wall, measuring 68x70x70 mm exerting mass effect on the bladder and the sigmoid. The surgical procedure, a midline laparotomy, allowed the removal of a well encapsulated retrovesical mass. Histological and immunohistochemical examinations concluded to a benign schwannoma. Recidivism and malignant transformation, although rare after surgery, impose postoperative clinical monitoring and annual CT scanning.
27217015	[A Case of Inflammatory Myofibroblastic Tumor of Urinary Bladder].	A 61-year-old man presenting with voiding pain was diagnosed with a bladder tumor by ultrasound in another hospital, and was subsequently referred to our hospital. Cystoscopy showed a nodular tumor and surrounding edematous mucosa in the right wall of the bladder. Initially, we suspected bladder invasion of gastrointestinal malignancy, but abdominal computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and a series of tumor marker tests revealed no abonormalities. We performed transurethral resection of the bladder tumor under the clinical diagnosis of a submucosal tumor originating from the bladder wall. Histopathological examination revealed spindle cell proliferation, which was positively stained with anti-anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) antibody. Based on the findings, the diagnosis of an inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (IMT) was made. Therefore, we performed partial cystectomy to reduce the risk of local recurrence. The pathological diagnosis was IMT, and the surgical margins were negative. Bladder IMT is a rare disease, and surgical resection is the only recommended treatment. In the literature, if completely resected, the prognosis of patients with bladder IMT is excellent. Also, in the present case, no recurrence has been detected for over 6 months.
27213352	Predicting MicroRNA Biomarkers for Cancer Using Phylogenetic Tree and Microarray Analysis.	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are shown to be involved in the initiation and progression of cancers in the literature, and the expression of miRNAs is used as an important cancer prognostic tool. The aim of this study is to predict high-confidence miRNA biomarkers for cancer. We adopt a method that combines miRNA phylogenetic structure and miRNA microarray data analysis to discover high-confidence miRNA biomarkers for colon, prostate, pancreatic, lung, breast, bladder and kidney cancers. There are 53 miRNAs selected through this method that either have potential to involve a single cancer's development or to involve several cancers' development. These miRNAs can be used as high-confidence miRNA biomarkers of these seven investigated cancers for further experiment validation. miR-17, miR-20, miR-106a, miR-106b, miR-92, miR-25, miR-16, miR-195 and miR-143 are selected to involve a single cancer's development in these seven cancers. They have the potential to be useful miRNA biomarkers when the result can be confirmed by experiments.
27211249	Second-Line Palliative Chemotherapy in Advanced Gall Bladder Cancer, CAP-IRI: Safe and Effective Option.	INTRODUCTION: Gall bladder cancer (GBC) has high prevalence in the Indo-Gangetic belt in India. While the first-line chemotherapy (CT1) has been established as gemcitabine-platinum doublet in advanced GBC, there is no standard recommendation or guidelines regarding feasibility of second-line therapy. METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of all patients who received second-line of chemotherapy (CT2) at our institution from July 2012 to December 2014. Patient records were examined for efficacy and toxicity of administered CT2, along with response rates (RR) and survival. Potential prognostic factors were also evaluated. RESULTS: Eighty-seven patients received CT2 in the predefined period. Ninety-nine percent of patients had received a gemcitabine-based regimen as CT1 with a median progression-free survival (PFS) of 5 months before CT2. 51.7 % patients had undergone surgery prior with 5.7 % patients having received radiotherapy previously. Prior to beginning CT2, PS was 0/1 in 67.8 % patients, albumin was >4 g% in 40.2 % and CA 19.9 was raised in a majority (66.7 %) patients, respectively. As per institution protocol, a majority of patients (89.6 %) were administered CAP-IRI regimen. Overall RR and disease control rates (DCR) were 21.8 % and 41.3 %, respectively. Median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 6 and 8 months, with no significant differences between CAP-IRI and other regimens. Adverse effects were tolerable, with dose reduced upfront in 23 % patients and 11.5 % patients during subsequent cycles of CT. ECOG Performance Status (PS) of 0/1 was a significant prognostic variable for OS on multivariate analysis (p = 0.003). CONCLUSION: CAP-IRI is a well-tolerated second-line chemotherapeutic regimen in patients with advanced GBC. Careful selection of patients is required when administering second-line chemotherapy to advanced GBC patients, with particular emphasis on ECOG PS.
27210100	[A Case of Advanced Rectal Cancer Resected Successfully after Induction Chemotherapy with Modified FOLFOX6 plus Panitumumab].	We report a case of advanced colon cancer that was effectively treated with mFOLFOX6 plus panitumumab combination chemotherapy. The patient was a 54-year-old man who had type 2 colon cancer of the rectum. An abdominal CT scan demonstrated rectal cancer with bulky lymph node metastasis and 1 hepatic node (rectal cancer SI [bladder retroperitoneum], N2M0H1P0, cStage IV). He was treated with mFOLFOX6 plus panitumumab as neoadjuvant chemotherapy. After 4 courses of chemotherapy, CT revealed that the primary lesion and regional metastatic lymph nodes had reduced in size (rectal cancer A, N1H1P0M0, cStage IV). Anterior rectal resection with D3 nodal dissection and left lateral segmentectomy of the liver was performed. The histological diagnosis was tubular adenocarcinoma (tub2-1), int, INF a, pMP, ly0, v0, pDM0, pPM0, R0. He was treated with 4 courses of mFOLFOX6 after surgery. The patient has been in good health without a recurrence for 2 years and 5 months after surgery. This case suggests that induction chemotherapy with mFOLFOX6 plus panitumumab is a potentially effective regimen for advanced colon cancer.
27209646	Drug-induced liver injury caused by iodine-131.	Iodine-131 is a radioisotope that is routinely used for the treatment of differentiated thyroid cancer after total or near-total thyroidectomy. However, there is some evidence that iodine-131 can induce liver injury . Here we report a rare case of drug-induced liver injury (DILI) caused by iodine-131 in a patient with regional lymph node metastasis after total thyroidectomy. A 47-year-old woman was admitted with elevated liver enzymes and symptoms of general weakness and nausea. Ten weeks earlier she had undergone a total thyroidectomy for papillary thyroid carcinoma and had subsequently been prescribed levothyroxine to reduce the level of thyroid-stimulating hormone. Eight weeks after surgery she underwent iodine-131 ablative therapy at a dose of 100 millicuries, and subsequently presented with acute hepatitis after 10 days. To rule out all possible causative factors, abdominal ultrasonography, endoscopic ultrasonography (on the biliary tree and gall bladder), and a liver biopsy were performed. DILI caused by iodine-131 was suspected. Oral prednisolone was started at 30 mg/day, to which the patient responded well.
27209221	[Predictive factors and prognostic consequences of perioperative complications of radical cystectomies for urothelial carcinoma in patients of 80 years or more].	OBJECTIVE: To define the predictive factors and the prognostic consequences of perioperative complications occurrence while radical cystectomies for urothelial carcinoma treatment in patients older than 80 years. MATERIAL AND METHOD: Retrospective analysis of clinical and biological preoperative data and outcome of eighty patients of 80 years or more, treated with radical cystectomy between 1990 and 2010 in one centre. Perioperative complications were graded according to the classification from Clavien-Dindo. RESULTS: Twenty-eight patients (35%) had a single perioperative complication and nineteen (24%) had multiple (>/=2) perioperative complications. Overall survival of patients with multiple perioperative complications was significantly lower than that of patients who had no complications (Log-rank P=0.0004). The occurrence of multiple perioperative complications was associated with Charlson and ASA scores, with pelvic irradiation and induction chemotherapy histories. However, in multivariate analysis, only the existence of respiratory comorbidity was an independent risk factor for the occurrence of multiple perioperative complications. CONCLUSIONS: The occurrence of multiple perioperative complications was associated with reduced overall survival in elderly patients after radical cystectomy. The existence of respiratory comorbidity was the only independent risk factor for the occurrence of multiple perioperative complications. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 5.
27207281	Biodistribution and radiation dosimetry of (68)Ga-PSMA HBED CC-a PSMA specific probe for PET imaging of prostate cancer.	PURPOSE: Positron emission tomography (PET) agents targeting the prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) are currently under broad clinical and scientific investigation. (68)Ga-PSMA HBED-CC constitutes the first (68)Ga-labelled PSMA-inhibitor and has evolved as a promising agent for imaging PSMA expression in vivo. The aim of this study was to evaluate the whole-body distribution and radiation dosimetry of this new probe. METHODS: Five patients with a history or high suspicion of prostate cancer were injected intravenously with a mean of 139.8 +/- 13.7 MBq of (68)Ga-PSMA HBED-CC (range 120-158 MBq). Four static skull to mid-thigh scans using a whole-body fully integrated PET/MR-system were performed 10 min, 60 min, 130 min, and 175 min after the tracer injection. Time-dependent changes of the injected activity per organ were determined. Mean organ-absorbed doses and effective doses (ED) were calculated using OLINDA/EXM. RESULTS: Injection of a standard activity of 150 MBq (68)Ga-PSMA HBED-CC resulted in a median effective dose of 2.37 mSv (Range 1.08E-02 - 2.46E-02 mSv/MBq). The urinary bladder wall (median absorbed dose 1.64E-01 mGv/MBq; range 8.76E-02 - 2.91E-01 mGv/MBq) was the critical organ, followed by the kidneys (median absorbed dose 1.21E-01 mGv/MBq; range 7.16E-02 - 1.75E-01), spleen (median absorbed dose 4.13E-02 mGv/MBq; range 1.57E-02 - 7.32E-02 mGv/MBq) and liver (median absorbed dose 2.07E-02 mGv/MBq; range 1.80E-02 - 2.57E-02 mGv/MBq). No drug-related pharmacological effects occurred. CONCLUSION: The use of (68)Ga-PSMA HBED-CC results in a relatively low radiation exposure, delivering organ doses that are comparable to those of other (68)Ga-labelled PSMA-inhibitors used for PET-imaging. Total effective dose is lower than for other PET-agents used for prostate cancer imaging (e.g. (11)C- and (18)F-Choline).
27207054	Polymer microfilters with nanostructured surfaces for the culture of circulating cancer cells.	There is a critical need to improve the accuracy of drug screening and testing through the development of in vitro culture systems that more effectively mimic the in vivo environment. Surface topographical features on the nanoscale level, in short nanotopography, effect the cell growth patterns, and hence affect cell function in culture. We report the preliminary results on the fabrication, and subsequent cellular growth, of nanoscale surface topography on polymer microfilters using cell lines as a precursor to circulating tumor cells (CTCs). To create various nanoscale features on the microfilter surface, we used reactive ion etching (RIE) with and without an etching mask. An anodized aluminum oxide (AAO) membrane fabricated directly on the polymer surface served as an etching mask. Polymer filters with a variety of modified surfaces were used to compare the effects on the culture of cancer cell lines in blank culture wells, with untreated microfilters or with RIE-treated microfilters. We then report the differences of cell shape, phenotype and growth patterns of bladder and glioblastoma cancer cell lines after isolation on the various types of material modifications. Our data suggest that RIE modified polymer filters can isolate model cell lines while retaining ell viability, and that the RIE filter modification allows T24 monolayering cells to proliferate as a structured cluster.
27203748	Evaluation of plan quality assurance models for prostate cancer patients based on fully automatically generated Pareto-optimal treatment plans.	IMRT planning with commercial Treatment Planning Systems (TPSs) is a trial-and-error process. Consequently, the quality of treatment plans may not be consistent among patients, planners and institutions. Recently, different plan quality assurance (QA) models have been proposed, that could flag and guide improvement of suboptimal treatment plans. However, the performance of these models was validated using plans that were created using the conventional trail-and-error treatment planning process. Consequently, it is challenging to assess and compare quantitatively the accuracy of different treatment planning QA models. Therefore, we created a golden standard dataset of consistently planned Pareto-optimal IMRT plans for 115 prostate patients. Next, the dataset was used to assess the performance of a treatment planning QA model that uses the overlap volume histogram (OVH). 115 prostate IMRT plans were fully automatically planned using our in-house developed TPS Erasmus-iCycle. An existing OVH model was trained on the plans of 58 of the patients. Next it was applied to predict DVHs of the rectum, bladder and anus of the remaining 57 patients. The predictions were compared with the achieved values of the golden standard plans for the rectum D mean, V 65, and V 75, and D mean of the anus and the bladder. For the rectum, the prediction errors (predicted-achieved) were only -0.2 +/- 0.9 Gy (mean +/- 1 SD) for D mean,-1.0 +/- 1.6% for V 65, and -0.4 +/- 1.1% for V 75. For D mean of the anus and the bladder, the prediction error was 0.1 +/- 1.6 Gy and 4.8 +/- 4.1 Gy, respectively. Increasing the training cohort to 114 patients only led to minor improvements. A dataset of consistently planned Pareto-optimal prostate IMRT plans was generated. This dataset can be used to train new, and validate and compare existing treatment planning QA models, and has been made publicly available. The OVH model was highly accurate in predicting rectum and anus DVHs. For the bladder, larger prediction errors were observed.
27199504	Prognostic and Clinicopathological Significance of Downregulated p16 Expression in Patients with Bladder Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.	p16, encoded by the CDKN2A gene, is a tumor suppressor that has been widely studied in cancer research. However, the relationship of p16 with prognostic and clinicopathological parameters in patients with bladder cancer remains unclear. Data inclusion criteria were articles reporting on the relationship between p16 expression and the prognosis or clinicopathology in patients with bladder cancer. Meta-analyses were performed with Stata software. Hazard ratios (HRs) or odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated to evaluate the relative risks. The source of heterogeneity was analyzed by subgroup analysis. A total of 37 studies with 2246 cases were included and analyzed. The results identified an important link between downregulated p16 expression and poor prognosis in patients with bladder cancer in terms of recurrence-free survival (RFS), overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and some clinicopathological parameters including clinical staging, pathological degree, and lymph node metastasis. Subgroup analysis also showed that low p16 expression could function as a warning sign for RFS and PFS in patients with early-stage (Ta-T1) bladder cancer. In conclusion, p16 might play an essential role in the deterioration of bladder cancer and could serve as a biomarker for the prediction for patients' progression and prognosis.
27198658	No Evidence of Human Polyomavirus 9, WU and KI DNA in Kidney and Urinary Bladder Tumour Tissue Samples.	BACKGROUND/AIMS: The oncogenic potential of human polyomaviruses (HPyVs) has been proposed, but so far only Merkel cell carcinoma polyomavirus seems to be associated with a human tumour. The role of BK polyomavirus (BKPyV) in human tumourigenesis remains controversial. BKPyV establishes persistent infection in the urinary tract, and renal and bladder neoplasms have been studied extensively, but conflicting prevalence data are reported. KI, WU and HPyV9 were detected in urine samples suggesting that these viruses may also infect the urinary tract, but their presence in urinary tract tumours has not been studied. The aim of this work was to examine the prevalence of KIPyV, WUPyV, HPyV9 and BKPyV by PCR in renal and bladder neoplasms. METHODS: A total of 190 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded renal neoplasms, bladder cancer and kidney biopsy samples were analysed for the presence of BKPyV, KIPyV, WUPyV and HPyV9 DNA by real-time and nested PCR. RESULTS: Amplifiable DNA was extracted from all the samples, but none of the studied viruses were detected in benign renal neoplasia (0/23), malignant renal tumours (0/89) or bladder cancer (0/76). CONCLUSION: Our study did not find any evidence that BKPyV, KIPyV, WUPyV or HPyV9 are associated with bladder and renal tumours.
27197339	Cystectomy and Urinary Diversion for the Management of a Devastated Lower Urinary Tract Following Prostatic Cryotherapy and/or Radiotherapy.	INTRODUCTION: We investigated the outcomes and quality of life measures in men who underwent cystectomy and urinary diversion for devastating lower urinary tract toxicity after prostatic radiotherapy and/or cryotherapy for the treatment of prostate cancer. METHODS: Records of patients who underwent cystectomy and urinary diversion for the management of a devastated lower urinary tract following prostatic radiotherapy or cryotherapy were reviewed retrospectively. A postoperative, retrospective quality of life (QOL) survey was designed specific to this patient subset and obtained by telephone interview. RESULTS: Extirpative surgery with urinary diversion for management of a devastated lower urinary tract was performed on 15 patients with a mean age of 72 years (range 63-82). Toxicities leading to bladder removal included bladder neck contractures, prostatic necrosis, incontinence, osteomyelitis, bladder calculi, fistulae, urethral strictures, abscesses, necrotizing fasciitis, and radiation/hemorrhagic cystitis. The mean number of failed conservative, minimally invasive interventions per patients prior to cystectomy was 3.7 (range 1-12). The average time period from major complication following radiotherapy/cryotherapy to cystectomy was 29.1 months (range 5-65). The QOL survey showed all of the patients who completed the survey (n = 13) would undergo the procedure again and 11 (85%) would have undergone the procedure an average of 13.2 months sooner (range 5-36). CONCLUSION: Toxicities secondary to prostatic radiotherapy or cryotherapy may be debilitating. Our results demonstrate that cystectomy with urinary diversion can improve QOL in patients with a devastated lower urinary tract.
27196525	Preventable Incidence and Mortality of Carcinoma Associated With Lifestyle Factors Among White Adults in the United States.	IMPORTANCE: Lifestyle factors are important for cancer development. However, a recent study has been interpreted to suggest that random mutations during stem cell divisions are the major contributor to human cancer. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the proportion of cases and deaths of carcinoma (all cancers except skin, brain, lymphatic, hematologic, and nonfatal prostate malignancies) among whites in the United States that can be potentially prevented by lifestyle modification. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This prospective cohort study analyzes cancer and lifestyle data from the Nurses' Health Study, the Health Professionals Follow-up Study, and US national cancer statistics to evaluate associations between lifestyle and cancer incidence and mortality. EXPOSURES: A healthy lifestyle pattern was defined as never or past smoking (pack-years <5), no or moderate alcohol drinking (</=1 drink/d for women, </=2 drinks/d for men), BMI of at least 18.5 but lower than 27.5, and weekly aerobic physical activity of at least 75 vigorous-intensity or 150 moderate-intensity minutes. Participants meeting all 4 of these criteria made up the low-risk group; all others, the high-risk group. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: We calculated the population-attributable risk (PAR) by comparing incidence and mortality of total and major individual carcinomas between the low- and high-risk groups. We further assessed the PAR at the national scale by comparing the low-risk group with the US population. RESULTS: A total of 89571 women and 46339 men from 2 cohorts were included in the study: 16531 women and 11731 men had a healthy lifestyle pattern (low-risk group), and the remaining 73040 women and 34608 men made up the high-risk group. Within the 2 cohorts, the PARs for incidence and mortality of total carcinoma were 25% and 48% in women, and 33% and 44% in men, respectively. For individual cancers, the respective PARs in women and men were 82% and 78% for lung, 29% and 20% for colon and rectum, 30% and 29% for pancreas, and 36% and 44% for bladder. Similar estimates were obtained for mortality. The PARs were 4% and 12% for breast cancer incidence and mortality, and 21% for fatal prostate cancer. Substantially higher PARs were obtained when the low-risk group was compared with the US population. For example, the PARs in women and men were 41% and 63% for incidence of total carcinoma, and 60% and 59% for colorectal cancer, respectively. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: A substantial cancer burden may be prevented through lifestyle modification. Primary prevention should remain a priority for cancer control.
27189278	Metabolic Pathway Signatures Associated with Urinary Metabolite Biomarkers Differentiate Bladder Cancer Patients from Healthy Controls.	PURPOSE: Our previous high-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry study identified bladder cancer (BCA)-specific urine metabolites, including carnitine, acylcarnitines, and melatonin. The objective of the current study was to determine which metabolic pathways are perturbed in BCA, based on our previously identified urinary metabolome. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 135 primary BCA samples and 26 control tissue samples from healthy volunteers were analyzed. The association between specific urinary metabolites and their related encoding genes was analyzed. RESULTS: Significant alterations in the carnitine-acylcarnitine and tryptophan metabolic pathways were detected in urine specimens from BCA patients compared to those of healthy controls. The expression of eight genes involved in the carnitine-acylcarnitine metabolic pathway (CPT1A, CPT1B, CPT1C, CPT2, SLC25A20, and CRAT) or tryptophan metabolism (TPH1 and IDO1) was assessed by RT-PCR in our BCA cohort (n=135). CPT1B, CPT1C, SLC25A20, CRAT, TPH1, and IOD1 were significantly downregulated in tumor tissues compared to normal bladder tissues (p<0.05 all) of patients with non-muscle invasive BCA, whereas CPT1B, CPT1C, CRAT, and TPH1 were downregulated in those with muscle invasive BCA (p<0.05), with no changes in IDO1 expression. CONCLUSION: Alterations in the expression of genes associated with the carnitine-acylcarnitine and tryptophan metabolic pathways, which were the most perturbed pathways in BCA, were determined.
27189277	Prognostic Factors for Recurrence and Progression in Korean Non-Muscle-Invasive Bladder Cancer Patients: A Retrospective, Multi-Institutional Study.	PURPOSE: To identify the prognostic factors related to tumor recurrence and progression in Korean patients with non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data were collected and analyzed for 2412 NMIBC patients from 15 centers who were initially diagnosed after transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) from January 2006 to December 2010. Using univariable and multivariable Cox proportional hazards models, the prognostic value of each variable was evaluated for the time to first recurrence and progression. RESULTS: With a median follow-up duration of 37 months, 866 patients (35.9%) experienced recurrence, and 137 (5.7%) experienced progression. Patients with recurrence had a median time to the first recurrence of 10 months. Multivariable analysis conducted in all patients revealed that preoperative positive urine cytology (PUC) was independently associated with worse recurrence-free survival [RFS; hazard ratio (HR) 1.56; p<0.001], and progression-free survival (PFS; HR 1.56; p=0.037). In particular, on multivariable analysis conducted for the high-risk group (T1 tumor/high-grade Ta tumor/carcinoma in situ), preoperative PUC was an independent predictor of worse RFS (HR 1.73; p<0.001) and PFS (HR 1.96; p=0.006). On multivariable analysis in patients with T1 high-grade (T1HG) cancer (n=684), better RFS (HR 0.75; p=0.033) and PFS (HR 0.33; p<0.001) were observed in association with the administration of intravesical Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) induction therapy. CONCLUSION: A preoperative PUC result may adversely affect RFS and PFS, particularly in high-risk NMIBC patients. Of particular note, intravesical BCG induction therapy should be administered as an adjunct to TURBT in order to improve RFS and PFS in patients with T1HG cancer.
27189274	Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor 1 Overexpression Is Associated with Poor Survival in Patients with Resected Muscle Invasive Urothelial Carcinoma.	PURPOSE: To examine the usefulness of various receptor tyrosine kinase expressions as prognostic markers and therapeutic targets in muscle invasive urothelial cancer (UC) patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the data of 98 patients with muscle invasive UC who underwent radical cystectomy between 2005 and 2010 in Yonsei Cancer Center. Using formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissues of primary tumors, immunohistochemical staining was done for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1), and fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3). RESULTS: There were 41 (41.8%), 44 (44.9%), and 14 (14.2%) patients who have over-expressed HER2, FGFR1, and FGFR3, respectively. In univariate analysis, significantly shorter median time to recurrence (TTR) (12.9 months vs. 49.0 months; p=0.008) and overall survival (OS) (22.3 months vs. 52.7 months; p=0.006) was found in patients with FGFR1 overexpression. By contrast, there was no difference in TTR or OS according to the HER2 and FGFR3 expression status. FGFR1 remained as a significant prognostic factor for OS with hazard ratio of 2.23 (95% confidence interval: 1.27-3.90, p=0.006) in multivariate analysis. CONCLUSION: Our result showed that FGFR1 expression, but not FGFR3, is an adverse prognostic factor in muscle invasive UC patients after radical cystectomy. FGFR1 might be feasible for prognosis prediction and a potential therapeutic target after thorough validation in muscle invasive UC.
27185601	Outcomes and prognostic factors of simple partial cystectomy for localized bladder urothelial cell carcinoma.	Radical cystectomy has remained the gold standard for recurrent superficial or muscle invasive bladder tumor. However, partial cystectomy still has a role in those who reject or have contraindications for radical cystectomy. In this study, we sought to identify predictors of bladder recurrence and overall survival after simple partial cystectomy. We included 27 patients with bladder tumor who received simple partial cystectomy without pelvic lymph node dissection between March 2000 and September 2013. Adjuvant chemotherapy or radiation therapy was prescribed according to the pathological results. Parameters were compared on the basis of bladder recurrence and overall survival. During a mean follow-up time of 39 months, five patients (18.5%) experienced bladder recurrence. An older age, a higher pathological stage, positive surgical margins, and distant metastases were significant predictors of overall survival (p = 0.031, p = 0.001, p = 0.001, and p = 0.011, respectively). Meanwhile, previous bladder instillation and positive surgical margins were significant predictors of bladder recurrence (p = 0.026 and p = 0.027, respectively). The rate of consecutive distant metastases (33.3%) was almost twice the rate of bladder recurrence (18.5%), and six patients developed consecutive distant metastases without first experiencing bladder recurrence. In patients who received a simple partial cystectomy as an alternative treatment, previous bladder instillation and positive surgical margins were significant predictors of bladder recurrence. Patients with an older age, positive surgical margins, and consecutive distant metastases had worse overall survival. Partial cystectomy with routine lymph node dissection may be a better option for achieving favorable long-term outcomes.
27184557	A highly sensitive and facile graphene oxide-based nucleic acid probe: Label-free detection of telomerase activity in cancer patient's urine using AIEgens.	Molecular beacon (MB)-based sensing platforms that consist of a fluorogen-quencher pair play an important role in medical and biological researches. However, the synthesis of both fluorogen and quencher in the nucleic acid probes will increase the burden of organic synthesis works and induce the difficulties for precisely controlling the relative distance between fluorogen and quencher, which may lead to false-positive and false-negative results. In this work, initially we report a single labeled MB (FAM-MB, with carboxyfluorescein as fluorogen and without quencher) thus simplifies MBs with the aid of graphene oxide (GO) to detect telomerase activity. To further simplify this structure, namely label-free strategy, we design a facile, sensitive and selective platform using a label-free beacon (AIE-MB, without fluorogen and quencher), based on aggregation-induced emission fluorogen (silole-R). Upon the addition of telomerase, AIE-MB induced comb-like DNA structure leads to high aggregation of silole-R and thus exhibits strong fluorescence emission. By exploitation of this, we can detect telomerase with superior sensitivity and demonstrate their applications in bladder cancer diagnosis. Compared to single-labeled FAM-MB based telomerase activity assay, the label-free AIE-MB induced method could perform the sensitive detection with high signal-to-background ratio.
27180878	Genotoxicity and cytotoxicity of oxindole alkaloids from Uncaria tomentosa (cat's claw): Chemotype relevance.	ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Uncaria tomentosa (Willdenow ex Roemer & Schultes) DC. (Rubiaceae) or cat's claw is a climber vine from the South American rainforest used in folk medicine for cancer treatment. Its antitumor activity has been mostly ascribed to pentacyclic oxindole alkaloids (POA) from stem bark and leaves while the activity of tetracyclic oxindole alkaloids (TOA) remains unknown. In recent times, the occurrence of three chemotypes based on its oxindole alkaloid profile was noticed in U. tomentosa, namely, chemotype I (POA cis D/E ring junction); chemotype II (POA trans D/E ring junction) or chemotype III (TOA). Consequently, the relationship between the chemotype and cytotoxic and genotoxic activities deserves attention. AIM OF THE STUDY: To evaluate the influence of cat's claw chemotypes on genotoxicity and cytotoxicity against non malignant and malignant human cell line models. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Four authentic stem bark cat's claw samples (SI-SIV) and two leaf samples (LII and LIII) were analyzed by HPLC-PDA, properly extracted and fractioned by ion-exchange to obtain oxindole alkaloid purified fractions (OAPFs). The freeze-dried fractions were assayed for genotoxicity and cytotoxicity against human leukocytes (non malignant cell line) by the micronuclei frequency method and the alkaline comet DNA assay, and the trypan blue method, respectively. Moreover, the cytotoxicity of each OAPF was evaluated against a human bladder cancer cell line (T24) and human glioblastoma cell line (U-251-MG) by MTT method (malignant cell lines). Additionally, the isomerization of oxindole alkaloids throughout the course of cell incubation was monitored by HPLC-PDA. RESULTS: Based on HPLC-PDA analyses, sample SI was characterized as chemotype I, while samples SII and LII were characterized as chemotype II, and samples SIII, SIV and LIII as chemotype III. The chemotypes showed comparable cytotoxic activity toward malignant cell lines (T24 and U-251-MG) unlike human leukocytes (non malignant cell line), where this activity was clearly distinct. Chemotype II (POA trans D/E ring junction) showed a higher selectivity index (SI) against malignant cells (SI=1.11-3.04) than chemotype I (SI=0.10-0.19) and III (SI=0.21-0.57). No important genotoxic potential was found by micronuclei frequency and alkaline comet DNA assays. Despite the isomerization of oxindole alkaloids during the cell incubation, the chemotype of the cat's claw samples remained unchanged. CONCLUSION: Cat's claw chemotypes showed different selectivity against human malignant cells, so that the correct identification of each chemotype seems to be important to better understand its antitumor potential.
27179268	Influence of gross specimen sampling on the incidence of incidental prostatic carcinoma in cystoprostatectomy specimens of patients with bladder carcinoma.	Reported prostate cancer incidence rates vary greatly among cystoprostatectomy samples. We investigated how the thoroughness of prostate sampling influences prostatic carcinoma incidence in bladder cancer patients. In a retrospective study, 313 cystoprostatectomy cases of urinary bladder carcinoma were analysed for the presence of concurrent prostatic carcinoma. Patients were divided into two groups: patients who had undergone the operation before and after 2007, when a policy of preferably complete prostate sampling in cystoprostatectomy specimens was introduced at our institution. Cases processed after the 2007 recommended sampling changes had a significantly higher rate of incidental prostatic carcinoma and clinically significant prostatic carcinoma than the pre-2007 group (p < 0.0001 and p = 0.003, respectively). Complete prostate processing in cystoprostatectomy specimens results in a higher incidence of incidental prostatic carcinoma than with partial processing. More patients with clinically significant prostate cancer are consequently discovered. In conclusion, we believe that complete prostate sampling should be mandatory.
27177757	Urothelial Cancer: Inflammatory Mediators and Implications for Immunotherapy.	Urothelial cancer (UC) represents one of the most frequent malignancies, which causes about 150,000 deaths per year worldwide. To date, only a few chemotherapeutic drugs have been approved against UC, showing poor results, and limited effective molecular markers. In the last years, several studies have evaluated the correlation between bladder cancer and phlogosis, showing that some cytokines produced by different stimuli can enhance invasion and migration of tumor cells. In more recent years, antibodies blocking immune checkpoints have exhibited oncologic efficacy, including increased overall survival, in various tumor types. To date, several studies evaluated the role of immune-checkpoint inhibitors in metastatic UC showing exiting results, compared to those of classic chemotherapeutic regimens. In this review, we summarized data on inflammatory mediators and discussed implications for treatment with new immune-related drugs in UC patients.
27177091	Isoquercitrin inhibits bladder cancer progression in vivo and in vitro by regulating the PI3K/Akt and PKC signaling pathways.	Bladder cancer is the most common malignancy of the urinary system and is also one of the 10 most common cancers of the human body. Currently, clinical treatment of bladder cancer mainly utilizes partial or total cystectomy, supplemented by conventional chemotherapy. However, such treatment has not fully improved the prognosis of patients and is associated with various side effects. Studies have found that flavonoids extracted from plants can be used in radiotherapy and chemotherapy for the prevention of postoperative recurrence and metastasis but also alone for the treatment of advanced tumors. Both applications can ameliorate clinical symptoms, improve the quality of life, and prolong the survival of patients. Based on the above information, the present study investigated the effect of isoquercitrin, a type of flavonoid found in Bidens pilosa L. extracts, on bladder cancer progression, with the goal of understanding the biological characteristics of isoquercitrin by which it participates in bladder cancer progression. Using in vitro experiments, we found that therapeutic doses of isoquercitrin significantly inhibited cell proliferation and induced apoptosis in human bladder cancer cells and that the cell cycle was arrested in the G1 phase. Isoquercitrin inhibited phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and Akt phosphorylation expression levels, thus inhibiting proliferation and inducing apoptosis in the cancer cells. In addition, we found that isoquercitrin reduced protein kinase C (PKC) protein expression levels in the human bladder cancer cell lines. We also showed via in vivo experiments that isoquercitrin inhibited xenograft tumor growth in nude mice. In conclusion, our study confirmed that isoquercitrin inhibits bladder cancer progression in vivo and demonstrated that the molecular mechanism of this inhibition may be closely associated with the PI3K/Akt and PKC signaling pathways.
27177072	Quantitative phase imaging to improve the diagnostic accuracy of urine cytology.	BACKGROUND: A definitive diagnosis of urothelial carcinoma in urine cytology is often challenging and subjective. Many urine cytology samples receive an indeterminate diagnosis. Ancillary techniques such as fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) have been used to improve the diagnostic sensitivity, but FISH is not approved as a routine screening test, and the complex fluorescent staining protocol also limits its widespread clinical use. Quantitative phase imaging (QPI) is an emerging technology allowing accurate measurements of the single-cell dry mass. This study was undertaken to explore the ability of QPI to improve the diagnostic accuracy of urine cytology for malignancy. METHODS: QPI was performed on unstained, ThinPrep-prepared urine cytology slides from 28 patients with 4 categories of cytological diagnoses (negative, atypical, suspicious, and positive for malignancy). The nuclear/cell dry mass, the entropy, and the nucleus-to-cell mass ratio were calculated for several hundred cells for each patient, and they were then correlated with the follow-up diagnoses. RESULTS: The nuclear mass and nuclear mass entropy of urothelial cells showed significant differences between negative and positive groups. These data showed a progressive increase from patients with negative diagnosis, to patients with atypical/suspicious and positive cytologic diagnosis. Most importantly, among the patients in the atypical and suspicious diagnosis, the nuclear mass and its entropy were significantly higher for those patients with a follow-up diagnosis of malignancy than those patients without a subsequent follow-up diagnosis of malignancy. CONCLUSIONS: QPI shows potential for improving the diagnostic accuracy of urine cytology, especially for indeterminate cases, and should be further evaluated as an ancillary test for urine cytology.

27176124	Forkhead box Q1: A key player in the pathogenesis of tumors (Review).	As a member of the Forkhead box protein family, Forkhead box Q1 (FOXQ1) is a transcription factor that functions to regulate cell differentiation. Recently, an increasing number of studies have demonstrated that FOXQ1 is significantly associated with the pathogenesis of tumors. This review aims to predominantly discuss the relationship between FOXQ1 and various types of tumor. The FOXQ1 gene is located at human chromosome 6p25.3 and encodes a functional 403 amino acid protein, which has many physiological functions, including promoting epithelial differentiation, inhibiting smooth muscle differentiation, activating T cells and autoimmunity, and controlling mucin gene expression and granule content in stomach surface mucous cells. There are several modes of regulation of FOXQ1 expression that have been demonstrated in normal and tumor cells, such as microRNA and the Wnt signaling pathway. The activation of FOXQ1 affects downstream genes promoting the initiation, proliferation and invasion, in addition to the metastasis of tumor cells. Amongst these, the regulation of invasion and metastasis by FOXQ1 is the most extensively studied. The detailed mechanism involves angiogenesis, tumor re-initiation, alterations in the tumor microenvironment and epithelial-mesenchymal transition. In a number of studies, the expression of FOXQ1 has been reported to be upregulated in breast, colorectal, pancreatic, bladder and ovarian cancer, and glioma, amongst other tumor types. Together, these studies contribute to cancer diagnostics, prognostics and therapeutics. In conclusion, the application prospect of FOXQ1 in tumors is hopeful.
27175954	Primary Care of the Prostate Cancer Survivor.	This summary of the American Cancer Society Prostate Cancer Survivorship Care Guidelines targets primary care physicians who coordinate care of prostate cancer survivors with subspecialists. Prostate cancer survivors should undergo prostate-specific antigen screening every six to 12 months and digital rectal examination annually. Surveillance of patients who choose watchful waiting for their prostate cancer should be conducted by a subspecialist. Any hematuria or rectal bleeding must be thoroughly evaluated. Prostate cancer survivors should be screened regularly for urinary incontinence and sexual dysfunction. Patients with predominant urge incontinence symptoms, which can occur after surgical and radiation treatments, may benefit from an anticholinergic agent. If there is difficulty with bladder emptying, a trial of an alpha blocker may be considered. A phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor can effectively treat sexual dysfunction following treatment for prostate cancer. Osteoporosis screening should occur before initiation of androgen deprivation therapy, and patients treated with androgen deprivation therapy should be monitored for anemia, metabolic syndrome, and vasomotor symptoms. Healthy lifestyle choices should be encouraged, including weight management, regular physical activity, proper nutrition, and smoking cessation. Primary care physicians should be vigilant for psychosocial distress, including depression, among prostate cancer survivors, as well as the potential impact of this distress on patients' family members and partners.
27175706	Efficacy and Safety of Stroke Volume Variation-Guided Fluid Therapy for Reducing Blood Loss and Transfusion Requirements During Radical Cystectomy: A Randomized Clinical Trial.	Radical cystectomy, which is performed to treat muscle-invasive bladder tumors, is among the most difficult urological surgical procedures and puts patients at risk of intraoperative blood loss and transfusion. Fluid management via stroke volume variation (SVV) is associated with reduced intraoperative blood loss. Therefore, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of SVV-guided fluid therapy for reducing blood loss and transfusion requirements in patients undergoing radical cystectomy.This study included 48 patients who underwent radical cystectomy, and these patients were randomly allocated to the control group and maintained at <10% SVV (n = 24) or allocated to the trial group and maintained at 10% to 20% SVV (n = 24). The primary endpoints were comparisons of the amounts of intraoperative blood loss and transfused red blood cells (RBCs) between the control and trial groups during radical cystectomy. Intraoperative blood loss was evaluated through the estimated blood loss and estimated red cell mass loss. The secondary endpoints were comparisons of the postoperative outcomes between groups.A total of 46 patients were included in the final analysis: 23 patients in the control group and 23 patients in the trial group. The SVV values in the trial group were significantly higher than in the control group. Estimated blood loss, estimated red cell mass loss, and RBC transfusion requirements in the trial group were significantly lower than in the control group (734.3 +/- 321.5 mL vs 1096.5 +/- 623.9 mL, P = 0.019; 274.1 +/- 207.8 mL vs 553.1 +/- 298.7 mL, P <0.001; 0.5 +/- 0.8 units vs 1.9 +/- 2.2 units, P = 0.005). There were no significant differences in postoperative outcomes between the two groups.SVV-guided fluid therapy (SVV maintained at 10%-20%) can reduce blood loss and transfusion requirements in patients undergoing radical cystectomy without resulting in adverse outcomes. These findings provide useful information for optimal fluid management during radical cystectomy.
27175683	A Challenging Surgical Approach to Locally Advanced Primary Urethral Carcinoma: A Case Report and Literature Review.	Primary urethral carcinoma (PUC) is a rare and aggressive cancer, often underdetected and consequently unsatisfactorily treated. We report a case of advanced PUC, surgically treated with combined approaches.A 47-year-old man underwent transurethral resection of a urethral lesion with histological evidence of a poorly differentiated squamous cancer of the bulbomembranous urethra. Computed tomography (CT) and bone scans excluded metastatic spread of the disease but showed involvement of both corpora cavernosa (cT3N0M0). A radical surgical approach was advised, but the patient refused this and opted for chemotherapy. After 17 months the patient was referred to our department due to the evidence of a fistula in the scrotal area. CT scan showed bilateral metastatic disease in the inguinal, external iliac, and obturator lymph nodes as well as the involvement of both corpora cavernosa. Additionally, a fistula originating from the right corpus cavernosum extended to the scrotal skin. At this stage, the patient accepted the surgical treatment, consisting of different phases. Phase I: Radical extraperitoneal cystoprostatectomy with iliac-obturator lymph nodes dissection. Phase II: Creation of a urinary diversion through a Bricker ileal conduit. Phase III: Repositioning of the patient in lithotomic position for an overturned Y skin incision, total penectomy, fistula excision, and "en bloc" removal of surgical specimens including the bladder, through the perineal breach. Phase IV: Right inguinal lymphadenectomy.The procedure lasted 9-and-a-half hours, was complication-free, and intraoperative blood loss was 600 mL. The patient was discharged 8 days after surgery. Pathological examination documented a T4N2M0 tumor. The clinical situation was stable during the first 3 months postoperatively but then metastatic spread occurred, not responsive to adjuvant chemotherapy, which led to the patient's death 6 months after surgery.Patients with advanced stage tumors of the bulbomembranous urethra should be managed with radical surgery including the corporas up to the ischiatic tuberosity attachment, and membranous urethra in continuity with the prostate and bladder. Neo-adjuvant treatment may be advisable with the aim of improving the poor prognosis, even if the efficacy is not certain while it can delay the radical treatment of the disease.
27174960	BUBR1 overexpression predicts disease-specific survival after nephroureterectomy in patients with upper tract urothelial carcinoma.	OBJECTIVE: To date, there are few reliable markers to distinguish tumors with aggressive characteristics in upper tract urothelial carcinoma. The purpose of this study was to identify a biomarker related to genetic instability (chromosomal instability or microsatellite instability) with prognostic value, in patients with upper tract urothelial carcinoma. METHODS: Expression of chromosomal instability-related markers (BUBR1, p53, polo-like kinase 1) and microsatellite instability-related markers (mismatch repair proteins, MLH1 and MSH2) were assessed by immunohistochemistry in 100 patients who had radical nephroureterectomy for upper tract urothelial carcinoma. Numerical aberrations of chromosomes 7, 9 and 17 were evaluated by fluorescence in situ hybridization, which allowed an estimation of the degree of chromosomal instability. BUB1B copy number was examined by array-based comparative genomic hybridization in 32 patients with upper tract urothelial carcinoma. RESULTS: BUBR1 status was most significantly correlated with chromosomal instability-related and low mismatch repair parameters, according to the molecular biomarkers examined. Overexpression of BUBR1 is frequently detected in tumors with higher histological grade (P < 0.0001) and is significantly associated with chromosomal instability (P = 0.0071). Array-based comparative genomic hybridization revealed that no tumors (0%) showed BUB1B amplification and gain, indicating that overexpression of BUBR1 was independent of BUB1B copy number. For disease-specific survival, BUBR1 overexpression, lymphovascular invasion, pathological tumor stage, pathological lymph node involvement and low MSH2 expression were significant prognostic factors in univariate analyses. In multivariate analyses, BUBR1 overexpression was an independent prognostic factor for disease-specific survival (P = 0.0483, risk ratio 3.76, 95% confidence interval: 1.01-18.43). CONCLUSIONS: BUBR1 may have significant potential as a biomarker for estimating disease-specific survival in patients with upper tract urothelial carcinoma treated by radical nephroureterectomy.
27173252	CYP1A2-163C/A (rs762551) polymorphism and bladder cancer risk: a case-control study.	To date, no study has investigated the association between CYP1A2-163C/A polymorphism and bladder cancer risk in a Chinese population. Here, we extracted genomic DNA from peripheral white blood cells, and differentiated CYP1A2 alleles by polymerase chain reaction-based restriction fragment length polymorphism methods. Differences in genotype frequencies between the cases and controls were evaluated using a chi-square test. The odds ratio (OR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated using an unconditional logistic regression model. This revealed that the -163A allele was present at a significantly increased frequency in bladder cancer patients compared to healthy controls (44.10 vs 22.25%, P < 0.001). The prevalence of CC genotype, CA genotype, and AA genotype was 34.91, 41.98, and 23.11% in bladder cancer patients, and 64.00, 27.50, and 8.5% in the controls, respectively. Therefore, significant differences in the frequencies of -163 genotypes were found between bladder cancer patients and controls (P < 0.001). We found that the AA genotype was significantly associated with increased bladder cancer risk (OR = 3.72; 95%CI = 1.55-7.16; P = 0.02), and the -163A carriers were at increased risk of bladder cancer in a multivariate COX regression model (OR = 4.89, 95%CI = 2.78-10.87, P = 0.01). We conclude that the CYP1A2-163C/A polymorphism is associated with increased susceptibility to bladder cancer in the Chinese population.
27173162	Clinical Translation of a Click-Labeled 18F-Octreotate Radioligand for Imaging Neuroendocrine Tumors.	UNLABELLED: We conducted the first-in-human study of (18)F-fluoroethyl triazole [Tyr(3)] octreotate ((18)F-FET-betaAG-TOCA) in patients with neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) to evaluate biodistribution, dosimetry, and safety. Despite advances in clinical imaging, detection and quantification of NET activity remains a challenge, with no universally accepted imaging standard. METHODS: Nine patients were enrolled. Eight patients had sporadic NETs, and 1 had multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 syndrome. Patients received 137-163 MBq (mean +/- SD, 155.7 +/- 8 MBq) of (18)F-FET-betaAG-TOCA. Safety data were obtained during and 24 h after radioligand administration. Patients underwent detailed whole-body PET/CT multibed scanning over 4 h with sampling of venous bloods for radioactivity and radioactive metabolite quantification. Regions of interest were defined to derive individual and mean organ residence times; effective dose was calculated with OLINDA 1.1. RESULTS: All patients tolerated (18)F-FET-betaAG-TOCA with no adverse events. Over 60% parent radioligand was present in plasma at 60 min. High tumor (primary and metastases)-to-background contrast images were observed. Physiologic distribution was seen in the pituitary, salivary glands, thyroid, and spleen, with low background distribution in the liver, an organ in which metastases commonly occur. The organs receiving highest absorbed dose were the gallbladder, spleen, stomach, liver, kidneys, and bladder. The calculated effective dose over all subjects (mean +/- SD) was 0.029 +/- 0.004 mSv/MBq. CONCLUSION: The favorable safety, imaging, and dosimetric profile makes (18)F-FET-betaAG-TOCA a promising candidate radioligand for staging and management of NETs. Clinical studies in an expanded cohort are ongoing to clinically qualify this agent.
27172738	Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and cyclooxygenase 2 (COX 2) immunostaining in ovarian cancer.	PURPOSE OF INVESTIGATION: Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX 2) are markers of angiogenesis and potential therapeutic targets. Previous studies demonstrate that VEGF is upregulated in some ovarian cancers. The purpose of this study was to determine the correlation of VEGF and COX 2 staining with survival in ovarian cancer patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred forty-three consecutive patients with ovarian carcinoma underwent primary staging or cytoreduction prior to platinum-based chemotherapy. Their tumors were immunohistochemically stained for expression of VEGF and COX 2. FIGO stage, grade, cytoreduction status, and histology were also analyzed as prognostic factors. RESULTS: Twenty-seven patients had Stage I tumors, three Stage II, 87 Stage III, and 26 Stage IV. Median follow-up was 74 months (mean 79 months). One hundred nineteen patients (83.2%) had tumors that were positive for VEGF and 110 patients (76.9%) had tumors that were positive for COX 2. Patients with tumors staining positive for both VEGF and COX 2 (68.5%) had a significantly increased risk of dying from their ovarian cancer (Chi-square p = 0.011, Log rank p = 0.037). Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed FIGO stage, grade, cytoreduction status, and VEGF/COX 2 expression to be independent prognostic indicators of survival. Conclusion: VEGF and COX 2 staining are frequently positive in ovarian cancer. Patients whose tumors are positive for both VEGF and COX 2 have a decreased survival. These patients may benefit from anti-angiogenesis targeted therapy.
27172290	Generation of Rat Monoclonal Antibodies Against Human Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma Cells.	Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is an aggressive tumor with a poor prognosis. Biomarkers that can detect the tumor in its early stages when it may be amenable to curative resection might improve prognosis. To discover novel markers expressed in primary pancreatic cancer, we generated a panel of monoclonal antibodies against pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cell line BxPC3 using a rat medial iliac lymph node method. The antigen recognized by 1B5A5 was expressed on the cell surface and secreted into the conditioned medium of BxPC3 cells, and characterized as glycoproteins with molecular mass between 60 and 90 kDa. A wide range of molecular weights of 1B5A5 antigen in several pancreatic cancer cell lines were observed. Immunohistochemistry using a human multiple organ tumor tissue array showed an enhanced expression of 1B5A5 antigen in pancreas, lung, stomach, breast, urinary bladder, colon, and cervix uteri cancers. Immunoprecipitation followed by proteomic analyses identified CEACAM6 as a 1B5A5 antigen. In addition, western blot analysis results indicated that the 1B5A5 epitope is located within an amino-terminal domain of CEACAM6. These results raised the possibility that our approach could lead to discovery of novel biomarkers for the early stage of cancers in a relatively short period of time.
27170615	Systemic BCG infection in a patient with pancytopaenia and fever 9 years after intravesical BCG administration for bladder cancer.	BCG is an attenuated live strain of Mycobacterium bovis that is used as an intravesical immunotherapy for superficial bladder cancer. Although generally well tolerated, BCG instillation can lead to systemic diseases. We present a case of a 75-year-old man who was treated for recurrent localised transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) of the bladder with intravesical instillation of BCG in 2006. His medical history included Parkinson's disease. The patient reported worsening of Parkinson symptoms in the preceding month. In addition, he had progressive pancytopaenia and a bone marrow biopsy showed a granulomatous inflammatory infiltrate. Cultures from bone marrow aspiration grew M. bovis He was successfully treated with tuberculostatic drugs and made a full recovery. In addition, there was partial amelioration of the Parkinson symptoms. This case shows that physicians should be aware that BCG instillation for TCC can cause systemic disease even years after treatment.
27167289	Deformable image registration and interobserver variation in contour propagation for radiation therapy planning.	Deformable image registration (DIR) and interobserver variation inevitably intro-duce uncertainty into the treatment planning process. The purpose of the current work was to measure deformable image registration (DIR) errors and interobserver variability for regions of interest (ROIs) in the head and neck and pelvic regions. Measured uncertainties were combined to examine planning margin adequacy for contours propagated for adaptive therapy and to assess the trade-off of DIR and interobserver uncertainty in atlas-based automatic segmentation. Two experi-enced dosimetrists retrospectively contoured brainstem, spinal cord, anterior oral cavity, larynx, right and left parotids, optic nerves, and eyes on the planning CT (CT1) and attenuation-correction CT of diagnostic PET/CT (CT2) for 30 patients who received radiation therapy for head and neck cancer. Two senior radiation oncology residents retrospectively contoured prostate, bladder, and rectum on the postseed-implant CT (CT1) and planning CT (CT2) for 20 patients who received radiation therapy for prostate cancer. Interobserver variation was measured by calculating mean Hausdorff distances between the two observers' contours. CT2 was deformably registered to CT1 via commercially available multipass B-spline DIR. CT2 contours were propagated and compared with CT1 contours via mean Hausdorff distances. These values were summed in quadrature with interobserver variation for margin analysis and compared with interobserver variation for sta-tistical significance using two-tailed t-tests for independent samples (alpha = 0.05). Combined uncertainty ranged from 1.5-5.8 mm for head and neck structures and 3.1-3.7 mm for pelvic structures. Conventional 5 mm margins may not be adequate to cover this additional uncertainty. DIR uncertainty was significantly less than interobserver variation for four head and neck and one pelvic ROI. DIR uncertainty was not significantly different than interobserver variation for four head and neck and one pelvic ROI. DIR uncertainty was significantly greater than interobserver variation for two head and neck and one pelvic ROI. The introduction of DIR errors may offset any reduction in interobserver variation by using atlas-based automatic segmentation.
27167281	MR image-based synthetic CT for IMRT prostate treatment planning and CBCT image-guided localization.	The purpose of this study was to propose and evaluate a method of creating a synthetic CT (S-CT) from MRI simulation for dose calculation and daily CBCT localization. A pair of MR and CT images was obtained in the same day from each of 10 prostate patients. The pair of MR and CT images was preregistered using the deformable image registration (DIR). Using the corresponding displacement vector field (atlas-DVF), the CT image was deformed to the MR image to create an atlas MR-CT pair. Regions of interest (ROI) on the atlas MR-CT pair were delineated and used to create atlas-ROI masks. 'Leave-one-out' test (one pair of MR and CT was used as subject-MR and subject-CT for evaluation, and the remaining 9 pairs were in the atlas library) was performed. For a subject-MR, autosegmentation and DVFs were generated using DIR between the subject-MR and the 9 atlas-MRs. An S-CT was then generated using the corresponding 9 paired atlas-CTs, the 9 atlas-DVFs and the corresponding atlas-ROI masks. The total 10 S-CTs were evaluated using the Hounsfield unit (HU), the calculated dose distribution, and the auto bony registration to daily CBCT images with respect to the 10 subject-CTs. HU differences (mean +/- STD) were (2.4 +/- 25.23), (1.18 +/- 39.49), (32.46 +/- 81.9), (0.23 +/- 40.13), and (3.74 +/- 144.76) for prostate, bladder, rectal wall, soft tissue outside all ROIs, and bone, respectively. The discrepancy of dose-volume param-eters calculated using the S-CT for treatment planning was small (</= 0.22% with 95% confidence). Gamma pass rate (2% &amp; 2 mm) was higher than 99.86% inside PTV and 98.45% inside normal structures. Using the 10 S-CTs as the reference CT for daily CBCT localization achieved the similar results compared to using the subject-CT. The translational vector differences were within 1.08 mm (0.37 +/- 0.23 mm), and the rotational differences were within 1.1 degrees in all three directions. S-CT created from a simulation MR image using the proposed approach with the preconstructed atlas library can replace the planning CT for dose calculation and daily CBCT image guidance.
27167262	Using Daily Diagnostic Quality Images To validate Planning Margins for Inter-fractional Variations of Prostate Cancer.	The purpose of this study is to use the same diagnostic-quality verification and planning CTs to validate planning margin account for residual interfractional variations with image-guided soft tissue alignment of the prostate. For nine pros-tate cancer patients treated with IMRT to 78 Gy in 39 fractions, daily verification CT-on-rails images of the first seven and last seven fractions (n = 126) were retrospectively selected for this study. On these images, prostate, bladder, and rectum were delineated by the same attending physician. Clinical plans were cre-ated with a margin of 8 mm except for 5 mm posteriorly, referred to as 8/5mm. Three additional plans were created for each patient with the margins of 6/4 mm, 4/2mm, and 2 mm uniform. These plans were subsequently applied to daily images and radiation doses were recalculated. The isocenters of these plans were placed according to clinical online shifts, which were based on soft tissue alignment to the prostate. Retrospective offline shifts by aligning prostate contours were com-pared to online shifts. The resultant daily target dose was analyzed using D99, the percentage of the prescription dose received by 99% of CTV. The percent of blad-der volume receiving 65 Gy (V65Gy) and rectum V70Gy were also analyzed. After interfractional correction, using CTV D99 &gt; 97% criteria, 8/5 mm, 6/4 mm, 4/2 mm, and 2 mm planning margins met the CTV dose coverage in 95%, 91%, 65%, and 53% of the 126 fractions with online shifts, and 99%, 98%, 85%, and 68% with offline shifts. The rectum V70Gy and bladder V65Gy were significantly decreased at each level of margin reduction (p &lt; 0.05). With daily diagnostic quality imaging-guidance, the interfractional planning margin may be reduced from 8/5mm to 6/4 mm. The residual interfractional uncertainties most likely stem from prostate rotation anddeformation.
27167253	A comparison of organs at risk doses in GYN intracavitary brachytherapy for different tandem lengths and bladder volumes.	The purpose of this study was to investigate the concurrent effects of tandem length and bladder volume on dose to pelvic organs at risk (OARs) in HDR intracavitary brachytherapy treatment of cervical cancer. Twenty patients with locally advanced cervical cancer were selected for brachytherapy using Rotterdam applicators. The patients were CT scanned twice with empty and full bladder. Two treatment plans were prepared on each of the image sets. Patients were categorized into two groups; those treated with a tandem length of 4 cm or smaller (T </= 4 cm) and those with tandem length larger than 4 cm (T &gt; 4 cm). Only one tandem tip angle of 30 degrees was studied. Dose-volume histograms (DVHs) of OARs were calculated and compared. Bladder dose was significantly affected by both bladder volume and tandem physical length for T </= 4 cm. This was reflected on the values obtained for D2cm(3), D1cm(3), and D0.1cm(3) for both empty and full bladder cases. When T &gt; 4 cm, no correlation could be established between variations in bladder dose and blad-der volume. Rectum dose was generally lower when the bladder was empty and T &gt; 4 cm. Dose to sigmoid was increased when T &gt; 4 cm; this increase was larger when the bladder was full. Our results suggest that, for tandems longer than 4 cm, keeping the bladder empty may reduce the dose to rectum and sigmoid. This is contrary to cases where a shorter than 4 cm tandem is used in which a full bladder (about 50-120 cm(3)) tends to result in a lower dose to rectum and sigmoid. Attention should be given to doses to sigmoid with long tandem lengths, as a larger tandem generally results in a larger dose to sigmoid.
27165418	The current role of thiazolidinediones in diabetes management.	Among the epidemics of modern time, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is one of the main contributors to overall morbidity as well as mortality. A number of different treatment options are available for the management of diabetes. Among them thiazolidinediones (TZDs) is an interesting drug class since it does not target the result of T2DM, i.e., hyperglycemia but rather some of the core mechanisms of the disease. Indeed, glitazones increase insulin sensitivity by activating the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma, which plays an important role in regulating various metabolic parameters. Although TZDs have an established efficacy in T2DM treatment, their usage during the past years was questioned following the emergence of some alarming data regarding their safety and especially the cardiovascular safety of rosiglitazone. As a result, there is often some skepticism about the current role of TZDs in T2DM management. This mainly affects rosiglitazone even leading to its withdrawal from several markets in contrast to pioglitazone, which has shown a beneficial cardiovascular profile. A comprehensive assessment of the benefit-to-risk ratio of TZDs is required in order to better understand the place of these drugs in T2DM management.
27165237	Prevalence of Types of Cancers in the Elderly Covered by Insurance of the Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting Company in 2015 - Comparison with Younger Groups.	Presently, the world population of the elderly is growing. By improving health hygiene and welfare indicators, mortality and birth rates decrease and life expectancy increases, making the present century the century of elderly. Aging is one of the main risk factors for development of cancer, which itself is the second cause of death in old people. This study was conducted to assess the prevalence of cancer in the elderly covered by the Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting (IRIB) insurance program and to obtain suitable programs for cancer screening and early detection, increase patient survival, improve elderly care and to reclaim the cost of treatment in comparison to the national and international statistics. This is a cross-sectional study conducted on all elderly patients diagnosed with malignancy based on their pathology reports. In this study, of the total 75,500 patients covered by IRIB insurance, 17.2% belonged to the elderly group, males accounting for 53.3%. The most common cancers in old men were prostatic cancer (61.3%), colon cancer (10.3%) cancer of the hematologic system, bladder cancer (9.6%), lung cancer (9.1%), thyroid cancer (3.9%) and brain tumors (1.3%). In the elderly women, the most common cancers were breast cancer (80.1%), colon cancer (5.1%), thyroid cancers (4.4%), bladder and hematologic system malignancies (3.6), lung cancer (2.9%) and brain tumors (0.7%). In addition, the prevalence of cancer was almost the same as national and international statistics. With the exception of non-melanoma skin cancer no difference was shown in prevalence of cancer between IRIB elderly patients and the other groups of cancer patients in Iran.
27165205	Trends in Incidence of Common Cancers in Iran.	Cancer is a major public health problem in Iran. The aim of this study was to evaluate trends in incidence of ten common cancers in Iran, based on the national cancer registry reports from 2004 to 2009. This epidemiological study was carried out based on existing age-standardized estimate cancer data from the national report on cancer registry/Ministry of Health in Iran. The obtained data were analyzed by test for linear trend and P >/= 0.05 was taken as the significant level. Totals of 41,169 and 32,898 cases of cancer were registered in men and females, respectively, during these years. Overall age-standard incidence rates (ASRs) per 100,000 population according to primary site weres 125.6 and 113.4 in males and females, respectively. Between 2004 and 2009, the ten most common cancers (excluding skin cancer) were stomach (16.2), bladder (12.6), prostate (11), colon-rectum (10.14), hematopoeitic system (7.1), lung (6.1), esophagus (6.4), brain (3.2), lymph node (3.8) and larynx (3.4) in males; and in females were breast (27.4), colon-rectum (9.3), stomach (7.6), esophagus (6.4), hematopoeitic system (4.9), thyroid (3.9), ovary (3.6), corpus uteri (2.9), bladder (3.2) and lung (2.6). Moreover, results showed that skin cancer was estimated as the most common cancer in both sexes. The lowest and the highest incidence in females and males were reported respectively in 2004 and 2009. Over this period, the incidence of cancer in both sexes has been significantly increasing (p<0.01). Like other less developed and epidemiologically transitioning countries, the trend of age-standardized incidence rate of cancer in Iran is rising. Due to the increasing trends, the future burden of cancer in the Iran is going to be acute with the expected increases in aging populations. Determining and controlling potential risk factors of cancer should hopefully lead to decrease in its burden.
27164900	[(68)Ga]NODAGA-RGD - Metabolic stability, biodistribution, and dosimetry data from patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and liver cirrhosis.	PURPOSE: This study was designed to determine safety, tolerability, and radiation burden of a [(68)Ga]NODAGA-RGD-PET for imaging integrin alphavbeta3 expression in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and liver cirrhosis. Moreover, metabolic stability and biokinetic data were compiled. METHODS: After injection of 154-184 MBq [(68)Ga]NODAGA-RGD three consecutive PET/CT scans were acquired starting 8.3 +/- 2.1, 36.9 +/- 2.8, and 75.1 +/- 3.4 min after tracer injection. For metabolite analysis, blood and urine samples were analyzed by HPLC. For dosimetry studies, residence time VOIs were placed in the corresponding organs. The OLINDA/EXM program was used to estimate the absorbed radiation dose. RESULTS: The radiopharmaceutical was well tolerated and no drug-related adverse effects were observed. No metabolites could be detected in blood (30 and 60 min p.i.) and urine (60 min p.i.). [(68)Ga]NODAGA-RGD showed rapid and predominantly renal elimination. Background radioactivity in blood, intestine, lung, and muscle tissue was low (%ID/l 60 min p.i. was 0.56 +/- 0.43, 0.54 +/- 0.39, 0.22 +/- 0.05, and 0.16 +/- 0.8, respectively). The calculated effective dose was 21.5 +/- 5.4 muSv/MBq, and the highest absorbed radiation dose was found for the urinary bladder wall (0.26 +/- 0.09 mSv/MBq). No increased uptake of the tracer was found in HCC compared with the background liver tissue. CONCLUSIONS: [(68)Ga]NODAGA-RGD uptake in the HCCs lesions was not sufficient to use this tracer for imaging these tumors. [(68)Ga]NODAGA-RGD was well tolerated and metabolically stable. Due to rapid renal excretion, background radioactivity was low in most of the body, resulting in low radiation burden and indicating the potential of [(68)Ga]NODAGA-RGD PET for non-invasive determination of integrin alphavbeta3 expression.
27161431	Overall and recurrence-free survival among black and white bladder cancer patients in an equal-access health system.	BACKGROUND: While the incidence of bladder cancer is twice as high among whites than among blacks, mortality is higher among blacks than whites. Unequal access to medical care may be an important factor. Insufficient access to care could delay cancer detection and treatment, which can result in worse survival. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether survival differed between black and white bladder cancer patients in the Department of Defense (DoD), which provides universal healthcare to all beneficiaries regardless of racial background. METHODS: This study was based on data from the U.S. DoD Automated Central Tumor Registry (ACTUR). White and black patients histologically diagnosed with bladder cancer between 1990 and 2004 were included in the study and followed to the end of 2007. The outcomes were all-cause mortality and recurrence. We assessed the relationship between race and outcomes of interest using Cox proportional hazard ratios (HRs) for all, non-muscle invasive (NMIBC), and muscle invasive (MIBC) bladder cancers, separately. RESULTS: The survival of black and white individuals did not differ statistically. No significant racial differences in survival (HR: 0.96, 95% CI: 0.76-1.22) or recurrence-free survival (HR: 0.94, 95% CI: 0.69-1.30) were observed after adjustment for demographic variables, tumor characteristics, and treatment. Similar findings were observed for NMIBC and MIBC patients, respectively. CONCLUSION: Black patients were more likely to present with MIBC than white patients. However, white and black patients with bladder cancer were not significantly different in overall and recurrence-free survival regardless of muscle invasion. Our study suggests the importance of equal access to healthcare in reducing racial disparities in bladder cancer survival.
27160267	Comparison of Nerve-Sparing Radical Hysterectomy and Radical Hysterectomy: a Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.	BACKGROUND/AIMS: Radical hysterectomy (RH) for the treatment of cervical cancer frequently caused pelvic organ dysfunctions. This study aimed to compare the results of pelvic organ function and recurrence rate after Nerve sparing radical hysterectomy (NSRH) and RH treatment through systematic review and meta-analysis. METHODS: PubMed, Web of Science and China Knowledge Resource Integrated Database were searched from inception to 25 February 2015. Studies of cervical cancer which reported radical hysterectomy or nerve sparing radical hysterectomy were included. The quality of included studies was evaluated using the guidelines of Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. Statistical analysis was performed using Review Manager 5.3 software (Cochrane Collaboration). RESULTS: A total of 20 studies were finally included. Meta-analysis demonstrated that NSRH was associated with less bladder and anorectal dysfunction than RH. The time to bladder and anorectal function recovery after NSRH was shorter than RH. Patients undergoing NSRH also scored higher than patients undergoing RH at Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI). On the other hand, the local recurrence and overall recurrence rate were similar between NSRH and RH. CONCLUSION: NSRH may be an effective technique for lowering pelvic organ dysfunction and improving the function recovery without increasing the recurrence rate of cervical cancer.
27157988	Differences between a probable and proven BCG infection following intravesical instillations: 16 years experience in a tertiary care hospital.	BACKGROUND: Intravesical instillation of Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) is an efficient immunotherapy for superficial bladder cancer. BCG infection represents a major yet uncommon adverse event that occurs in 5-10% of the patients treated with BCG instillations, though the pathogenesis of this entity is not clear. METHODS: We report two cases of patients presented at our institution with BCG infection after instillation: one with microbiological BCG isolate and another without, and review all the medical records of patients instilled with BCG in our institution from 1996 until 2012, comparing patients with probable and proven BCG infection. RESULTS: During the study period, a total of 786 patients received BCG intravesical instillations. Of them, 31 (4%) patients had to suspend treatment because of adverse events and, specifically, 11 (1.3%) patients had to interrupt treatment because of suspected BCG infection. The incidence of BCG infection during our study period was 0.87 episodes per 1,000 instilled patients/year and 140 cases per 10,000 instilled patients. Of the 11 patients with suspected BCG infection, 7 (64%) had a probable BCG infection, while 4 (36%) patients had a proven BCG infection. All patients with a proven infection had a previous underlying condition, compared to a high proportion of patients with probable infection (57%) that did not present with underlying diseases. Common findings between both groups of patients were abnormal imaging studies and laboratory tests. Regarding treatment, 8 (73%) of the 11 patients with BCG infection received at least two first line drugs active against M. bovis (isoniazid, rifampicin or ethambutol), four patients (36%) received steroids as part of the treatment and curation was obtained in 10 (91%) patients, while 1 patient with a proven infection had a death related to BCG infection. CONCLUSIONS: We can conclude that BCG infection after intravesical instillations has a low incidence in our institution. Patients with previous underlying conditions seem to have more proven infections. A high proportion of patients do not yield positive microbiological tests; in those cases the diagnosis relies in clinical, radiological and laboratory findings. Treatment for BCG infection should include at least two active drugs against M. bovis and coadjuvant steroid treatment for systemic BCG infections.
27157921	[The W-shaped ileal neobladder: Long term functional outcomes and health-related quality of life].	PURPOSE: To evaluate functional outcomes and patients' health-related quality of life over ten years after a W-shaped ileal neobladder urinary diversion. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From 1994 to 2004, 87 patients with bladder cancer underwent a cystoprostatectomy with a W-shaped ileal neobladder. Among them, 31 patients (35.6%) were evaluated. The average follow-up was 158months, average age was 72years. We assessed functional outcomes (use of protections, USP score, uroflowmetry, postvoid residual volume), overall health-related quality of life (SF-36 score), and specific urinary-related quality of life (Ditrovie scale). RESULTS: Daytime continence was satisfactory in 29 patients (96.8%). Night-time continence was satisfactory in 27 patients (87.1%). Mean daytime continence, hyperactivity and dysuria scores of the USP were respectively 1.5/9, 3.2/21 and 2/9. Mean value of the maximum flow rate was 18mL/s for an average voiding volume of 324mL and an average postvoid residual volume of 70mL. The 8 dimensions of the SF-36 were all comparable with the French population's values. According to the Ditrovie scale whose average value was 1.83, the health-related quality of life was unchanged or little changed by urinary disorders in 28 patients (90.3%). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that voiding status and health-related quality of life remain satisfactory over ten years after an orthotopic ileal neobladder derivation. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 5.
27156320	Improved Noninvasive Bladder Cancer Diagnosis using Urine Sediments and Novel DNA Methylation Biomarker Panels.	BACKGROUND: Aberrant DNA methylation status early in carcinogenesis represents a potential indicator of tumor detection. We would like to establish a DNA methylation biomarker panel for bladder cancer detection in the research. METHODS: Seven candidate genes with known cancer associations were selected for this study. The DNA methylation status of the candidate genes was analyzed by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction assays to evaluate the relationship between bladder cancer and target gene methylation status in the urine sediments of participants. RESULTS: 112 bladder cancer patients, 10 healthy volunteers, and 17 glandular cystitis patients were enrolled. There were significant differences in the methylation status of p14ARF, RUNX3, RARbeta, DAPK, and HPP1 between the healthy control, glandular cystitis, and bladder cancer groups (p = 0.027, p < 0.001, p < 0.001, p = 0.030 and p = 0.003, respectively). A panel composed of all five genes with significant methylation differences yielded an area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.936 and had 98.21% sensitivity and 88.89% specificity, while a panel using just two of these genes (RUNX3 and RARP) yielded an AUC of 0.918 with 96.64% sensitivity and 88.89% specificity. Another panel of two genes (p14ARF and HPP1) had 100% specificity, but an AUC of 0.688 and 37.50% sensitivity. CONCLUSIONS: Using the urine of bladder cancer patients and healthy controls, we assessed several novel DNA methylation biomarker panels that demonstrated good bladder cancer detection capability. Based on the results of this study we recommend the RUNX3 and RARbeta panel as the first choice for bladder cancer detection. In suspicious or difficult to diagnose cases, the p14ARF and HPP1 panel could be used as an additional diagnostic tool due to its high specificity.
27153944	Effects of social support, hope and resilience on quality of life among Chinese bladder cancer patients: a cross-sectional study.	BACKGROUND: Improvement of quality of life has been one of goals in health care for people living with bladder cancer. Meanwhile, positive psycho-social variables in oncology field have increasingly received attention. However, the assessment of quality of life of bladder cancer patients and the integrative effects of positive psycho-social variables has limited reporting. The aim of this study was to assess quality of life as well as the integrative effects of social support, hope and resilience on quality of life among Chinese bladder cancer patients. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted at the First Hospital of China Medical University in Liaoning Province, China. A total of 365 bladder cancer patients eligible for this study completed questionnaires on demographic variables, FACT-BL, Perceived Social Support Scale, Adult Hope Scale, and Resilience Scale-14 during July 2013 to July 2014. RESULTS: The average score of FACT-BL was 87.60 +/- 16.27 (Mean +/- SD). Hierarchical regression analyses indicated that social support, hope and resilience as a whole accounted for 30.3 % variance of quality of life. Under standardized estimate (beta) sequence, social support, hope and resilience significantly and positively associated with quality of life, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Quality of life for bladder cancer patients was at a low level in China, which should receive more attention in Chinese medical institutions. More importantly, efforts to increase social support, hope and resilience might be useful to support the quality of life among Chinese bladder cancer patients.
27149501	Unique Case Report of Pineal Gland Metastasis From Bladder Carcinoma.	Pineal metastasis is uncommon and most metastatic pineal lesions are asymptomatic. To our knowledge the herein reported case is the first in which the pineal gland was confirmed as the metastatic site of a bladder carcinoma.The patient reported in this case is a 59-year-old man who suffered from headache and delirium for 4 days after surgical treatment for removal of a bladder carcinoma 1 year ago. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a solid tumor involving the pineal gland with significant enhancement.The patient underwent surgical treatment for removal of the neoplastic lesion in the pineal gland. Histopathological examination confirmed invasion of the pineal gland by metastatic urothelial carcinoma.This case highlighted that the presence of pineal lesions in patient with known malignancy should raise suspicion of metastatic involvement.
27149447	Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia and the Risk of Prostate Cancer and Bladder Cancer: A Meta-Analysis of Observational Studies.	Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) has been suggested to be a risk factor for certain urologic cancers, but the current evidence is inconsistent.The aim of this study was to investigate the association between BPH and urologic cancers.MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science were searched for potential eligible studies.We included case-control studies or cohort studies, which evaluated the association between BPH and urologic cancers (including prostate cancer, bladder cancer, kidney cancer, testicular cancer, or penile cancer).Overall effect estimates were calculated using the DerSimonian-Laird method for a random-effects model. Summary effect-size was calculated as risk ratio (RR), together with the 95% confidence interval (CI).This systematic review included 16 case-control studies and 10 cohort studies evaluating the association of BPH and prostate or bladder cancer; we did not identify any study about other urologic cancers. Meta-analyses demonstrated that BPH was associated with an increased incidence of prostate cancer (case-control study: RR = 3.93, 95% CI = 2.18-7.08; cohort-study: RR = 1.41, 95% CI = 1.00-1.99) and bladder cancer (case-control study: RR = 2.50, 95% CI = 1.63-3.84; cohort-study: RR = 1.58, 95% CI = 1.28-1.95). Subgroup analysis by ethnicity suggested that the association between BPH and prostate cancer was much stronger in Asians (RR = 6.09, 95% CI = 2.96-12.54) than in Caucasians (RR = 1.54, 95% CI = 1.19-2.01). Egger's tests indicated low risk of publication bias (prostate cancer: P = 0.11; bladder cancer: P = 0.95).BPH is associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer and bladder cancer. The risk of prostate cancer is particularly high in Asian BPH patients. Given the limitations of included studies, additional prospective studies with strict design are needed to confirm our findings.
27149655	Chemotherapeutic potential of quercetin on human bladder cancer cells.	In an effort to improve local bladder cancer control, we investigated the cytotoxic and genotoxic effects of quercetin on human bladder cancer T24 cells. The cytotoxic effect of quercetin against T24 cells was examined by MTT test, clonogenic assay as well as DNA damaging effect by comet assay. In addition, the cytotoxic effect of quercetin on the primary culture of papillary urothelial carcinoma (PUC), histopathological stage T1 of low- or high-grade tumours, was investigated. Our analysis demonstrated a high correlation between reduced number of colony and cell viability and an increase in DNA damage of T24 cells incubated with quercetin at doses of 1 and 50 microM during short term incubation (2 h). At all exposure times (24, 48 and 72 h), the efficacy of quercetin, administered at a 10x higher dose compared to T24 cells, was statistically significant (P < 0.05) for the primary culture of PUC. In conclusion, our study suggests that quercetin could inhibit cell proliferation and colony formation of human bladder cancer cells by inducing DNA damage and that quercetin may be an effective chemopreventive and chemotherapeutic agent for papillary urothelial bladder cancer after transurethral resection.
27149545	Association between selected dietary scores and the risk of urothelial cell carcinoma: A prospective cohort study.	Studies investigating the association of food and nutrient consumption with the risk of urothelial cell carcinoma (UCC) have produced mixed results. We used three common dietary scores, the Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS), the Alternate Healthy Eating Index 2010 (AHEI-2010) and the Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII) to assess the evidence of an association between diet and the risk of UCC. Over a median follow-up time of 21.3 years, 379 incident UCC cases were diagnosed. Dietary scores were calculated using data from a 121-item food frequency questionnaire administered at baseline. We used Cox models to compute hazard ratios (HR) for the association between dietary scores (per one standard deviation) and UCC risk. In order to reflect overall adherence to a healthy diet, a metascore was constructed by summing the quintiles of each of the three scores. None of the dietary scores was associated with the risk of UCC overall. A healthier diet was found to be inversely associated with the risk of invasive (MDS: HR = 0.86, 95% CI: 0.74-1.00, metascore: HR = 0.84, 95% CI: 0.71-0.98), but not superficial disease (heterogeneity between subtypes p = 0.04 and p = 0.03, respectively). Results were consistent but weaker for the DII and the AHEI-2010. We found some evidence of effect modification by smoking, in particular for the metascore (Current: HR = 0.77, 95% CI: 0.58-1.01, Former: HR = 0.77, 95% CI: 0.64-0.92, Never: HR = 1.01, 95% CI: 0.81-1.26, p for heterogeneity = 0.05). A healthy diet may be protective against the risk of invasive, but not superficial, UCC. Promoting healthy dietary habits may help lower the risk of invasive UCC, especially for current and former smokers.
27146766	Radiation therapy outcomes in muscle invasive urinary bladder cancer: A single institution experience.	INTRODUCTION: To audit the survival outcomes and loco-regional control in muscle invasive urinary bladder cancer patients treated with external beam radiation therapy (RT). MATERIALS AND METHODS: From November 2008 through December 2011, 50 consecutively diagnosed muscle invasive urinary bladder carcinoma (T2-4a N0-2, M0) patients were included in this retrospective study. All these patients received external beam RT to a median dose of 60 Gy (range 30-66 Gy), and were not suitable for radical surgery due to patients' preference or medical comorbidities. A stepwise procedure using proportional hazard regression was used to identify prognostic factors with respect to survival. RESULTS: Completion trans-urethral resection of bladder tumor was done in 38 (76%) patients of the cohort and 47 (94%) had transitional cell carcinoma on histopathology. Clinical stage T2 was diagnosed in 40 (80%) patients. The median follow-up for the entire cohort was 14 +/- 8.9 months (range 1-36 months). In conclusion, 24 patients (48%) were free of disease, 5 patients (10%) had residual disease, and 13 patients (26%) had died of disease. Two-year and 3 year overall survival of intact bladder for the entire cohort was 58% and 43.6%, respectively. Cox regression modeling strongly suggested clinical stage (P = 0.01) and RT dose (P = 0.001) as being predictors for overall survival. CONCLUSION: RT shows reliable outcomes and excellent compliance in this advanced disease. Prescribing a higher RT dose could potentially correlate to better intact bladder control rates while maintaining good quality of life in selected patients.
27146066	Multidetector CT imaging features of invasive renal parenchyma urothelial carcinoma.	OBJECTIVE: To characterize the multidetector CT imaging features of invasive renal parenchyma urothelial carcinoma (IRPUC). METHODS: 29 patients with IRPUC were retrospectively evaluated. Tumour location, density, cystic or solid appearance, calcification, capsule sign, enhancement pattern and metastases were assessed. RESULTS: IRPUC involved the right kidney in 82.7% of patients. Medullary involvement was observed in 93.1% of patients. In 89.6% of patients, the reniform contour of the kidney was preserved. Tumours showed an infiltrative appearance (100%) with a poorly defined margin (100%), but an expansile component was also present (20.7%). Linear calcification was present (20.7%). Evidence of intra-abdominal metastatic disease (in 37.9% of cases) and regional lymphadenopathy (in 27.5% of cases) was present. Tumour attenuation was less or equal compared with the renal cortex or medulla on unenhanced CT (p-value> 0.05), after i.v. contrast administration; 100% were of homogeneous low attenuation compared with the normal renal cortex and medulla (p-value< 0.05). CONCLUSION: IRPUC tends to be more prevalent in the right kidney, poorly defined margin, medullary involvement, with homogeneous enhancement less than the cortex and medulla in all phases. ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: IRPUC was more prevalent in the right kidney. IRPUC enhancement was less than that of the cortex and medulla on all phases. IRPUC showed poorly defined margin with medullary involvement and preserved reniform contour.
27145164	Prospective MRI-based imaging study to assess feasibility of proton therapy for post-prostatectomy radiation.	PURPOSE/OBJECTIVES: To optimize delivery of post-prostatectomy radiation (PPRT) with protons by examining dosimetric effects of variations in physician contouring, organ motion, and patient alignment during a course of PPRT. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We enrolled 10 patients receiving PPRT in a prospective imaging study. All patients underwent combined computed tomography (CT)/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) simulation with endorectal balloon (ERB) and received intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) per institutional standards. Study patients underwent weekly MRI verification scans in the treatment position. Three radiation oncologists contoured clinical target volumes (CTV) on initial and verification scans using two consensus guidelines (RTOG and EORTC). We generated IMRT, double scattering (DS), and pencil beam scanning (PBS) proton plans and examined the dosimetric impact of contour variations, inter-fraction motion, and patient alignment techniques. RESULTS: Inter-observer variations in contouring reduced median CTV coverage (D100) by 0.9% for IMRT plans, 2.8% for DS proton plans, 3.4-4.9% for PBS Proton Plans. Inter-fraction changes in target volumes due to internal organ motion resulted in a median loss of target dose coverage (D98) of 0% with IMRT, 3.5% with DS, and 8.1-8.3% with PBS. Median bladder V65Gy increased during the treatment course with all techniques (6.0-7.5%). Changes in the median rectal V60Gy remained small regardless of the treatment technique (0.5-3.1% increase). Alignment to the ERB after cranio-caudal bony alignment reduced CTV displacement compared to bony alignment alone, and as a result CTV coverage (D98) changed <2% with IMRT, DS, and PBS. CONCLUSION: Proton-based treatments are more sensitive to changes in inter-fraction organ motion during PPRT compared to IMRT, and therefore motion management and patient alignment methods are critical. Patient alignment using bony anatomy as well as the ERB minimizes displacement of the CTV, and reduces variation in target dose coverage particularly for PBS proton therapy.
27143856	Autophagy inhibition enhances RAD001-induced cytotoxicity in human bladder cancer cells.	BACKGROUND: Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), involved in PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, is known to play a central role in regulating the growth of cancer cells. The PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway enhances tumor survival and proliferation through suppressing autophagy, which sustains energy homeostasis by collecting and recycling cellular components under stress conditions. Conversely, inhibitors of the mTOR pathway such as RAD001 induce autophagy, leading to promotion of tumor survival and limited antitumor efficacy. We thus hypothesized that the use of autophagy inhibitor in combination with mTOR inhibition improves the cytotoxicity of mTOR inhibitors in bladder cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The cytotoxicity of RT4, 5637, HT1376, and T24 human bladder cancer cells treated with RAD001 alone or combined with autophagy inhibitors (3-methyladenine (3-MA), bafilomycin A1 (Baf A1), chloroquine, or hydroxychloroquine) was assessed using the WST-8 cell viability kit. The autophagy status in cells was analyzed by the detection of microtubule-associated light chain 3 form II (LC3-II), using immunofluorescent staining and Western blot. Acidic vesicular organelle (AVO) formation in treated cells was determined by acridine orange vital staining. Inhibition of mTOR pathway by RAD001 was monitored by using a homemade quantitative polymerase chain reaction gene array, while phospho-mTOR was detected using Western blot. Induced apoptosis was determined by measurement of caspase 3/7 activity and DNA fragmentation in cells after treatment. RESULTS: Advanced bladder cancer cells (5637, HT1376, and T24) were more resistant to RAD001 than RT4. Autophagy flux detected by the expression of LC3-II showed RAD001-induced autophagy. AVO formation was detected in cells treated with RAD001 and was inhibited by the addition of 3-MA or Baf A1. Cotreatment of RAD001 with autophagy inhibitors further reduced cell viability and induced apoptosis in bladder cancer cells. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that simultaneous inhibition of the mTOR and autophagy pathway significantly enhances apoptosis, and it is suggested to be a new therapeutic paradigm for the treatment of bladder cancer.
27142819	Whyever bladder tissue engineering clinical applications still remain unusual even though many intriguing technological advances have been reached?	To prevent problematic outcomes of bowel-based bladder reconstructive surgery, such as prosthetic tumors and systemic metabolic complications, research works, to either regenerate and strengthen failing organ or build organ replacement biosubstitute, have been turned, from 90s of the last century, to both regenerative medicine and tissue engineering.Various types of acellular matrices, naturally-derived materials, synthetic polymers have been used for either "unseeded" (cell free) or autologous "cell seeded" tissue engineering scaffolds. Different categories of cell sources - from autologous differentiated urothelial and smooth muscle cells to natural or laboratory procedure-derived stem cells - have been taken into consideration to reach the construction of suitable "cell seeded" templates. Current clinically validated bladder tissue engineering approaches essentially consist of augmentation cystoplasty in patients suffering from poorly compliant neuropathic bladder. No clinical applications of wholly tissue engineered neobladder have been carried out to radical-reconstructive surgical treatment of bladder malignancies or chronic inflammation-due vesical coarctation. Reliable reasons why bladder tissue engineering clinical applications so far remain unusual, particularly imply the risk of graft ischemia, hence its both fibrous contraction and even worse perforation. Therefore, the achievement of graft vascular network (vasculogenesis) could allow, together with the promotion of host surrounding vessel sprouting (angiogenesis), an effective graft blood supply, so avoiding the ischemia-related serious complications.
27136670	Arsenic in drinking water and prostate cancer in Illinois counties: An ecologic study.	BACKGROUND: Inorganic arsenic is a lung, bladder, and skin carcinogen. One of the major sources of exposure to arsenic is through naturally contaminated drinking water. While positive associations have been observed between arsenic in drinking water and prostate cancer, few studies have explored this association in the United States. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the association between inorganic arsenic concentrations in community water systems and prostate cancer incidence in Illinois using an ecologic study design. METHODS: Illinois Environmental Protection Agency data on arsenic concentrations in drinking water from community water systems throughout the state were linked with county-level prostate cancer incidence data from 2007 to 2011 from the Illinois State Cancer Registry. Incidence rates were indirectly standardized by age to calculate standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) for each county. A Poisson regression model was used to model the association between county-level SIRs and mean arsenic tertile (0.33-0.72, 0.73-1.60, and 1.61-16.23ppb), adjusting for potential confounders. RESULTS: For counties with mean arsenic levels in the second tertile, the SIR was 1.05 (95% CI: 0.96-1.16). For counties with mean arsenic levels in the third tertile, the SIR was 1.10 (95% CI: 1.03-1.19). There was a significant linear dose-response relationship observed between mean arsenic levels and prostate cancer incidence (p for trend=0.003). CONCLUSIONS: In this ecologic study, counties with higher mean arsenic levels in community water systems had significantly higher prostate cancer incidence. Individual-level studies of prostate cancer incidence and low-level arsenic exposure are needed.
27136464	Are we following the guidelines on non-muscle invasive bladder cancer?	OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical practice of non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) treatment in Brazil in relation to international guidelines: Sociedade Brasileira de Urologia (SBU), European Association of Urology (EAU) and American Urological Association (AUA). METHODS: Cross-sectional study using questionnaires about urological practice on treatment of NMIBC during the 32nd Brazilian Congress of Urology. A total of 650 question forms were answered. RESULTS: There were 73% of complete answers (total of 476 question forms). In total, 246 urologists (51.68%) lived in the southeast region and 310 (65.13%) treat 1 to 3 cases of NMIBC per month. Low risk cancer: Only 35 urologists (7.5%) apply the single intravesical dose of immediate chemotherapy with Mitomicin C recommended by the above guidelines. Adjuvant therapy with BCG 2 to 4 weeks after TUR is used by 167 participants (35.1%) and 271 urologists (56.9%) use only TUR. High risk tumors: 397 urologists (83.4%) use adjuvant therapy, 375 (78.8%) use BCG 2 to 4 weeks after TUR, of which 306 (64.3%) referred the use for at least one year. Intravesical chemotherapy with Mitomicin C (a controversial recommendation) was used by 22 urologists (4.6%). BCG dose raised a lot of discrepancies. Induction doses of 40, 80 and 120mg were referred by 105 (22%), 193 (40.4%) and 54 (11.3%) respectively. Maintenance doses of 40, 80 and 120mg were referred by 190 (48.7%), 144 (37.0%) and 32 (8.2%) urologists, respectively. Schemes of administration were also varied and the one cited by SWOG protocol was the most used: 142 (29.8%). CONCLUSIONS: SBU, EAU and AUA guidelines are partially respected by Brazilian urologists, particularly in low risk tumors. In high risk tumors, concordance rates are comparable to international data. Further studies are necessary to fully understand the reasons of such disagreement.
27133887	[A Subcutaneous Metastasis from Renal Pelvic Carcinoma Growing Rapidly after radical Nephrectomy : A Case Report].	A 78-year-old man was admitted to our department for a right renal mass detected by computed tomography which was accompanied by right hypochondriac pain. Dynamic computed tomography demonstrated a 7cm hypovascular right renal mass invading the liver. No metastatic disease was evident. Transabdominal nephrectomy and partial hepatectomy were performed under the diagnosis of right renal cell carcinoma in July 2014. Pathological examination revealed right renal pelvic carcinoma with liver invasion. After the operation, a subcutaneous nodule in the right forearm rapidly grew in one week. A needle biopsy revealed that it was a metastasis of the urothelial carcinoma. Additionally, lung metastases and lymph node swelling were detected. The patient received two courses of combination chemotherapy (gemcitabine, carboplatin) in August 2014. The subcutaneous metastasis was decreased, but it was not effective for other metastases. Two courses of another combination chemotherapy (methotrexate, vinblastine, epirubicin, calboplatin) were performed. It was effective for all metastatic lesions. During the third course, the patient developed melancholia and rejected additional therapy. He died in March 2015 due to disease progression.
27133288	Discovery of urine biomarkers for bladder cancer via global metabolomics.	Bladder cancer (BC) is latent in its early stage and lethal in its late stage. Therefore, early diagnosis and intervention are essential for successful BC treatment. Considering the limitations of current diagnostic tools, noninvasive biomarkers that are both highly sensitive and specific are needed to improve the overall survival and quality of life of patients. With the advent of systems biology, "-omics" technologies have been developed over the past few decades. As a promising member, global metabolomics has increasingly been found to have clear potential for biomarker discovery. However, urinary metabolomics studies related to BC have lagged behind those of other urinary cancers, and major findings have not been systematically reported. The objective of this review is to comprehensively list the currently identified potential urinary metabolite biomarkers for BC.
27133066	MiR-194 inhibits cell proliferation and invasion via repression of RAP2B in bladder cancer.	Bladder cancer is the 7th most common cancer type in the world, and microRNAs (miRNAs) play important roles in cancer progression. In the present study, we investigated the roles and molecular mechanisms of miR-194 in bladder cancer. The results demonstrated that the expression level of miR-194 is significantly down-regulated in bladder cancer cell lines and clinical tissues. Overexpression of miR-194 inhibited cell proliferation and invasion in J82 and T24 cells. Further mechanistic study showed that overexpression of miR1-94 induced G0/G1 phase arrest as well as apoptosis in J82 and T24 cells. In addition, by using bioinformatics tool (Targetscan), RAP2B is found to be a target of miR-194, and miR-194 down-regulates the expression level of RAP2B via directly targeting its 3'UTR. Knockdown of RAP2B also inhibited cell proliferation and invasion in J28 cells. More importantly, restoration of RAP2B activity rescued the inhibitory effects of miR-194 on cell proliferation and invasion in J82 cells. Further analysis of bladder cancer clinical samples showed that miR-194 is inversely correlated with RAP2B. Collectively, our study may implicate that miR-194 plays an important role in the regulation of bladder cancer progression. In summary, our study may implicate that miR-194 acts as a tumor suppressor and plays an important role in the regulation of bladder cancer progression.
27129876	p53 status correlates with the risk of progression in stage T1 bladder cancer: a meta-analysis.	BACKGROUND: Published studies have yielded inconsistent results on the relationship between p53 status and the progression of stage T1 non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). Therefore, we performed a meta-analysis to evaluate the prognostic value of p53 in T1 NMIBC. METHODS: We systematically searched for relevant literatures in MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Web of Science. Data were pooled together from individual studies, and meta-analysis was performed. Study quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Pooled risk ratios (RRs) and 95% CI were calculated to estimate the effect sizes. Moreover, subgroup analyses were carried out. RESULTS: A total of 12 studies comprising 712 patients were subjected to the final analysis. p53 overexpression was significantly associated with higher progression rate of T1 NMIBC (RR 2.32, 95% CI 1.59-3.38). Moderate heterogeneity was observed across the studies (I(2) = 39%, P < 0.0001). In a subgroup analysis stratified by stage, p53 overexpression was a predictor of progression in T1 grade 3 NMIBC (RR 2.71, 95% CI 1.31-5.64). In addition, in a subgroup analysis stratified by intravesical therapy, p53 overexpression was a predictor of progression in T1 NMIBC received Bacillus Calmette-Guerin intravesical therapy (RR 3.35, 95% CI 1.89-5.93). Furthermore, after excluding the study that possibly contributed to the heterogeneity by the sensitivity analysis, the association p53 overexpression was significantly correlated with progression of T1 NMIBC (RR 2.74, 95% CI 2.05-3.65) without evidence of heterogeneity (I(2) = 0 %, P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis suggested that p53 overexpression may be associated with progression of T1 NMIBC patients. Because of the heterogeneity and other limitations, further studies with rigid criteria and large populations are still warranted to confirm our findings.
27128438	The Associations of Psychological Stress with Depressive and Anxiety Symptoms among Chinese Bladder and Renal Cancer Patients: The Mediating Role of Resilience.	BACKGROUND: The prevalence of depressive and anxiety symptoms and their associated factors in bladder and renal cancer patients are not well evaluated in China. Given the growing attention to positive psychological constructs in the field of oncology, it is necessary to explore the effects of these constructs on depressive and anxiety symptoms. This study aims to explore the associations of psychological stress with depressive and anxiety symptoms among Chinese bladder and renal cancer patients and the mediating role of resilience in these relationships. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted at the First Affiliated Hospital of China Medical University in Liaoning province. 327 bladder cancer patients and 268 renal cancer patients completed questionnaires on demographic variables, the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, Zung Self-Rating Anxiety Scale, Resilience Scale-14, and Perceived Stress Scale-10 during the period from July 2013 to July 2014. Hierarchical linear regression analyses were performed to explore the mediating role of resilience. RESULTS: The prevalence of depressive and anxiety symptoms was 78.0% and 71.3% in bladder cancer patients, and 77.6% and 68.3% in renal cancer patients. Psychological stress was positively related to depressive and anxiety symptoms, while resilience was negatively related to these symptoms. Resilience partially mediated the relations of psychological stress with depressive and anxiety symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: The high prevalence of depressive and anxiety symptoms among Chinese bladder and renal cancer patients should receive more attention from medical institutions and government agencies. In addition to reducing depressive and anxiety symptoms, resilience development should be included in depression and anxiety prevention and treatment strategies in China.
27126668	Thyroid metastasis of bladder transitional cell carcinoma.	The thyroid gland is a rare site for cancer metastasis. We report a 75-year-old man who was referred with a history of hematuria and generalized bone pain for the past few months. He had a past history of partial left lobe thyroidectomy for follicular adenoma. Subsequently he was referred for a thyroid mass and a subtotal thyroidectomy showed a poorly-differentiated carcinoma. On the latest admission, the patient underwent resection of a bladder tumour with malignant histology and an immunohistochemical profile of CK7+/CK20+/34 Beta E12+/CEA-/PSA-. Re-examination of thyroid sections with immunohistochemical stains revealed the malignant cells to be CK7+/CK20+/34 Beta E12+/CEA-/TTF1-. The findings were compatible with metastasis of the bladder transitional cell carcinoma to the thyroid gland.Scans revealed multiple liver and bone metastases. The patient died 2 months after the diagnosis.
27125653	Gastrointestinal Complications in Patients Who Undergo Radical Cystectomy with Enhanced Recovery Protocol.	Gastrointestinal (GI) complications are among the most common complications following radical cystectomy and urinary diversion. The most common is postoperative ileus, although its precise pathophysiology is not completely understood. Enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) protocols include evidence-based steps to optimize postoperative recovery and shorten hospital stay, mainly through expedited GI function recovery. They include avoiding bowel preparation and postoperative nasogastric tube, early feeding, non-narcotic pain management, and the use of cholinergic and mu-receptor opioid antagonists. We reviewed the literature in regard to GI complications using enhanced recovery protocols and share our institutional experience with over 300 patients.
27124920	Can We Identify Nephrogenic Adenoma in Urine Cytology Specimens? A Study Evaluating Previously Described Cytomorphologic Features in Correlation With PAX8 Immunohistochemical Staining Results.	OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study is to determine if the diagnosis of nephrogenic adenoma (NA) can be made on cytologic criteria alone and if pair box gene transcription factor 8 (PAX8) is useful in the diagnosis of NA in daily cytology practice. METHODS: Cytologic features of NA previously described in a literature were used to identify NA cells in urinary specimens. Subsequently, all cytology and corresponding biopsy specimens were stained with the PAX8 immunohistochemistry stain. The stains were examined; the results were tabulated. RESULTS: A total of 44 specimens were reviewed (35 with corresponding biopsy specimens diagnosed as NA and nine negative for NA diagnosis on corresponding biopsy specimens). Of them, 14 demonstrated features previously described as NA. None of atypical cells that were morphologically suspicious for NA showed positive staining, whereas all of the corresponding biopsy sections demonstrated nuclear PAX8 positivity. Only rare lymphocytes present in cytology specimens showed nuclear staining with PAX8. CONCLUSIONS: Assuming that the results of the PAX8 stain performed are accurate at least in most cases, as suggested by the presence of internal positive controls, our study shows that the previously described cytologic features of NA cannot be used as diagnostic criteria, since they are not characteristic for this entity.
27123757	Recent advances in immuno-oncology and its application to urological cancers.	Recent advances in immuno-oncology have the potential to transform the practice of medical oncology. Antibodies directed against negative regulators of T-cell function (checkpoint inhibitors), engineered cell therapies and innate immune stimulators, such as oncolytic viruses, are effective in a wide range of cancers. Immune'based therapies have had a clinically meaningful impact on the treatment of advanced melanoma, and the lessons regarding use of single agents and combinations in melanoma may be applicable to the treatment of urological cancers. Checkpoint inhibitors, cytokine therapy and therapeutic vaccines are already showing promise in urothelial bladder cancer, renal cell carcinoma and prostate cancer. Critical areas of future immuno-oncology research include the prospective identification of patients who will respond to current immune-based cancer therapies and the identification of new therapeutic agents that promote immune priming in tumours, and increase the rate of durable clinical responses.
27122461	[Selective bladder preservation in muscle-invasive bladder cancer by transurethral resection combined with intravesical instillation therapy: analysis of clinical effect in the elderly].	OBJECTIVE: To explore the therapeutic effect and quality of life in elderly patients of muscle-invasive bladder cancer by transurethral resection combined with intravesical instillation therapy. METHODS: From January 2005 to January 2015, 136 cases were diagnosed with T2 bladder cancer by transurethralplasmakinetic therapy or transurethral laser therapy. The data of 136 cases were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: In transurethralplasmakinetic therapy group, the overall survival rate was 73.3%, the cancer-specific survival rate was 85.6%, the average survival time were 65 months. In transurethral laser therapy group, the overall survival rate was 73.9%, the cancer-specific survivalrate was 87.2%, the average survival time were 70 months. Two methods also can improve the patient's quality of life. CONCLUSION: For the aged with invasive bladder cancer (T2), we could try the transurethral resection combined with intravesical instillation therapy.
27121034	Cytopathological features of villous adenoma of the urinary bladder in urine: A rare case report.	Villous adenoma of the urinary bladder is a rare tumor that histologically mimics its enteric counterpart. Patients with an isolated villous adenoma have an excellent prognosis, but associated adenocarcinomas can frequently be identified in them as well. There is no literature that discusses the cytopathologic features of villous adenoma. Here we report a case which was diagnosed as villous adenoma histologically, which has been followed up with urine cytology. In urine cytology, many mucin producing cells are recognized. Few cell clusters show glandular formation or arrangement along the basement membrane. When glandular cells with columnar mucin-filled goblet cells are seen in urine cytology, the presence of a primary glandular lesion of the urinary bladder, such as villous adenoma, should be considered possible.

27118199	Risk factors for malignancy in systemic sclerosis patients.	Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is an autoimmune connective tissue disease with multisystem involvement. An increased incidence of cancer in SSc patients compared with the general population has been reported in several reports. Our aims in this study were to determine the most common malignancies and to investigate the possible risk factors for the development of malignancy in patients with SSc. Three hundred forty SSc patients from 13 centers were included to the study. Data of the patients were obtained by evaluating their medical records retrospectively. A total of 340 patients with SSc were evaluated. Twenty-five of the patients had 19 different types of malignancy. Bladder cancer was the most common type of cancer with four patients and was followed by breast cancer with three patients, and cervix cancer and ovarian cancer with two patients each. Other types of cancers such as squamous cell skin cancer, adenocancer with an unknown origin, multiple myeloma, chronic myeloid leukemia, papillary thyroid cancer, larynx cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, follicular type non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), endometrium cancer, colon cancer, uterus cancer, neuroendocrine tumor, glioblastoma multiforme, and soft tissue sarcoma were diagnosed in one patient each. The only cancer type that showed an association with cyclophosphamide dose was bladder carcinoma. Other malignancies did not show a correlation with age, sex, smoking, type and duration of the disease, autoantibodies, organ involvement, and dose and duration of cyclophosphamide therapy. Cancer may develop in any organ in patients with SSc. Continuous screening of the patients during a follow-up period is necessary for the early detection of the tumor development.
27111904	The State of Immune Checkpoint Inhibition in Urothelial Carcinoma: Current Evidence and Future Areas of Exploration.	Immune checkpoint inhibition will be the first treatment breakthrough in recurrent and metastatic urothelial carcinoma since the introduction of combination chemotherapy more than 30 years ago. Monoclonal antibodies that target cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4, programmed death receptor 1, and programmed death receptor ligand 1 are furthest along in clinical development. Specific antibodies targeting either programmed death receptor 1 or programmed death receptor ligand 1 have demonstrated significant single-agent activity with impressive safety and tolerability for heavily pretreated patients in early-phase clinical trials. In our review, we discuss the rationale for immunotherapy in urothelial cancer, completed and ongoing studies with immune checkpoint therapy, the development of molecular subtypes of urothelial carcinoma with the potential impact of immunotherapy in these new groupings, and future directions of exploration with these agents in both early- and late-stage disease.
27110721	Analysis and Management of Rectal Gas with Kampo Formulas During Intensity-Modulated Radiotherapy of Prostate Cancer: A Case Series Study.	OBJECTIVES: During intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) for prostate cancer, the target, bladder, and rectum positions should be kept constant to reduce adverse events, such as radiation proctitis, and to increase local tumor control. For this purpose, decreasing the rectal contents as much as possible is important. Daisaikoto (DST) and bukuryoingohangekobokuto (BIHKT) are traditional Japanese herbal (Kampo) formulas that have been used to treat patients with abdominal bloating or constipation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study investigated the effect of DST and BIHKT on the rectal gas volume during prostate IMRT according to Kampo diagnosis. Five patients were treated with DST or BIHKT at a dose of 5.0 or 7.5 g/d. The volume of rectal gas in 189 megavoltage computed tomographic images taken before each treatment session and the frequency of rectal gas drainage were evaluated before and after DST or BIHKT administration. RESULTS: After DST or BIHKT treatment, the mean volume of rectal gas was reduced from 6.4 to 2.1 mL, and the mean frequency of gas drainage decreased from 43% to 9%. CONCLUSIONS: DST and BIHKT appear to be useful in reducing rectal gas, which would help prevent radiation proctitis and improve the local control of prostate cancer with IMRT.
27108909	[Role of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4G in tumor].	Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4G (eIF4G) is a scaffold component of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4F (eIF4F) complex, which takes principal part in the initiating of protein synthesis. Both two subtypes (eIF4G1 and eIF4G2) of eIF4G were found to be closely related with various tumors. The eIF4G1 expression is significantly up-regulated in breast cancer, cervical cancer, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, lung squamous cell carcinoma, prostatic carcinoma and other malignant tumors, compared with those in adjacent tissues; and the eIF4G2 is obviously over-expressed in diffuse large B cell lymphoma and acute myeloid leukemia, but low-expressed in bladder transitional cell carcinoma. This paper reviews the progress in the study of the role of eIF4G in tumor genesis, development, diagnosis and prognosis.
27108122	Short and long-term urodynamic and quality of life assessment after nerve sparing radical hysterectomy: a prospective pilot study.	OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to compare pre- and postoperative bladder function and quality of life (QoL) in women diagnosed with gynecologic malignancy and treated with nerve sparing radical hysterectomy (NSRH). STUDY DESIGN: Before and after NSRH for uterine malignancy, bladder function was prospectively assessed in a small cohort of 12 women (39-72 years) suffering from uterine malignancy using urodynamic studies and a validated self-administered condition specific QoL questionnaire. Urodynamic studies were performed one day before (U0) as well as one week (U1) and 22 months (U2) after surgery. The questionnaire was applied at U0 and U2. RESULTS: Cystometry showed detrusor contractions leading to overactive bladder incontinence in six out of nine women at short-term, which persisted in three women at long-term follow-up leading to a significant impaired QoL. Voiding function and bladder sensation remained uncompromised after surgery. CONCLUSIONS: NSRH preserves voiding function and bladder sensation. However, short and long-term urodynamic detrusor overactivity and urge incontinence was observed in a significant number of women although symptoms improved over time. These data are important for counselling women and for the design of larger studies to assess the benefits of NSRH versus conventional radical hysterectomy (RH).
27106493	Second primary malignancies in renal cortical neoplasms: an updated evaluation from a single institution.	PURPOSE: To examine the incidence of secondary primary malignancies in patients with renal cortical neoplasms. METHODS: Between January 1989 and July 2010, 3647 patients underwent surgery at our institution for a renal cortical neoplasm and were followed through 2012. Occurrence of other malignancies was classified as antecedent, synchronous, or subsequent. All patients with antecedent malignancies (n = 498) and a randomly selected half of those with synchronous malignancies (n = 83) were excluded. The expected number of second primaries was calculated by multiplying Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program incidence rates of renal cortical neoplasms by person-years at risk within categories of age, sex, and year of diagnosis. The standardized incidence ratio (SIR) was calculated as observed cancers divided by expected incidence of the cancer, with approximation to the exact Poisson test used to obtain confidence intervals (CI) and p values. RESULTS: Of 3066 patients with renal cortical neoplasms, 267 had a second primary cancer; the five most common in men were prostate, colorectal, bladder, lung, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma; the five most common in women were breast, colorectal, lung, endometrium, and thyroid. Men demonstrated higher than expected thyroid cancer rate (SIR 5.0; 95 % CI 1.83-10.88, p = 0.002), and women had higher than expected rates of stomach cancer (SIR 5.0; 95 % CI 1.61-11.67, p = 0.004) and thyroid cancer (SIR 4.62; 95 % CI 1.69-10.05, p = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of certain types of second malignancies may be higher in patients after diagnosis of renal cortical neoplasms compared to the general population. These observations can inform clinical follow-up in kidney cancer survivorship and future research studies.
27106137	The impact of red and processed meat consumption on cancer and other health outcomes: Epidemiological evidences.	Meat is one of the staples of the human diet, which provides high-quality nutrients, but that also constitutes a relevant source of cholesterol and saturated fatty acids. Epidemiologic studies have linked consumption of red or processed meat with obesity, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and cancers. Most epidemiological studies suggest that a high intake of meat, especially processed meat, is associated with increased colorectal cancer risk. Potential reasons for the association between high meat intake and colorectal cancer risk include some chemicals naturally contained in meat, or generated by the processing and cooking. From the literature it can be concluded that there is enough epidemiological evidence linking processed meat intake and colorectal cancer risk, but there is limited evidence regarding unprocessed red meat intake and the disease. On the contrary, there is only limited evidence linking meat intake with other diseases such as cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes or other cancers. Nevertheless, the literature suggest that dietary intervention may be a promising approach for prevention of cancers of the colon, esophagus, liver, stomach and bladder, and type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease which still need to be confirmed by further well designed prospective studies and experimental research.
27106005	Can immediate second resection be an alternative to standardized second transurethral resection of bladder tumors?	This study analyzed the impact of an immediate second transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) protocol on residual tumor status at the initial TURBT session and the recurrence rate in the primary resection area. We prospectively evaluated and randomized 47 consecutive patients who underwent TURBT sessions for bladder cancer. In accordance with the inclusion criteria, of the 47 consecutive patients, 19 (Group I) underwent immediate second resection of the tumor bed after complete TUR and 28 (Group II) did not. After standard TURBT, Group I underwent a second cystoscopy and resection of the bed of the tumor or an ignored tumor, which was performed by a different urologist. After 4-6 weeks, delayed second TURB was performed, and all pathological results were evaluated. Tumors were detected in two patients during the immediate second resection. Of these, one was a misdiagnosed tumor, whereas the other was diagnosed at the bed of the tumor by pathological examination. Tumors were detected in nine patients at the delayed second TURB, of which only one was part of Group I, while the others were part of Group II (p = 0.04). The results of this study demonstrated that residual tumors may remain after initial TURB, either in the tumor bed or in a different location within the bladder. Although this was a pilot study enrolling only a small number of patients, our initial results supported the assertion that immediate second resection can be an alternative to standard second TURBT.
27105947	Cisplatin versus carboplatin: comparative review of therapeutic management in solid malignancies.	The platinum analogues, cisplatin and carboplatin, are among the most widely used chemotherapeutic agents in oncology. Both agents have a broad spectrum of clinical activity in numerous malignancies including gynaecological cancers, germ cell tumours, head and neck cancer, thoracic cancers and bladder cancer. Although the final mechanism of inducing tumour cell apoptosis is similar for both compounds, cisplatin has been shown to be more effective in treating specific tumour types. Whilst more favourable toxicity profiles are often associated with carboplatin, this can frequently translate to inferior response in certain malignancies. This review succinctly collates the evidence for the preferential use of these platinum analogues in particular settings in addition to the long-standing dilemma surrounding the paucity of biomarkers predicting response to these agents.
27102235	The possible role of the tumour necrosis factor polymorphisms and human leucocyte antigens in the development of prostate cancer.	The cause of prostate cancer (PC), one of the most common cancers found among ageing men, remains unclear, but genetic predisposition is believed to play a major role in its aetiology. The aim of the study was to examine HLA genes polymorphism and TNF polymorphisms in PC development. Patients diagnosed with PC (N = 113) and 150 healthy individuals were tested for HLA-A, HLA-B and HLA-DRB1 genes and for TNFa, TNFb and TNFd microsatellites. The comparison of patients and controls revealed a positive association of HLA-DRB1*12, TNFa2 and TNFb5, and a negative association of HLA-DRB1*13 and TNFb4 with PC. A division of patients into groups according to age, pre-operative PSA level, Gleason score (GS) and involvement of prostatic capsule, seminal vesicles or bladder neck and perineural invasion of PC demonstrated the following: a positive correlation of HLA-DRB1*12 and a negative correlation of HLA-DRB1*13 with younger patients (<65 years), GS > 7 and the positive association of prostatic capsule, seminal vesicles, bladder neck and perineural invasion of PC; TNFb4 allele's negative association with older patients displaying higher PSA levels, higher GS and positive surrounding tissue involvement; positive association of TNFb5 allele for both older and younger patients. Investigation of HLA genes and TNF microsatellites demonstrated a possible role of HLA-DRB1 and TNF regions in PC aetiology.
27102013	Cancer incidence in urban Shanghai, 1973-2010: an updated trend and age-period-cohort effects.	BACKGROUND: To provide a comprehensive overview of temporal trends in cancer incidence during 1973-2010 in urban Shanghai. METHODS: The estimated annual percent changes (EAPCs) for the whole period and for the time segments in age-standardized incidence rates (ASR) were evaluated with Joinpoint analysis. Age-period-cohort (APC) models were modeled to examine the effects of age, period and birth cohort on cancer incidence. RESULTS: The overall ASR decreased slightly and significantly in males (EAPC of -0.41) but increased significantly in females (EAPC of 0.57) during 1973-2010 in urban Shanghai. The incidence trend was not linear and varied by time segments. During the most recent 10 years (2001-2010), the ASR in males decreased by 1.65% per year and stabilized in females. Incidence rates continued to decline during 1973-2010 for esophagus, stomach, and liver cancer in both sexes, as well as male lung cancer and cervix cancer. It should be noted that it was the first time to document a significant decline in lung cancer incidence among males during 1973-2010 with EAPC of -0.58%, and a notable upward for cervix cancer since 1996 with EAPC of 8.94%. Unfavorable trends in incidence were observed for the most common cancer sites in the 38 years period: colorectum, gallbladder & biliary tract, pancreas, kidney, bladder, brain & central nervous system (CNS), thyroid, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), prostate, female breast, corpus uteri, and ovary. APC analysis showed age, period and birth cohort yielded different effects by cancer sites. CONCLUSIONS: The observed trends primarily reflect dramatic changes in socioeconomic development and lifestyles in urban Shanghai over the past four decades.
27100442	A Large Bladder Tumor Covered With a Thick "Shell" of Necrotic Material: Misdiagnosis of a Patient With Spina Bifida.	Bladder tumor arising in a spina bifida patient is rare and may be clinically latent. We report the case of a 61-year-old female patient with spina bifida, neurogenic bladder, and a history of recurrent urinary tract infections. A B-ultrasound and non-contrast computed tomography scan did not reveal any bladder mass, but an unexplained "well-filled" bladder was observed, which was confusing as the catheter was present and open. However, a subsequent cystoscopic evaluation revealed a large bladder mass measuring 9.5 x 9.0 x 6.5 cm(3), which almost filled the entire bladder. The mass had coarse and flocculent surface and seemed to be free from each observed wall of the urinary bladder. It was diagnosed as an infectious necrotic mass based on its appearance. During transurethral resection of the mass, a bladder tumor was suspected as small blood vessels and bleeding appeared within the inner layer of the mass. Pathological examination revealed necrotic material, inflammatory cells, and urothelial carcinoma cells. Then, a radical cystectomy was performed, and the pathological results indicated stage pT3bN0M0 transitional cell carcinoma. In the gross specimen, the base of the tumor measured 3 x 3 cm(2) on the top of the back wall of the bladder. Bladder tumors may have atypical presentations in patients with spina bifida. Regular screening is helpful for earlier detection and improving outcomes of bladder tumors in such patients.
27100215	A biological modeling based comparison of two strategies for adaptive radiotherapy of urinary bladder cancer.	Background Adaptive radiotherapy is introduced in the management of urinary bladder cancer to account for day-to-day anatomical changes. The purpose of this study was to determine whether an adaptive plan selection strategy using either the first four cone beam computed tomography scans (CBCT-based strategy) for plan creation, or the interpolation of bladder volumes on pretreatment CT scans (CT-based strategy), is better in terms of tumor control probability (TCP) and normal tissue sparing while taking the clinically applied fractionation schedules also into account. Material and methods With the CT-based strategy, a library of five plans was created. Patients received 55 Gy to the bladder tumor and 40 Gy to the non-involved bladder and lymph nodes, in 20 fractions. With the CBCT-based strategy, a library of three plans was created, and patients received 70 Gy to the tumor, 60 Gy to the bladder and 48 Gy to the lymph nodes, in 30-35 fractions. Ten patients were analyzed for each adaptive plan selection strategy. TCP was calculated applying the clinically used fractionation schedules, as well as a rescaling of the dose from 55 to 70 Gy for the CT-based strategy. For rectum and bowel, equivalent doses in 2 Gy fractions (EQD2) were calculated. Results The CBCT-based strategy resulted in a median TCP of 75%, compared to 49% for the CT-based strategy, the latter improving to 72% upon rescaling the dose to 70 Gy. A median rectum V30Gy (EQD2) of 26% [interquartile range (IQR): 8-52%] was found for the CT-based strategy, compared to 58% (IQR: 55-73%) for the CBCT-based strategy. Also the bowel doses were lower with the CT-based strategy. Conclusions Whereas the higher total bladder TCP for the CBCT-based strategy is due to prescription differences, the adaptive strategy based on CT scans results in the lowest rectum and bowel cavity doses.
27099489	Improvement and enhancement of antibladder carcinoma cell effects of heteronemin by the nanosized hyaluronan aggregation.	The effects against tumors exerted by marine active compounds have been highlighted and investigated. Polymeric nanoparticles made from biodegradable and biocompatible molecules such as hyaluronan (HA) and chitosan (CHI) are able to aggregate the compounds to enhance their activities against tumor cells and reduce the toxicity on normal cells. Here, we extensively examined the antitumor activities and the mechanisms of HA/CHI nanoparticles-aggregated heteronemin (HET) extracted from the sponge Hippospongia sp. The half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of pure HET toward T24 bladder carcinoma cells is ~0.28 microg/mL. Pure HET from 0.2 to 0.8 microg/mL and HA nanoparticles-aggregated HET at 0.1 and 0.2 microg/mL significantly reduced T24 cell viability. Compared to pure HET, HA nanoparticles/HET aggregates showed much weaker viability-inhibitory effects on L929 normal fibroblasts. HET dose-dependently suppressed cancer cell migration as HA/CHI nanoparticles-aggregated HET displayed stronger migration-inhibitory effects than pure HET. Flow cytometric analysis showed that pure HET increased early/total apoptosis and JC-1 monomer fluorescence, while HA/CHI nanoparticles-aggregated HET induced higher apoptosis and JC-1 monomer rates than pure HET, suggesting that aggregation of HA nanoparticles offers HET stronger apoptosis-inducing capacity through mitochondrial depolarization. Western blot analysis showed that HA nanoparticles-aggregated HET further increased mitochondrial-associated, caspase-dependent and caspase-independent, as well as endoplasmic reticulum stress-related factors in comparison with pure HET. These data indicated that pure HET possesses cytotoxic, antimigratory, and apoptosis-inducing effects on bladder cancer cells in vitro, and its induction of apoptosis in bladder carcinoma cells is mainly caspase dependent. Moreover, HA nanoparticle aggregation reinforced the cytotoxic, antimigratory, and apoptosis-inducing activities against bladder carcinoma cells and attenuated the viability-inhibitory effects on normal fibroblasts. This aggregation reinforces antibladder carcinoma effects of HET via diverse routes, including mitochondrial-related/caspase-dependent, caspase-independent, and endoplasmic reticulum stress-related pathways. The current data also strongly suggested that HA/CHI nanoparticles-aggregated HET would be a potential treatment for urothelial cancer in vivo.
27098227	Risk of Alcohol Consumption in Bladder Cancer: Case-Control Study from a Nationwide Inpatient Database in Japan.	Bladder cancer is common in Western countries, but not in Japan. Established risk factors are smoking and high-risk jobs such as printing and manufacturing. The risk of alcohol consumption in bladder cancer has been the recent focus; however, available literature on alcohol consumption and bladder cancer has been limited from Japanese population, thought to have a weak genetic tolerance to acetaldehyde. We aimed to determine whether alcohol consumption is an independent risk factor for bladder cancer among Japanese. The study was a matched case-control study from the nationwide Japanese clinical database administered by the Rosai Hospital group. We identified 739 cases of bladder cancer diagnosed between 2005 (when the database was established) and 2014 and 7,196 controls matched by sex, age, hospital, and admission period. We estimated the odds ratio of alcohol consumption for bladder cancer adjusted for the amount of smoking, high-risk occupations, and comorbidities (hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, hyperuricemia, and obesity) with conditional logistic regression. The risk of bladder cancer was significantly higher in ever drinkers than in never drinkers (odds ratio, 1.33; 95% confidence interval, 1.06 to 1.66). Furthermore, the risk threshold for alcohol consumption was more than 15 g of alcohol intake per day (one, 180-mL cup equivalent to 6 ounces of Japanese sake containing 23 grams of alcohol). Among Japanese, alcohol consumption may be an independent risk factor for bladder cancer, with a lower risk threshold.
27097041	Changes in Rectal Dose Due to Alterations in Beam Angles for Setup Uncertainty and Range Uncertainty in Carbon-Ion Radiotherapy for Prostate Cancer.	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Carbon-ion radiotherapy of prostate cancer is challenging in patients with metal implants in one or both hips. Problems can be circumvented by using fields at oblique angles. To evaluate the influence of setup and range uncertainties accompanying oblique field angles, we calculated rectal dose changes with oblique orthogonal field angles, using a device with fixed fields at 0 degrees and 90 degrees and a rotating patient couch. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Dose distributions were calculated at the standard angles of 0 degrees and 90 degrees , and then at 30 degrees and 60 degrees . Setup uncertainty was simulated with changes from -2 mm to +2 mm for fields in the anterior-posterior, left-right, and cranial-caudal directions, and dose changes from range uncertainty were calculated with a 1 mm water-equivalent path length added to the target isocenter in each angle. The dose distributions regarding the passive irradiation method were calculated using the K2 dose algorithm. RESULTS: The rectal volumes with 0 degrees , 30 degrees , 60 degrees , and 90 degrees field angles at 95% of the prescription dose were 3.4+/-0.9 cm3, 2.8+/-1.1 cm3, 2.2+/-0.8 cm3, and 3.8+/-1.1 cm3, respectively. As compared with 90 degrees fields, 30 degrees and 60 degrees fields had significant advantages regarding setup uncertainty and significant disadvantages regarding range uncertainty, but were not significantly different from the 90 degrees field setup and range uncertainties. CONCLUSIONS: The setup and range uncertainties calculated at 30 degrees and 60 degrees field angles were not associated with a significant change in rectal dose relative to those at 90 degrees .
27096770	Early results of liver resection using laparoscopic technique.	UNLABELLED: The aim of the study was to present early outcomes of liver resection using laparoscopic technique. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retrospective analysis of patients who underwent liver resection using laparoscopic method was conducted. The analyzed group included 23 patients (11 women and 12 men). An average patient age was 61.3 years (37 - 83 years). Metastases of the colorectal cancer to the liver were the cause for qualification to the procedure of 15 patients, metastasis of breast cancer in 1 patient and primary liver malignancy in 5 patients. The other 2 patients were qualified to the liver resection to widen the surgical margins due to gall-bladder cancer diagnosed in the pathological assessment of the specimen resected during laparoscopic cholecystectomy, initially performed for other than oncology indications. RESULTS: Hemihepatectomy was performed in 11 patients (9 right and 2 left), while the other 12 patients underwent minor resection procedures (5 metastasectomies, 4 nonanatomical liver resections, 1 bisegmentectomy, 2 resections of the gall-bladder fossa). An average duration of the surgical procedure was 275 minutes 65 - 600). An average size of the resected tumors was 28 mm (7 - 55 mm). In three cases conversion to laparotomy occurred, caused by excessive bleeding from the liver parenchyma. Postoperative complications were found in 4 patients (17.4%). Median hospitalization duration was 6 days (2 - 130 days). One patient (4.3%) was rehospitalized due to subhepatic abscess and required reoperation. Histopathology assessment confirmed radical resection (R0) in all patients in our group. CONCLUSION: Laparoscopic liver resections seem to be an interesting alternative in the treatment of focal lesions in the liver.
27096620	Differences in cancer survival in Canada by sex.	BACKGROUND: Research in the United States and Europe has found that women have an advantage over men in surviving a diagnosis of cancer, but the issue has not been systematically studied in Canada. DATA AND METHODS: Data are from the Canadian Cancer Registry, with mortality follow-up through record linkage to the Canadian Vital Statistics Death Database. The percentage unit difference in five-year relative survival ratios (RSRs) between women and men and the relative excess risk (RER) of death for women compared with men were used as measures of differences in cancer survival. RESULTS: A significant advantage for women compared with men was observed in 13 of the 18 cancers studied. Point estimates of RER were almost uniformly lower among those diagnosed at younger ages (15 to 54). For all cancers combined, women had a 13% lower excess risk of death-23% lower among women younger than 55. The overall advantage was greatest for thyroid cancer (RER = 0.31), skin melanoma (0.52) and Hodgkin lymphoma (0.65). The advantage for thyroid cancer was somewhat attenuated, though still significant, in earlier time periods. Bladder cancer was the only cancer for which women had a significant disadvantage (RER = 1.23); this excess risk seemed to be restricted to the first 12 to 18 months after diagnosis. INTERPRETATION: The reasons behind sex-specific differences in cancer survival are not well understood. Many explanations are possible, and differences are best explored on a cancer-by-cancer basis. The pronounced advantage for women at younger ages lends indirect support to a hypothesized hormonal influence.
27095782	[Clinical significance of residual tumors at repeat transurethral resection in patients with T1 bladder cancer].	OBJECTIVE: To investigate the predictors of residual tumors at repeat transurethral resection of bladder tumors (re-TURBT) for the patients with T1 bladder cancer and evaluate the effect of the residual tumors on the prognosis of the disease. METHODS: We reviewed the clinical data of the patients with T1 bladder cancer who underwent re-TURBT from 2008 to 2015 in our department. Seventy-two patients received re-TURBT 2-6 weeks after the initial TURBT. A total of 65 patients were followed up, and we recorded the events of tumor recurrence, tumor progression, radical cystectomy and cancer specific death.The influencing factors of re-TURBT positive rate were analyzed.The effects of re-TURBT positive or negative findings on the prognosiswere compared. RESULTS: 33.3% of the patients who received re-TURBT had residual tumours. Re-TURBT positive in T1 bladder cancer has significant correlation with tumor size (P<0.05). Residual tumors tended to be detected in patients with larger tumors (diameter >/= 4 cm) but might have no relationship with tumor grade or tumor number. The recurrence rate within 3 month ofthe patients with residual tumours at re-TURBT was 25% (5/20), while there were no patients suffering recurrence who had no residual tumours at re-TURBT, which had a significant difference (P<0.001). However, the overall recurrence rate, progression rate, rate of radical cystectomy and cancer specific mortality showed no significant difference between the two groups (45% vs 40%, P=0.71; 10% vs 6.7%, P=0.64; 5% vs 8.9%, P=0.59; 5% vs 2.2%, P=0.55). CONCLUSIONS: For the patients with T1 bladder cancer, larger tumors could be a predictor for residual tumors at re-TURBT. The presence of residual tumors is associated with early recurrence.
27093762	Indicators of Health Literacy In Bladder Cancer Survivors: A Secondary Analysis of the Integrative Health Interview Series (IHIS).	A secondary analysis was performed to characterize the health literacy of bladder cancer survivors. A cluster of patients was identified that is less healthy and may have more health literacy needs.
27093372	Antitumor activity of recombinant Bacille Calmette-Guerin secreting interleukin-15-Ag85B fusion protein against bladder cancer.	Mycobacterium bovis Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) is used for the treatment of bladder cancer. The recruitment of neutrophlis to the bladder after BCG instillation exerts anti-tumor activity against bladder tumor. We have recently demonstrated that interleukin (IL)-17A produced by gammadelta T cells played a role in the recruitment of neutrophlis to the bladder after BCG instillation. IL-15 is known to play an important role in neutrophil migration during inflammation. We previously constructed a recombinant BCG strain expressing the fusion protein of IL-15 and Ag85B (BCG-IL-15) for prevention of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. Here we compared the efficacy of the BCG-IL-15 in protection against bladder cancer with that of rBCG-Ag85B (BCG). Six-week-old female C57BL/6 mice were inoculated with MB49 bladder tumor cells in the bladder and subsequently intravesically inoculated with BCG or BCG-IL-15. BCG-IL-15 treatment significantly prolonged survival of mice inoculated with bladder cancer cells compared with BCG treatment. Infiltration of neutrophils was significantly elevated in BCGB-IL-15 treated mice accompanied by increased chemokines (MIP-2 and MIP-1alpha) in the bladder. Thus, BCG-IL-15 exerted additive effect on Infiltration of neutrophils in the bladder. BCG-IL-15 may be a promising drug for non-muscle invasive bladder cancer.
27091477	Epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor with fluorouracil, leucovorin, and irinotecan as an alternative treatment for advanced upper tract urothelial carcinoma: a case report.	BACKGROUND: Currently, there is no standard salvage regimen after the failure of cisplatin-based chemotherapy for advanced urothelial carcinoma. The combination of epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor with fluorouracil, leucovorin, and irinotecan was originally designed for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer. Until now, there have been no reports using this combination therapy in treating advanced upper tract urothelial carcinoma. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report showing this possible treatment regimen for advanced upper tract urothelial carcinoma. CASE PRESENTATION: We report the case of a 90-year-old Chinese woman who was diagnosed with metastatic colorectal cancer and urothelial carcinoma of the bladder, ureter, and renal pelvis. The upper tract urothelial carcinoma was well controlled by the chemotherapy regimen for metastatic colorectal cancer. Considering her age, we used only laser ablation for the treatment of her urothelial carcinoma in combination with intravesical mitomycin C chemotherapy. Follow-up cystoscopy and ureterorenoscopy showed an unexpected regression of the upper tract urothelial tumor. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography also demonstrated the same results. CONCLUSIONS: This novel regimen for the treatment of upper tract urothelial carcinoma may merit further investigation or evaluation in clinical trials.
27090213	Isoform switching and exon skipping induced by the DNA methylation inhibitor 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine.	DNA methylation in gene promoters leads to gene silencing and is the therapeutic target of methylation inhibitors such as 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-Aza-CdR). By analyzing the time series RNA-seq data (days 5, 9, 13, 17) obtained from human bladder cells exposed to 5-Aza-CdR with 0.1 uM concentration, we showed that 5-Aza-CdR can affect isoform switching and differential exon usage (i.e., exon-skipping), in addition to its effects on gene expression. We identified more than 2,000 genes with significant expression changes after 5-Aza-CdR treatment. Interestingly, 29 exon-skipping events induced by treatment were identified and validated experimentally. Particularly, exon-skipping event in Enhancer of Zeste Homologue 2 (EZH2) along with expression changes showed significant down regulation on Day 5 and Day 9 but returned to normal level on Day 13 and Day 17. EZH2 is a component of the multi-subunit polycomb repressive complex PRC2, and the down-regulation of exon-skipping event may lead to the regain of functional EZH2 which was consistent with our previous finding that demethylation may cause regain of PRC2 in demethylated regions. In summary, our study identified pervasive transcriptome changes of bladder cancer cells after treatment with 5-Aza-CdR, and provided valuable insights into the therapeutic effects of 5-Aza-CdR in current clinical trials.
27089849	Increased risk of malignancy for non-atypical urothelial cell groups compared to negative cytology in voided urine. Morphological changes with LBC.	Liquid-based cytology (LBC) has recently become the preferred method for urine cytology analysis, but differences with conventional cytology (CC) have been observed. The purpose of this study is to analyze these differences and the clinical relevance of non-atypical urothelial cell groups (UCG) in voided urine specimens. Reporting terminology is discussed. Initially, diagnostic categories from 619 LBC and 474 CC samples, reviewed by five different pathologists, were compared (phase 1). Five years after LBC was implemented and applying strict cytologic criteria for UCG diagnosis, 760 samples were analyzed (phase 2) and compared to previous LBC specimens. Diagnostic differences, interobserver variability and clinicopathological correlation with a 6-month follow-up, were analyzed. UCG increased from 6.5% with CC to 20.7% (218%, 3.2 fold, P < 0.0001) with LBC. This difference was not related to interobserver variability. Five years later, the rate of UCG had decreased to 13 2%. While 6% of cases with a negative cytology had urothelial carcinoma (UC) within 6 months of diagnosis, this percentage increased to 15.7% with UCG. The sensitivity of the UCG category for UC was low (30.4%), but the specificity and the negative predictive value (NPV) were high (87.1% and 94%, respectively). LBC increases UCG when compared to CC. This can be corrected with observers experience and using set cytological criteria. Due to its association with carcinoma, the presence of UCG in voided urine should be framed in a diagnostic category other than "negative for malignancy." Diagn. Cytopathol. 2016;44:582-590.

27088600	Quantifying Post- Laser Ablation Prostate Therapy Changes on MRI via a Domain-Specific Biomechanical Model: Preliminary Findings.	Focal laser ablation destroys cancerous cells via thermal destruction of tissue by a laser. Heat is absorbed, causing thermal necrosis of the target region. It combines the aggressive benefits of radiation treatment (destroying cancer cells) without the harmful side effects (due to its precise localization). MRI is typically used pre-treatment to determine the targeted area, and post-treatment to determine efficacy by detecting necrotic tissue, or tumor recurrence. However, no system exists to quantitatively evaluate the post-treatment effects on the morphology and structure via MRI. To quantify these changes, the pre- and post-treatment MR images must first be spatially aligned. The goal is to quantify (a) laser-induced shape-based changes, and (b) changes in MRI parameters post-treatment. The shape-based changes may be correlated with treatment efficacy, and the quantitative effects of laser treatment over time is currently poorly understood. This work attempts to model changes in gland morphology following laser treatment due to (1) patient alignment, (2) changes due to surrounding organs such as the bladder and rectum, and (3) changes due to the treatment itself. To isolate the treatment-induced shape-based changes, the changes from (1) and (2) are first modeled and removed using a finite element model (FEM). A FEM models the physical properties of tissue. The use of a physical biomechanical model is important since a stated goal of this work is to determine the physical shape-based changes to the prostate from the treatment, and therefore only physical real deformations are to be allowed. A second FEM is then used to isolate the physical, shape-based, treatment-induced changes. We applied and evaluated our model in capturing the laser induced changes to the prostate morphology on eight patients with 3.0 Tesla, T2-weighted MRI, acquired approximately six months following treatment. Our results suggest the laser treatment causes a decrease in prostate volume, which appears to manifest predominantly at the site of ablation. After spatially aligning the images, changes to MRI intensity values are clearly visible at the site of ablation. Our results suggest that our new methodology is able to capture and quantify the degree of laser-induced changes to the prostate. The quantitative measurements reflecting of the deformation changes can be used to track treatment response over time.
27087975	Automated replication of cone beam CT-guided treatments in the Pinnacle(3) treatment planning system for adaptive radiotherapy.	INTRODUCTION: Time-consuming manual methods have been required to register cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) images with plans in the Pinnacle(3) treatment planning system in order to replicate delivered treatments for adaptive radiotherapy. These methods rely on fiducial marker (FM) placement during CBCT acquisition or the image mid-point to localise the image isocentre. A quality assurance study was conducted to validate an automated CBCT-plan registration method utilising the Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) Structure Set (RS) and Spatial Registration (RE) files created during online image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT). METHODS: CBCTs of a phantom were acquired with FMs and predetermined setup errors using various online IGRT workflows. The CBCTs, DICOM RS and RE files were imported into Pinnacle(3) plans of the phantom and the resulting automated CBCT-plan registrations were compared to existing manual methods. A clinical protocol for the automated method was subsequently developed and tested retrospectively using CBCTs and plans for six bladder patients. RESULTS: The automated CBCT-plan registration method was successfully applied to thirty-four phantom CBCT images acquired with an online 0 mm action level workflow. Ten CBCTs acquired with other IGRT workflows required manual workarounds. This was addressed during the development and testing of the clinical protocol using twenty-eight patient CBCTs. The automated CBCT-plan registrations were instantaneous, replicating delivered treatments in Pinnacle(3) with errors of +/-0.5 mm. These errors were comparable to mid-point-dependant manual registrations but superior to FM-dependant manual registrations. CONCLUSION: The automated CBCT-plan registration method quickly and reliably replicates delivered treatments in Pinnacle(3) for adaptive radiotherapy.
27087035	Cancer incidence in Priolo, Sicily: a spatial approach for estimation of industrial air pollution impact.	The territory around the industrial Sicilian area of Priolo, Italy, has been defined as a contaminated site (CS) of national priority for remediation because of diffuse environmental contamination caused by large industrial settlements. The present study investigates the spatial distribution of cancer into the CS territory (period 1999-2006). Different geographical methods used for the evaluation of the impact of industrial air pollutants were adopted. Using the database of Syracuse Province Cancer Registry, gender-specific standardised incidence ratios were calculated for 35 tumour sites for the CS overall and for each municipality included in the CS. A cluster analysis for 17 selected neoplasms was performed at micro-geographical level. The identification of the priority index contaminants (PICs) present in environmental matrices and a review of their carcinogenicity have been performed and applied in the interpretation of the findings. The area has a higher cancer incidence with respect to the provincial population, in particular excess is registered among both genders of lung, bladder and breast cancers as well as skin melanoma and pleural mesothelioma and there is an a priori evidence of association with the exposure to PICs. The study highlights the need to provide different approaches in CSs where several exposure pathways might be relevant for the population. The presence of potential sources of asbestos exposure deserves specific concern.
27086763	Sensitive Electrochemical Immunosensor for Detection of Nuclear Matrix Protein-22 based on NH2-SAPO-34 Supported Pd/Co Nanoparticles.	A novel sandwich-type electrochemical immunosensor using the new amino group functionalized silicoaluminophosphates molecular sieves (NH2-SAPO-34) supported Pd/Co nanoparticles (NH2-SAPO-34-Pd/Co NPs) as labels for the detection of bladder cancer biomarker nuclear matrix protein-22 (NMP-22) was developed in this work. The reduced graphene oxide-NH (rGO-NH) with good conductivity and large surface area was used to immobilize primary antibody (Ab1). Due to the excellent catalytic activity toward hydrogen peroxide, NH2-SAPO-34-Pd/Co NPs were used as labels and immobilized secondary antibody (Ab2) through adsorption capacity of Pd/Co NPs to protein. The immunosensor displayed a wide linear range (0.001-20 ng/mL) and low detection limit (0.33 pg/mL). Good reproducibility and stability have showed satisfying results in the analysis of clinical urine samples. This novel and ultrasensitive immunosensor may have the potential application in the detection of different tumor markers.
27085829	Takotsubo stress-induced cardiomyopathy following robotic radical cystectomy.	Cardiac complications following surgery can be devastating especially if it is unrecognized. We present a case of a stress-induced cardiomyopathy that occurred in postoperative period following a robotic radical cystectomy and urinary diversion. While most cases of stress-induced cardiomyopathy, also known as Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, are transient and with little to no long term clinical effects, a small number of patients can develop severe complications. This has not been reported in urologic literature and the unique characteristics of this cardiac condition are reviewed.
27085823	Short term complications from transurethral resection of bladder tumor.	INTRODUCTION: The diagnosis and subsequent management of bladder cancer often involves transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT). Risks of TURBT include perioperative complications such as bleeding, pain and perforation. We aimed to determine TURBT complication rates and risk factors in a contemporary series. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From 2002 to 2011, 505 patients underwent TURBT either for suspected bladder cancer or during follow up at a single institution. Baseline patient characteristics and complications within 2 weeks of surgery were extracted from the electronic medical record for all TURBTs. Patient and tumor characteristics were evaluated for associations with complication using univariate analysis. A multivariable logistic regression was fit to further examine associations between TURBT related characteristics and complication. RESULTS: A total of 910 TURBTs were performed on 505 patients. Overall complication rate was 8.1%. The most common complications were pain or spasm (3.0%), retention (2.8%), and infection (2.1%), and 0.5% of TURBTs had perforation. Over 85% of complications were Clavien-Dindo grade I or II. Forty-three patients had a complication after their first TURBT, while 25 had complications after subsequent TURBTs. Prior complication and single tumor, but not other patient or tumor-related characteristics, were associated with complication. Only prior complication (p < 0.01) was associated with subsequent complication after TURBT on multivariable analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Complication rate after TURBT is 8.1% and complications are generally not severe in nature. Prior short term complication is likely associated with subsequent complication. Further studies are needed to validate these results and determine patient groups most at risk for intraoperative and post TURBT complications.
27085562	Association of AKR1C3 Polymorphisms with Bladder Cancer.	PURPOSE: Polymorphisms in the genes coding for the carcinogen metabolizing enzymes may affect enzyme activities and alter the activation and detoxification rates of the carcinogens. AKR1C3 is one of the very polymorphic xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes involved in the bioactivation process. Here we aimed to investigate the association of two single nucleotide polymorphisms in AKR1C3, rs12529 (c.15C > G) and rs1937920 (12259 bp 3' of STP A > G) with urinary bladder cancer (UBC). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two-hundred fifty UBC cases and 250 control subjects were genotyped using the Polymerase Chain Reaction and Restriction Fragment Length method. Associations of the genotypes with UBC risk and tumor characteristics were assessed using logistic regression and Fisher's exact test. The results are corrected for multiple testing. RESULTS: We identified strong associations between the studied AKR1C3 variants and UBC risk. The homozygous variant genotype of rs12529 was found to be inversely associated with UBC, and rs1937920 was shown to be associated with increased risk of UBC. None of the genotypes were found to be significantly associated with tumor characteristics. CONCLUSION: We provided evidence that rs12529 and rs1937920 are significant in the molecular pathogenesis of UBC. However, the results presented here should be regarded as preliminary and might represent a first step of future larger studies aiming to better elucidate the role of AKR1C3 polymorphisms in the susceptibility to bladder cancer.
27085560	Bladder Paraganglioma: Clinicopathology and Magnetic Resonance Imaging Study of Five Patients.	PURPOSE: To investigate the clinicopathology and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features of bladder paraganglioma, an extremely rare clinical entity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Five patients with bladder paraganglioma (3 males and 2 females, 27-52 years old) were retrospectively reviewed. All cases underwent baseline MRI and contrast-enhanced scans, and three cases underwent diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) and cystoscopy. Cases were immunohistochemically examined with neuroendocrine markers (chromogranin and synaptophysin) and Ki-67, and histology was reviewed by a pathologist. RESULTS: Three cases exhibited painless gross hematuria, including one case with hypertension, whereas two cases were asymptomatic. One of the three patients who underwent cystoscopy was negative. The tumors were round (n = 1) or oval (n = 4) and located in the anterior wall (n = 1), posterior wall (n = 1), lateral wall (n = 2) or trigone (n = 1). All tumors were located in the submucosal or lamina propria. Four cases presented with well-circumscribed margins, whereas one case was poorly circumscribed. All tumors exhibited slight hyperintensity on T1-weighted images (T1WI) and hyperintensity with "salt and pepper" appearance on T2-weighted images (T2WI). DWI indicated strong hyperintensity, and all cases exhibited conspicuous enhancement after intravenous gadobenate dimeglumine (Gd-DTPA) injection. Pathological evaluation confirmed paraganglioma. CONCLUSION: MRI plays an important role in the preoperative diagnosis of bladder paraganglioma. This rare condition has a characteristic round or oval appearance, located in the submucosal area, with slight hyperintensity on T1WI and hyperintensity with "salt and pepper" appearance on T2WI. DWI indicated strong hyperintensity and conspicuous enhancement on contrast-enhanced scans.
27084660	Can We Advance Proton Therapy for Prostate? Considering Alternative Beam Angles and Relative Biological Effectiveness Variations When Comparing Against Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy.	PURPOSE: For prostate treatments, robust evidence regarding the superiority of either intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) or proton therapy is currently lacking. In this study we investigated the circumstances under which proton therapy should be expected to outperform IMRT, particularly the proton beam orientations and relative biological effectiveness (RBE) assumptions. METHODS AND MATERIALS: For 8 patients, 4 treatment planning strategies were considered: (A) IMRT; (B) passively scattered standard bilateral (SB) proton beams; (C) passively scattered anterior oblique (AO) proton beams, and (D) AO intensity modulated proton therapy (IMPT). For modalities (B)-(D) the dose and linear energy transfer (LET) distributions were simulated using the TOPAS Monte Carlo platform and RBE was calculated according to 3 different models. RESULTS: Assuming a fixed RBE of 1.1, our implementation of IMRT outperformed SB proton therapy across most normal tissue metrics. For the scattered AO proton plans, application of the variable RBE models resulted in substantial hotspots in rectal RBE weighted dose. For AO IMPT, it was typically not possible to find a plan that simultaneously met the tumor and rectal constraints for both fixed and variable RBE models. CONCLUSION: If either a fixed RBE of 1.1 or a variable RBE model could be validated in vivo, then it would always be possible to use AO IMPT to dose-boost the prostate and improve normal tissue sparing relative to IMRT. For a cohort without rectum spacer gels, this study (1) underlines the importance of resolving the question of proton RBE within the framework of an IMRT versus proton debate for the prostate and (2) highlights that without further LET/RBE model validation, great care must be taken if AO proton fields are to be considered for prostate treatments.
27084648	A Prospective Outcomes Study of Proton Therapy for Chordomas and Chondrosarcomas of the Spine.	PURPOSE: To evaluate the effectiveness of definitive or adjuvant external beam proton therapy on survival in patients with chordomas and chondrosarcomas of the spine. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between March 2007 and May 2013, 51 patients with a median age of 58 years (range, 22-83 years) with chordoma (n=34) or chondrosarcomas (n=17) of the sacrum (n=21), the cervical spine (n=20), and the thoracolumbar spine (n=10) were treated with external beam proton therapy to a median dose of 70.2 Gy(RBE) [range, 64.2-75.6 Gy(RBE)] at our institution. Distant metastases, overall survival, cause-specific survival, local control, and disease-free survival were calculated. RESULTS: The mean follow-up time was 3.7 years (range, 0.3-7.7 years). Across all time points, 25 patients experienced disease recurrence: 18 local recurrences, 6 local and distant recurrences, and 1 distant metastasis. The 4-year rates of overall survival and cause-specific survival were 72%; disease-free survival was 57%, local control was 58%, and freedom from distant metastases was 86%. The median time to local progression was 1.7 years (range, 0.2-6.0 years), and the median time to distant progression was 1.6 years (range, 0.2-6.0 years). The risk factors for local recurrence were age </=58 years (62% vs 26%; P=.04) and recurrence after prior surgery (29% vs 81%; P=.01). Secondary cancers developed in 2 patients: B-cell lymphoma 5.5 years after treatment and bladder cancer 2 years after treatment. We observed the following toxicities: sacral soft tissue necrosis requiring surgery (n=2), T1 vertebral fracture requiring fusion surgery (n=1), chronic urinary tract infections (n=1), surgery for necrotic bone cyst (n=1), and grade 2 bilateral radiation nephritis (n=1). CONCLUSION: High-dose proton therapy controls more than half of spinal chordomas and chondrosarcomas and compares favorably with historic photon data. Local progression is the dominant mode of treatment failure and may be reduced by treating patients at the time of initial diagnosis. The impact of age is a novel finding of this study.
27084642	Robust Proton Pencil Beam Scanning Treatment Planning for Rectal Cancer Radiation Therapy.	PURPOSE: To investigate, in a treatment plan design and robustness study, whether proton pencil beam scanning (PBS) has the potential to offer advantages, relative to interfraction uncertainties, over photon volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) in a locally advanced rectal cancer patient population. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Ten patients received a planning CT scan, followed by an average of 4 weekly offline CT verification CT scans, which were rigidly co-registered to the planning CT. Clinical PBS plans were generated on the planning CT, using a single-field uniform-dose technique with single-posterior and parallel-opposed (LAT) fields geometries. The VMAT plans were generated on the planning CT using 2 6-MV, 220 degrees coplanar arcs. Clinical plans were forward-calculated on verification CTs to assess robustness relative to anatomic changes. Setup errors were assessed by forward-calculating clinical plans with a +/-5-mm (left-right, anterior-posterior, superior-inferior) isocenter shift on the planning CT. Differences in clinical target volume and organ at risk dose-volume histogram (DHV) indicators between plans were tested for significance using an appropriate Wilcoxon test (P<.05). RESULTS: Dosimetrically, PBS plans were statistically different from VMAT plans, showing greater organ at risk sparing. However, the bladder was statistically identical among LAT and VMAT plans. The clinical target volume coverage was statistically identical among all plans. The robustness test found that all DVH indicators for PBS and VMAT plans were robust, except the LAT's genitalia (V5, V35). The verification CT plans showed that all DVH indicators were robust. CONCLUSIONS: Pencil beam scanning plans were found to be as robust as VMAT plans relative to interfractional changes during treatment when posterior beam angles and appropriate range margins are used. Pencil beam scanning dosimetric gains in the bowel (V15, V20) over VMAT suggest that using PBS to treat rectal cancer may reduce radiation treatment-related toxicity.
27083415	OncoNEM: inferring tumor evolution from single-cell sequencing data.	Single-cell sequencing promises a high-resolution view of genetic heterogeneity and clonal evolution in cancer. However, methods to infer tumor evolution from single-cell sequencing data lag behind methods developed for bulk-sequencing data. Here, we present OncoNEM, a probabilistic method for inferring intra-tumor evolutionary lineage trees from somatic single nucleotide variants of single cells. OncoNEM identifies homogeneous cellular subpopulations and infers their genotypes as well as a tree describing their evolutionary relationships. In simulation studies, we assess OncoNEM's robustness and benchmark its performance against competing methods. Finally, we show its applicability in case studies of muscle-invasive bladder cancer and essential thrombocythemia.
27082587	High Ki-67 Immunohistochemical Reactivity Correlates With Poor Prognosis in Bladder Carcinoma: A Comprehensive Meta-Analysis with 13,053 Patients Involved.	Ki-67 is considered as one of prime biomarkers to reflect cell proliferation and immunohistochemical Ki-67 staining has been widely applied in clinical pathology. To solve the widespread controversy whether Ki-67 reactivity significantly predicts clinical prognosis of bladder carcinoma (BC), we performed a comprehensive meta-analysis by combining results from different literature. A comprehensive search was conducted in the Chinese databases of WanFang, China National Knowledge Infrastructure and Chinese VIP as well as English databases of PubMed, ISI web of science, EMBASE, Science Direct, and Wiley online library. Independent studies linking Ki-67 to cancer-specific survival (CSS), disease-free survival (DFS), overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and recurrence-free survival (RFS) were included in our meta-analysis. With the cut-off values literature provided, hazard ratio (HR) values between the survival distributions were extracted and later combined with STATA 12.0. In total, 76 studies (n = 13,053 patients) were eligible for the meta-analysis. It was indicated in either univariate or multivariate analysis for survival that high Ki-67 reactivity significantly predicted poor prognosis. In the univariate analysis, the combined HR for CSS, DFS, OS, PFS, and RFS were 2.588 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.623-4.127, P < 0.001), 2.697 (95%CI: 1.874-3.883, P < 0.001), 2.649 (95%CI: 1.632-4.300, P < 0.001), 3.506 (95%CI: 2.231-5.508, P < 0.001), and 1.792 (95%CI: 1.409-2.279, P < 0.001), respectively. The pooled HR of multivariate analysis for CSS, DFS, OS, PFS, and RFS were 1.868 (95%CI: 1.343-2.597, P < 0.001), 2.626 (95%CI: 2.089-3.301, P < 0.001), 1.104 (95%CI: 1.008-1.209, P = 0.032), 1.518 (95%CI: 1.299-1.773, P < 0.001), and 1.294 (95%CI: 1.203-1.392, P < 0.001), respectively. Subgroup analysis of univariate analysis by origin showed that Ki-67 reactivity significantly correlated with all 5 clinical outcome in Asian and European-American patients (P < 0.05). For multivariate analysis, however, the pooled results were only significant for DFS, OS, and RFS in Asian patients, for CSS, DFS, PFS, and RFS in European-American patients (P < 0.05). In the subgroup with low cut-off value (<20%), our meta-analysis indicated that high Ki-67 reactivity was significantly correlated with worsened CSS, DFS, OS, PFS, and RFS on univariate analysis (P < 0.05). For multivariate analysis, the meta-analysis of literature with low cut-off value (<20%) demonstrated that high Ki-67 reactivity predicted shorter DFS, PFS, and RFS in BC patients (P < 0.05). In the subgroup analysis of high cut-off value (>/=20%), our meta-analysis indicated that high Ki-67 reactivity, in either univariate or multivariate analysis, significantly correlated with all five clinical outcomes in BC patients (P < 0.05). The meta-analysis indicates that high Ki-67 reactivity significantly correlates with deteriorated clinical outcomes in BC patients and that Ki-67 can be considered as an independent indicator for the prognosis by the meta-analyses of multivariate analysis.
27082575	Thyroid-Like Follicular Carcinoma of the Kidney in a Patient with Skull and Meningeal Metastasis: A Unique Case Report and Review of the Literature.	Thyroid-like follicular carcinoma of the kidney (TLFCK) is an extremely rare subtype of renal cell carcinoma with close resemblance to the well-differentiated thyroid follicular neoplasms. TLFCK has not been included in the 2004 World Health Organization (WHO) classification due to the limited data available. Only 27 cases have been reported in the literature to date. Herein, we report a unique case of TLFCK that presented as a striking skull and meningeal metastasis 5 years after the initial diagnosis; this is the first case of TLFCK with such a novel metastasis pattern. A 68-year-old woman was found to have a right renal lesion using computed tomography (CT) during her regular clinical follow-up visit for bladder cancer, but she exhibited no obvious clinical symptoms. The CT scan showed a 4.4-cm diameter, slightly lobulated soft tissue mass in the right lower kidney, the pathological findings of which showed a TLFCK. Five years later, the patient had progressed to skull and meningeal metastasis. Both the renal tumor and the metastasis lesion were composed almost entirely of follicles with a dense, colloid-like material that resembled thyroid follicular carcinoma. However, no lesion was found in the thyroid gland. The neoplastic epithelial cells were strongly immunoreactive for cytokeratin 7 (and vimentin but negative for thyroid transcription factor-1 and thyroglobulin. This is the first reported case of TLFCK to consist of widespread metastases to the skull and meninges and provides evidence that this rare variant of renal cell carcinoma has uncertain malignant potential and can be more clinically aggressive than previously believed.
27082503	Silencing of RTKN2 by siRNA suppresses proliferation, and induces G1 arrest and apoptosis in human bladder cancer cells.	Human bladder cancer is the most common urological malignancy in China. One of the causes of carcinogenesis in the cancer may be gene mutation. Therefore, the present study investigated the expression levels of Rhotekin 2 (RTKN2), a Rho effector protein, in human bladder cancer tissues and cell lines, and examined the effect of RTKN2 on the proliferation, cell cycle, apoptosis and invasion of human bladder cancer cell lines. The mRNA expression levels of RTKN2 in 30 human bladder cancer tissue samples were significantly higher, compared with those in 30 normal human bladder tissue samples. The protein expression levels of RTKN2 was markedly higher in T24 and 5637 cells, compared with those in four other human bladder cancer cell lines. The silencing of RTKN2 by small interfering (si)RNA inhibited cell proliferation and arrested cell cycle at the G1 phase, via reducing the expression levels of the MCM10, CDK2, CDC24A and CDC6 cell cycleassociated proteins in the T24 and 5637 cells. Furthermore, RTKN2 knockdown in the cells led to cell apoptosis and the suppression of invasion. These results suggested that RTKN2 is involved in the carcinogenesis and progression of human bladder cancer, indicating that RTKN2 may be a molecular target in cancer therapy.
27082124	Histone deacetylase inhibitor-induced cell death in bladder cancer is associated with chromatin modification and modifying protein expression: A proteomic approach.	The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project recently identified the importance of mutations in chromatin remodeling genes in human carcinomas. These findings imply that epigenetic modulators might have a therapeutic role in urothelial cancers. To exploit histone deacetylases (HDACs) as targets for cancer therapy, we investigated the HDAC inhibitors (HDACIs) romidepsin, trichostatin A, and vorinostat as potential chemotherapeutic agents for bladder cancer. We demonstrate that the three HDACIs suppressed cell growth and induced cell death in the bladder cancer cell line 5637. To identify potential mechanisms associated with the anti-proliferative and cytotoxic effects of the HDACIs, we used quantitative proteomics to determine the proteins potentially involved in these processes. Our proteome studies identified a total of 6003 unique proteins. Of these, 2472 proteins were upregulated and 2049 proteins were downregulated in response to HDACI exposure compared to the untreated controls (P<0.05). Bioinformatic analysis further revealed that those differentially expressed proteins were involved in multiple biological functions and enzyme-regulated pathways, including cell cycle progression, apoptosis, autophagy, free radical generation and DNA damage repair. HDACIs also altered the acetylation status of histones and non-histone proteins, as well as the levels of chromatin modification proteins, suggesting that HDACIs exert multiple cytotoxic actions in bladder cancer cells by inhibiting HDAC activity or altering the structure of chromatin. We conclude that HDACIs are effective in the inhibition of cell proliferation and the induction of apoptosis in the 5637 bladder cancer cells through multiple cell death-associated pathways. These observations support the notion that HDACIs provide new therapeutic options for bladder cancer treatment and thus warrant further preclinical exploration.

27077643	Preoperative Evaluation of Prostate Cancer Aggressiveness: Using ADC and ADC Ratio in Determining Gleason Score.	OBJECTIVE: The objective of our study was to evaluate apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and various ADC ratios in determining aggressiveness of prostate cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred sixty-five patients with biopsy-proven prostate cancer underwent 3-T MRI followed by radical prostatectomy. ADC and ADC ratios were calculated using the peripheral zone, transition zone, same zone as the tumor, and urinary bladder as references. ADC and ADC ratios were correlated with Gleason score using the Spearman correlation coefficient (rho) and were compared between low-grade (Gleason score = 6) and high-grade (Gleason score >/= 7) prostate cancer using the unpaired t test. ROC curves were used to compare diagnostic accuracies of ADC and ADC ratios in determining high-grade prostate cancer. RESULTS: Fifty-six (33.9%) and 109 (66.1%) patients had low- and high-grade prostate cancer, respectively. ADC (rho = -0.476) and all ADC ratios (rho = -0.397, -0.412, -0.381, and -0.474, respectively) correlated significantly with Gleason score (p < 0.001) and were significantly lower in patients with high-grade prostate cancer (p < 0.001). For predicting high-grade prostate cancer, tumor ADC and tumor-to-urinary bladder ADC ratio showed the highest AUC (0.794 and 0.790, respectively) but without statistically significant difference (p = 0.803). AUC of tumor ADC (0.794) was statistically significantly higher than those of the tumor-to-peripheral zone and tumor-to-transition zone ADC ratios (0.746, p = 0.039; 0.751, p = 0.027; respectively). AUC of tumor ADC was not statistically significantly higher than that of the tumor-to-tumor zone ADC ratio (0.763, p = 0.193). AUC calculated using the tumor-to-urinary bladder ADC ratio was statistically significantly higher than that using the tumor-to-transition zone ADC ratio (p = 0.028) and marginally higher than that from tumor-to-peripheral zone ADC ratio (p = 0.080). Otherwise, no significant differences were seen in the AUCs (p = 0.193-0.828). CONCLUSION: Both ADC and various ADC ratios correlated significantly with Gleason score and were significant predictors of high-grade prostate cancer. However, no benefit was found in using ADC ratio over ADC.
27077498	Recent perspectives of bladder cancer diagnostics.	The human bladder cancer (BC) diagnostics is being improvised every day for the better management and efficient diagnosis. The primary aim of all these innovations is to accomplish timely treatment and planning of BC patients. Diagnostic approaches involved both invasive as well as non-invasive methods, wherein; the extent of the spread of carcinogenesis is the deciding factor. The latest in the upcoming techniques is the utilization of principles of immunology for better and highly specific diagnosis. The present review article will be focused on the latest diagnostic methods for the better diagnosis of BC like utilization of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) BTA (bladder tumor antigen) etc. for the early BC diagnosis.
27077112	CD8(+) T-cell Immune Evasion Enables Oncolytic Virus Immunotherapy.	Although counteracting innate defenses allows oncolytic viruses (OVs) to better replicate and spread within tumors, CD8(+) T-cells restrict their capacity to trigger systemic anti-tumor immune responses. Herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) evades CD8(+) T-cells by producing ICP47, which limits immune recognition of infected cells by inhibiting the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP). Surprisingly, removing ICP47 was assumed to benefit OV immuno-therapy, but the impact of inhibiting TAP remains unknown because human HSV-1 ICP47 is not effective in rodents. Here, we engineer an HSV-1 OV to produce bovine herpesvirus UL49.5, which unlike ICP47, antagonizes rodent and human TAP. Significantly, UL49.5-expressing OVs showed superior efficacy treating bladder and breast cancer in murine models that was dependent upon CD8(+) T-cells. Besides injected subcutaneous tumors, UL49.5-OV reduced untreated, contralateral tumor size and metastases. These findings establish TAP inhibitor-armed OVs that evade CD8(+) T-cells as an immunotherapy strategy to elicit potent local and systemic anti-tumor responses.
27075816	Design of an improved surgical instrument for the removal of bladder tumours.	The aim of this work was to design an add-on instrument that could potentially decrease the recurrence of non-muscle invasive bladder cancer. The current surgical approach permits spilled tumour cells to disseminate within the bladder, re-implant and cause tumour recurrence. An add-on instrument has been designed in the form of an opening cone intended to provide space for surgery and yet reduce tumour cell spillage and dissemination. A prototype was manufactured using the shape memory metal Nitinol which was activated using an electrical current to facilitate opening and supplemented with latex to provide a sealed environment. The prototype was tested in comparable surgical conditions utilising porcine bladder wall and blue dye to simulate tumour cells. It was demonstrated that the vast majority of dye was retained within the device, supporting the proposed aim.
27075288	[Surgical Treatment for Refractory Metastatic Lung Tumors from Urachal Carcinoma after Chemotherapy].	A 33-year-old man underwent radical surgery for urachal cancer. Histology of the cancer revealed an adenocarcinoma of the urachus, Sheldon stage A. He developed a right lung nodule 23 months after the surgery. Partial lobectomy was performed;it revealed an adenocarcinoma compatible with urachal carcinoma. Additionally, 2 right lung metastases measuring 0.5 cm and 1.6 cm in diameter were found 12 months after partial lobectomy. The patient was treated with 4 different chemotherapy regimens including TS-1 and cisplatin, paclitaxel, folinic acidfluorouraciloxaliplatin(FOLFOX), and folinic acidfluorouracilirinotecan (FOLFIRI). Computed tomography reports showed progression of the pulmonary nodules, now measuring 1.4 cm and 10 cm in diameter. There was no evidence of distant metastasis except for in the lung and local recurrence. Right pneumonectomy was performed;the histology of the specimen confirmed urachal adenocarcinoma. Three months later, he developed cerebellar metastasis. The tumor was removed by neurosurgeons. The patient died of widespread metastases 6 months after the pneumonectomy.
27074465	A comparative study of automatic image segmentation algorithms for target tracking in MR-IGRT.	On-board magnetic resonance (MR) image guidance during radiation therapy offers the potential for more accurate treatment delivery. To utilize the real-time image information, a crucial prerequisite is the ability to successfully segment and track regions of interest (ROI). The purpose of this work is to evaluate the performance of different segmentation algorithms using motion images (4 frames per second) acquired using a MR image-guided radiotherapy (MR-IGRT) system. Manual con-tours of the kidney, bladder, duodenum, and a liver tumor by an experienced radiation oncologist were used as the ground truth for performance evaluation. Besides the manual segmentation, images were automatically segmented using thresholding, fuzzy k-means (FKM), k-harmonic means (KHM), and reaction-diffusion level set evolution (RD-LSE) algorithms, as well as the tissue tracking algorithm provided by the ViewRay treatment planning and delivery system (VR-TPDS). The performance of the five algorithms was evaluated quantitatively by comparing with the manual segmentation using the Dice coefficient and target registration error (TRE) measured as the distance between the centroid of the manual ROI and the centroid of the automatically segmented ROI. All methods were able to successfully segment the bladder and the kidney, but only FKM, KHM, and VR-TPDS were able to segment the liver tumor and the duodenum. The performance of the thresholding, FKM, KHM, and RD-LSE algorithms degraded as the local image contrast decreased, whereas the performance of the VP-TPDS method was nearly independent of local image contrast due to the reference registration algorithm. For segmenting high-contrast images (i.e., kidney), the thresholding method provided the best speed (< 1 ms) with a satisfying accuracy (Dice = 0.95). When the image contrast was low, the VR-TPDS method had the best automatic contour. Results suggest an image quality determination procedure before segmentation and a combination of different methods for optimal segmentation with the on-board MR-IGRT system.
27072610	Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy in Neuroendocrine Bladder Cancer: A Case Report.	BACKGROUND: Small cell carcinoma of the urinary bladder is a rare and aggressive form of bladder cancer that mainly presents at an advanced stage. As a result of its rarity, it has been described in many case reports and reviews but few retrospective and prospective trials, showing there is no standard therapeutic approach. In the literature the best therapeutic strategy for limited disease is the multimodality treatment and most authors have extrapolated treatment algorithms from the therapy recommendations of small cell lung cancer. CASE REPORT: A 71-year-old male patient was referred to our hospital with gross hematuria and dysuria. Imaging and cystoscopy revealed a vegetative lesion of the bladder wall. A transurethral resection of the bladder was performed. Pathological examination revealed a pT2 high-grade urothelial carcinoma with widespread neuroendocrine differentiation. Multimodal treatment with neoadjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy was performed. A CT scan performed after chemotherapy demonstrated a radiological complete response. The patient underwent radical cystectomy and lymphadenectomy. The histopathological finding of bladder and node specimen confirmed a pathological complete response. A post-surgery CT scan showed no evidence of local or systemic disease. Six months after surgery, the patient is still alive and disease-free. CONCLUSIONS: A standard treatment strategy of small cell cancer of the urinary bladder is not yet well established, but a multimodal treatment of this disease is the best option compared to surgical therapy alone. The authors confirm the use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy in limited disease of small cell carcinoma of the urinary bladder.
27072536	Clinical role of additional adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with locally advanced urothelial carcinoma following neoadjuvant chemotherapy and cystectomy.	PURPOSE: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) can downstage invasive bladder cancers prior to radical cystectomy (RC) and improve overall survival. However, the optimal management in patients with persistent non-organ confined disease (pT3-T4 and/or pN+) following RC has not been completely defined. The aim of this study was to describe outcomes associated with the use of adjuvant chemotherapy (AC) in patients with residual non-organ confined cancer at RC following NAC. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using data from a high-volume referral institution, pT3-T4 and/or pN+ patients who received NAC and then also RC were identified. Recurrence-free survival (RFS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS) were assessed with Kaplan-Meier analysis. RESULTS: From 2001 to 2013, 161 patients received NAC and then RC. Eighty-eight pT3-T4 and/or pN+ patients were identified. Twenty-nine (33 %) received AC. Adjuvant chemotherapy in the majority of patients was carboplatin-based (16), followed by cisplatin (8) and other, mainly taxane-containing regimens (5). The median RFS was 17.5 months in the AC and 13.7 months in the non-AC group (p = 0.78). AC remained an insignificant predictor for RFS after adjusting for pT, pN and margin status (HR 0.89, 95 % CI 0.48-1.68]). CSS was 23 and 22 months (p = 0.65) and remained insignificant after adjusting for pathologic confounders. CONCLUSIONS: In our current study population, adjuvant conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy was not associated with significant improvements in RFS or CSS. The choice of AC regimens, and incorporation of newer treatments, may be the key for improving outcomes in this high-risk patient group.
27072228	The role of perioperative blood transfusion on postoperative outcomes and overall survival in patients after laparoscopic radical cystectomy.	INTRODUCTION: There are different studies in the last decades focused on general surgery patients and the impact of perioperative blood transfusion (PBT) in cancer patients' survival, and most of them have supported an independent association between PBT and worse survival in those with solid tumor malignancies. The aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of perioperative blood transfusion on the postoperative outcomes and survival of patients after LRC. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective study analyzing our series of 218 patients surgically treated with LRC form 2005 to 2012. One-way analysis of variance test was used. Survival was estimated using the Kaplan - Meier method and was compared with log - rank and the Cox regression model was used to evaluate the association of PBT with the outcomes. RESULTS: The PBT rate of LRC series was 16%. Patients' age, comorbidities and pathological stage were not related to the PBT rate. A statistically significant relationship was found between the PBT rate and the appearance of infectious complications. Overall 3 years survival estimated with the Kaplan-Meier method was significantly worse in the transfused group: 41.38% versus 63.57% for non-transfused patients. PBT was not a significant independent predictor factor in the survival of patients after LRC. The main independent factor was the TNM classification. CONCLUSIONS: Many studies including ours have reported a lower survival rate in patients who receive PBT after oncological surgery. There was a relationship between infectious complications and PBT. We have to make efforts to limit the use of blood products in patients surgically treated with radical cystectomy for bladder cancer.
27072176	Diagnosis and treatment in primary bladder small cell carcinoma: Literature review.	Small cell bladder carcinoma is a rare and frequently fatal disease. It can be distinguished from classical urothelial carcinoma microscopically and immunohistochemically. Small cell bladder carcinoma has histologically similar properties with other small cell carcinomas in other organs. It has a worse prognosis when compared to urothelial bladder cancer. Multimodal treatments are recommended although there is no widely accepted consensus regarding to the treatment algorithm because of its rarity. In this review, clinical properties and diagnosis of small cell bladder carcinoma, its histopathological and immunohistochemical properties and treatment modalities are examined.
27072170	Non-muscle invasive high grade urothelial carcinoma of the bladder. Which factors can influence understaging at the time of radical cystectomy?	OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the main factors which influence understaging in patients with T1G3 non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). MATERIALS AND METHODS: 109 patients with T1/G3 underwent transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) and then radical cystectomy (RC) with pelvic lymph nodes dissection. A number of variables were considered when evaluating the detection of understaging. We considered the patients age and gender, as well as the size, number, location and morphology of their tumor. We also considered coexistence of bladder carcinoma in situ (CIS), microscopic vascular invasion and deep lamina propria invasion. The level of experience of the surgeon was also analyzed. RESULTS: in RC samples muscle invasion, that is understaging, was detected in 74 (67.9%) patients, while 35 (32.1%) patients were appropriately staged. In these cohort of patients with high grade tumors, understaging was associated with deep lamina propria and microscopic vascular invasion, multiple tumors, tumor size &gt; 6 cm, tumor location (trigone and dome), presence of residual tumor; age, gender, tumor morphology, CIS associated, and experience of urological surgeon were not associated with clinical understaging. CONCLUSIONS: in our study, evaluating patients with high grade NMIBC at first TURBT, we identified some risk factors that need to be considered and that are able to increase the risk of understaging: deep lamina propria and microscopic vascular invasion, multiple tumors, tumor size &gt; 6 cm, tumor location (trigone and dome), presence of residual tumor. When these risk factors are present, performing an early cystectomy, and not a re-TURBT, could lower the risk of worse pathological finding due to rapid disease progression of the high grade tumors, and can prolong survival.
27070653	High apoptotic index in urine cytology is associated with high-grade urothelial carcinoma.	BACKGROUND: The significance of apoptosis and its association with high-grade urothelial carcinoma (HGUC) in urine cytology has yet to be determined. METHODS: A computerized search of the study laboratory information system was performed over a 3-year period for all urine cytology specimens processed using the SurePath liquid-based preparation technique. Only those cases with correlating surgical pathology obtained within 6 months after the urine cytologic samples were included in the current study. Cases from ileal conduit samples were excluded. A semiquantitative numerical scoring system (apoptotic index) was used to assess the amount of pyknosis or karyorrhexis, with 0 indicating none, 1 indicating < 10 per 10 high-power fields, 2 indicating 10 to 30 per 10 high-power fields, and 3 indicating > 30 per 10 high-power fields. Statistical analysis using the Pearson chi-square test was performed. RESULTS: A total of 228 cases including 105 benign cases, 79 cases of HGUC, and 44 cases of low-grade urothelial carcinoma (LGUC) diagnosed on follow-up surgical pathology were selected. A score of 0 was observed in 70 benign, 11 HGUC, and 8 LGUC cases; a score of 1 was observed in 31 benign, 21 HGUC, and 23 LGUC cases; a score of 2 was observed in 3 benign, 27 HGUC, and 9 LGUC cases; and a score of 3 was observed in 1 benign, 20 HGUC, and 4 LGUC cases. CONCLUSIONS: Excluding ileal conduit urine specimens, the finding of a high apoptotic index (score >/= 2) with the presence of pyknosis or karyorrhexis in >/=10 per 10 high-power fields in the urine cytology appears to be significantly associated with HGUC (P<.05).

27070449	MAGE-A is More Highly Expressed Than NY-ESO-1 in a Systematic Immunohistochemical Analysis of 3668 Cases.	Two cancer testis antigens, the New York esophageal squamous cell carcinoma-1 (NY-ESO-1) and the melanoma-antigen family A (MAGE-A), represent promising immunotherapy targets due to the low expression of these antigens in nonmalignant tissue. To assess overexpression patterns in various cancers, we performed a systematic immunohistochemical analysis for NY-ESO-1 and MAGE-A on tissue array samples of 3668 common epithelial carcinomas (CA) and germ cell tumors of high prevalence and mortality. Here, we find significantly higher expression of MAGE-A (>50% on tumor cells) compared with NY-ESO-1 in several CAs including cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) (52.8%/2.8%), esophageal SCC (50%/0%), head and neck SCC (41.1%/<1%), bladder urothelial CA (40.4%/8.3%), cervical/anal SCC (37.5%/0%), lung SCC (34%/3.8%), lung adenocarcinomas (27.6%/3.9%), ovarian CA (26.4%/3.6%), endometrial CA (26.3%/1.3%), lung small cell CA (24.4%/2.4%), gastric adenocarcinomas (20%/4%), breast mucinous CA (19.3%/0%), hepatocellular CA (18.8%/1.2%), breast infiltrating ductal CA (16.4%/1.8%), colorectal adenocarcinomas (10.7%/<1%), cholangiocarcinomas (9.8%/0%), thymic CA (9%/4.5%), and mesotheliomas (7.9%/<1%). Furthermore, high expression of MAGE-A, but not NY-ESO-1, was seen in whole slide evaluations of an independent cohort of metastatic SCC (45.5%/3.6%) and metastatic CA (13.5%/0%) of various primaries with significantly higher expression of MAGE-A in metastatic SCC compared with other metastatic CA. MAGE-A is also more highly expressed in germ cell tumors, seminomas (69%/3.5%) and nonseminomas (40.1%/4.7%). In summary, MAGE-A is more highly expressed than NY-ESO-1 in a majority of human malignancies, and targeting MAGE-A may benefit a large number of patients.
27069153	Predictive Value of NRAMP1 and HGPX1 Gene Polymorphism for Maintenance BCG Response in Non-muscle-invasive Bladder Cancer.	AIM: To assess the potential predictive value of natural resistance-associated macrophage protein 1 (NRAMP1) and human glutathione peroxidase 1 (hGPX1) polymorphism in non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer treated with bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) instillation, we conducted an original ancillary multicenter study. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We evaluated patients included in the multicenter URO-BCG 4 trial, who received three weekly instillations of one-third dose BCG every 6 months (group I) or two weekly instillations every 3 months (group II) for 3 years. For clinical evaluation we also evaluated tumor recurrence and muscle progression. NRAMP1 and hGPX1 polymorphism analyses were performed on blood DNA. NRAMP1 exon 15 and hGPX1 exon 1c were amplified using Type-it Microsatellite PCR Kit(R) for multiplex polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: From June 2004 to April 2010, 146 randomized patients were included in this retrospective study. Blood samples were obtained from 107 patients. With 36 months of follow-up, 13.6% of patients had a tumor recurrence and muscle-invasive progression was observed in 4.3% of patients. Concerning NRAMP1 D543N polymorphism, patients with allele A had no tumor recurrence or muscle-invasive progression. No significant difference was observed in gene polymorphism distribution between groups I and II. Moreover, we did not observe any significant association of gene polymorphisms, tumor recurrence or muscle-invasive progression, event time and disease-free survival. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that no significant difference was found for NRAMP1 and hGPX1 gene polymorphisms associated with recurrence time, muscle invasion frequency and disease-free survival, nevertheless, we observed that the NRAMP1 D543N GG genotype group had a shorter time to tumor recurrence.
27069132	Piperazine-based Alpha-1 AR Blocker, Naftopidil, Selectively Suppresses Malignant Human Bladder Cells via Induction of Apoptosis.	A retrospective observational cohort study has shown that exposure to alpha-1 adrenergic receptor (AR) blocker reduces the risk of bladder cancer (BCa). We investigated the antitumor activity of alpha-1 blockers, that are administered long-term therapeutically, in BCa. The antitumor activity of alpha-1 blockers was evaluated in terms of cell viability, cell cycle, competition, and apoptotic signaling in BCa cells. Our cell viability studies showed that naftopidil was one of the strongest alpha-1 AR blockers, regarding its antitumor action in BCa cells, independent of the grade of malignancy, but with no similar action on normal human bladder cells. Oral administration of naftopidil reduced tumor volume in a xenograft model. Our own competitive analysis using an alpha-1 AR agonist and other alpha-1 AR blockers showed that naftopidil activated cell death signaling without inhibitory action on alpha-1 ARs. We conclude that naftopidil has potential as an antitumor drug against BCa in vitro and in vivo. This finding provides a rationale for developing naftopidil in grade-independent treatment of BCa.
27069123	Inhibition of Growth by Combined Treatment with Inhibitors of Lactate Dehydrogenase and either Phenformin or Inhibitors of 6-Phosphofructo-2-kinase/Fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase 3.	Enhanced glycolysis in cancer cells presents a target for chemotherapy. Previous studies have indicated that proliferation of cancer cells can be inhibited by treatment with phenformin and with an inhibitor of 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase 3 (PFKFB) namely 3-(3-pyridinyl)-1-(4-pyridinyl)-2-propen-1-one (3PO). In the present work, the action of two inhibitors that are effective at lower concentrations than 3PO, namely 1-(3-pyridinyl)-3-(2-quinolinyl)-2-propen-1-one (PQP) and 1-(4-pyridinyl)-3-(2-quinolinyl)-2-propen-1-one (PFK15) were investigated. The inhibitors of lactate dehydrogenase (LDHA) studied in order of half-maximal inhibitory concentrations were methyl 1-hydroxy-6-phenyl-4-(trifluoromethyl)-1H-indole-2-carboxylate (NHI-2) < isosafrole < oxamate. In colonic and bladder cancer cells, additive growth inhibitory effects were seen with the LDHA inhibitors, of which NHI-2 was effective at the lowest concentrations. Growth inhibition was generally greater with PFK15 than with PQP. The increased acidification of the culture medium and glucose uptake caused by phenformin was blocked by combined treatment with PFKFB3 or LDHA inhibitors. The results suggest that combined treatment with phenformin and inhibitors of glycolysis can cause additive inhibition of cell proliferation and may mitigate lactic acidosis caused by phenformin when used as a single agent.
27068274	Predicting toxicity in radiotherapy for prostate cancer.	This comprehensive review addresses most organs at risk involved in planning optimization for prostate cancer. It can be considered an update of a previous educational review that was published in 2009 (Fiorino et al., 2009). The literature was reviewed based on PubMed and MEDLINE database searches (from January 2009 up to September 2015), including papers in press; for each section/subsection, key title words were used and possibly combined with other more general key-words (such as radiotherapy, dose-volume effects, NTCP, DVH, and predictive model). Publications generally dealing with toxicity without any association with dose-volume effects or correlations with clinical risk factors were disregarded, being outside the aim of the review. A focus was on external beam radiotherapy, including post-prostatectomy, with conventional fractionation or moderate hypofractionation (<4Gy/fraction); extreme hypofractionation is the topic of another paper in this special issue. Gastrointestinal and urinary toxicity are the most investigated endpoints, with quantitative data published in the last 5years suggesting both a dose-response relationship and the existence of a number of clinical/patient related risk factors acting as dose-response modifiers. Some results on erectile dysfunction, bowel toxicity and hematological toxicity are also presented.
27067860	[A Case of an Unresectable Locally Advanced Rectal Cancer with Surrounding Organ Invasion Successfully Resected after Chemotherapy with mFOLFOX6 plus Cetuximab].	A 63-year-old man visited our hospital with pain on micturition and was found to have a large rectal tumor with urinary bladder invasion on enhanced abdominal computed tomography (CT). The tumor appeared to be unresectable at presentation; thus, sigmoid colostomy was performed and chemotherapy was initiated. The tumor was found to be EGFR-positive and contained a wild-type KRAS. The mFOLFOX6 plus cetuximab (c-mab) regimen was initiated. The follow-up CT scan showed good tumor shrinkage after 4 courses of chemotherapy; 4 additional courses were administered. The tumor eventually regressed by more than 60% and was judged to be resectable. High anterior resection of the rectum with partial resection of the bladder was performed. Abdominal wall metastasis was detected 8 months after surgery, and additional resection was performed. The patient remained well with no other recurrence 8 months after the high anterior resection. Although chemoradiotherapy is the standard preoperative treatment of locally advanced rectal cancer, systemic therapy is effective in certain cases such as substantial tumor invasion of adjacent organs or metastasis. Here, we present a case of rectal cancer that became curatively resectable after preoperative chemotherapy with mFOLFOX6 plus c-mab.
27067857	[A Case of Double Cancer of Initially Unresectable Sigmoid Colon Cancer and Advanced Gastric Cancer Treated with Curative Resection after mFOLFOX6 Therapy].	A 61-year-old man was admitted to our hospital because of a complaint of blood in stool. He was diagnosed with advanced colon and gastric cancers. Computed tomography (CT) revealed a sigmoid tumor with invasion to the bladder, a metastatic tumor in the lateral segmental branch of the left hepatic lobe, and ascites. He was diagnosed with initially unresectable double cancer. Ileostomy was performed immediately, and he was treated with modified (m) FOLFOX6 regimen (oxaliplatin in combination with infusional 5-fluorouracil/Leucovorin). After 6 courses of the mFOLFOX6 regimen, CT revealed that the primary lesion of the sigmoid colon and liver metastasis had reduced in size, and the ascites had disappeared. Gastroscopy revealed that the gastric cancer had disappeared. Biopsy results were negative. Accordingly, his gastric cancer was diagnosed as treatment effect Grade 3. After 8 courses of mFOLFOX6 therapy, sigmoidectomy, partial resection of the bladder, and partial resection of the liver were performed. Gastric cancer was not resected in accordance with his will. Although 40 months has passed after the radical resection, neither the sigmoid colon cancer nor the gastric cancer recurred.
27066716	Structures and biological activities of triterpenes and sesquiterpenes obtained from Russula lepida.	A seco-cucurbitane triterpene and two aristolane sesquiterpenes, named (24E)-3,4-seco-cucurbita-4,24-diene-3-hydroxy-26,29-dioic acid, (+)-1,2-didehydro-9-hydroxy-aristlone, and (+)-12-hydroxy-aristlone, were isolated from fruiting bodies of the medicinal mushroom Russula lepida, together with (24E)-3,4-seco-cucurbita-4,24-diene-3,26,29-trioic acid and (+)-aristlone. The structures of the first three compounds, including their absolute configurations, were assigned on the basis of their NMR and ECD spectra. Two seco-cucurbitane triterpenes, (24E)-3,4-seco-cucurbita-4,24-diene-3-hydroxy-26,29-dioic acid and (24E)-3,4-seco-cucurbita-4,24-diene-3,26,29-trioic acid, inhibited the activity of protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B), with IC50 values of 20.3 and 0.4muM, respectively. All isolated compounds did not show cytotoxicity against human cancer cell lines, Huh-7 (hepatoma) and EJ-1 (bladder), at 50muM.
27064910	Postoperative Quality of Life in Patients with Ileal Neobladder at Short-, Intermediate- and Long-Term Follow-Up.	BACKGROUND: To evaluate the difference at different steps of follow-up of the postoperative quality of life (QoL) in patients who had undergone radical cystectomy and ileal orthotopic neobladder derivation. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A multicentric, cross-qualitative study was performed in 5 Italian centers of reference for the treatment of bladder cancer. One hundred seventy one patients who underwent radical cystectomy and creation of ileal orthotopic neobladder according to 'Vescica Ileale Padovana' between 2006 and 2011 have been analyzed. The validated and dedicated questionnaires EORTC QLQ-C30, IOB-PRO and EORTC QLQ-BLM30 were used. RESULTS: All data gathered were then processed, specifically means +/- SD were included for comparison during 4 periods of follow-up (quartile): the first ranging from 1 to 18 months; the second ranging from 19 to 36 months; the third from 37 to 72 months and the fourth >72 months. Cancer-specific and health-related factors were analyzed separately, and the change was determined during follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: The global QoL, highlighted by validated cancer-specific and health-related questionnaires, is certainly on a satisfactory level. Thus, the education of the patient, the exploration of the pros and cons of an orthotopic neobladder and the active participation in treatment decision seem to be the keys to better improve the post-operative QoL during the follow-up period.
27064870	Deregulation of seven CpG island-harboring miRNAs in bladder cancer: miR-155 and miR-23b as the most promising oncomiRs.	Analyses of differential miRNA expressions in tumor and normal tissues can identify specific miRNAs involved in cancer pathogenesis, which can then be used as diagnostic, therapeutic and prognostic biomarkers. In this respect, we aimed to investigate expression levels of seven CpG island-harboring miRNAs in 50 paired UBC tissues by qRT-PCR. miR-21 and miR-155 were found to be significantly upregulated, and miR-23b, miR-126, miR-129-5p, miR-143a and miR-218-5p were downregulated. ROC analysis indicated miR-155 as the most promising candidate for discrimination of tumors from healthy tissue, and miR-23b for the discrimination of early stage from late stage tumors.
27064313	DWI in the Etiologic Diagnosis of Excretory Upper Urinary Tract Lesions: Can It Help in Differentiating Benign From Malignant Tumors? A Retrospective Study of 98 Patients.	OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic performance of high-field DWI in distinguishing benign from malignant lesions of the upper urinary tract (UUT). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ninety-eight patients who underwent 3-T DWI (b = 1000 s/mm(2)) for assessment of a UUT lesion were retrospectively included in the study. Data on the size, location, and mean apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) value of the lesions were collected and correlated with the final diagnosis. ROC curve analysis was used to determine the best threshold value of the mean ADC for characterization of the lesions. RESULTS: A total of 66 carcinomas and 33 benign lesions were identified. The mean (+/- SD) ADC value was statistically significantly lower for the malignant lesions than for the benign lesions (0.984 +/- 0.048 vs 1.536 +/- 0.067 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s; p = 0.000007). For characterization of malignant lesions, the best cutoff ADC value on the ROC curve was found to be less than or equal to 0.996 10(-3) mm(2)/s. On the basis of this value, the sensitivity and specificity of 3-T DWI for the identification of malignant UUT lesions were 78.3% and 95.5%, respectively, with a positive predictive value of 94.7% and a negative predictive value of 80.8% (p = 0.0001). The thickness of the smallest lesion was 3 mm. The mean ADC value of high-grade tumors was not statistically significantly lower than that of low-grade tumors. The best cutoff value for predicting benignancy was greater than or equal to 1.100 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s with sensitivity of 90.9%, specificity of 82.6%, positive predictive value of 83.3%, and negative predictive value of 90.5%. CONCLUSION: The ADC measurement is a useful additional parameter in the differentiation of benign from malignant UUT lesions.
27058730	Follow the Stream: Imaging of Urinary Diversions.	Urinary diversion is a surgical technique to redirect the stream of urine, most often after cystectomy. Cystectomy may be performed both for benign and for malignant conditions. Bladder cancer is the most common indication for cystectomy, and most patients who undergo radical cystectomy and urinary diversion have muscle-invasive or high-risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer. There are two major surgical approaches for urinary diversions performed after radical cystectomy: continent and incontinent diversions. For incontinent urinary diversions, a cutaneous ostomy is used for continuous urine drainage (eg, ileal conduit). With a continent diversion procedure, the patient may void through the native urethra or self-catheterize through a surgically created stoma. The goals of imaging after urinary diversion are to assess postoperative anatomy, detect postoperative complications, evaluate for residual or recurrent tumor and metastatic disease, and monitor for upper tract distention and/or deterioration. Multiple imaging modalities and techniques may be used to evaluate urinary diversions, including computed tomographic and magnetic resonance urography, intravenous pyelography, ultrasonography, pouchography, loopography, and nephrostomy studies. Knowledge of the expected postoperative appearance after urinary diversions and potential postoperative complications is crucial because many complications may be clinically silent. Radiologists must be able to recognize the expected postoperative appearance as well as complications to facilitate appropriate diagnosis and treatment of patients after cystectomy and urinary diversion.

27057873	Chronic Kidney Disease is Associated With Upper Tract Urothelial Carcinoma: A Nationwide Population-Based Cohort Study in Taiwan.	Increased urinary tract malignancy has been reported in end-stage renal disease (ESRD). However, little is known about chronic kidney disease (CKD). This study is designed to explore the association between CKD and upper tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC).Using Taiwan's Longitudinal Health Insurance Database, we studied CKD patients between January 2000 and December 2011. The non-CKD controls were selected at a ratio of 4:1 and frequency matched by gender, age group, and index date. We used the chi-square test and t test to analyze the sociodemographic information and comorbidities. Cox regression analysis was used to calculate the hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI).The selected cases included 45,321 CKD cases and 181,284 controls. A significantly higher incidence of UTUC was noted in the CKD group (0.22% vs 0.07%, P < 0.001). In univariate analysis, CKD, female gender, age, hypertension, hematuria, repeated urinary tract infection, bladder cancer, and ESRD were all associated with UTUC. In multivariate analysis, only CKD, female gender, age, hematuria, bladder cancer, and ESRD were significantly associated. The HR for CKD was 1.63 (95% CI: 1.26-2.13). Females had a higher HR of 1.38 (95% CI: 1.11-1.71). After excluding those patients who progressed to dialysis or kidney transplantation, the risk for CKD was still high, with an HR of 1.72 (95% CI: 1.33-2.33).CKD is a significant factor associated with UTUC. We should pay attention to the possibility of UTUC for CKD patients before they progress to ESRD.
27057809	Upper tract urothelial carcinoma: special considerations.	Upper tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC) is an uncommon disease with a prognosis worse than that of primary urothelial carcinoma (UC) of the bladder. Although surgery remains the mainstay of UTUC therapy, there is increasing enthusiasm for combined-modality approaches in both adjuvant and neoadjuvant settings. Nephron-sparing surgical strategies, including partial ureterectomy and purely endoscopic tumor resection, are also increasingly used. Through the development of multi-institutional consortiums, novel treatment algorithms can now be used to evaluate patients more efficiently and thoroughly than in the past. In addition, the genome of UC isolates has recently been sequenced and published, making it possible to identify molecular targets for future therapies. By reviewing the epidemiology, current management strategies, and areas of ongoing research in UTUC, we hope to provide a background of knowledge useful to clinicians managing patients with this challenging disease.
27057081	Urinary APE1/Ref-1: A Potential Bladder Cancer Biomarker.	Bladder cancer (BCa) is one of the most common urothelial cancers with still noticeable incidence rate. Early detection of BCa is highly correlated with successful therapeutic outcomes. We previously showed that apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1/redox factor-1 (APE1/Ref-1) was expressed at an increased level in the serum of BCa patients when compared to the level in healthy controls. In this study, we investigated whether urinary APE1/Ref-1 was also elevated in patients with BCa. In this case-control study, voided urine was collected from 277 subjects including 169 BCa patients and 108 non-BCa controls. Urinary APE1/Ref-1 level was assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). APE1/Ref-1 levels were significantly elevated in BCa patients relative to levels in non-BCa controls and were correlated with tumor grade and stage. Urinary APE1/Ref-1 levels were also higher in patients with recurrence history of BCa. The receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve of APE1/Ref-1 showed an area under the curve of 0.83, indicating the reliability and validity of this biomarker. The optimal combination of sensitivity and specificity was determined to be 82% and 80% at a cut-off value of 0.376 ng/100 muL for detection of APE1/Ref-1 in urine. In conclusion, urinary APE1/Ref-1 levels measured from noninvasively obtained body fluids would be clinically applicable for diagnosis of BCa.
27056384	Silence of long noncoding RNA UCA1 inhibits malignant proliferation and chemotherapy resistance to adriamycin in gastric cancer.	PURPOSE: Urothelial carcinoma associated 1 (UCA1) gene is a long noncoding RNA (lncRNA), which shows expression and function abnormality in some kinds of malignant cancers. This study aimed to investigate its clinical significance and to examine its regulative effects of malignant proliferation and chemosensitivity to doxorubicin in gastric cancer cells. METHODS: The expression of UCA1 was detected by quantitative real-time PCR. Statistical analysis was used to determine the relationship between UCA1 expression and clinical features and the prognostic value of UCA1 for disease-free survival. MTT assay was used to detect cell proliferation ability and chemosensitivity. Dual-color flow cytometric method was used to detect cell apoptosis. The expression of cleaved PARP and Bcl-2 protein was examined by Western blot. RESULTS: UCA1 was highly expressed in gastric cancer tissues and cells, and its high expression level had a positive correlation with some malignant pathological characteristics of gastric cancer, such as higher grade and poor differentiation. Moreover, UCA1 was an independent prognostic biomarker of disease-free survival for gastric cancer patients. Silence of UCA1 could significantly inhibit the cell proliferation of gastric cancer BGC-823 and SGC7901 cells. The chemotherapy resistance to adriamycin of SGC7901/ADR cells was depressed by UCA1 silence, and IC50 for adriamycin presented a conspicuous depression. UCA1 silence advanced apoptosis induced by adriamycin in SGC7901/ADR cells, up-regulated cleaved PARP protein expression and depressed the expression of anti-apoptosis protein Bcl-2. These results demonstrated that chemotherapy resistance changes induced by UCA1 silence might be mediated by the cell apoptosis pathway. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, lncRNA UCA1 was an independent prognostic biomarker of disease-free survival in gastric cancer patients and acted as an oncogene to regulate the malignant proliferation and resistance to adriamycin in gastric cancer cells. UCA1 might provide a new potential therapeutic target and stratagem for gastric cancer.
27055785	Significant association of catechol-O-methyltransferase Val158Met polymorphism with bladder cancer instead of prostate and kidney cancer.	BACKGROUND: Urological cancers occur worldwide. Many factors, among which the catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) Val158Met polymorphism, are said to be associated with the cancer risk. We conducted a meta-analysis to investigate the association between urological cancer susceptibility and COMT Val158Met in different genetic models. METHODS: This study was based on material obtained from the PubMed, HuGENet and Embase databases. Four models including dominant (AA + AG vs. GG), recessive (AA vs. AG + GG), codominant (AA vs. AG, AA vs. GG) and per-allele analysis (A vs. G) were applied. Odds ratios (OR) and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) were used to evaluate the power of the associations. RESULTS: Fourteen eligible studies comprising 3,285 cases and 3,594 controls were included. Although we could not detect a positive function of the COMT Val158Met polymorphism in urological cancers, the polymorphism might be significantly associated with bladder cancer risk (dominant model [AA + AG vs. GG]: OR = 0.736, 95% CI = 0.586-0.925, I2 = 0.00%; recessive model [AA vs. AG + GG]: OR = 0.822, 95%CI = 0.653-1.035, I2 = 6.30%; codominant model [AA vs. AG]: OR = 0.908, 95% CI = 0.710-1.161, I2 = 0.00%; codominant model [AA vs. GG]: OR = 0.693, 95% CI = 0.524-0.917, I2 = 30.20%; allele analysis [A vs. G]: OR = 0.826, 95%CI = 0.717-0.951, I2 = 30.20%). The same significant associations were not found for kidney cancer and prostate cancer risk in different ethnicities. There also seemed to be no distinct effect of the polymorphism on benign prostatic hyperplasia. CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that bladder cancer but not prostate cancer and kidney cancer could be significantly associated with the Val158Met polymorphism. Interaction of COMT genetic and related environmental factors for urological cancers should not be ignored in future.
27055644	[Effect of synthetic small double-stranded RNA on the development of bladder cancer by activating P21 expression].	OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of a synthetic small double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) dsP21-555 on the development of bladder cancer cell lines T24 and EJ. METHODS: According to the different treatments, bladder cancer cells were divided into three groups: negative control group (transfected with dsControl), positive control group (transfected with candidate microRNA, i.e. miR-370) and experimental group (transfected with dsP21-555). Real-time fluorescent quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was conducted to detect the expressions of p21 mRNA and cyclin-dependent kinases 4/6 (CDK4/6) mRNA; Western blot was operated to verify the expression of P21 and CDK4/6 proteins. Cell cycle distribution was measured by flow cytometry after transfection. Cell proliferation assay was performed to evaluate the proliferative capacity of transfected cells. Colony formation assay was carried out to analyze the proliferative ability of single cancer cells. RESULTS: qPCR showed that, compared with the negative control group, dsP21-555 up-regulated the expressions of p21 mRNA by 2.46 times (P<0.01) in T24 cells and 2.60 times (P<0.01) in EJ cells; compared with the positive control group, the expression of p21 mRNA was no significantly different in the experimental group (P>0.05). Compared with the dsControl group, dsP21-555 suppressed the expressions of CDK4 mRNA by 43% (P<0.01) in T24 and 54% (P<0.01) in EJ cells, the expression of CDK6 mRNA by 39% (P<0.01) in T24 and 36% (P<0.01) in EJ cells; the differences in the expression of CDK4 and CDK6 mRNAs between the miR-370 and dsP21-555 groups were not statistically significant (P> 0.05). Western blot verified the differences of p21 and CDK4/6 genes expression among groups. Flow cytometry revealed that the G0/G1 phase cells significantly increased while S and G2/M phase cells decreased in the miR-370 and the dsP21-555 groups, compared with the dsControl group. Cell proliferation assay showed that, compared with the dsControl group, the proliferative capacities of cells transfected with miR-370 or dsP21-555 decreased significantly (both P<0.05), but the difference in proliferative capacities between the miR-370 and the dsP21-555 groups was no statistically significant (P>0.05). Colony formation assay showed that the numbers of colonies formed in the miR-370 and the dsP21-555 groups were both smaller than that in the dsControl group. CONCLUSION: dsP21-555 may activate the expression of P21 protein by RNA activation, thereby significantly inhibit the growth of bladder cancer cells.
27055486	Adaptive radiotherapy strategies for pelvic tumors - a systematic review of clinical implementations.	UNLABELLED: Introdution: Variation in shape, position and treatment response of both tumor and organs at risk are major challenges for accurate dose delivery in radiotherapy. Adaptive radiotherapy (ART) has been proposed to customize the treatment to these motion/response patterns of the individual patients, but increases workload and thereby challenges clinical implementation. This paper reviews strategies and workflows for clinical and in silico implemented ART for prostate, bladder, gynecological (gyne) and ano-rectal cancers. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Initial identification of papers was based on searches in PubMed. For each tumor site, the identified papers were screened independently by two researches for selection of studies describing all processes of an ART workflow: treatment monitoring and evaluation, decision and execution of adaptations. Both brachytherapy and external beam studies were eligible for review. RESULTS: The review consisted of 43 clinical studies and 51 in silico studies. For prostate, 1219 patients were treated with offline re-planning, mainly to adapt prostate motion relative to bony anatomy. For gyne 1155 patients were treated with online brachytherapy re-planning while 25 ano-rectal cancer patients were treated with offline re-planning, all to account for tumor regression detected by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)/computed tomography (CT). For bladder and gyne, 161 and 64 patients, respectively, were treated with library-based online plan selection to account for target volume and shape variations. The studies reported sparing of rectum (prostate and bladder cancer), bladder (ano-rectal cancer) and bowel cavity (gyne and bladder cancer) as compared to non-ART. CONCLUSION: Implementations of ART were dominated by offline re-planning and online brachytherapy re-planning strategies, although recently online plan selection workflows have increased with the availability of cone-beam CT. Advantageous dosimetric and outcome patterns using ART was documented by the studies of this review. Despite this, clinical implementations were scarce due to challenges in target/organ re-contouring and suboptimal patient selection in the ART workflows.
27055134	Radio-Guided Lymph Node Mapping in Bladder Cancer Using SPECT/CT and Intraoperative gamma-Probe Methods.	PURPOSE: Lymph outflow from bladder tumor differs between individuals, making the prediction of the metastatic landing sites difficult. A "blind" template of lymphadenectomy has been tested as a solution to this problem. We believe that it is feasible to find methods enabling more precise lymph nodes (LNs) evaluation. The aims of our study were to evaluate the possibility of LNs mapping in case of muscle invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) and to compare the 2 methods of their detection. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Our study group consisted of 38 cN0 MIBC patients. Lymph nodes mapping was performed by SPECT/CT lymphoscintigraphy using Tc-nanocolloid, followed by intraoperative verification with gamma-ray probe. Lymph nodes with increased radiotracer uptake (hot spots) were removed, and then pelvic LNs dissection was conducted. Lymph nodes resected as hot spots and LNs resected with lymphadenectomy were separately examined by a pathologist. RESULTS: An average of 3 hot spots (range, 1-5) were identified in each case. For 36 of 38 patients, both preoperative SPECT/CT and intraoperative gamma-probe evaluation results were obtained. Ninety-five percent of hot spots were found distally and caudally to the uretero-iliac crossing; 5% were found proximal. Lymph nodes outside the pelvic LNs dissection area did not contain metastases. In 2 patients, metastases were found in LNs without increased radiotracer uptake, and the observed hot spots contained no metastases. CONCLUSIONS: Radio-guided LNs mapping in case of MIBC is feasible. Preoperative detection of hot spots using SPECT/CT and intraoperative gamma-ray detection probe gives similar results.
27053450	mARC prostate treatment planning with Varian Eclipse for flat vs. FFF beams.	PURPOSE: The modulated arc (mARC) technique as an alternative to VMAT is a rotational IMRT irradiation with burst mode delivery. Varian has recently implemented an option for mARC-planning into the Eclipse treatment planning system (TPS) and so far mARC-planning with this TPS has not been evaluated systematically. Therefore, for prostate treatment with Eclipse we compare mARC with IMRT using flat (6MV) and flattening-filter-free (FFF, 7MV) beam energies. METHODS: For ten prostate cancer patients standardized re-contouring and re-planning was performed with a prescription of 76Gy to the complete planning-target-volume (PTV). IMRT and mARC plans (6MV vs. FFF 7MV) were compared pairwise considering indices for plan quality. All plans were delivered on an anthromorphic phantom equipped with thermoluminescent dosimeters to measure out-of-field dose and treatment times. RESULTS: Regarding PTV coverage, there was no marked preference for either technique or energy. The evaluation of organs at risk showed improved bladder sparing of the mARC plans up to about 75Gy; above this dose the IMRT plans achieved significant better sparing. The use of the FFF-beam-energy and mARC-technique resulted in a significant decrease in out-of-field dose. This combination also led to a drastic reduction of treatment time by factor of three in comparison with 6MV IMRT. CONCLUSION: While highly conformal treatment plans could be created by the use of all modalities, the combination of the high dose rate with mARC appears to be the preferable option as it benefits from a marked decrease in treatment time and out-of-field dose.
27053449	Bladder dose-surface maps and urinary toxicity: Robustness with respect to motion in assessing local dose effects.	The purpose of this study was to quantify the impact of inter-fraction modifications of bladder during RT of prostate cancer on bladder dose surface maps (DSM). Eighteen patients treated with daily image-guided Tomotherapy and moderate hypofractionation (70-72.8Gy at 2.5-2.6Gy/fr in 28 fractions and full bladder) were considered. Bladder contours were delineated on co-registered daily Megavoltage CT (MVCT) by a single observer and copied on the planning CT to generate dose-volume/surface histograms (DVH/DSH) and bladder DSMs. Discrepancies between planned and daily absorbed doses were analyzed through the average of individual systematic errors, the population systematic errors and the population random errors for the DVH/DSHs and DSMs. In total, 477 DVH/DSH and 472 DSM were available. DSH and DVH showed small population systematic errors of absolute surfaces (<3.4cm(2)) and volumes (<8.4cm(3)) at the highest doses. The dose to the posterior bladder base assessed on DSMs showed a mean systematic error below 1Gy, with population systematic and random errors within 4 and 3Gy, respectively. The region surrounding this area shows higher mean systematic errors (1-3Gy), population systematic (8-11Gy) and random (5-7Gy) errors. In conclusion, DVH/DSH and DSMs are quite stable with respect to inter-fraction variations in the high-dose region, within about 2cm from bladder base. Larger systematic variations occur in the anterior portion and cranially 2.5-3.5cm from the base. Results suggest that dose predictors related to the high dose area (including the trigone dose) are likely to be sufficiently reliable with respect to the expected variations due to variable bladder filling.
27053367	Reducing understaging of bladder cancer with the aid of photodynamic cystoscopy.	BACKGROUND: The authors evaluated the role of photodynamic cystoscopy in the detection of additional urothelial lesions, mainly carcinoma in situ, that would not be detected solely with white light cystoscopy, leading to disease understaging. METHODS: From 2009 to 2011, 70 patients underwent white light cystoscopy, followed by photodynamic cystoscopy (blue light system, Karl Storz, Tuttlingen, Germany). Preoperatively they were instilled intravesically with 50ml of Hexvix (Hexaminolevulinate hexylester). We recorded all lesions found with white light cystoscopy and the additional lesions revealed by blue light cystoscopy. Afterward all lesions were removed and sent for pathologic evaluation. RESULTS: Seventeen patients (24.3%) had primary tumors while 53 patients (75.7%) had recurrent disease. In 53 out of 70 patients (75.7%) white light cystoscopy revealed urothelial lesions. In the rest 17 patients who had no findings with white light cystoscopy, blue light cystoscopy revealed 7 cases of Cis (41.2%) and 8 cases of dysplasia (47%). In the group of patients with visible lesions in white light cystoscopy photodynamic cystoscopy revealed additional carcinoma in situ in 22 patients. Altogether additional carcinoma in situ cases found with the aid of photodynamic cystoscopy were 29 out of 70 cases (41.4%). CONCLUSIONS: Photodynamic cystoscopy is the most efficient diagnostic procedure for flat urothelial lesions and especially for carcinoma in situ. It is significantly more sensitive than conventional white light cystoscopy in Cis diagnosis, thus reducing understaging of the disease and consequently improving recurrence and progression rates.
27052470	Expression of Estrogen Receptor Beta Predicts Oncologic Outcome of pT3 Upper Urinary Tract Urothelial Carcinoma Better Than Aggressive Pathological Features.	Upper urinary tract urothelial carcinoma (UT-UC) is rare and treatment options or prognostic markers are limited. There is increasing evidence indicating that urothelial carcinoma may be an endocrine-related cancer. The aim of this study was to analyze the prognostic effect of estrogen receptor beta (ERbeta) on the outcome of UT-UC. From 2005 to 2012, this study included 105 patients with pT3 UT-UC. Perioperative factors, pathological features, and ERbeta immunostaining were reviewed and prognostic effects were examined by multivariate analysis. This study divided patients into either the ERbeta-high (n = 52) or ERbeta-low (n = 53) group and analyzed their oncologic outcomes. All pathological features except infiltrating tumor architecture (significantly higher incidence in ERbeta-low group, p = 0.004) are symmetric in both groups. Low ERbeta expression was significantly correlated with local recurrence and distant metastasis in univariate analysis (p = 0.035 and 0.004, respectively) and multivariate analysis (p = 0.05 and 0.008, respectively). Cell line study also proved that knock down of ERbeta cause less UTUC proliferation and migration. In addition, ERbeta agonist also enhanced the cytotoxic and migration inhibition effect of cisplatin and ERbeta antagonist cause the UTUC cell more resistant to cisplatin. This result may help identify patients in need of adjuvant therapy or develop potential targeted therapy.
27052114	Urologic cancer in Taiwan.	For the past three decades, cancer is the number one cause of death in Taiwan. An increasing trend in the incidence of urologic cancers has also been noticed since 1979. In 2012, urologic cancer accounted for 10.0% of all the new malignant cases. Prostate, bladder and kidney cancers are the most common types. Metastatic prostate cancer still accounted for nearly 30% of new cases in Taiwan between 2004 and 2012. There are several specifically noticeable characteristics of urothelial carcinoma in Taiwan, associated with arseniasis and aristolochic acid. The diagnosis and treatment of urologic cancer mainly follows the current international guidelines. The development of minimal invasive surgery, especially DaVinci robotic surgical system, has made a marked change in the surgical treatment of urologic cancer. Meanwhile, newer systemic agents also commence and improve our standard of care. However, treatment decisions are greatly influenced by the National Health Insurance coverage. The current national cancer registry system should be renovated more comprehensively in order to gain better insight into specific features of urologic cancer in Taiwan.
27050898	A Case Report of an Incidentally Diagnosed Blind-ending Bifid Ureter in a Patient with Ovarian Cancer.	A 58-year-old Japanese female was admitted to our hospital for treatment of ovarian cancer. She had no urinary tract symptoms at the time of presentation. Preoperative CT (Computed Tomography) was performed for surgical planning, and it revealed two left-sided ureters including a short ureter with a blind, cystic ending and a short ureter joined to the main ureter before entering into the bladder. On CT urography, these radiological findings were compatible with a blind-ending bifid ureter. Preoperatively, a double J stent was inserted into the normal left ureter, and then the blind-ending bifid ureter was resected before an ovarian cancer operation.
27050171	Advanced optimization methods for whole pelvic and local prostate external beam therapy.	PURPOSE: Radiation treatment planning inherently involves multiple conflicting planning goals, which makes it a suitable application for multicriteria optimization (MCO). This study investigates a MCO algorithm for VMAT planning (VMAT-MCO) for prostate cancer treatments including pelvic lymph nodes and uses standard inverse VMAT optimization (sVMAT) and Tomotherapy planning as benchmarks. METHODS: For each of ten prostate cancer patients, a two stage plan was generated, consisting of a stage 1 plan delivering 22Gy to the prostate, and a stage 2 plan delivering 50.4Gy to the lymph nodes and 56Gy to the prostate with a simultaneous integrated boost. The single plans were generated by three planning techniques (VMAT-MCO, sVMAT, Tomotherapy) and subsequently compared with respect to plan quality and planning time efficiency. RESULTS: Plan quality was similar for all techniques, but sVMAT showed slightly better rectum (on average Dmean -7%) and bowel sparing (Dmean -17%) compared to VMAT-MCO in the whole pelvic treatments. Tomotherapy plans exhibited higher bladder dose (Dmean +42%) in stage 1 and lower rectum dose (Dmean -6%) in stage 2 than VMAT-MCO. Compared to manual planning, the planning time with MCO was reduced up to 12 and 38min for stage 1 and 2 plans, respectively. CONCLUSION: MCO can generate highly conformal prostate VMAT plans with minimal workload in the settings of prostate-only treatments and prostate plus lymph nodes irradiation. In the whole pelvic plan manual VMAT optimization led to slightly improved OAR sparing over VMAT-MCO, whereas for the primary prostate treatment plan quality was equal.
27049022	Urologic cancer in China.	Cancer remains to be the second most common cause of death, and its incidence and mortality rates are increasing in China. According to the 2015 National Central Cancer Registry (NCCR) of China, the incidence of bladder cancer and prostate cancer ranked sixth and seventh, respectively, in male cancers. The majority of prostate cancer patients were diagnosed at an advanced stage. Early diagnosis of prostate cancer is the key to improve prostate cancer survival in China. Radical prostatectomy or radical radiotherapy is the main treatment for localized prostate cancer, and a comprehensive therapy based on androgen deprivation therapy is the treatment for advanced disease. The most common histologic types of bladder cancer in China were urothelial carcinoma, followed by adenocarcinoma and squamous carcinoma. The majority of patients were diagnosed using white-light cystoscopy with biopsy. Fluorescence and narrow-band imaging cystoscopy had additional detection rates and are becoming more popular. Following Chinese guidelines, most non-muscle invasive bladder cancer patients were treated with diagnostic transurethral resection and more than half of the muscle invasive bladder cancer patients were treated with radical cystectomy. Due to the increased detection rate of kidney tumors by ultrasound in physical examination, the number of incidentally diagnosed renal cell carcinoma has increased. Localized kidney cancers are more and more often treated by nephron-sparing surgery. Radical nephrectomy is still the main treatment option for patients with locally advanced renal cell carcinoma. Both laparoscopic and robotic-assisted laparoscopic surgeries have been used in big medical centers. Both testicular cancer and penile cancer have lower incidence levels than that in Europe. As we have an enormous population base, the absolute patient number is big. The diagnosis and treatment follows the Chinese guidelines. In China, both medical professionals and public should concern more on the early diagnosis, as there is not enough cancer prevention information available. Urologists should also take a more active role in educating the population.
27046651	LncRNA-UCA1 enhances cell proliferation and 5-fluorouracil resistance in colorectal cancer by inhibiting miR-204-5p.	Recent preliminary studies reported the in vitro tumor-promoting effects of long non-coding RNA urothelial carcinoma associated 1 (UCA1) in colorectal cancer (CRC). However, the in vivo functions and molecular mechanism of UCA1 in CRC remain unclear. Therefore, we investigated the detailed role and mechanism of UCA1 in CRC. We found that UCA1 was up-regulated in CRCs and negatively correlated with survival time in two CRC cohorts. Functional assays revealed the in vitro and in vivo growth-promoting function of UCA1 and revealed that UCA1 can decrease the sensitivity of CRC cells to 5-FU by attenuating apoptosis. Further mechanistic studies revealed that UCA1 could sponge endogenous miR-204-5p and inhibit its activity. We also identified CREB1 as a new target of miR-204-5p. The protein levels of CREB1 were significantly up-regulated in CRCs, negatively associated with survival time and positively correlated with the UCA1 expression. The present work provides the first evidence of a UCA1-miR-204-5p-CREB1/BCL2/RAB22A regulatory network in CRC and reveals that UCA1 and CREB1 are potential new oncogenes and prognostic factors for CRC.
27045034	Prognostic Significance of VEGF after Twenty-Year Follow-up in a Randomized Trial of Fenretinide in Non-Muscle-Invasive Bladder Cancer.	Non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) may progress to muscle-invasive disease, but no effective preventive treatments are available. In addition, no reliable prognostic biomarkers have been identified. We assessed the long-term effect of the oral retinoid fenretinide and the prognostic value of circulating VEGF levels. We updated through the Tumor Registry the vital status of 99 patients with resected Ta/T1 bladder tumors who were recruited in a randomized trial of 2 years of fenretinide or no treatment in 1993-1994. Serum VEGF levels measured at baseline and 12 months were available in a subgroup of 62 patients. After a median of 20.5 years, 54 subjects died, 35 of any cancer and 14 of bladder cancer. Neither overall survival (OS), nor cancer survival (CS) or bladder cancer survival (BCS) was affected by fenretinide (log-rank P >/= 0.2). DNA aneuploidy in bladder washing was associated with shorter OS (P = 0.02), CS (P = 0.05), and BCS (P = 0.09). Subjects with baseline VEGF levels in the top quintile (>/=350 pg/mL) had a significantly shorter OS (P = 0.01), CS (P = 0.02), and BCS (P = 0.008). The trend across quintiles of VEGF was significant for BCS (P = 0.007). Multivariate analyses showed that, in addition to smoking status, VEGF level in the top quintile was an independent prognostic factor for OS (HR = 2.7; 95% CI, 1.1-6.5), CS (HR = 3.3; 95% CI, 1.1-9.4) and BCS (HR = 8.9; 95% CI,1.3-61). Fenretinide did not affect the long-term outcome of patients with NMIBC. High serum VEGF level was a significant predictor of overall and cancer death and may help to identify high-risk subjects who may benefit from a preventive therapy. Cancer Prev Res; 9(6); 437-44.

27044355	Potential of sulfasalazine as a therapeutic sensitizer for CD44 splice variant 9-positive urogenital cancer.	Cancer stem-like cells (CSCs) with high expression of CD44 splice variant (CD44v) have an enhanced capacity for intracellular reduced glutathione synthesis and defense against reactive oxygen species, resulting in resistance to various therapeutic stresses. Sulfasalazine (SSZ), a drug used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), inhibits glutamate-cystine transport, and suppressed CD44v-dependent tumor growth and increased sensitivity to cytotoxic drugs in an in vivo study. Here, we present two cases of CD44v9-positive urogenital cancer with concomitant treatment with SSZ for RA. Patient 1 was a 62-year-old man who had received SSZ for RA beginning 2 months before the diagnosis of urinary bladder cancer. Although he had multiple metastases to the bladder, abdominal, left cervical and left axillary lymph nodes, and brain, complete response with multidisciplinary therapy was maintained for more than 2 years. Patient 2 was a 74-year-old man with castration-resistant prostate cancer who was diagnosed with RA during chemotherapy and a gradual increase in prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level. When SSZ was added, his PSA value (ng/mL) decreased from 12.93 to 5.58 in only 2 weeks and then quickly rebounded, whereas levels of neuron-specific enolase, a neuroendocrine differentiator and CSC marker, remained almost unchanged. We therefore speculate that SSZ treatment may represent a new adjuvant treatment option for patients with CD44v9-positive urogenital cancer.
27041407	Using Patient-reported Outcomes to Compare Relative Burden of Cancer: EQ-5D and Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General in Eleven Types of Cancer.	PURPOSE: The objective of this study was to compare the health-related quality of life (HRQL) burden across different types of advanced cancer with the use of 2 widely used patient-reported outcome measures, the generic EQ-5D and the cancer-specific Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General (FACT-G). METHODS: Patients with advanced cancer of the bladder, brain, breast, colon/rectum, head/neck, hepatobiliary tract/pancreas, kidney, lung, lymphoma, ovary, or prostate completed the EQ-5D and FACT-G. HRQL domains and summary scores were compared across types of cancer, using regression models to adjust for age and sex. FINDINGS: Approximately 50 patients with each type of cancer were recruited (total, 534 patients). According to EQ-5D dimensions, the highest proportion of problems was associated with prostate (mobility); prostate and kidney (self-care); head/neck, bladder, and lung (usual activities); breast, head/neck, and lung (pain/discomfort); and lymphoma and lung (anxiety/depression) cancers. EQ-5D visual analogue scale scores were lowest for breast and head/neck cancers; US index-based scores were lowest for breast and lung cancers and highest for brain cancer. For the FACT-G, physical well-being scores were lowest for head/neck, hepatobiliary, and kidney cancers; emotional well-being scores were lowest for hepatobiliary cancer, and functional well-being scores were lowest for head/neck, hepatobiliary, and bladder cancers. IMPLICATIONS: The overall and dimension-specific HRQL burden of advanced cancer depended on the type of cancer. Such results may aid clinicians and patients in better understanding of how cancer site can affect HRQL and functioning in different ways.
27040924	Recurrent TERT promoter mutations in urothelial carcinoma and potential clinical applications.	Increased telomerase activity is associated with almost all types of advanced human cancers with unknown molecular mechanism(s). Two recurrent point mutations in the promoter region of telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT)--the key subunit of telomerase--have recently been identified in melanoma as well as a small sample of bladder cancer cell lines. However, the incidence and clinical-pathological significance of these mutations in urothelial carcinoma have not been well established yet. We collected 86 specimens of urothelial carcinoma including upper and lower urinary tract: high grade and low grade, invasive and noninvasive, and primary and metastatic. We also included some matched benign urothelium and common benign bladder lesions: cystitis, nephrogenic adenoma, and inverted papilloma. In addition, we collected urine samples for urothelial carcinoma workup; blood samples from patients underwent cystectomy with extensive lymphovascular invasion. All specimens were subject to polymerase chain reaction amplification and bidirectional Sanger sequencing for the TERT promoter mutations: C228T and C250T. We found that 64 (74%) of 86 carcinoma samples harbored 1 of the 2 TERT promoter mutations (C228T, n = 54; C250T, n = 10); the incidences were roughly equal regardless of site of origin, histologic grade, and invasive status. All matched benign and benign lesion samples showed wild-type sequence. These TERT promoter mutations are the most common genetic alterations in urothelial carcinoma and are not associated with tumor locations, grade, or invasiveness. Importantly, the feasibility of detecting these mutations in urine samples may provide a novel method to detect urothelial carcinoma in urine.
27040885	A Case of Severe Rectal Hemorrhage Possibly Caused by Radiation Recall after Administration of Gemcitabine.	Radiation recall is an acute inflammatory reaction that can be triggered when systemic agents are administered long time after radiotherapy. Because radiotherapy is now indicated for many types of cancer, care should be taken regarding possible toxic events relating to radiotherapy in combination with radio-sensitizing agents. Gemcitabine, one such anti-cancer agent, is widely used, especially for urologic cancers. We report an intriguing case of possible radiation recall in the rectum caused by gemcitabine administration 37 years after radiation therapy. From a review of the literature, it appears that there have been no reported cases of radiation recall in the rectum with such a long interval between radiation therapy and chemotherapy. Here, we describe the case and provide a literature review.
27040844	Diffuse malignant mesothelioma and synchronous lung cancer: A clinicopathological study of 18 cases.	OBJECTIVES: To examine the clinicopathologic characteristics of individuals with diffuse malignant mesothelioma (DMM) occurring concurrently with lung cancer (LC). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A database of approximately 3800 patients with DMM was reviewed, from which 18 patients (0.5%) who had synchronous LC were identified. The clinicopathologic features, as well as the occupational exposure history and fiber burden analysis data were examined. RESULTS: The patient median age was 68 years (range 58-84 years). Of the 18 patients (14 male, 4 female), 11 (61%) had epithelial, 5 (28%) had biphasic, and 2 (11%) had sarcomatoid DMM, with the majority (16 cases; 89%) originating in the pleura and only 2 were peritoneal. Among the histologic types of LC, adenocarcinoma was most frequent (12 cases; 67%), while 5 cases of squamous cell carcinoma, and 1 case of small cell carcinoma were observed. Three patients also had a history of prior malignancy (1 with testicular seminoma and bladder carcinoma and 2 with prostate carcinoma). Fifteen patients had a positive smoking history. All but 3 had documented asbestos exposure. Three had histologic features of asbestosis. Mineral analysis performed in 8 showed an elevated asbestos fiber burden in 4 (22%). Amosite was detected in 4 patients, crocidolite in 3, and non-commercial amphiboles in 5. CONCLUSION: The finding of simultaneous carcinoma of the lung and DMM is distinctly unusual. The majority of patients are male smokers with pleural epithelial DMM and lung adenocarcinoma. This study represents the largest cohort of patients reported to date with synchronous malignant mesothelioma and lung cancer, and we propose guidelines for making a diagnosis of synchronous malignant mesothelioma and primary lung cancer.
27036584	Urinary bladder segmentation in CT urography using deep-learning convolutional neural network and level sets.	PURPOSE: The authors are developing a computerized system for bladder segmentation in CT urography (CTU) as a critical component for computer-aided detection of bladder cancer. METHODS: A deep-learning convolutional neural network (DL-CNN) was trained to distinguish between the inside and the outside of the bladder using 160 000 regions of interest (ROI) from CTU images. The trained DL-CNN was used to estimate the likelihood of an ROI being inside the bladder for ROIs centered at each voxel in a CTU case, resulting in a likelihood map. Thresholding and hole-filling were applied to the map to generate the initial contour for the bladder, which was then refined by 3D and 2D level sets. The segmentation performance was evaluated using 173 cases: 81 cases in the training set (42 lesions, 21 wall thickenings, and 18 normal bladders) and 92 cases in the test set (43 lesions, 36 wall thickenings, and 13 normal bladders). The computerized segmentation accuracy using the DL likelihood map was compared to that using a likelihood map generated by Haar features and a random forest classifier, and that using our previous conjoint level set analysis and segmentation system (CLASS) without using a likelihood map. All methods were evaluated relative to the 3D hand-segmented reference contours. RESULTS: With DL-CNN-based likelihood map and level sets, the average volume intersection ratio, average percent volume error, average absolute volume error, average minimum distance, and the Jaccard index for the test set were 81.9% +/- 12.1%, 10.2% +/- 16.2%, 14.0% +/- 13.0%, 3.6 +/- 2.0 mm, and 76.2% +/- 11.8%, respectively. With the Haar-feature-based likelihood map and level sets, the corresponding values were 74.3% +/- 12.7%, 13.0% +/- 22.3%, 20.5% +/- 15.7%, 5.7 +/- 2.6 mm, and 66.7% +/- 12.6%, respectively. With our previous CLASS with local contour refinement (LCR) method, the corresponding values were 78.0% +/- 14.7%, 16.5% +/- 16.8%, 18.2% +/- 15.0%, 3.8 +/- 2.3 mm, and 73.9% +/- 13.5%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The authors demonstrated that the DL-CNN can overcome the strong boundary between two regions that have large difference in gray levels and provides a seamless mask to guide level set segmentation, which has been a problem for many gradient-based segmentation methods. Compared to our previous CLASS with LCR method, which required two user inputs to initialize the segmentation, DL-CNN with level sets achieved better segmentation performance while using a single user input. Compared to the Haar-feature-based likelihood map, the DL-CNN-based likelihood map could guide the level sets to achieve better segmentation. The results demonstrate the feasibility of our new approach of using DL-CNN in combination with level sets for segmentation of the bladder.
27036110	The serine protease prostasin (PRSS8) is a potential biomarker for early detection of ovarian cancer.	BACKGROUND: Ovarian cancer (OVC) is the deadliest of all gynecologic cancers, primarily as a consequence of asymptomatic progression. The complex nature of OVC creates challenges for early detection, and there is a lack of specific and sensitive biomarkers suitable for screening and detecting early stage OVC. METHODS: Potential OVC biomarkers were identified by bioinformatic analysis. Candidates were further screened for differential expression in a library of OVC cell lines. OVC-specific overexpression of a candidate gene, PRSS8, which encodes prostasin, was confirmed against 18 major human cancer types from 390 cancer samples by qRT-PCR. PRSS8 expression profiles stratified by OVC tumor stage-, grade- and subtype were generated using cDNA samples from 159 OVC samples. Cell-specific expression and localization of prostasin was determined by immunohistological tissue array analysis of more than 500 normal, benign, and cancerous ovarian tissues. The presence of prostasin in normal, benign, and OVC serum samples was also determined. RESULTS: Gene expression analysis indicated that PRSS8 was expressed in OVC at levels more than 100 fold greater than found in normal or benign ovarian lesions. This overexpression signature was found in early stages of OVC and was maintained in higher stages and grades of OVC. The PRSS8 overexpression signature was specific for OVC and urinary bladder cancer among 18 human cancer types. The majority of ovarian cell lines overexpressed PRSS8. In situ hybridization and histopathology studies of OVC tissues indicated that overexpression of prostasin was largely localized to tumor epithelium and was absent in neighboring stroma. Significantly higher levels of prostasin were found in early stage OVC serum samples compared to benign ovarian and normal donor samples. CONCLUSIONS: The abundant amounts of secreted prostasin found in sera of early stage OVC can potentially be used as a minimally invasive screening biomarker for early stage OVC. Overexpression of PRSS8 mRNA and high levels of prostasin in multiple subtypes of early stage ovarian tumors may provide clinical biomarkers for early detection of OVC, which can potentially be used with CA125 and HE4.
27035231	Regulation of myo-inositol biosynthesis by p53-ISYNA1 pathway.	In response to various cellular stresses, p53 exerts its tumor suppressive effects such as apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, and senescence through the induction of its target genes. Recently, p53 was shown to control cellular homeostasis by regulating energy metabolism, glycolysis, antioxidant effect, and autophagy. However, its function in inositol synthesis was not reported. Through a microarray screening, we found that five genes related with myo-inositol metabolism were induced by p53. DNA damage enhanced intracellular myo-inositol content in HCT116 p53+/+ cells, but not in HCT116 p53-/- cells. We also indicated that inositol 3-phosphate synthase (ISYNA1) which encodes an enzyme essential for myo-inositol biosynthesis as a direct target of p53. Activated p53 regulated ISYNA1 expression through p53 response element in the seventh exon. Ectopic ISYNA1 expression increased myo-inositol levels in the cells and suppressed tumor cell growth. Knockdown of ISYNA1 caused resistance to adriamycin treatment, demonstrating the role of ISYNA1 in p53-mediated growth suppression. Furthermore, ISYNA1 expression was significantly associated with p53 mutation in bladder, breast cancer, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, lung squamous cell carcinoma, and pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Our findings revealed a novel role of p53 in myo-inositol biosynthesis which could be a potential therapeutic target.
27035227	MicroRNA-335 is downregulated in bladder cancer and inhibits cell growth, migration and invasion via targeting ROCK1.	The expression of microRNA335 (miR335) has been demonstrated to be downregulated in numerous types of cancer. Thus far, no previous studies have investigated the miR335 expression in bladder cancer. In the present study, the expression and effects of miR335 were assessed in bladder cancer. The results of the present study provided, to the best of our knowledge, the first evidence that miR335 is downregulated in the tumor tissue of patients with bladder cancer. Following transfection of miR335, MTT, cell migration and invasion, luciferase and western blot assays were conducted in bladder cancer cell lines. The results demonstrated that miR335 inhibited cell proliferation, migration and invasion in T24 and EJ cells. In addition, the results suggested that miR335 directly targets Rhoassociated protein kinase 1 (ROCK1) in bladder cancer. The present study provided a novel therapeutic target, the miR335/ROCK1 axis in bladder cancer. The suggested approach will be beneficial in developing an effective treatment against bladder cancer.
27034533	HER2 Protein Overexpression and Gene Amplification in Plasmacytoid Urothelial Carcinoma of the Urinary Bladder.	AIM: HER2 overexpression has been reported in a minority of urothelial carcinomas, but little is known about HER2 protein expression and gene alterations in plasmacytoid urothelial carcinoma, a rare and aggressive variant. The aim of this study was to clarify the HER2 status in plasmacytoid urothelial carcinomas. METHODS: Six cases of plasmacytoid urothelial carcinoma were included, in which we evaluated HER2 protein expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and HER2 gene amplification by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). RESULTS: The patients' ages ranged from 57 to 83 years (mean age, 71 years). Five patients were male and one was female. The ratio of the plasmacytoid component ranged from 30% to 100% (mean, 77%). HER2 expression score was 3+ in 4 cases, 2+ in one case, and negative in one case. HER2 gene amplification was positive in 3 cases, of which 2 cases showed a 3+ HER2 IHC score but one case was negative for HER2 IHC. Another 2 cases showed equivocal HER2 FISH results, and one remaining case was negative for HER2 FISH. CONCLUSION: Our observation that plasmacytoid urothelial carcinomas frequently demonstrated HER2 protein overexpression provides supporting evidence that HER2 may be a potential therapeutic target for plasmacytoid urothelial carcinoma.
27034531	Network Biomarkers of Bladder Cancer Based on a Genome-Wide Genetic and Epigenetic Network Derived from Next-Generation Sequencing Data.	Epigenetic and microRNA (miRNA) regulation are associated with carcinogenesis and the development of cancer. By using the available omics data, including those from next-generation sequencing (NGS), genome-wide methylation profiling, candidate integrated genetic and epigenetic network (IGEN) analysis, and drug response genome-wide microarray analysis, we constructed an IGEN system based on three coupling regression models that characterize protein-protein interaction networks (PPINs), gene regulatory networks (GRNs), miRNA regulatory networks (MRNs), and epigenetic regulatory networks (ERNs). By applying system identification method and principal genome-wide network projection (PGNP) to IGEN analysis, we identified the core network biomarkers to investigate bladder carcinogenic mechanisms and design multiple drug combinations for treating bladder cancer with minimal side-effects. The progression of DNA repair and cell proliferation in stage 1 bladder cancer ultimately results not only in the derepression of miR-200a and miR-200b but also in the regulation of the TNF pathway to metastasis-related genes or proteins, cell proliferation, and DNA repair in stage 4 bladder cancer. We designed a multiple drug combination comprising gefitinib, estradiol, yohimbine, and fulvestrant for treating stage 1 bladder cancer with minimal side-effects, and another multiple drug combination comprising gefitinib, estradiol, chlorpromazine, and LY294002 for treating stage 4 bladder cancer with minimal side-effects.
27034183	Cystectomy for bladder cancer in Denmark during the 2006-2013 period.	INTRODUCTION: The treatment of bladder cancer has been centralised in Denmark, and only five departments are licensed to perform radical cystectomy (RC). The purpose of this nationwide study was to evaluate perioperative mortality, length of post-operative hospital stay (LOS) and readmissions related to time course, surgical technique and number of RCs performed. METHODS: Patients were identified from the Danish National Hospital Register. We included all patients who had a RC performed because of bladder cancer in the period 2006-2013. RESULTS: A total of 1,857 RCs were performed, 81% of which were open and 19% were robot-assisted operations. Median LOS ranged 8-15 days, with the minimum LOS at the end of period. Readmission within 30 days occurred in 35% of patients. For patients operated with open technique, the readmission rate was 32% versus 45% for robot-assisted surgery. The 30-day mortality was 1.3% of which 1.5% occurred after open and 0.6% after robot-assisted RC. CONCLUSIONS: The study shows an increase in the number of RCs performed and a decrease in LOS during the study period. Furthermore, the study reveals a significant uptake of robot-assisted RC without obvious demonstrable benefits in terms of LOS and readmissions, but with a slightly lower mortality. Selection criteria for robot-assisted RC as well as data on tumour stage and preoperative co-morbidities are not available; therefore, interdepartmental comparison is not possible. However, these nationwide data suggest room for improvement through integration of the fast-track methodology combined with optimisation of surgical technique. FUNDING: none. TRIAL REGISTRATION: not relevant.
27033388	[Clinicopathologic features of solitary fibrous tumor in urogenital system].	OBJECTIVE: To study the clinicopathologic features and differential diagnosis of solitary fibrous tumor (SFT) in the urogenital system. METHODS: The clinical data and pathologic characteristics of eight cases of SFT in the urogenital system were analyzed, and the relevant literature was reviewed. RESULTS: The cohort included six male and two female patients, with age of onset ranging from 25 to 80 years. Five occurred in the kidney (three in the right kidney), one case each occurred in the bladder, the prostate and the spermatic cord. Most patients showed no obvious clinical symptoms or only had low back pain and swelling. The diameter of the tumor was ranged from 2.5 to 11.8 cm (median 5.2 cm). Microscopy showed at low magnification, the tumor cells were spindle-shaped and arranged in bundles or helicoid pattern. The regional mesenchymal fibroblasts showed hyperplasia, with obvious collagenization and formed hemangiopericytoma-like structure. One case showed increased mitotic figures (>5 cells/10 HPF) and focal necrosis. By immunohistochemistry, the tumor cells were positive for CD34 and STAT6 in all eight cases, CD99 and vimentin in six cases, bcl-2 in four cases and SMA in one case. All seven cases with follow-up did not show any tumor recurrence or metastasis. CONCLUSIONS: SFT is rare in the urogenital system and most patients show good prognosis. SFT expresses CD34 and STAT6 and needs to be distinguished from other spindle cell tumors.
27033297	Abdominal wall metastasis following open nephroureterectomy for upper tract urothelial carcinoma in a patient with Lynch syndrome.	A 74-year-old man developed the rare complication of an abdominal wall metastasis following open nephroureterectomy for upper tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC). This occurred in the setting of synchronous contralateral ureteric and metachronous colorectal carcinomas. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated loss of the mutS homolog 6 (MSH6) mismatch repair (MMR) protein in the metastatic abdominal wall and colonic lesions, which in conjunction with meeting the Amsterdam II criteria, is strongly suggestive of Lynch syndrome (LS). Surgical resection of the recurrence was performed with clear margins and neither recurrence nor spread during short-term follow-up.
27032573	Improving target volume delineation in intact cervical carcinoma: Literature review and step-by-step pictorial atlas to aid contouring.	PURPOSE: Accurate delineation of target volume and normal tissue is critical for intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) use in cervical cancer. Phase III Multicentre Trial of Weekly Induction Chemotherapy Followed by Standard Chemoradiation versus Standard Chemoradiation Alone in Patients With Locally Advanced Cervical Cancer (INTERLACE) radiation therapy quality assurance (RTQA) has highlighted significant interobserver delineation variation. Prescriptive guidelines reduce interobserver variation in other cancers. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A literature search using PubMed/Medline database of guidelines for target anatomy delineation in cervical cancer was undertaken. Differences in practice in these publications and INTERLACE trial RTQA were identified. Consensus best practice delineation was derived and a pictorial atlas produced. The proportion of outlines complying with protocol in test and real-time cases was compared before and after atlas implementation within the INTERLACE RTQA pack. RESULTS: Seven key papers were reviewed. Eleven areas of variation were identified. These included the definition and editing of bowel, definition of the femur, vagina, parametria, inferior and superior nodal borders, nodal clinical target volume (CTV) editing, para-aortic nodal CTV definition, and the margin to be used around enlarged nodes. The average proportion of outlines (of 4; primary CTV, nodal CTV, bladder, rectum) complying with protocol in test and real-time cases improved from 1.8 to 2.7 (difference, 0.9; 95% confidence interval, 0.3-1.5; P = .003) with atlas use. CONCLUSION: Differences exist in the published literature and clinical practice. This pictorial atlas reflects consensus recommendations and is now available to INTERLACE participating centers. Atlas use has reduced interobserver delineation variation in this trial setting.
27032563	In vitro and in vivo evaluation of sandwich-like mesoporous silica nanoflakes as promising anticancer drug delivery system.	We present the new promising nanostructure- sandwich-like mesoporous silica nanoflakes synthesized on graphene oxide sheets core. In the first step biocompatibility of the nanoflakes with PEG and without functionalization in human fibroblast, melanoma and breast cancer cells was assessed. In order to define the cellular uptake in vitro and biodistribution in vivo the nanostructures were labelled with fluorescent dye. In the next step, the silica nanostructures were filled by the anticancer drug- methotrexate (MTX) and cytotoxicity of the complex in reference to MTX was evaluated. The WST-1 assay shows mild, but concentration dependent, cytotoxicity of the nanoflakes, most significant for the non-functionalized structures. PEG-modified silica nanoflakes didn't produce a disruption of cell membranes and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release. Cell imaging revealed efficient internalization of the silica nanoflakes in cells. Ex vivo organ imaging showed high accumulation of the nanostructures in lungs, bladder and gall bladder, whereas confocal imaging revealed wide nanoflake distribution in all tested tissues, especially at 1h and 4h post intravenous injection. Cytotoxicity of the nanoflake-MTX complex in reference to MTX showed similar cytotoxic potential against cancer cells. These findings may provide useful information for designing drug delivery systems, which may improve anticancer efficacy and decrease side effects.
27031776	Sarcomatoid Urothelial Carcinoma of the Bladder: Analysis of 28 Cases With Emphasis on Clinicopathologic Features and Markers of Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition.	CONTEXT: -Sarcomatoid urothelial carcinoma (UCa) is a rare but aggressive variant of bladder cancer that can show diagnostic challenges even using ancillary techniques. OBJECTIVE: -To examine immunohistochemical markers in the context of sarcomatoid UCa, including those associated with epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. DESIGN: -Twenty-eight cases of sarcomatoid UCa were rereviewed. Clinical outcomes were obtained through database search. Immunohistochemistry for clinical and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition markers was performed. RESULTS: -All patients had biopsy-proven invasive UCa; 61% (17 of 28) had sarcomatoid UCa at initial diagnosis. A recognizable epithelial component(s) was present in 17 lesions. The sarcomatoid component accounted for 65% of the lesion (average), with heterologous elements present in 3 of 28 cases (11%). The morphologic spectrum of the sarcomatoid element included spindled not otherwise specified, myxoid, pseudoangiosarcomatous, and malignant fibrous histiocytoma-like undifferentiated features. The sarcomatoid component was immunoreactive for pancytokeratin (22 of 26; 85%), p63 (20 of 26; 77%), cytokeratin 903 (17 of 26; 65%), cytokeratin 7 (16 of 26; 62%), GATA3 (16 of 26; 62%), and cytokeratin 5/6 (16 of 26; 62%). STAT-6, CD31, CD34, and HMB45 were all nonreactive, whereas smooth muscle actin often showed at least focal immunoreactivity (22 of 26; 85%). Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition markers were frequently expressed, including vimentin (26 of 26; 100%), FoxC2 (26 of 26; 100%), SNAIL (23 of 26; 88.5%), and ZEB1 (18 of 26; 69.2%). Follow-up was available for 24 patients (median, 7 months). Sixteen of 28 patients (57%) died of disease (overall mean survival, 9.1 months). The presence of myxoid or chordoid features was associated with reduced survival (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: -Sarcomatoid UCa is an aggressive form of UCa that frequently expresses epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition markers, suggesting a possible mechanism associated with aggressive tumor behavior.
27029385	Pioglitazone use and risk of bladder cancer: population based cohort study.	OBJECTIVE: To determine whether pioglitazone compared with other antidiabetic drugs is associated with an increased risk of bladder cancer in people with type 2 diabetes. DESIGN: Population based cohort study. SETTING: General practices contributing data to the United Kingdom Clinical Practice Research Datalink. PARTICIPANTS: A cohort of 145,806 patients newly treated with antidiabetic drugs between 1 January 2000 and 31 July 2013, with follow-up until 31 July 2014. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The use of pioglitazone was treated as a time varying variable, with use lagged by one year for latency purposes. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate adjusted hazard ratios with 95% confidence intervals of incident bladder cancer associated with pioglitazone overall and by both cumulative duration of use and cumulative dose. Similar analyses were conducted for rosiglitazone, a thiazolidinedione not previously associated with an increased risk of bladder cancer. RESULTS: The cohort generated 689,616 person years of follow-up, during which 622 patients were newly diagnosed as having bladder cancer (crude incidence 90.2 per 100,000 person years). Compared with other antidiabetic drugs, pioglitazone was associated with an increased risk of bladder cancer (121.0 v 88.9 per 100,000 person years; hazard ratio 1.63, 95% confidence interval 1.22 to 2.19). Conversely, rosiglitazone was not associated with an increased risk of bladder cancer (86.2 v 88.9 per 100,000 person years; 1.10, 0.83 to 1.47). Duration-response and dose-response relations were observed for pioglitazone but not for rosiglitazone. CONCLUSION: The results of this large population based study indicate that pioglitazone is associated with an increased risk of bladder cancer. The absence of an association with rosiglitazone suggests that the increased risk is drug specific and not a class effect.
27027999	MiRImpact, a new bioinformatic method using complete microRNA expression profiles to assess their overall influence on the activity of intracellular molecular pathways.	MicroRNAs (miRs) are short noncoding RNA molecules that regulate expression of target mRNAs. Many published sources provide information about miRs and their targets. However, bioinformatic tools elucidating higher level impact of the established total miR profiles, are still largely missing. Recently, we developed a method termed OncoFinder enabling quantification of the activities of intracellular molecular pathways basing on gene expression data. Here we propose a new technique, MiRImpact, which enables to link miR expression data with its estimated outcome on the regulation of molecular pathways, like signaling, metabolic, cytoskeleton rearrangement, and DNA repair pathways. MiRImpact uses OncoFinder rationale for pathway activity calculations, with the major distinctions that (i) it deals with the concentrations of miRs--known regulators of gene products participating in molecular pathways, and (ii) miRs are considered as negative regulators of target molecules, if other is not specified. MiRImpact operates with 2 types of databases: for molecular targets of miRs and for gene products participating in molecular pathways. We applied MiRImpact to compare regulation of human bladder cancer-specific signaling pathways at the levels of mRNA and miR expression. We took 2 most complete alternative databases of experimentally validated miR targets--miRTarBase and DianaTarBase, and an OncoFinder database featuring 2725 gene products and 271 signaling pathways. We showed that the impact of miRs is orthogonal to pathway regulation at the mRNA level, which stresses the importance of studying posttranscriptional regulation of gene expression. We also report characteristic set of miR and mRNA regulation features linked with bladder cancer.
27026309	Patterns of Failure After Radical Cystectomy for pT3-4 Bladder Cancer: Implications for Adjuvant Radiation Therapy.	PURPOSE: In patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer, local-regional failure (LF) has been reported to occur in up to 20% of patients following radical cystectomy. The goals of this study were to describe patterns of LF, as well as assess factors associated with LF in a cohort of patients with pT3-4 bladder cancer. This information may have implications towards the use of adjuvant radiation therapy. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Patients with pathologic T3-4 N0-1 bladder cancer were examined from an institutional radical cystectomy database. Preoperative demographics and pathologic characteristics were examined. Outcomes included overall survival and LF. Local-regional failures were defined using follow-up imaging reports and scans, and the locations of LF were characterized. Variables were tested by univariate and multivariate analysis for association with LF and overall survival. RESULTS: A total of 334 patients had pT3-4 and N0-1 disease after radical cystectomy and bilateral pelvic lymph node dissection. Of these, 46% received perioperative chemotherapy. The median age was 71 years old, and median follow-up was 11 months. On univariate analysis, margin status, pT stage, and pN stage, were all associated with LF (P<.05), however, on multivariate analysis, only pT and pN stages were significantly associated with LF (P<.05). Three strata of risk were defined, including low-risk patients with pT3N0 disease, intermediate-risk patients with pT3N1 or pT4N0 disease, and high-risk patients with pT4N1 disease, who had a 2-year incidence of LF of 12%, 33%, and 72%, respectively. The most common sites of pelvic relapse included the external and internal iliac lymph nodes (LNs) and obturator LN regions. Notably, 34% of patients with LF had local-regional only disease at the time of recurrence. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with pT4 or N1 disease have a 2-year risk of LF that exceeds 30%. These patients may be the most likely to benefit from local adjuvant therapies.
27026308	Prospective Study Delivering Simultaneous Integrated High-dose Tumor Boost (</=70 Gy) With Image Guided Adaptive Radiation Therapy for Radical Treatment of Localized Muscle-Invasive Bladder Cancer.	PURPOSE: Image guided adaptive radiation therapy offers individualized solutions to improve target coverage and reduce normal tissue irradiation, allowing the opportunity to increase the radiation tumor dose and spare normal bladder tissue. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A library of 3 intensity modulated radiation therapy plans were created (small, medium, and large) from planning computed tomography (CT) scans performed at 30 and 60 minutes; treating the whole bladder to 52 Gy and the tumor to 70 Gy in 32 fractions. A "plan of the day" approach was used for treatment delivery. A post-treatment cone beam CT (CBCT) scan was acquired weekly to assess intrafraction filling and coverage. RESULTS: A total of 18 patients completed treatment to 70 Gy. The plan and treatment for 1 patient was to 68 Gy. Also, 1 patient's plan was to 70 Gy but the patient was treated to a total dose of 65.6 Gy because dose-limiting toxicity occurred before dose escalation. A total of 734 CBCT scans were evaluated. Small, medium, and large plans were used in 36%, 48%, and 16% of cases, respectively. The mean +/- standard deviation rate of intrafraction filling at the start of treatment (ie, week 1) was 4.0 +/- 4.8 mL/min (range 0.1-19.4) and at end of radiation therapy (ie, week 5 or 6) was 1.1 +/- 1.6 mL/min (range 0.01-7.5; P=.002). The mean D98 (dose received by 98% volume) of the tumor boost and bladder as assessed on the post-treatment CBCT scan was 97.07% +/- 2.10% (range 89.0%-104%) and 99.97% +/- 2.62% (range 96.4%-112.0%). At a median follow-up period of 19 months (range 4-33), no muscle-invasive recurrences had developed. Two patients experienced late toxicity (both grade 3 cystitis) at 5.3 months (now resolved) and 18 months after radiation therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Image guided adaptive radiation therapy using intensity modulated radiation therapy to deliver a simultaneous integrated tumor boost to 70 Gy is feasible, with acceptable toxicity, and will be evaluated in a randomized trial.
27023391	Examining the Relationship between Pre-Malignant Breast Lesions, Carcinogenesis and Tumor Evolution in the Mammary Epithelium Using an Agent-Based Model.	INTRODUCTION: Breast cancer, the product of numerous rare mutational events that occur over an extended time period, presents numerous challenges to investigators interested in studying the transformation from normal breast epithelium to malignancy using traditional laboratory methods, particularly with respect to characterizing transitional and pre-malignant states. Dynamic computational modeling can provide insight into these pathophysiological dynamics, and as such we use a previously validated agent-based computational model of the mammary epithelium (the DEABM) to investigate the probabilistic mechanisms by which normal populations of ductal cells could transform into states replicating features of both pre-malignant breast lesions and a diverse set of breast cancer subtypes. METHODS: The DEABM consists of simulated cellular populations governed by algorithms based on accepted and previously published cellular mechanisms. Cells respond to hormones, undergo mitosis, apoptosis and cellular differentiation. Heritable mutations to 12 genes prominently implicated in breast cancer are acquired via a probabilistic mechanism. 3000 simulations of the 40-year period of menstrual cycling were run in wild-type (WT) and BRCA1-mutated groups. Simulations were analyzed by development of hyperplastic states, incidence of malignancy, hormone receptor and HER-2 status, frequency of mutation to particular genes, and whether mutations were early events in carcinogenesis. RESULTS: Cancer incidence in WT (2.6%) and BRCA1-mutated (45.9%) populations closely matched published epidemiologic rates. Hormone receptor expression profiles in both WT and BRCA groups also closely matched epidemiologic data. Hyperplastic populations carried more mutations than normal populations and mutations were similar to early mutations found in ER+ tumors (telomerase, E-cadherin, TGFB, RUNX3, p < .01). ER- tumors carried significantly more mutations and carried more early mutations in BRCA1, c-MYC and genes associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition. CONCLUSIONS: The DEABM generates diverse tumors that express tumor markers consistent with epidemiologic data. The DEABM also generates non-invasive, hyperplastic populations, analogous to atypia or ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), via mutations to genes known to be present in hyperplastic lesions and as early mutations in breast cancers. The results demonstrate that agent-based models are well-suited to studying tumor evolution through stages of carcinogenesis and have the potential to be used to develop prevention and treatment strategies.
27021910	Current Status of Robot-Assisted Radical Cystectomy and Intracorporeal Urinary Diversion.	Robot-assisted surgery has become a widely used surgical approach in the management of urologic malignancies. With its initial experience in the treatment of prostate cancer, the technology rapidly expanded to other urologic malignancies including bladder cancer. Since its introduction in 2003, robot-assisted radical cystectomy has seen refinement and increased penetration over the last decade. Furthermore, urologic surgeons have expanded its use to perform urinary diversions. The concept of intracorporeal urinary diversion is still in development but continues to see increased refinement among high volume academic centers.
27020167	SNPs associated with activity and toxicity of cabazitaxel in patients with advanced urothelial cell carcinoma.	AIM: We aimed to identify SNPs associated with cabazitaxel toxicity and response within a Phase II clinical trial using this compound in advanced transitional cell carcinoma after progression to a platinum-based regimen. PATIENTS & METHODS: Eleven SNPs in CYP3A4, CYP3A5, CYP2C8, ABCB1 and TUBB1 were genotyped in 45 patients. RESULTS: CYP3A5 rs776746 A allele was associated with protection against gastrointestinal toxicity (odds ratio: 0.06, 95% CI: 0.007-0.63, p = 0.018) and with reduced progression-free survival (hazard ratio: 5.1, 95% CI: 1.7-15.1, p = 0.0038, multivariable analysis). ABCB1 SNPs were associated with total number of grade 3-4 toxicity events (p-values of 0.009, 0.041 and 0.043, respectively). CONCLUSION: Polymorphisms in CYP3A5 and ABCB1 may define a subset of patients with different cabazitaxel toxicity and efficacy and therefore could be used as markers for treatment optimization.
27019161	The cytomorphological features of low-grade urothelial neoplasms vary by specimen type.	BACKGROUND: Urinary tract (UT) cytology has been used successfully to diagnose high-grade urothelial carcinoma but is reported to have poor sensitivity for low-grade urothelial neoplasms (LGUNs). However, the literature has shown that LGUN may be associated with atypical findings in UT specimens. The authors determined which features were most commonly observed, and whether the method of specimen procurement had an effect. METHODS: A total of 326 specimens were identified over an 8-year period. One hundred fifty-three specimens were reviewed and graded for cellularity, number of tissue fragments (TFs), degeneration, inflammation, hyperchromasia, nuclear pleomorphism, nuclear border irregularity, nuclear size, cytoplasmic tails, nuclear eccentricity, and high-grade features. RESULTS: Of the 153 specimens, 86 specimens (56.2%) demonstrated cellular atypia; of those, 51.2% were voided urine (VU) and 31.4% were UT washing (UW) specimens. The majority of specimens had many cells (46.5%), many single cells (44.2%), few to moderate TFs (46.5% and 27.9%, respectively), mild hyperchromasia (52.3%), mild nuclear pleomorphism (51.2%), mild nuclear border irregularity (60.5%), cytoplasmic tails (51.2%), and few to moderate eccentric nuclei (37.2% and 36.1%, respectively). The presence of TFs, cytoplasmic tails, and eccentric and enlarged nuclei were significantly more common in UW versus VU specimens (P = .036, .012, .014, and .027, respectively) and in UW versus benign UW controls (P = .001, .002, .002, and .003, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Approximately 50% of UT specimens with LGUN on follow-up demonstrated atypical features. Based on comparison with benign UW controls, TFs, cytoplasmic tails, nuclear eccentricity, and enlarged nuclei were more pronounced in neoplastic UW than VU specimens, suggesting that the method of urine specimen procurement affects the presence of certain low-grade features.

27018902	Proposed Scoring System for Evaluating Neurologic Deficit after Sacral Resection: Functional Outcomes of 170 Consecutive Patients.	STUDY DESIGN: Cross-section analysis. OBJECTIVE: A quality-of-life oriented scoring system for evaluation of lower limbs, bladder, and bowel functions of patients after sacral tumor resection has been proposed and was adopted in a clinical research. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Surgical resections of sacral tumors usually cause postoperative neurologic deficits. A widely agreed scoring system for detailed evaluation of functional outcomes is not yet established. METHODS: The scoring system has three domains with three items in each domain, being allocated 0 to 3 points of each item according to the degree of functional impairment. Overall function scale is presented in percentage form. In the current single-center cross-section study, it was adopted to evaluate and quantify the postoperative functional outcomes of 170 consecutive patients who underwent sacrectomy. RESULTS: Significant observer agreement (P < 0.01) was found in all nine items of the proposed system. Detailed functional outcome and difference between each group can be well described by the scoring results. Preservation of bilateral S1 nerve roots preserved majority of motor and sensory function in lower limbs. The probability and degree of urine incontinence (P = 0.003) and abnormal bladder sensation (P = 0.039) was significantly lower in patients with bilateral S3 nerve preserved than those whose unilateral S3 was severed. Patients with unilateral S3 preserved had a lower incidence and degree of dysuria (P = 0.056), constipation (P = 0.059), bowel incontinence (P = 0.007), and abnormal rectal sensation (P = 0.002) than those whose bilateral S3 were sacrificed. Functional outcomes for patients with retained coccyx were better than those with coccyx transected. Functional outcome of different level sacral nerve preservation was semi-quantified and profiled. CONCLUSION: Detailed and intuitive description of neurologic deficits after sacral tumor resection is the major purpose of current scoring system. The ease of use and reproducibility makes it a practical tool to evaluate function status after sacrectomy under oncologic condition. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 4.
27018414	[Emphysematous Cystitis and Acute Focal Bacterial Nephritis: A Case Report].	A 96-year-old woman was diagnosed with colitis in our hospital. Her past history was breast cancer and lung cancer but no diabetes mellitus. She suddenly complained of lower abdominal pain. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) revealed intramural gas in the bladder wall and multiple poor contrasting area in her right kidney, which suggested emphysematous cystitis and acute focal bacterial nephritis. Indwelling urethral catheter was performed for bladder drainage and the treatment with antibiotics started. Urine culture revealed Klebsiella pneumoniae and blood culture was negative. After 3 weeks, the abdominal CT confirmed the decrease of gas within the bladder wall and improvement of contrasting area in the right kidney.
27018413	[Intravesical Recurrence of Small Cell Carcinoma of the Ureter: A Case Report].	A 63-year-old man who presented with asymptomatic gross hematuria was referred to our hospital. Left ureteral tumor (cT3N0M0) was diagnosed and left nephroureterectomy was performed. Pathological examination revealed urothelial carcinoma and small cell carcinoma with local invasion (pT3). The patient was treated with three cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy with gemcitabine and cisplatin. Three months after the chemotherapy, cystoscopy showed an intravesical recurrence of the tumor. Transurethral resection was performed and histopathological examination revealed small cell carcinoma (pT1). We recommended a cystectomy and neoadjuvant chemotherapy with etoposide and carboplatin according to the standard care of small cell carcinoma of bladder. However, the patient refused to undergo cystectomy and desired to preserve his bladder. Therefore, after two cycles of chemotherapy with etoposide and carboplatin, transurethral resection was performed to examine the presence of the residual tumor instead of immediate cystectomy. Because of no residual tumor, another two cycles of chemotherapy were added instead of a cystectomy. There is no evidence of recurrence seven months after the chemotherapy.
27018412	[Port-Site Metastasis of Urothelial Carcinoma after Laparoscopic Nephroureterectomy: A Case Report].	The patient was a 70-year-old woman with a chief complaint of right hydronephrosis and hydroureter detected by ultrasound by a local doctor. She came to our hospital in January, 2014 for further examination. Because a tumor was discovered in her right upper ureter by computed tomography (CT) and retrograde pyelography, a right laparoscopic nephroureterectomy was perfomed on the suspicion of a right ureter carcinoma (clinical stage T2 N0M0). The pathological examination showed urothelial carcinoma, grade 3, pT3. She was followed up carefully without adjuvant chemotherapy. At 10 months postoperatively, a subcutaneous tumor was found at the port-site by CT, and she underwent surgical resection of the subcutaneous tumor. Pathological diagnosis was urothelial carcinoma, and was confimed to be portsite metastasis of urothelial carcinoma. She received three courses of gemcitabine and carboplatin chemotherapy therapy from November, 2014. She has been followed up without signs of recurrence.
27018411	[Case of a Plasmacytoid Urothelial Carcinoma Identified Due to the Hardening of the Abdominal Wall].	The patient was a 75 year-old male. Noticing areas of hardening in the lower abdomen, and consequently feelings of systemic fatigue and difficulty in walking, the patient visited a clinic and was diagnosed with kidney failure prior to the visit to our clinic. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging showed thickness of the rectus abdominis muscle and the bladder wall, and bilateral hydronephrosis was also identified. As no explicit tumor was identified in the bladder, the patient underwent biopsies of the abdominal wall and bladder membrane mucous, and was diagnosed with a plasmacytoid urothelial carcinoma primarily developed in the bladder. The patient displayed a poor general state of health and died five months after the diagnosis. It is known that plasmacytoid urothelial carcinomas progress rapidly and the prognosis is poorer than for the micropapillary variant. It is important to obtain a tissue specimen in the early stage of this disease because there are cases in which no explicit tumor can be identified. Furthermore, the value of carbohydrate antigen (CA) 19-9 of the patient was much higher than would be expected as normal at the first visit. It kept rising during the follow-up and was useful as a marker to indicate the progress of the disease.
27018410	[The Vaginal Metastasis of Ureteral Carcinoma after Left Nephroureterectomy: A Case Report].	69-year-old woman underwent left nephroureterectomy for left ureteral cancer (urothelial carcinoma (UC), high grade, pT3pN0) in September 2013. She returned to our hospital presenting with asymptomatic macrohematuria in July 2014. Cystoscopy showed tiny papillary tumors in the bladder. We also found genital bleeding from multiple papillary tumors on the vaginal wall. We performed transurethral resection of the bladder tumor and a biopsy of the vaginal wall demonstrated non-invasive UC, high grade. Pelvic magnetic resonance imaging after the operation showed no infiltration outside the bladder wall and vaginal wall. Therefore, we performed endoscopic excision of the vaginal tumor. However we could not resect all vaginal tumors. Irradiation of the vagina and uterus was performed under the diagnosis of metastasis of UC tovagina. Vaginal UC is extremely rare and this is the 26th case report in the literature.
27018407	[Solitary Bladder Metastasis of Chromophobe Renal Cell Carcinoma: Report of a Case].	Bladder metastasis of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is relatively rare, and only 43 cases have been reported in the Japanese literature. In most cases, the histology of the primary site was clear cell type. Here, we report a case of bladder metastasis of chromophobe RCC. A 74-year-old man presented with asymptomatic gross hematuria. He had a history of chromophobe RCC treated with radical nephrectomy 11 years previously. Since cystoscopy revealed a papillary pedunculated tumor, he underwent transurethral resection of the bladder tumor (TUR-Bt). The pathological diagnosis was chromophobe RCC because the histological findings were similar to those of nephrectomized specimens. Four years after TUR-Bt, the patient received bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) therapy under the diagnosis of carcinoma in situ of urothelial cancer of the bladder but not chromophobe RCC. There was no recurrence of chromophobe RCC within 5 years follow-up after TUR-Bt. To the best of our knowledge, there has been only one other case report of bladder metastasis of chromophobe RCC in the Japanese literature.
27018406	[A Case of Perirenal Non-Specific Lymphadenitis Resected by Laparoscopic Operation for the Possibility of Malignancy].	Various types of tumors, including benign tumors, arise from the renal parenchyma or renal capsule, but it is difficult to predict the histological type preoperatively. Here, we report a case of perirenal non-specific lymphadenitis resected laparoscopically. A 79-year-old man with a history of diabetic mellitus and noninvasive bladder cancer had an incidentally-detected enhanced mass in contact with the surface of the left kidney. Given the possibility that the tumor was malignant, we resected the mass laparoscopically. Intraoperative findings revealed that the tumor did not invade the renal parenchyma, and it could be easily resected. Microscopic findings showed that the tumor consisted of inflammation of a lymph node, lymphoid follicles with hyperplasia of germ center and granulomatous inflammation with giant cells, and there was no malignant finding. Despite various additional examinations, the specific cause of the lymphadenitis was not clarified, leading to a final diagnosis of non-specific lymphadenitis. To our knowledge this is the first report about perirenal non-specific lymphadenitis difficult to distinguish from perirenal malignant tumor in preoperative computed tomography imaging.
27018306	Tetracycline-inducible shRNA targeting antisense long non-coding RNA HIF1A-AS2 represses the malignant phenotypes of bladder cancer.	Various studies have indicated that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play vital roles in the cancer development and progression. LncRNA hypoxia inducible factor 1alpha antisense RNA-2 (HIF1A-AS2) is upregulated in gastric carcinomas and knockdown of HIF1A-AS2 expression by siRNA could inhibit cell proliferation in vitro and tumorigenesis in vivo. Inspired by these observations, we hypothesized that HIF1A-AS2 possibly plays the analogous roles in bladder cancer. In our study, we first reported that HIF1A-AS2 was up-regulated in bladder cancer tissues and cells, and HIF1A-AS2 expression level in bladder cancer tissues is positively associated with advanced clinical pathologic grade and TNM phase. Cell proliferation inhibition, cell migration suppression and apoptosis induction were observed by silencing HIF1A-AS2 in bladder cancer T24 and 5637 cells. Overexpression of HIF1A-AS2 in SV-HUC-1 cells could promote cell proliferation, cell migration and anti-apoptosis. Besides, we utilized the emerging technology of medical synthetic biology to design tetracycline-inducible small hairpin RNA (shRNA) vector which specifically silenced HIF1A-AS2 in a dosage-dependent manner to inhibit the progression of human bladder cancer. In conclusion, our data suggested that HIF1A-AS2 plays oncogenic roles and can be used as a therapeutic target for treating human bladder cancer. Synthetic "tetracycline-on" switch system that quantitatively controlled the expression of HIF1A-AS2 in bladder cancer can inhibit the progression of bladder cancer cells in a dosage-dependent manner. Our findings provide new insights into the role of the lncRNA HIF1A-AS2 in the bladder cancer.
27016918	A case of adenocarcinoma with enteroblastic differentiation of the ampulla of Vater.	Cancer of the ampulla of Vater is rare, though it has various histological types and its histogenesis is fascinating in view of the anatomically complex nature of the ampulla. Fetal gut-like adenocarcinoma, usually found in the stomach, can also develop in the ampullary region in extremely rare cases. Here we present a case of ampullary adenocarcinoma with enteroblastic and neuroendocrine differentiation. A 55-year-old woman presented with an epigastric pain. Endoscopic examination revealed a 2-cm submucosal tumor-like lesion in the ampulla. The surgical specimen showed that an exposed protruding type of tumor appeared as a well-demarcated whitish-yellow solid mass. Microscopically, the tumor had proliferated in the common channel and invaded the duodenal submucosa with mucosal lesion of intestinal-type adenocarcinoma. The main tumor consisted of three different histological types showing transitional areas: adenocarcinoma with enteroblastic differentiation (ENT), neuroendocrine carcinoma (NEC), and well differentiated adenocarcinoma (WEL). Morphologically the ENT resembled fetal gut and immunohistochemically expressed SALL4 and glypican 3. The WEL was positive for CK20 and CDX2, revealing an intestinal-type phenotype. AFP and HepPar1 were not evident in any part of the lesion. We speculated this tumor had arisen from intestinal-type adenocarcinoma of the common channel and acquired enteroblastic and neuroendocrine differentiation during growth.
27015167	Murine Double Minute 2 SNP T309G Polymorphism and Urinary Tract Cancer Risk: A Meta-Analysis.	Urinary tract cancer is a common cause of cancer-related death. The etiology and pathogenesis of urinary tract cancer remain unclear, with genetic and epigenetic factors playing an important role. Studies of the polymorphism of murine double minute 2 (MDM2) have shown inconclusive trends in the risk of urinary tract cancer.To clarify this inconsistency, we conducted updated meta-analyses to evaluate the role of MDM2 T309G polymorphism in urinary tract cancer susceptibility.Data sources were Pubmed (1966-May 2015), Chinese biomedicine literature database (1978-May 2015), and hand searching of the reference lists of included studies:(1) research categories case-control study or a nested case-control study; (2) information evaluating the association between the MDM2 SNP309 and urinary tract cancer risk; (3) studies with sufficient data to perform a meta-analysis.It included the use of odds ratios (ORs) to assess the strength of the association, and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) give a sense of the precision of the estimate. We used I for the assessment of between-study heterogeneity, and publication bias was assessed using the funnel plot and the Egger test. Statistical analyses were performed by Review Manage, version 5.0 and Stata 11.0.A total of 18 studies met the eligibility criteria and were included in our analyses. Overall, there was no statistical association between MDM2 SNP309 and prostate cancer risk for the allele contrast, the GG genotype, the recessive genetic model, the dominant genetic model, and prostate cancer risk in all subjects (OR = 0.96, 95% CI 0.87-1.05, P = 0.36; OR = 0.93, 95% CI 0.75-1.15, P = 0.50; OR = 1.00, 95% CI 0.87-1.15, P = 0.99; OR = 0.93, 95% CI 0.80-1.07, P = 0.30), and between MDM2 SNP309 and bladder cancer risk (the allele contrast: OR = 1.06, 95% CI 0.89-1.27, P = 0.50; the GG genotype: OR = 1.12, 95% CI 0.79-1.61, P = 0.52; the dominant genetic model: OR = 1.03, 95% CI 0.83-1.28, P = 0.78; the recessive genetic model: OR = 1.12, 95% CI 0.84-1.49, P = 0.45). However, there was positive association between MDM2 SNP309 and kidney cancer risk for the allele contrast (OR = 1.24, 95% CI 1.05-1.46, P = 0.01), the GG genotype (OR = 1.57, 95% CI 1.11-2.20, P = 0.01), dominant model contrast (OR = 1.30, 95% CI 1.00-1.68, P = 0.05), the recessive genetic model (OR = 1.37, 95% CI 1.02-1.83, P = 0.04).First, only the data of published studies were included in this meta-analysis. Unpublished studies tend to show more negative results; therefore, publication bias may be present. Second, because of the lack of the original data, we did not perform stratification analysis by age, hormone levels, dietary habit, or other variables. This might have caused confounding bias. Third, because the number of studies was relatively small for kidney cancer, the results might not have enough statistical power for us to investigate the association of the polymorphism with kidney cancer susceptibility, and we could not perform subgroup analyses. Finally, there were no studies about Africans in this meta-analysis.In summary, the results of our meta-analysis suggest an increased risk role of the MDM2 SNP T309G in renal cancer. However, there was no association between the MDM2 SNP T309G and prostate cancer risk or between the MDM2 SNP T309G and bladder cancer risk. Moreover, well-designed studies should estimate different ethnicities, degree of malignancy and clinical progression on the association between MDM2 SNP309 and urinary cancer risk in the future.
27012825	Targeted p53 activation by saRNA suppresses human bladder cancer cells growth and metastasis.	BACKGROUND: Previous study showed that dsP53-285 has the capacity to induce tumor suppressor gene p53 expression by targeting promoter in non-human primates' cells. And it is well known that TP53 gene is frequently mutant or inactivated in human bladder cancer. Hereby, whether this small RNA can activate the expression of wild-type p53 and inhibit human bladder cancer cells remains to be elucidated. METHODS: Oligonucleotide and lentivirus were used to overexpress dsP53-285 and dsControl. Real-time PCR and western blot were used to detect genes' mRNA and protein expression, respectively. Cell proliferation assay, colony formation, flow cytometry, transwell assay and wound healing assay were performed to determine the effects on bladder cancer cells proliferation and migration/invasion in vitro. Animal models were carried out to analyze the effects on cells growth and metastasis in vivo. RESULTS: Transfection of dsP53-285 into human bladder cancer cell lines T24 and EJ readily activate wild-type p53 expression by targeting promoter. Moreover, dsP53-285 exhibited robust capacity to inhibit cells proliferation and colony formation, induce cells G0/G1 arrest, suppress migration and invasion. Besides, the Cyclin-CDK genes (Cyclin D1 and CDK4/6) were down-regulated and the EMT-associated genes (E-cadherin, beta-catenin, ZEB1 and Vimentin) were also expressed inversely after dsP53-285 treatment. In addition, dsP53-285 could also significantly suppress the growth of bladder cancer xenografts and metastasis in nude mice. Most importantly, the anti-tumor effects mediated by dsP53-285 were mainly achieved by manipulating wild-type p53 expression. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that the dsP53-285 can upregulate wild-type p53 expression in human bladder cancer cells through RNA activation, and suppresses cells proliferation and metastasis in vitro and in vivo.
27011373	68Ga-PSMA I&T PET/CT for assessment of prostate cancer: evaluation of image quality after forced diuresis and delayed imaging.	OBJECTIVE: Urinary radiotracer excretion of 68Ga-Labelled prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) ligands may complicate the assessment of the prostate region and differentiation of lymph nodes from ureteral activity. The aim of this study was to assess the value of delayed imaging after forced diuresis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty-six patients underwent 68Ga-PSMA I&T PET/CT for evaluation of prostate cancer at 60 min post-injection. In subgroups of patients, this was amended by delayed imaging after 180 min post-injection, preceded by furosemide and oral hydration early, at the time of tracer injection, or delayed, at 100 min post-injection. Urinary tracer activity within the bladder and focal ureteral activity was analyzed. RESULTS: After forced diuresis, linear and focal visualization of ureters was significantly reduced. After delayed furosemide, mean and peak bladder activity decreased (p < 0.001), and image quality of the prostate region improved on delayed images (p < 0.001). Early furosemide co-injection with tracer resulted in increased mean and peak bladder activity (p < 0.001) and in deteriorated image quality of the prostate region on delayed images (p = 0.008). CONCLUSION: Ga-PSMA I&T PET/CT delayed imaging after forced diuresis can improve the assessment of prostate region and pelvic lymph nodes by removing excreted tracer from the lower urinary tract. KEY POINTS: * Forced diuresis can improve image quality in 68 Ga-PSMA I&T. * After forced diuresis, linear and focal visualization of ureters was reduced. * Timing of diuresis relative to 68 Ga-PSMA I&T injection is important. * Early furosemide co-injection with tracer resulted in deteriorated image quality on delayed images. * After delayed furosemide, image quality improved on delayed images.
27011183	Arsenite Regulates Prolongation of Glycan Residues of Membrane Glycoprotein: A Pivotal Study via Wax Physisorption Kinetics and FTIR Imaging.	Arsenic exposure results in several human cancers, including those of the skin, lung, and bladder. As skin cancers are the most common form, epidermal keratinocytes (KC) are the main target of arsenic exposure. The mechanisms by which arsenic induces carcinogenesis remains unclear, but aberrant cell proliferation and dysregulated energy homeostasis play a significant role. Protein glycosylation is involved in many key physiological processes, including cell proliferation and differentiation. To evaluate whether arsenite exposure affected protein glycosylation, the alteration of chain length of glycan residues in arsenite treated skin cells was estimated. Herein we demonstrated that the protein glycosylation was adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-dependent and regulated by arsenite exposure by using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) reflectance spectroscopy, synchrotron-radiation-based FTIR (SR-FTIR) microspectroscopy, and wax physisorption kinetics coupled with focal-plane-array-based FTIR (WPK-FPA-FTIR) imaging. We were able to estimate the relative length of surface protein-linked glycan residues on arsenite-treated skin cells, including primary KC and two skin cancer cell lines, HSC-1 and HaCaT cells. Differential physisorption of wax adsorbents adhered to long-chain (elongated type) and short-chain (regular type) glycan residues of glycoprotein of skin cell samples treated with various concentration of arsenite was measured. The physisorption ratio of beeswax remain/n-pentacosane remain for KC cells was increased during arsenite exposure. Interestingly, this increase was reversed after oligomycin (an ATP synthase inhibitor) pretreatment, suggesting the chain length of protein-linked glycan residues is likely ATP-dependent. This is the first study to demonstrate the elongation and termination of surface protein-linked glycan residues using WPK-FPA-FTIR imaging in eukaryotes. Herein the result may provide a scientific basis to target surface protein-linked glycan residues in the process of arsenic carcinogenesis.
27011048	Advances in cancer immunology and cancer immunotherapy.	After decades of setbacks, cancer immunology is living its Golden Age. Recent advances in cancer immunology have provided new therapeutic approaches to treat cancer. The objective clinical response observed in patients treated with antibodies that block the immune checkpoints, cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) and programmed cell-death protein 1 (PD-1)/programmed cell-death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) pathways, has led to their FDA approval for the treatment of melanoma in 2011 and in 2014, respectively. The anti-PD-1 antibody nivolumab has received the FDA-approval in March 2015 for squamous lung cancer treatment. In addition, antibodies targeting PD-1 or PD-L1 have demonstrated their efficacy and safety in additional tumors, including non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), renal cell carcinoma (RCC), bladder cancer, and Hodgkin's lymphoma. Almost at the same time, the field of adoptive cell transfer has exploded. The chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T technology has provided strong evidence of efficacy in the treatment of B cell malignancies, and different T cell based treatments are currently under investigation for different types of tumors. In this review we will discuss the latest advances in cancer immunology and immunotherapy as well as new treatments now under development in the clinic and potential strategies that have shown promising results in preclinical models.
27008430	The prognostic value of rectal invasion for stage IVA uterine cervical cancer treated with radiation therapy.	BACKGROUND: The prognostic value of rectal invasion is still unclear in stage IVA cervical cancer. The objective of this study is to evaluate patient outcome and prognostic factors in stage IVA cervical cancer treated with radiation therapy. METHODS: A retrospective review of the medical records of patients treated with definitive photon radiation therapy for pathologically proven stage IVA cervical cancer between 1980 and 2010 was performed. Eligible patients for the present study were diagnosed with clinical stage IVA cervical cancer by cystoscopy or/and proctoscopy, and they received definitive radiation therapy consisting of a combination of external beam radiotherapy and high-dose-rate brachytherapy. All patients underwent CT scans of the abdomen and pelvis. RESULTS: Among the 67 stage IVA patients studied, 53 patients were stage IVA on the basis of bladder invasion, 7 according to rectal mucosal invasion, and 7 because of both bladder and rectal mucosal invasion. Median follow-up of all patients and surviving patients was 19 months (range, 2-235 months) and 114 months (range, 14-223 months), respectively. The 5-year local control (LC), disease-free survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS) rate were 55, 17, and 24%, respectively. Rectal invasion had significant impact on DFS, but bladder invasion had the opposite effect (p = 0.00006 and 0.005, respectively). There were significant differences of LC, DFS and OS rates between patients with and without rectal invasion (p = 0.006, 0.00006 and 0.05, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with stage IVA cervical cancer had poor prognosis, with 5-year survival of only 24%. Furthermore, in stage IVA, rectal invasion might be a worse prognostic factor than bladder invasion.
27005509	Discussion on robot-assisted laparoscopic cystectomy and Ileal neobladder surgery preoperative care.	To investigate the clinical applications of robot-assisted radical cystectomy with orthotopic ileal neobladder (RARC-INB) and make a preliminary summary. Retrospective analysis the clinical data of 12 patients underwent robotic bladder cancer (da vinci surgical system) assisted laparoscopic cystectomy with ileal orthotopic neobladder from March 2015 to April 2015. 12 cases were successful, with no surgical intervention, and organ damage occurred. The operation time was 330~470 min, which average (390.0+/-61.5) min; blood loss was 90~870 ml, which average (185.0+/-88.3) ml. One case of intraoperative blood transfusion was 400 ml. The enjoin eating time of postoperative intestinal ventilation was 3~6 d, and the average time was (4.0+/-1.5) d. Removal of ureteral stents time was 14~28 d and the average time was (21+/-7) d. Removal of the catheter time was 18~28 d and the average time was (23+/-5) d. Postoperative hospital stay 19~29 d and the average time was (24+/-5) dRARC-INB make the surgical tends to simplify, which was conducive to surgeon intraoperative control and assurance. RARC-INB make the surgical tends to use less trauma, less bleeding, complete lymphadenectomy, quick recovery, etc. It is a safe, effective and reliablethe method in the treatment of invasive bladder cancer. So the method should be widely applied.
27004619	Outcome of patients with nonmetastatic muscle-invasive bladder cancer not undergoing cystectomy after treatment with noncisplatin-based chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy: a retrospective analysis.	Transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT), radiotherapy, chemotherapy, or combinations can be used in patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) not undergoing cystectomy. Nevertheless, unfitness for cystectomy is frequently associated with unfitness for other therapeutic modalities. We report the outcome of patients with MIBC who did not undergo cystectomy and did not receive cisplatin-based chemotherapy. Selection criteria for the study were nonmetastatic MIBC, no cystectomy, no cisplatin-based chemotherapy. Chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy should have been used aside from TURBT. Forty-nine patients (median age 79), managed between April 2001 and January 2012, were included in this analysis. Median Charlson Comorbidity Index was 5, while 76% were unfit for cisplatin. Treatment included radiotherapy (n = 7), carboplatin-based chemotherapy (n = 25), carboplatin-based chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy (n = 10), and radiochemotherapy (n = 7). Five-year event-free rate was 26% (standard error [SE] = 7) for overall survival, 23% (SE = 7) for progression-free survival, and 30 (SE = 8) for cancer-specific survival (CSS). Patients who were treated with combination of radiotherapy and chemotherapy had significantly longer CSS compared to those treated with radiotherapy or chemotherapy only (5-year CSS rate: 16% [SE 8] vs. 63% [SE 15], P = 0.053). Unfit-for-cystectomy patients frequently receive suboptimal nonsurgical treatment. Their outcome was poor. Combining chemotherapy with radiotherapy produced better outcomes and should be prospectively evaluated.
27003158	Loss of DAB2IP expression in human urothelial carcinoma is associated with poorer recurrence-free survival.	The purpose of this study is to investigate the clinical relevance of deletion of ovarian carcinoma 2/disabled homolog 2 (DOC-2/DAB2) interacting protein (DAB2IP) expression in human urothelial carcinoma (UC). We studied DAB2IP protein expression by immunohistochemistry in 130 UCs (90 of the bladder and 40 of the upper urinary tract) and 79 adjacent normal tissues and assessed its prognostic value in terms of recurrence-free and progression-free survival in superficial bladder UC. Twelve human UC cell lines were examined for DAB2IP messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein expression using quantitative RT-PCR and western blotting. Selected cell lines were used to study the effect of treatment with chromatin-modifying agents (5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine, Trichostatin A, or both) on DAB2IP expression. Of 90 bladder tumors, 50 (56 %) and, of 40 upper tract UC, 11 (28 %) were positive for DAB2IP immunostaining (bladder cancer versus upper tract UC, p = 0.003). In 65 superficial cases of bladder cancer loss of DAB2IP, expression was significantly associated with decreased recurrence-free survival (p = 0.046), but not with progression-free survival. Most human urothelial cancer cell lines consistently express DAB2IP mRNA and protein, without any relation to S-phase kinase protein expression. After treatment with either 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine or Trichostatin A or both, the low DAB2IP-expressing bladder cancer cell lines BFTC905 and BFTC909 showed increased DAB2IP mRNA expression. DAB2IP protein levels are higher in bladder cancer than in upper tract UC and in superficial bladder cancer. This is associated with longer recurrence-free survival. Epigenetic regulation of DAB2IP protein appears to play an important role in human urothelial carcinoma.
27002765	MGMT hypermethylation and BCL-2 overexpression associated with superficial bladder cancer and recurrence.	BACKGROUND: Urinary bladder carcinoma is one of the leading causes of death among men, and its high recurrence rates make it one of the most solid tumors to treat. The silencing of the tumor suppressor gene by hypermethylation of the CpG islands and overexpression of proto-oncogene proteins are the main mechanisms in cancers. Here, we investigate methylation status of O6-methylguanine-DNA-methyltransferase (MGMT), a tumor suppressor gene and expression level of BCL-2 a proto-oncogene protein that is frequently observed in bladder carcinoma and its recurrences. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed the methylation of MGMT in 80 tissue samples of patients suffering from bladder cancer and 80 urine samples of cancer-free individuals by MS-PCR. Additionally, BCL-2 protein expression level was analyzed on these 80 tissue samples by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: 45% of patients had MGMT methylation, of which this hypermethylation does not have significant association with an increase in grade, but there was significant association in cases with recurrence tumors and metastasis tumors. Among patients with recurrence tumor, 92.5% patients showed MGMT hypermethylation; 66% of these showed BCL-2 overexpression. CONCLUSION: Our data indicate that MGMT hypermethylation and BCL-2 overexpression may have an intense role in superficial bladder cancer recurrences.
26999210	Potential Effect of Liposomes and Liposome-Encapsulated Botulinum Toxin and Tacrolimus in the Treatment of Bladder Dysfunction.	Bladder drug delivery via catheter instillation is a widely used treatment for recurrence of superficial bladder cancer. Intravesical instillation of liposomal botulinum toxin has recently shown promise in the treatment of overactive bladder and interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome, and studies of liposomal tacrolimus instillations show promise in the treatment of hemorrhagic cystitis. Liposomes are lipid vesicles composed of phospholipid bilayers surrounding an aqueous core that can encapsulate hydrophilic and hydrophobic drug molecules to be delivered to cells via endocytosis. This review will present new developments on instillations of liposomes and liposome-encapsulated drugs into the urinary bladder for treating lower urinary tract dysfunction.
26997439	MAGE-A expression, immune microenvironment, and prognosis in upper urinary tract carcinoma.	The melanoma-associated antigen A (MAGE-A) family comprises cancer-testis antigens that represent promising prognostic biomarkers and immunotherapy targets in several cancer types. The aim of this study was to investigate the significance of MAGE-A expression in upper urinary tract urothelial carcinoma in relation to clinicopathological features, lymphocytic infiltration, and clinical outcome. We immunohistochemically examined the expression of MAGE-A in 171 patients with upper urinary tract urothelial carcinoma. High (>/= 50% positive) and low MAGE-A expression levels were observed in 33 (19%) and 49 (29%) cases, respectively. MAGE-A was negative in 89 cases (52%). MAGE-A expression was positively correlated with high histologic grade; concomitant carcinoma in situ; higher Ki-67 proliferation index; and infiltration of CD3-, CD8-, and CD45RO-positive T lymphocytes, but not with CD20-positive B lymphocytes. High MAGE-A expression was significantly associated with shorter metastasis-free survival after nephroureterectomy (log-rank P = .019; multivariate hazard ratio, 1.98; 95% confidence interval, 1.00-3.92). MAGE-A expression in metastatic lymph nodes was highly correlated with its expression in primary lesions. MAGE-A expression was retained in chemotherapy-resistant metachronous metastatic lesions of urothelial carcinoma. MAGE-A may be a promising prognostic biomarker and potential immunotherapeutic target for patients with upper urinary tract urothelial carcinoma.
26993980	Clinical results of conformal versus intensity-modulated radiotherapy using a focal simultaneous boost for muscle-invasive bladder cancer in elderly or medically unfit patients.	BACKGROUND: For elderly or medically unfit patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer, cystectomy or chemotherapy are contraindicated. This leaves radical radiotherapy as the only treatment option. It was the aim of this study to retrospectively analyze the treatment outcome and associated toxicity of conformal versus intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) using a focal simultaneous tumor boost for muscle-invasive bladder cancer in patients not suitable for cystectomy. METHODS: One hundred eighteen patients with T2-4 N0-1 M0 bladder cancer were analyzed retrospectively. Median age was 80 years. Treatment consisted of either a conformal box technique or IMRT and included a simultaneous boost to the tumor. To enable an accurate boost delivery, fiducial markers were placed around the tumor. Patients were treated with 40 Gy in 20 fractions to the elective treatment volumes, and a daily tumor boost up to 55-60 Gy. RESULTS: Clinical complete response was seen in 87 % of patients. Three-year overall survival was 44 %, with a locoregional control rate of 73 % at 3 years. Toxicity was low, with late urinary and intestinal toxicity rates grade >/= 2 of 14 and 5 %, respectively. The use of IMRT reduced late intestinal toxicity, whereas fiducial markers reduced acute urinary toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: Radical radiotherapy using a focal boost is feasible and effective for elderly or unfit patients, with a 3-year locoregional control of 73 %. Toxicity rates were low, and were reduced by the use of IMRT and fiducial markers.
26993416	Quantification of dose uncertainties in cumulated dose estimation compared to planned dose in prostate IMRT.	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: In prostate IMRT, the objectives were to quantify, for the bladder and the rectum: (i) the dose difference (DD) between the planned dose (PD) and the estimated cumulated dose (ECD) by deformable image registration (DIR); (ii) the dose accumulation uncertainties (DAU). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A series of 24 patients receiving 80Gy in the prostate was used to calculate the ECDpts and the DDpts. To evaluate the DAU, a numerical phantom (ph) simulating deformations of main pelvic organs was used to calculate the ECDph using the same DIR method. A reference cumulated dose (RCDph) was calculated, based on the simulated deformations. The DAUph was defined by the differences between RCDph and ECDph. RESULTS: For the mean dose to the bladder, the standard deviation of DDpts was 6.9Gy (18.1Gy maximum) with a DAUph of 2.7Gy. For the rectum wall, it was 2.0Gy (4.2Gy maximum) with a DAUph of 1.2Gy. Volume differences between PDpts and ECDpts, along the dose-volume histogram, ranged from -30% to +37% and -14% to +14% for the bladder and rectum, respectively. The corresponding uncertainties ranged from -23% to +7% and -4% to +7% for the bladder and rectum, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Large differences between planned and delivered doses to the bladder have been quantified and are higher than the uncertainties of the DIR method. For the rectum, the differences are smaller and close to the DIR uncertainties.
26993415	First application of a pixel-wise analysis on bladder dose-surface maps in prostate cancer radiotherapy.	PURPOSE: To develop a method for investigating local dose effects on the bladder after prostate cancer radiotherapy based on dose-surface maps (DSMs). BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: DSMs of patients included in a prospective study (DUE01) were generated by virtually cutting bladder contours at the points intersecting the sagittal plane passing through its center-of-mass: maps were laterally normalized and aligned at the posterior inferior point. The average DSMs of patients with/without toxicity, the DSMs of differences and t statistic were used to select regions better discriminating patients with toxicity. A total of 72 patients with no/mild urinary symptoms before radiotherapy and who were treated with moderate hypo-fractionation (2.5-2.65Gy/fr, 70-74Gy) were considered, and the endpoint was an International Prostate Symptoms Score (IPSS)15 at the end of therapy (IPSSend15, n=25/72). RESULTS: The DSMs of patients with/without toxicity were significantly different (p<0.05). The percentage of bladder circumference receiving >50-70Gy at 5-7mm from the base was associated with an IPSSend15 (odds ratios: 1.03-1.07). Different patterns were recognized for specific symptoms. With frequency/urgency, a quasi-threshold effect on the absolute posterior dose at 5-12mm from the base (2Gy equivalent doses=80-82Gy, alpha/beta=3-5Gy) was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Local-dose effects for acute symptoms were detected in a group of patients treated within a moderately hypo-fractionated protocol. The results for frequency/urgency were consistent with a threshold effect on the trigone.
26992901	Aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2) and alcohol dehydrogenase 1B (ADH1B) polymorphisms exacerbate bladder cancer risk associated with alcohol drinking: gene-environment interaction.	Although a range of chemical exposures (cigarette smoking and occupational exposure) are recognized risk factors for the development of bladder cancer (BCa), many epidemiological studies have demonstrated that alcohol drinking is not associated with BCa risk. Aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2; rs671, Glu504Lys) and alcohol dehydrogenase 1B (ADH1B; rs1229984, His47Arg) polymorphisms impact the accumulation of acetaldehyde, resulting in an increased risk of various cancers. To date, however, no studies evaluating the association between BCa risk and alcohol drinking have considered these polymorphisms. Here, we conducted a matched case-control study to investigate whether ALDH2 and ADH1B polymorphisms influence BCa risk associated with alcohol drinking. Cases were 74 BCa patients and controls were 740 first-visit outpatients without cancer at Aichi Cancer Center Hospital between January 2001 and December 2005. Odds ratio (OR), 95% confidence interval (CI) and gene-environment interaction were assessed by conditional logistic regression analysis with adjustment for potential confounders. Results showed that ALDH2 Glu/Lys was associated with a significantly increased risk of BCa compared with Glu/Glu (OR 2.03, 95% CI 1.14-3.62, P = 0.017). In contrast, ALDH2 Glu/Lys showed no increase in risk among the stratum of never drinkers compared with Glu/Glu, indicating a gene-environment interaction. ADH1B His/Arg had an OR of 1.98 (1.20-3.24, P = 0.007) compared with His/His. ADH1B Arg+ showed a similar OR and 95% CI. Individuals with ALDH2 Glu/Lys and ADH1B Arg+ had the highest risk of BCa compared with ALDH2 Glu/Glu and ADH1B His/His [OR 4.00 (1.81-8.87), P = 0.001].
26992900	Oral intake of ranitidine increases urinary excretion of N-nitrosodimethylamine.	The H2-receptor antagonist, ranitidine, is among the most widely used pharmaceuticals to treat gastroesophageal reflux disease and peptic ulcers. While previous studies have demonstrated that amines can form N-nitrosamines when exposed to nitrite at stomach-relevant pH, N-nitrosamine formation from ranitidine, an amine-based pharmaceutical, has not been demonstrated under these conditions. In this work, we confirmed the production of N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA), a potent carcinogen, by nitrosation of ranitidine under stomach-relevant pH conditions in vitro We also evaluated the urinary NDMA excretion attributable to ingestion of clinically used ranitidine doses. Urine samples collected from five female and five male, healthy adult volunteers over 24-h periods before and after consumption of 150mg ranitidine were analyzed for residual ranitidine, ranitidine metabolites, NDMA, total N-nitrosamines and dimethylamine. Following ranitidine intake, the urinary NDMA excreted over 24h increased 400-folds from 110 to 47 600ng, while total N-nitrosamines increased 5-folds. NDMA excretion rates after ranitidine intake equaled or exceeded those observed previously in patients with schistosomiasis, a disease wherein N-nitrosamines are implicated as the etiological agents for bladder cancer. Due to metabolism within the body, urinary NDMA measurements represent a lower-bound estimate of systemic NDMA exposure. Our results suggest a need to evaluate the risks attributable to NDMA associated with chronic consumption of ranitidine, and to identify alternative treatments that minimize exposure to N-nitrosamines.
26991372	The impact of subdividing the "atypical" category for urinary cytology on patient management.	INTRODUCTION: The purpose of the study is to determine the impact of subdividing the "atypical" cytology interpretation into two groups: Atypical urothelial cells of uncertain significance (AUC-US) and Atypical urothelial cells suspicious for high-grade urothelial carcinoma (AUC-H/SHGUC), on management of patients with no prior history of UC. MATERIALS AND METHOD: This is a retrospective study of "atypical" urine cytology with subsequent tissue examination occurring within six months. Cytology reports with "atypical" interpretation were reclassified into AUS-UC and AUC-H based on morphologic features identified by the Johns Hopkins system and the Paris system for urine cytology. Follow-up and categorical outcomes were compared between the reclassified AUC-US and AUC-H groups. RESULTS: There was no significant difference (P < 0.4539) in the rate of cytology follow-up, the follow-up cytology result (P < 0.1845), or time between follow-up cytologies (P < 0.0869) between the reclassified atypical group of AUC-H and AUC-US. There was a significant association (P < 0.0001) of rate of malignancy with the reclassified AUC-H (87.18%) compared to the AUC-US (58.68%) groups. CONCLUSION: There was no difference in follow-up between the AUC-H and AUC-US, however there was a difference in the rates of malignancy in the two groups. The AUC-H group is similar to the SHGUC group of the Paris system and can be considered as such, whereas the AUC-US group should continue to be considered atypical. We conclude that reclassification of the "atypical" category into AUC-US and AUC-H/SHGUC can reduce the rate of atypia and help in focused follow-up and targeted management. Diagn.

26990592	Recombinant horseradish peroxidase variants for targeted cancer treatment.	Cancer is a major cause of death. Common chemo- and radiation-therapies damage healthy tissue and cause painful side effects. The enzyme horseradish peroxidase (HRP) has been shown to activate the plant hormone indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) to a powerful anticancer agent in in vitro studies, but gene directed enzyme prodrug therapy (GDEPT) studies showed ambivalent results. Thus, HRP/IAA in antibody directed enzyme prodrug therapy (ADEPT) was investigated as an alternative. However, this approach has not been intensively studied, since the enzyme preparation from plant describes an undefined mixture of isoenzymes with a heterogenic glycosylation pattern incompatible with the human system. Here, we describe the recombinant production of the two HRP isoenzymes C1A and A2A in a Pichia pastoris benchmark strain and a glyco-engineered strain with a knockout of the alpha-1,6-mannosyltransferase (OCH1) responsible for hypermannosylation. We biochemically characterized the enzyme variants, tested them with IAA and applied them on cancer cells. In the absence of H2 O2 , HRP C1A turned out to be highly active with IAA, independent of its surface glycosylation. Subsequent in vitro cytotoxicity studies with human T24 bladder carcinoma and MDA-MB-231 breast carcinoma cells underlined the applicability of recombinant HRP C1A with reduced surface glycoslyation for targeted cancer treatment. Summarizing, this is the first study describing the successful use of recombinantly produced HRP for targeted cancer treatment. Our findings might pave the way for an increased use of the powerful isoenzyme HRP C1A in cancer research in the future.
26989867	Comparison between cytospin and liquid-based cytology in urine specimens classified according to the Paris System for Reporting Urinary Cytology.	BACKGROUND: The current study compared ThinPrep urinary cytology and conventional cytospin urinary cytology in the diagnosis of bladder cancer, applying the Paris System for Reporting Urinary Cytology. METHODS: Between January 2010 and December 2011, a total of 3659 urine samples were processed using conventional cytospin methods. Between January 2012 and December 2013, a total of 4186 urine cytological cases were analyzed using ThinPrep methods. In 131 cases (65 processed by conventional cytospin and 66 processed by ThinPrep), a subsequent biopsy was performed. The authors reclassified these cases according to the Paris System and an analysis between the 2 methods with regard to bladder biopsies was performed. RESULTS: No significant differences were observed in terms of sensitivity and specificity between the 2 methods in cases with positive cytology for high-grade carcinoma. According to the Paris System, cases of atypical urothelial cells (AUC) and atypical urothelial cells suspicious for high-grade carcinoma (AUC-H) that were processed using cytospin did not correlate with urothelial carcinoma or with negative biopsies; conversely, the AUC cases processed using ThinPrep appeared to correlate with negative histological biopsies or low-grade urothelial carcinoma. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the current study demonstrated that according to the Paris System, there were no significant differences in sensitivity or specificity for the diagnosis of high-grade urothelial carcinoma or AUC-H between the 2 methods. Cases of AUC should be easy to recognize using Thin Prep rather than cytospin and only AUCs diagnosed with ThinPrep were found to be statistically linked to negative cases for carcinoma or with low-grade urothelial carcinoma.

26988833	[Analysis of life-threatening complications during perioperative period in patients undergoing radical cystectomy with orthotopic neobladder].	OBJECTIVE: To investigate the factors influencing life-threatening complications during perioperative period in patients undergoing traditional cystectomy with orthotopic neobladder. METHODS: To retrospectively analyze the clinical data of 206 cases who underwent radical cystectomy with orthotopic neobladder. Logistic regression analysis was used to analyze the significance of the factors such as age, amount of bleeding, pathological stage, effective supplement of albumin, cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, operation duration, intestinal preparation, etc., on the occurrence of severe complications. RESULTS: Among the 206 patients who underwent radical cystectomy with orthotopic neobladder, 22 cases (10.7%) had life-threatening complications (intestinal fistula, hemorrhagic shock, severe infection) during the perioperative period, and 9 cases died (mortality rate 4.4%). Logistic regression analysis showed that the elderly age, long operation duration, lack of effective supplement of albumin, diabetes mellitus are independent factors influencing the occurrence of life-threatening complications during the perioperative period of radical cystectomy with orthotopic ileal neobladder (P<0.05 for all), and are risk factors positively correlated with the severe complications. CONCLUSION: The elderly age, long operation duration, lack of effective supplement of albumin, and diabetes mellitus are risk factors of the occurrence of life-threatening complications during the perioperative period in patients undergoing radical cystectomy with orthotopic ileal neobladder, therefore, attention should be paid to this issue.
26986503	BLCAP arrests G(1)/S checkpoint and induces apoptosis through downregulation of pRb1 in HeLa cells.	BLCAP (bladder cancer-associated protein) gene exhibited tumor suppressor function in different tumors and is regarded as a candidate tumor suppressor gene; however, the mechanism by which BLCAP exerts its function remains elusive. This study investigated the functional association between BLCAP and proliferation or apoptosis in cervical cancer cells, to identify the functional motifs of BLCAP. The BLCAP-shRNA expression vector based on pRNA-U6.1/Hygro plasmid was used to specifically inhibit BLCAP activity in HeLa cells. The optimal shRNA plasmid was selected to knock down BLCAP expression and the biological effects were investigated. The effects on cell cycle and apoptosis were detected by flow cytometric or Annexin V-FITC staining analysis. The gene expression profiles of HeLa cells transfected with blcap-wt and BLCAP-shRNA were analyzed using human signal pathway gene Oligochips. The levels of protein expression and interaction of BLCAP with Rb1 proteins were determined by western blotting and Co-IP assays. The site-specific mutagenesis assay was used to identify amino acid residues important for BLCAP. Significantly differentially expressed genes were found by gene Oligo chips analysis. These genes were all correlated with proliferation, cell cycle and apoptosis. The results of western blotting and Co-IP assays confirmed that overexpression of BLCAP could interact with Rb1 and inhibit Rb1 phosphorylation. Further investigation revealed that SAXX mutation in the key regions of BLCAP suppressed the function of BLCAP and significantly increased the level of phosphorylated Rb1 protein. Here our findings suggested that the functional association of BLCAP and Rb1 might play important roles in proliferation and apoptosis of HeLa cells. It suggested that BLCAP could be a novel therapeutic target for cervical cancer.
26985818	Perineal herniation of an ileal neobladder following radical cystectomy and consecutive rectal resection for recurrent bladder carcinoma.	Secondary perineal herniation of intraperitoneal contents represents a rare complication following procedures such as abdominoperineal rectal resection or cystectomy. We present a case of a perineal hernia formation with prolapse of an ileum neobladder following radical cystectomy and rectal resection for recurrent bladder cancer. Following consecutive resections in the anterior and posterior compartment of the lesser pelvis, the patient developed problems emptying his neobladder. Clinical examination and computed tomography revealed perineal herniation of his neobladder through the pelvic floor. Through a perineal approach, the hernial sac could be repositioned, and via a combination of absorbable and non-absorbable synthetic mesh grafts, the pelvic floor was stabilised. Follow-up review at one year after hernia fixation showed no signs of recurrence and no symptoms. In cases of extensive surgery in the lesser pelvis with associated weakness of the pelvic compartments, meshes should be considered for closure of the pelvic floor. Development of biological meshes with reduced risk of infection might be an interesting treatment option in these cases.
26984414	Improving Systemic Chemotherapy for Bladder Cancer.	Systemic chemotherapy is integral to the management of muscle-invasive and metastatic bladder cancer (BCa). Neoadjuvant chemotherapy has been increasingly utilized for muscle-invasive BCa over the past several years, and several options for cisplatin-based regimens have emerged. Adjuvant chemotherapy may be considered for select patients who did not receive neoadjuvant therapy. Systemic chemotherapy added to radiotherapy is a critical component of a bladder-preserving approach and superior to radiotherapy alone. Cisplatin-based chemotherapy has been the mainstay for metastatic BCa for more than three decades. Novel targeted agents are in development fueled by the recent molecular characterization of BCa. Recent trials of immunotherapy have demonstrated the possibility of a less toxic and potentially more effective treatment for metastatic disease. It is an extremely exciting time for BCa research, and much needed improvements in systemic treatment are most certainly on the horizon.
26984085	Pulmonary Tumor Thrombotic Microangiopathy Caused by Urothelial Carcinoma Expressing Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor, Platelet-derived Growth Factor, and Osteopontin.	Pulmonary tumor thrombotic microangiopathy (PTTM) is a fatal cancer-related pulmonary complication. It is generally caused by gastric adenocarcinoma, and several molecules produced by tumor cells are reported to play important roles in its pathogenesis. We herein report an autopsy case of PTTM caused by urothelial carcinoma. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), and osteopontin were found to be expressed in both the primary tumor cells and metastatic cells in the PTTM lesions. These findings implicate the possible involvement of VEGF, PDGF, and osteopontin in the pathogenesis of PTTM caused by urothelial carcinoma.
26983576	Tetrandrine reverses epithelial-mesenchymal transition in bladder cancer by downregulating Gli-1.	Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway is considered to play a crucial role in vertebrate development and carcinogenesis. Additionally, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a cellular process during which epithelial cells become mesenchymal-appearing cells, facilitating cancer metastasis and invasion. Accumulating evidence has indicated that the Hh signaling pathway could potentiate the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). In the present study, we demonstrated that tetrandrine, a bisbenzylisoquinoline alkaloid isolated from Stephaniae, exerts its anti-metastatic ability in bladder cancer cells by regulating GLI family zinc finger 1 (Gli-1), a key factor of Hedgehog signaling pathway. In our study, we confirmed that tetrandrine could impede migration and invasion in bladder cancer 5637 and T24 cells. Additionally, tetrandrine reverses EMT by increasing the expression of E-cadherin and reducing the N-cadherin, vimentin and Slug expression in a dose-dependent manner. Interestingly, tetrandrine also decreases mobility and reduces the expression of Gli-1 in bladder cancer cells. Moreover, we verified that tetrandrine inhibits metastasis and induces mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) of bladder cancer through downregulation of Gli-1, which could be partially reversed by Gli-1 overexpression. In conclusion, our findings show that tetrandrine inhibits migration and invasion, and reverses EMT of bladder cancer cells through negatively regulating Gli-1. It indicates that Gli-1 may be a potential therapeutic target of tetrandrine against bladder cancer.
26982782	Cutaneous invasion from sarcomatoid urothelial carcinoma: clinical and dermatopathologic features.	In Brazil, without considering the non-melanoma skin tumors, bladder cancer in men is the eighth most common, and the urothelial carcinoma or transitional cell carcinoma is the most common among these. Cutaneous metastases from urothelial neoplasms appear as single or multiple erythematous, infiltrated nodules or plaques, and like other cases of distant disease, it is indicative of poor prognosis. The invasive urothelial carcinoma is recognized for its ability to present divergent differentiation and morphological variants. The sarcomatoid urothelial carcinoma is a rare cancer that consists of two different components: one composed of epithelial tissue and the other with sarcomatoid features of mesenchymal origin. The authors describe a case of cutaneous metastasis of sarcomatoid urothelial carcinoma in a 63-year-old male patient.
26982739	Upper Urinary Tract Urothelial Carcinoma Tumor Seeding along Percutaneous Nephrostomy Track: Case Report and Review of the Literature.	Upper urinary tract urothelial carcinomas (UTUC) account for 5-10% of all transitional cells neoplasms. Kidney-sparing treatment should be considered for low grade (LG) UTUC and for imperative conditions. Percutaneous approach may have a role in LG tumors not manageable endoscopically. Tumor seeding along nephrostomy track is a rare report. We describe the case of a 73-year-old male, with a history of high-grade UC of the left renal pelvis. A CT scan showed the thickening of left renal pelvic wall, and percutaneous biopsy was performed. The patient underwent laparoscopic left nephroureterectomy. Seven months later, he was admitted for left flank pain due to a mass along the percutaneous track site. Mass en-bloc resection was performed, and histopathology finding demonstrated undifferentiated carcinoma, compatible with UTUC metastasis. The percutaneous approach should be considered to be the possible cause of tumor seeding. Multimodal therapy seems mandatory, as highlighted in our outcomes, with 5 years of recurrence free survival.
26981592	Value of urinary topoisomerase-IIA cell-free DNA for diagnosis of bladder cancer.	PURPOSE: Topoisomerase-II alpha (TopoIIA ), a DNA gyrase isoform that plays an important role in the cell cycle, is present in normal tissues and various human cancers, and can show altered expression in both. The aim of the current study was to examine the value of urinary TopoIIA cell-free DNA as a noninvasive diagnosis of bladder cancer (BC). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two patient cohorts were examined. Cohort 1 (73 BC patients and seven controls) provided bladder tissue samples, whereas cohort 2 (83 BC patients, 54 nonmalignant hematuric patients, and 61 normal controls) provided urine samples. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction was used to measure expression of TopoIIA mRNA in tissues and TopoIIA cell-free DNA in urine samples. RESULTS: The results showed that expression of TopoIIA mRNA in BC tissues was significantly higher than that in noncancer control tissues (p<0.001). The expression of urinary TopoIIA cell-free DNA in BC patients was also significantly higher than that in noncancer patient controls and hematuria patients (p < 0.001 and p < 0.001, respectively). High expression of urinary TopoIIA cell-free DNA was also detected in muscle invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) when compared with nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) (p=0.002). Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve analysis was performed to examine the sensitivity/specificity of urinary TopoIIA cell-free DNA for diagnosing BC, NMIBC, and MIBC. The areas under the ROC curve for BC, NMIBC, and MIBC were 0.741, 0.701, and 0.838, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, the results of this study provide evidence that cell-free TopoIIA DNA may be a potential biomarker for BC.
26980488	Genetic alteration in phosphofructokinase family promotes growth of muscle-invasive bladder cancer.	AIMS: Metabolic alterations in cancer, including bladder cancer, have been addressed in recent years. We aimed to study the role of phosphofructokinase (PFK) in muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC). METHOD: By in silico analysis of the bladder cancer data from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database using the cBioPortal platform, we studied genetic alteration of genes within the PFK family (PFKL, PFKM, PFKP, PFKFB1, PFKFB2, PFKFB3, and PFKFB4). In vitro studies were carried out using the PFK inhibitor 2,5-anhydro-D-glucitol-6-phosphate. RESULTS: Genetic alterations of PFK family genes were observed in ~44% of MIBC cases in TCGA. The main alterations were amplification and upregulation. Patients with altered PFK gene status were more likely to have a history of noninvasive bladder cancer. Altered PFK status was not associated with survival or disease relapse. Use of the PFK inhibitor significantly decreased the level of glycolysis and inhibited the growth and invasion of bladder cancer cells. CONCLUSIONS: PFKs were critical genes in charge of glycolysis and were upregulated in bladder cancer. Targeting this pathway could inhibit cell growth in bladder cancer.
26977846	Natural biology and management of nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer.	PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This article reviews the natural biology of noninvasive bladder cancer and its management strategies while summarizing the most recent advances in the field. RECENT FINDINGS: Nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) has a tendency to recur and progress. Risk stratification has helped triage patients but improved tools, including biomarkers, are still needed. Enhanced endoscopy with photodynamic imaging, narrow band imaging, optical coherence tomography and confocal laser endomicroscopy show promise for diagnosis, risk stratification and disease monitoring. Attempts at better treatment, especially in refractory high-risk cases, include the addition of intravesical hyperthermia, combination and sequential therapy with existing agents and the use of novel agents such as mycobacterial cell wall extract. New data are emerging regarding the potential role of active surveillance in low-risk patients. SUMMARY: NMIBC represents a variety of disease states and continues to pose management challenges. As our understanding of tumor biology improves and technology advances, achieving better outcomes through individualized care may be possible.
26976983	Expression of gamma-Synuclein in Bladder Carcinoma: A Possible Marker for Prognosis.	AIM: To investigate if gamma-synuclein (SNCG) could be used as a bladder cancer (BC) marker to predict prognosis of BC. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Medical records of 140 patients with BC (January, 2006 to December, 2009) were retrospectively reviewed. SNCG expression level was examined by immunohistological staining. The patients' survival rate was calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Cox proportional regression model was used to identify independent predictors for BC. RESULTS: Overexpression of SNCG was detected in BC tissues and the expression level of SNCG strongly positively correlated with BC recurrence. However, no correlation was found between SNCG level and tumor stage or survival rate. CONCLUSION: SNCG is a good marker to predict recurrence of BC, but not a reliable marker for staging or prediction of survival rate.
26976217	Pumpkin seed extract: Cell growth inhibition of hyperplastic and cancer cells, independent of steroid hormone receptors.	Pumpkin seeds have been known in folk medicine as remedy for kidney, bladder and prostate disorders since centuries. Nevertheless, pumpkin research provides insufficient data to back up traditional beliefs of ethnomedical practice. The bioactivity of a hydro-ethanolic extract of pumpkin seeds from the Styrian pumpkin, Cucurbita pepo L. subsp. pepo var. styriaca, was investigated. As pumpkin seed extracts are standardized to cucurbitin, this compound was also tested. Transactivational activity was evaluated for human androgen receptor, estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor with in vitro yeast assays. Cell viability tests with prostate cancer cells, breast cancer cells, colorectal adenocarcinoma cells and a hyperplastic cell line from benign prostate hyperplasia tissue were performed. As model for non-hyperplastic cells, effects on cell viability were tested with a human dermal fibroblast cell line (HDF-5). No transactivational activity was found for human androgen receptor, estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor, for both, extract and cucurbitin. A cell growth inhibition of ~40-50% was observed for all cell lines, with the exception of HDF-5, which showed with ~20% much lower cell growth inhibition. Given the receptor status of some cell lines, a steroid-hormone receptor independent growth inhibiting effect can be assumed. The cell growth inhibition for fast growing cells together with the cell growth inhibition of prostate-, breast- and colon cancer cells corroborates the ethnomedical use of pumpkin seeds for a treatment of benign prostate hyperplasia. Moreover, due to the lack of androgenic activity, pumpkin seed applications can be regarded as safe for the prostate.
26976048	Clinical Practice Pattern of Immediate Intravesical Chemotherapy following Transurethral Resection of a Bladder Tumor in Korea: National Health Insurance Database Study.	We evaluated the frequency and practice pattern of immediate postoperative intravesical chemotherapy (PIC) after transurethral resection of a bladder tumor (TURBT) in suspected non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). Information from the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service database from January 1, 2008 to December 31, 2013 was used. Patients with bladder cancer who received TURBT were considered as the cases (37,941 patients and 59,568 cases). The time of PIC after TURBT, types of PIC regimens, and the potential effect of PIC on the delay for additional treatment were analyzed. The study cohort included 23,726 subjects and 30,473 cases with a mean age of 66.8 +/- 12.0 years, including 19,362 (81.6%) male patients. The rate of immediate PIC was 11.0% of cases (3,359 cases). There was significant difference in the frequency rate of additional treatment among patients with immediate PIC and patients without immediate PIC within 1 year from the first TURBT (15.2% vs 16.6%, p = 0.035). However, no difference was revealed for whole observational period (33.7% vs 34.5%, p = 0.373). The frequency rate of immediate PIC after TURBT for suspected NMIBC was low in real clinical practice. More efforts are needed to improve the usage rate of PIC after TURBT for suspected NMIBC.
26975779	Efficacy and safety of Vinflunine for advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma in routine practice based on the French multi-centre CURVE study.	BACKGROUND: To retrospectively assess the efficacy and safety of Vinflunine (VFL) under routine conditions and identify overall survival (OS) prognostic factors. METHODS: Twenty centres participated in the retrospective study (minimum 4 patients undergoing VFL treatment for advanced/metastatic UC after platinum-based regimen progression. Primary endpoint was OS. Secondary endpoints: progression-free survival (PFS), radiological response rate (RR) RECIST criteria and toxicity (CTC NCI v3). RESULTS: These centres enrolled 134 patients. Prior chemotherapy (CT) lines (>/= 1 palliative): 1 and >/= 2 in 69% and 26% of patients, respectively. Performance status (PS): 0, 1, 2 in 25%, 46% and 23% of patients. Median OS = 8.2 months [6.5-9.4], PFS = 4.2 months and RR 22%, median number of 5 cycles. In risk groups based on 0-3 presence of adverse prognostic factors (PS >/= 1, haemoglobin </= 10 g/dl and liver metastasis), median OS: 13.2, 9.9, 3.6, and 2.4 months (P < .0001), respectively; 3.3 months (1.9-5.6) in PS >/= 2 subgroup. CONCLUSION: This study reflects routine UC management and confirmed VFL patient efficacy. The drug is safe with gastro-intestinal and haematological prophylaxis. Analysis of prognostic factors for OS is consistent with pivotal trials.
26975511	Comparison of the clinical effectiveness of 3D and 2D imaging systems for laparoscopic radical cystectomy with pelvic lymph node dissection.	OBJECTIVE: To compare the clinical effectiveness of three-dimensional (3D) and two-dimensional (2D) laparoscopic imaging systems for radical cystectomy (RC) with pelvic lymph node dissection. METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis of data collected from all patients who underwent RC with pelvic lymph node dissection between January 2013 and May 2014, performed by a single surgeon in our clinic. Demographic characteristics and operative data from the procedure were collected and compared. RESULTS: Data were available from 42 patients (mean age 63 +/- 6.7 years) of whom 18 were operated on using a 3D imaging laparoscope (Group 3D) and 24 were operated on using a conventional 2D laparoscope (Group 2D). There were no statistically significant differences in patient characteristics between the two groups (P > 0.05). There was no difference between groups in the mean (+/-SD) number of lymph nodes retrieved from each patient (13.2 +/- 4.6 and 12.5 +/- 4.3, for the 3D and 2D groups respectively), or in blood loss. PLND duration and total operative time were statistically significantly lower in Group 3D than in group 2D. There were no statistically significant between-group differences in postoperative hospital stay or total cost of the procedures. Serious postoperative complications occurred in one patient (5.6%) in group 3D, and four patients (16.7%) in group 2D (P = 0.075). CONCLUSIONS: With the assistance of 3D stereoscopic imaging, surgeons may be able to reduce both the duration of lymph node dissection and overall operative time during laparoscopic RC with pelvic lymph node dissection, without increasing postoperative hospital stay or total cost.
26975197	Hexaminolevulinate hydrochloride blue-light flexible cystoscopy in the detection and follow-up of nonmuscle-invasive bladder cancer: cost consequences during outpatient surveillance in Sweden.	AIM: This study explored the cost consequences of introducing hexaminolevulinate hydrochloride-guided blue-light flexible cystoscopy (HAL BLFC) as an adjunct to white-light flexible cystoscopy compared with white-light flexible cystoscopy alone, for the detection and management of nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer in Sweden. METHODS: The model evaluated 231 patients in the outpatient setting after successful initial transurethral resection of the bladder tumor. RESULTS: HAL BLFC introduction across all risk groups resulted in minimal budget impact (+1.6% total cost/5 years, or 189 Swedish Krona [SEK] per patient/year), and translated to cost savings in intermediate- and high-risk groups from year 2. CONCLUSION: HAL BLFC allowed more outpatient treatment with improved recurrence detection and reduced transurethral resection of the bladder tumors, cystectomies, bed days and operating room time, with minimal cost impact across all risk groups, demonstrating the economic benefits of introducing HAL.
26975021	Metabolic phenotype of bladder cancer.	Metabolism of bladder cancer represents a key issue for cancer research. Several metabolic altered pathways are involved in bladder tumorigenesis, representing therefore interesting targets for therapy. Tumor cells, including urothelial cancer cells, rely on a peculiar shift to aerobic glycolysis-dependent metabolism (the Warburg-effect) as the main energy source to sustain their uncontrolled growth and proliferation. Therefore, the high glycolytic flux depends on the overexpression of glycolysis-related genes (SRC-3, glucose transporter type 1 [GLUT1], GLUT3, lactic dehydrogenase A [LDHA], LDHB, hexokinase 1 [HK1], HK2, pyruvate kinase type M [PKM], and hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha [HIF-1alpha]), resulting in an overproduction of pyruvate, alanine and lactate. Concurrently, bladder cancer metabolism displays an increased expression of genes favoring the pentose phosphate pathway (glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase [G6PD]) and the fatty-acid synthesis (fatty acid synthase [FASN]), along with a decrease of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and Krebs cycle activities. Moreover, the PTEN/PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, hyper-activated in bladder cancer, acts as central regulator of aerobic glycolysis, hence contributing to cancer metabolic switch and tumor cell proliferation. Besides glycolysis, glycogen metabolism pathway plays a robust role in bladder cancer development. In particular, the overexpression of GLUT-1, the loss of the tumor suppressor glycogen debranching enzyme amylo-alpha-1,6-glucosidase, 4-alpha-glucanotransferase (AGL), and the increased activity of the tumor promoter enzyme glycogen phosphorylase impair glycogen metabolism. An increase in glucose uptake, decrease in normal cellular glycogen storage, and overproduction of lactate are consequences of decreased oxidative phosphorylation and inability to reuse glucose into the pentose phosphate and de novo fatty acid synthesis pathways. Moreover, AGL loss determines augmented levels of the serine-to-glycine enzyme serine hydroxymethyltransferase-2 (SHMT2), resulting in an increased glycine and purine ring of nucleotides synthesis, thus supporting cells proliferation. A deep understanding of the metabolic phenotype of bladder cancer will provide novel opportunities for targeted therapeutic strategies.
26974329	Malignancies in Swedish persons with haemophilia: a longitudinal registry study.	The aim of the study was to investigate, over time, the incidence of and mortality due to malignant diseases among persons with haemophilia, compared to matched controls. Persons with haemophilia A or B were enrolled via registries at each haemophilia centre, as well as from the National Patient Registry, and were compared to five sex and age-matched controls per patient. Data from the national Cancer Registry were linked to the study participants. A total of 1431 persons with haemophilia and 7150 matched controls were enrolled. Between the years 1972 and 2008, 164 malignancies were reported. The most common type of cancer among patients was prostate cancer, followed by haematologic malignancies, including lymphoma and leukaemia, which were significantly more frequent in patients [n = 35 (2.4%) vs. n = 60 (0.8%); P < 0.001]. Malignancies in bladder and other urinary organs were also significantly different [n = 21 (1.5%) vs. n = 46 (0.6%); P < 0.01]. The overall incidence rate ratio of malignancies per 1000 person-years compared to the controls was 1.3 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.1, 1.6]. In subgroup analysis, the corresponding incidence rate ratios per 1000 person-years for persons with severe haemophilia was 1.7 (95% CI 0.9, 3.1) and that for mild/moderate haemophilia 1.1 (95% CI 0.8, 1.5). Swedish persons with haemophilia had a significantly higher incidence of malignant diseases than controls. These were primarily haematologic malignancies and cancer in urinary organs, and the difference independent of any co-infections with HIV and/or viral hepatitis. The findings indicate the importance of further studies and close follow-up of malignancies in persons with haemophilia.
26972810	An ancillary method in urine cytology: Nucleolar/nuclear volume ratio for discrimination between benign and malignant urothelial cells.	BACKGROUND: The essential of urine cytology for the diagnosis and the follow-up of urothelial neoplasia has been widely recognized. However, there are some cases in which a definitive diagnosis cannot be made due to difficulty in discriminating between benign and malignant. This study evaluated the practicality of nucleolar/nuclear volume ratio (%) for the discrimination. METHODS: Using Papanicolaou-stained slides, 253 benign urothelial cells and 282 malignant urothelial cells were selected and divided into a benign urothelial cell and an urothelial carcinoma (UC) cell groups. Three suspicious cases and four cases in which discrimination between benign and malignant was difficult were prepared for verification test. Subject cells were decolorized and stained with 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole for detection of the nuclei and the nucleoli. Z-stack method was performed to analyze. RESULTS: When the cutoff point of 1.514% discriminating benign urothelial cells and UC cells from nucleolar/nuclear volume ratio (%) was utilized, the sensitivity was 56.0%, the specificity was 88.5%, the positive predictive value was 84.5%, and the negative predictive value was 64.4%. Nuclear and nucleolar volume, number of the nucleoli, and nucleolar/nuclear volume ratio (%) were significantly higher in the UC cell group than in the benign urothelial cell group (P <0.001). In the verification test using the nucleolar/nuclear ratio (%), four of the seven cases were concordant with the final diagnosis. CONCLUSION: This study analyzed the nuclear and nucleolar volume to establish an index for discrimination of benign and malignant urothelial cells, providing possible additional information in urine cytology.

26972278	Akt3 knockdown induces mitochondrial dysfunction in human cancer cells.	Akt/PKB plays a pivotal role in cell proliferation and survival. However, the isotype-specific roles of Akt in mitochondrial function have not been fully addressed. In this study, we explored the role of Akt in mitochondrial function after stable knockdown of the Akt isoforms in EJ human bladder cancer cells. We found that the mitochondrial mass was significantly increased in the Akt1- and Akt3-knockdown cells, and this increase was accompanied by an increase in TFAM and NRF1. Akt2 knockdown did not cause a similar effect. Interestingly, Akt3 knockdown also led to severe structural defects in the mitochondria, an increase in doxorubicin-induced senescence, and impairment of cell proliferation in galactose medium. Consistent with these observations, the mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate was significantly reduced in the Akt3-knockdown cells. An Akt3 deficiency-induced decrease in mitochondrial respiration was also observed in A549 lung cancer cells. Collectively, these results suggest that the Akt isoforms play distinct roles in mitochondrial function and that Akt3 is critical for proper mitochondrial respiration in human cancer cells.
26971194	A comparison of regional and general anesthesia effects on 5 year survival and cancer recurrence after transurethral resection of the bladder tumor: a retrospective analysis.	BACKGROUND: Recent studies have reported that cancer surgeries involving regional anesthesia have better outcomes than those under general anesthesia. However, the effects of anesthetic technique have not been investigated in patients with bladder cancer. Therefore, this retrospective study was conducted to investigate which anesthetic technique results in a better bladder cancer prognosis. METHODS: Sixty-one of 531 patients underwent transurethral resection of a bladder tumor under general anesthesia from 2001 to 2008 in our hospital. Patients who attended five years of follow-up and who had pathological findings of urothelial carcinoma grades I-II were enrolled. Finally, 24 patients (G group) who underwent general anesthesia and 137 (R group) who underwent regional (spinal or epidural) anesthesia were compared. Five-year survival and recurrence-free time were compared using the chi-square and t-tests, respectively. A logistic regression and partial correlation analysis were performed to evaluate other factors affecting survival. RESULTS: Five-year survival was 87.5% for general anesthesia and 96.3% for regional (P = 0.099). The regression analysis showed that older age contributed to reduced survival (odds ratio = 0.85, P = 0.001). Regional anesthesia showed higher 5-year survival (coefficient = -0.167, P = 0.044) more than general anesthesia through the partial correlation analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Though partial correlation analysis show that five-year survival is higher in patients whose surgery is under regional than general anesthesia, the association was not significant in the chi-square test and logistic regression analysis. Large prospective studies are needed to determine whether the association between regional anesthesia and survival is causative.
26970133	Frugal chemoprevention: targeting Nrf2 with foods rich in sulforaphane.	With the properties of efficacy, safety, tolerability, practicability and low cost, foods containing bioactive phytochemicals are gaining significant attention as elements of chemoprevention strategies against cancer. Sulforaphane [1-isothiocyanato-4-(methylsulfinyl)butane], a naturally occurring isothiocyanate produced by cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli, is found to be a highly promising chemoprevention agent against not only a variety of cancers such as breast, prostate, colon, skin, lung, stomach or bladder, but also cardiovascular disease, neurodegenerative diseases, and diabetes. For reasons of experimental exigency, preclinical studies have focused principally on sulforaphane itself, while clinical studies have relied on broccoli sprout preparations rich in either sulforaphane or its biogenic precursor, glucoraphanin. Substantive subsequent evaluation of sulforaphane pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics has been undertaken using either pure compound or food matrices. Sulforaphane affects multiple targets in cells. One key molecular mechanism of action for sulforaphane entails activation of the Nrf2-Keap1 signaling pathway although other actions contribute to the broad spectrum of efficacy in different animal models. This review summarizes the current status of pre-clinical chemoprevention studies with sulforaphane and highlights the progress and challenges for the application of foods rich in sulforaphane and/or glucoraphanin in the arena of clinical chemoprevention.
26969570	Spinal tuberculosis with severe neurological symptoms as a complication of intravesical BCG therapy for carcinoma of the bladder.	INTRODUCTION: Non-invasive bladder cancer is effectively treated with intravesical BCG therapy. The administration of the BCG vaccine is to destroy the neoplastic lesion or prevent further recurrences. The activity of the vaccine involves boosting the immune system through the stimulation of the inflammation in the bladder. Adverse reactions after this immunotherapy are rare. The aim of the study was to present complications in the form of spinal tuberculosis and serious neurological symptoms that occurred during intravesical BCG immunotherapy for carcinoma of the bladder. The manuscript also describes a method for neurosurgical spinal cord decompression of the thoracic spine. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In the first patient, aged 66, after intravesical BCG therapy for bladder carcinoma, back pain and spastic paralysis of the lower limbs were observed. The MRI and CT revealed destruction of the intervertebral disc and vertebral endplates Th11-Th12. Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex bacilli were cultured from the material obtained by puncture aspiration. In the second patient, aged 35 years, during intravesical BCG immunotherapy for carcinoma of the bladder, girdle thoracic spine pain was observed. The MRI and CT of the spine showed visible lesions characteristic of tuberculosis. Immobilization in a plaster corset and implementation of antituberculous treatment resulted in quick relief of the pain and healing of the tuberculosis focus in the spine. CONCLUSION: The cases described in the work are the first documented reports in the Polish literature of spinal tuberculosis which occurred as a complication of intravesical administration of bacilli Calmette-Guerin. The diagnosis was based on the finding of BCG vaccine bacillus with molecular methods or PCR. Full antimycobacterial treatment was implemented.
26969121	A phase II study of capecitabine and oxaliplatin combination chemotherapy in patients with inoperable adenocarcinoma of the gall bladder or biliary tract.	BACKGROUND: Advanced biliary tract carcinomas are associated with a poor prognosis, and palliative chemotherapy has only modest benefit. This multi-centre phase II study was conducted to determine the efficacy of capecitabine in combination with oxaliplatin in patients with inoperable gall bladder or biliary tract cancer. METHODS: This was a Phase II, non-randomised, two-stage Simon design, multi-centre study. Ethics approval was sought and obtained by the North West MREC, and then locally by the West Glasgow Hospitals Research Ethics Committee. Eligible patients with inoperable locally advanced or metastatic adenocarcinoma of the gall bladder or biliary tract and with adequate performance status, haematologic, renal, and hepatic function were treated with capecitabine (1000 mg/m(2) po, twice daily, days 1-14) and oxaliplatin (130 mg/m(2) i.v., day 1) every 3 weeks for up to six cycles. The primary objective of the study was to determine the objective tumour response rates (complete and partial). The secondary objectives included assessment of toxicity, progression-free survival, and overall survival. RESULTS: Forty-three patients were recruited between July 2003 and December 2005. The regimen was well tolerated with no grade 3/4 neutropenia or thrombocytopenia. Grade 3/4 sensory neuropathy was observed in six patients. Two-thirds of patients received their chemotherapy without any dose delays. Overall response rate was 23.8% (95% CI 12.05-39.5%). Stable disease was observed in a further 13 patients (31%) and progressive disease observed in 12 (28.6%) of patients. The median progression-free survival was 4.6 months (95% CI 2.8-6.4 months; Fig. 1) and the median overall survival 7.9 months (95% CI 5.3-10.4 months; Fig. 2). Fig. 1 Progression-free survival Fig. 2 Overall survival CONCLUSION: Capecitabine combined with oxaliplatin has a lower disease control and shorter overall survival than the combination of cisplatin with gemcitabine which has subsequently become the standard of care in this disease. However, capecitabine in combination with oxaliplatin does have modest activity in this disease, and can be considered as an alternative treatment option for patients in whom cisplatin and/or gemcitabine are contra-indicated.
26968418	Experience with Sequential Intravesical Gemcitabine and Docetaxel as Salvage Therapy for Non-Muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer.	Patients with high-grade muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) receive intravesical therapy with bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) as the well-established standard-of-care. However, even with prompt induction of intravesical therapy, approximately 40 % of patients will recur within 2 years. For patients who fail BCG, options include radical cystectomy, repeat BCG therapy, or alternative intravesical salvage therapy. In this review, we will discuss the most recent published evidence on salvage intravesical therapy with an emphasis on a more in-depth report of our therapeutic strategy with sequential gemcitabine and docetaxel intravesical therapy for this treatment-refractory population. In addition, we will provide practical advice on our approach to this challenging patient population including the use of operative staging to aid early identification of treatment failures.
26968416	Complications Following Radical Nephroureterectomy.	Radical nephroureterectomy (RNU) is the gold standard treatment strategy for bulky, high-grade, or muscle-invasive upper tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC). Many patients with UTUC who require RNU are elderly, comorbid, and at risk for perioperative complications. Recognition of likelihood and extent of such complications guides preoperative counseling, decision-making process for major surgery, and perioperative care. A critical review of such data is essential, given the inevitable impact of complications on hospital duration, need for readmission, resource utilization, and costs associated with management.
26966728	Upregulated expression of BCL2, MCM7, and CCNE1 indicate cisplatin-resistance in the set of two human bladder cancer cell lines: T24 cisplatin sensitive and T24R2 cisplatin resistant bladder cancer cell lines.	PURPOSE: The mechanism of resistance to cisplatin during treatment of bladder cancer (BC) has been a subject of intense investigation in clinical research. This study aims to identify candidate genes associated with resistance to cisplatin, in order to understand the resistance mechanism of BC cells to the drug, by combining the use of microarray profiling, quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and Western blot analyses. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The cisplatin sensitive human BC cell line (T24) and the cisplatin resistant BC cell line, T24R2, were used for microarray analysis to determine the differential expression of genes that are significant in cisplatin resistance. Candidate upregulated genes belonging to three well-known cancer-related KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) pathways (p53 tumor suppressor, apoptosis, and cell cycle) were selected from the microarray data. These candidate genes, differentially expressed in T24 and T24R2, were then confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR and western blot. A fold change >/=2 with a p-value <0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: A total of 18 significantly upregulated genes were detected in the three selected cancer-related pathways in both microarray and RT-PCR analyses. These genes were PRKAR2A, PRKAR2B, CYCS, BCL2, BIRC3, DFFB, CASP6, CDK6, CCNE1, STEAP3, MCM7, ORC2, ORC5, ANAPC1, and ANAPC7, CDC7, CDC27, and SKP1. Western blot analyses also confirmed the upregulation of BCL2, MCM7, and CCNE1 at the protein level, indicating their crucial association with cisplatin resistance. CONCLUSIONS: The BCL2, MCM7, and CCNE1 genes might play distinctive roles in cisplatin resistance in BC.
26965996	Prostate-derived ets factor represses tumorigenesis and modulates epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in bladder carcinoma cells.	Prostate-derived Ets (E-twenty six) factor (PDEF), an epithelium-specific member of the Ets family of transcription factors, has been shown to play a role in suppressing the development of many epithelium-derived cancers such as prostate and breast cancer. It is not clear, however, whether PDEF is involved in the development or progression of bladder cancer. In a comparison between normal urothelium and bladder tumor tissue, we identified significant decreases of PDEF in the tumor tissue. Further, the immunohistochemistry assays indicated a significantly higher immunostaining of PDEF in low-grade bladder tumors. Additionally, the highly differentiated transitional-cell bladder carcinoma RT-4 cells expressed significantly more PDEF levels than the bladder carcinoma HT1376 and the T24 cells. Ectopic overexpression of PDEF attenuated proliferation, invasion, and tumorigenesis of bladder carcinoma cells in vitro and in vivo. PDEF enhanced the expression levels of mammary serine protease inhibitor (MASPIN), N-myc downstream regulated gene 1 (NDRG1), KAI1, and B-cell translocation gene 2 (BTG2). PDEF modulated epithelial-mesenchymal-transition (EMT) by upregulating E-cadherin expression and downregulating the expression of N-cadherin, SNAIL, SLUG, and vimentin, leading to lower migration and invasion abilities of bladder carcinoma cells. Filamentous actin (F-actin) polarization and remodeling were observed in PDEF-knockdown RT-4 cells. Our results suggest that PDEF gene expression is associated with the extent of bladder neoplasia and PDEF modulated the expressions of EMT-related genes. The induction of BTG2, NDRG1, MASPIN, and KAI1 gene expressions by PDEF may explain the inhibitory functions of PDEF on the proliferation, invasion, and tumorigenesis in bladder carcinoma cells.
26962794	Nonmuscle-invasive and Muscle-invasive Urinary Bladder Cancer: Image Quality and Clinical Value of Reduced Field-of-view Versus Conventional Single-shot Echo-planar Imaging DWI.	This study compared the imaging quality, diagnostic accuracy, and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values of reduced field-of-view (rFOV) diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and full field-of-view (fFOV) single-shot echo-planar imaging with regard to patients with nonmuscle-invasive or muscle-invasive bladder cancer.Thirty-nine patients with 60 bladder tumors underwent rFOV and fFOV DWI in this internal review board-approved study. Pathologic and histologic grades were determined for all tumors. Two observers rated DWI image quality using a 4-point scale. Two radiologists who were blinded to the pathology findings reviewed 3 image sets (T2-weighted alone, T2-weighted plus fFOV DWI, and T2-weighted plus rFOV DWI) and assigned T stages and confidence levels for tumors of stage T2 or higher. The image quality scores for the 2 DWI sequences were assessed using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Differences in the diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity for each image set were evaluated using the McNemar test. Differences in performance were analyzed by comparing the areas under the receiver-operating characteristic curves (ie, the Az values). A Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare the mean ADCs and the relationship between tumor stage and histologic grade.Image quality scores were significantly higher for rFOV (mean = 3.62) than for fFOV DWI (2.98; P < 0.001). The pooled diagnostic accuracies were 57%, 70%, and 78% for the T2-weighted alone images, the T2-weighted plus fFOV DWI images, and the T2-weighted plus rFOV DWI images, respectively. The overall accuracy, specificity, and Az for diagnosing T2 or higher stages were significantly improved by adding rFOV DWI (P < 0.05). The mean ADC values of the muscle-invasive and G3 grade bladder cancers were significantly lower than those of the nonmuscle-invasive tumors and G1 grade cancers, regardless of DWI sequence (P < 0.01).rFOV DWI is superior to fFOV DWI with respect to image quality and diagnostic accuracy. ADC values might be useful for distinguishing nonmuscle-invasive from muscle-invasive cancers, and G1 from G3 grade lesions.
26961716	Bladder dose-volume parameters are associated with urinary incontinence after postoperative intensity modulated radiation therapy for prostate cancer.	PURPOSE: Urinary incontinence is a potential side effect of prostatectomy and intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) for prostate cancer. There are limited data on dosimetric parameters that may predict for poor continence recovery in men who receive postoperative IMRT. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Eighty-seven men with nonmetastatic prostate cancer who underwent prostatectomy followed by adjuvant (13%) or salvage (87%) IMRT were identified. The Expanded Prostate Cancer Index composite questionnaire was prospectively collected at baseline, 6 weeks, and 6, 12, 18, 24, 36, and 48 months post-IMRT. Relevant critical structures were contoured and dose-volume metrics collected. The primary endpoint was urinary continence global score. Longitudinal analysis using a generalized estimating equation model was performed. RESULTS: There was no statistically significant change in Expanded Prostate Cancer Index composite urinary continence global scores over time as compared with baseline (all P > .05). In univariate analysis, bladder volume receiving 70 Gy (V70 Gy) and penile bulb V70 Gy were associated with urinary continence (odds ratio, 0.82; P < .05). In a multivariable model that included body mass index, distance between vesicourethral junction and genitourinary diaphragm, time from surgery, use of antihypertensive medications, age, diabetes, and bladder V70 Gy, only bladder V70 Gy (odds ratio, 0.82; P = .03) was associated with outcome. After 2 years, there was a significant difference in global score for those with V70 Gy < 42.27 versus >/=42.27 mL (all P < .05 at 2 and 3 years post-IMRT). CONCLUSION: There was no significant change in patient-reported urinary continence scores after postprostatectomy IMRT. Bladder V70 Gy was independently associated with a decrease in urinary continence scores. Further evaluation is necessary to optimize quality of life in these men.
26961168	A clinicopathologic study of paragangliomas of the urinary bladder: can the clinical behavior of the tumor be predicted?	Lymphovascular invasion (LVI) is an independent predictor of metastatic lymph node disease in penile carcinoma and is one factor used to guide clinical management. The presence of LVI with and without the use of the endothelial immunohistochemical (IHC) markers, ERG and CD31, was retrospectively assessed in 46 penectomy cases containing invasive penile carcinoma (43 squamous cell carcinoma and 3 non-squamous cell carcinoma). Concordance for the detection of LVI between the original report, upon pathology review, and with the use of IHC was determined and histologic pitfalls were identified. For penile squamous cell carcinoma, LVI was diagnosed in 27.9% of tumors in the original reports, 16.3% upon pathology review, and in 16.3% with use of ERG and CD31. Concordance of LVI identification in the original report compared to IHC was 74.4% while concordance of review compared to IHC was 95.3%. Using IHC data as the reference, false positive LVI diagnoses were more common in the original report than false negatives. Histologic mimickers of LVI including involvement of the penile corpora cavernosum or spongiosum vasculature, seromucinous colonization, and a nested pattern of tumor invasion were identified. We demonstrated that it was not uncommon for LVI in penile carcinoma to be overdiagnosed or underdiagnosed. The use of endothelial IHC markers, such as ERG or CD31, or additional pathology consultation is recommended for penectomy cases in which LVI is difficult to histologically discern.
26960648	Anaplastic lymphoma kinase positive inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor of the urachus: A rare neoplasm in an unusual location.	Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors (IMTs) are uncommon benign neoplasms in the abdomen, and urachal involvement is very rare. IMT of the urachus is usually mistaken clinically and radiologically for a malignant tumor. The tumor has spindle cell proliferation with a prominent inflammatory infiltrate and myxoid degeneration favoring other designations such as inflammatory pseudotumor and fibromyxoid pseudotumor. Complete excision is the treatment of choice. The case documented here was in a 50-year-old male, with an abdominal mass diagnosed on computed tomography scan as adenocarcinoma of urachus infiltrating the bladder. Histopathology showed a benign spindle cell tumor invading bladder muscle. Immunohistochemistry aided in diagnosing an anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-1 positive IMT. Approximately, 50% of the IMTs show ALK positivity, and though when present, it indicates neoplastic nature of the spindle cells, the pathogenesis of IMT is still elusive. The urachal IMTs need documentation in literature for their rarity and diagnostic dilemma posed by them.
26960643	Postradiation angiosarcoma of bladder with extensive osseous metaplasia.	Angiosarcomas are rare soft tissue neoplasms accounting for <2% of all sarcomas. Rare cases have been reported in other sites like breast, spleen, liver, bone and bladder. This is a case report of an angiosarcoma of the bladder in a 65 year old lady who came with complaints of haematuria. Ultrasonography and computerized tomography revealed a bladder tumour with calcification, which on cystoscopy also showed a calcified mass. The patient had a past history of carcinoma cervix for which she had undergone surgery and radiotherapy, 22 years ago. Biopsy of the bladder mass showed features of a high grade epithelioid sarcoma with extensive osseous metaplasia. On immune stains,the tumour was positive for CD31 and vimentin and negative for cytokeratin, desmin and CD34. Until now, only sixteen cases of angiosarcoma of the bladder have been reported in english literature, of which 6 occurred secondary to radiation. Our case is the first to occur after 22 years of radiotherapy and have extensive osseous metaplasia.
26960514	Dosimetric evaluation and clinical outcome in post-operative patients of carcinoma vulva treated with intensity-modulated radiotherapy.	BACKGROUND: To compare dosimetric parameters of intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) with 3D conformal radiotherapy (3DCRT) in post-operative patients of vulvar cancer and to assess clinical outcome and toxicity with IMRT. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 8 post-operative patients of vulvar cancer were treated with IMRT. All patients were also planned by 3DCRT for comparison with IMRT. The two plans were compared in terms of conformity index, homogeneity index, tumor control probability (TCP) and normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) for the planning target volume and organs at risk (OAR). RESULTS: IMRT resulted in significantly lesser doses to rectum, bladder, bowel and femoral head as compared with 3DCRT plans. Mean conformity and homogeneity indices were better and within range with IMRT. The TCP was comparable between the two treatment plans and NTCP for rectum, bladder, bowel and femoral head was significantly less with IMRT as compared with 3DCRT. Treatment was well-tolerated and none of the patients developed Grade 3 or higher toxicity. CONCLUSION: IMRT yielded superior plans with respect to target coverage, homogeneity and conformality while lowering dose to adjacent OAR as compared with 3DCRT. Thus, IMRT offers a reduction in NTCP while maintaining TCP.
26960504	The influence of the bowel and bladder preparation protocol for radiotherapy of prostate cancer using kilo-voltage cone beam CT: Our experience.	The purpose of this study is to determine the influence of bladder and bowel preparation protocols on the dose-volume histograms (DVHs) of these organs using the cone beam computed tomography (CBCT)-based intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) treatment planning for prostate cancer patients. The pelvic DVHs of 12 prostate cancer patients were studied using CBCT images obtained immediately before each treatment. Six patients had bladder and bowel preparation protocol whilst the other six patients were the control group. Contoured bladder and rectal volumes on CBCT images were compared with planning computed tomography. All patients were treated with IMRT with 7800 cGy in 39 fractions over 8 weeks. Compared with the patient with bladder preparation protocol, patients without bladder preparation instruction had higher bladder volume and dose variation. The maximum variation in bladder volume was as high as 98% in the control group. Without bowel preparation protocol, the rectal volumes were more variability. Owing to changes in rectal filling on the day of treatment, the maximum variation in rectal volume was as high as + 96%. With bowel preparation protocol, the maximum rectum volume variations were less than 25%. The changes in prostate target dose compared with planning dose were minimal as would be expected from positioning with daily image guidance and gold seed implanted.
26959612	Comparison of dosimetric parameters and acute toxicity after whole-pelvic vs prostate-only volumetric-modulated arc therapy with daily image guidance for prostate cancer.	OBJECTIVE: To compare dosimetric parameters and acute toxicity rates between whole-pelvic (WP) and prostate-only (PO) volumetric-modulated arc therapy (VMAT) in patients with localized prostate cancer. METHODS: A total of 224 consecutive patients treated with definitive VMAT to 78 Gy in 39 fractions were enrolled. Of these, 119 patients received initial WP VMAT at 46.8 Gy in 26 fractions using a simultaneous integrated boost technique, and 105 patients received PO VMAT. Image-guided radiotherapy was practised with daily cone beam CT. RESULTS: The mean rectal dose, the rectal volume receiving >/=30 Gy (V30Gy), rectal V50Gy, the mean bladder dose, bladder V30Gy and bladder V50Gy were significantly increased in the WP group (p < 0.05 each); however, the rectal V70Gy did not differ between groups (p = 0.101), and the bladder V70Gy was significantly lower in the WP group (p = 0.029). The WP group experienced a significantly increased frequency of acute grade 2 diarrhoea relative to the PO group (5.9% vs 0%; p = 0.015). No differences were seen between the WP and PO groups in terms of acute grade 2 proctitis (10.1% vs 6.7%; p = 0.360) and genitourinary (GU) toxicity (12.6% vs 10.5%; p = 0.620). CONCLUSION: Despite larger rectum and bladder volumes at low- and medium-dose levels, WP VMAT resulted in no significant increase in acute proctitis or GU toxicity when compared with PO VMAT. ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: This study demonstrates that whole-pelvic radiotherapy has comparable acute toxicity to those observed with prostate-only radiotherapy when VMAT with daily image guidance is used.
26957615	Use of Palliative Chemotherapy for Advanced Bladder Cancer: Patterns of Care in Routine Clinical Practice.	BACKGROUND: Palliative chemotherapy for advanced bladder cancer is recommended in clinical practice guidelines. Patterns of care in routine clinical practice have not been well described. This article describes use rates of chemotherapy and referral rates to medical oncology in the last year of life among patients who have died of bladder cancer. METHODS: A population-based cohort of patients with bladder cancer was identified from the Ontario Cancer Registry; the study population included patients who died of bladder cancer between 1995 and 2009. Electronic records of treatment and physician billing records were used to identify treatment patterns and referral to medical oncology. Log-binomial and modified Poisson regression were used to examine factors associated with chemotherapy use and medical oncology consultation. RESULTS: A total of 8,005 patients died of bladder cancer, 25% (n=1,964) of whom received chemotherapy in the last year of life. Use was independently associated with patient age, comorbidities, socioeconomic status, sex, time period, and treatment region. A total of 68% (n=5,426) of patients were seen by a medical oncologist. Referral to medical oncology was associated with age, comorbidities, year of death. Geographic variation was seen with chemotherapy use-from 18% to 30%-that persisted on adjusted analysis. CONCLUSIONS: The efficacy of palliative chemotherapy demonstrated in clinical trials and recommended in guidelines has not translated into widespread use in practice. Understanding the extent to which patient preferences and health system factors influence use is needed. Access to acceptable palliative systemic treatments remains an unmet need for most patients dying of bladder cancer.
26957266	Preoperative neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) may be predictive of pathologic stage in patients with bladder cancer larger than 3 cm.	OBJECTIVE: Bladder cancer (BCa) is the most common malignancy of the urinary tract. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the ability of preoperative neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) to predict pathologic stage of at the time of first transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TUR-BT) in patients with BCa larger than 3 cm. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Records of consecutive patients undergoing TUR-BT for BCa with a diameter >3 cm were reviewed. A total of 222 patients were eligible for analysis, and were divided into two groups: 162 patients in non-muscle-invasive BCa (NMIBC) group and 60 patients in muscle-invasive BCa (MIBC) group. Differences in preoperative blood parameters and NLR were evaluated between groups with an unequal variance t-test. RESULTS: In the NMIBC group, 59 patients had low-grade and 103 high-grade papillary urothelial carcinomas. 60 patients had T2 stage carcinoma. The mean age of the patients was 71.8 and 75.7 years, and mean NLR was 3.44 +/- 2.03 and 4.6 +/- 2.8 in NMIBC and MIBC groups, respectively. In terms of NLR, there was a statistically significant difference between the NMIBC and MIBC groups (p = 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed that NLR might act as a significant predictive biomarker on the staging of BCa. Also, NLR could be used as a cost-effective, simple, common usable biomarker in urology clinic practice.
26956962	[Combined hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma (cholangiolocellular type) with stem-cell features: a clinicopathologic analysis of 26 cases].	OBJECTIVE: To study the clinicopathologic features of combined hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma (cholangiolocellular type, CLC type) with stem cell features and its relationship to hepatic progenitor cells (HPCs). METHODS: Clinical and histologic features of 26 cases of combined hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma (CLC type) were reviewed. Histochemistry was performed to confirm the type of mucin and immunohistochemical study was carried out for hepatocytic markers (Hep Par-1 and AFP) and biliary/HPCs markers (CK7, CK9, EMA, EpCAM, NCAM, CKIT). RESULTS: The age of patients ranged from 51 to 82 years (mean 64 years). All 26 cases contained CLC and hepatocellular carcinoma components. CLC area was composed of mixtures of small monotonous glands with abundant fibrous stroma and lymphocytic infiltrate. Tumor cells were cuboidal, smaller in size than normal hepatocytes, with basophilic cytoplasm and round nuclei. All cases, especially at the tumor boundary, showed HCC-like trabecular areas characterized by mildly atypical tumor cells with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm and little stroma. Out of 26 cases, 21 showed definite glandular formation with mucin production, representing intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma areas. The three distinct areas showed transitional zones merging with each other. The surrounding liver tissue showed cirrhosis and chronic hepatitis with varying degrees of fibrosis and periportal ductular reaction. Immunohistochemistry showed that biliary/HPC markers (CK7, CK9, EMA, EpCAM, NCAM and CKIT) were strongly positive in CLC area in almost all cases, similar to the staining pattern of ductular reaction. In HCC-like areas, CK7 and CK19 were positive in all cases and the expression rates of EMA, EpCAM, NCAM, CKIT, AFP, Hep Par-1 were 80.8% (21/26), 88.5% (23/26), 84.6% (22/26), 88.5% (23/26), 46.2% (12/26) and 53.8% (14/26) respectively, similar to the staining pattern of intermediate hepatocytes. In ICC areas, CK7, CK9, EMA and EpCAM were positive in all cases without the expression of NCAM and CKIT. CONCLUSION: The clinicopathologic findings and immunohistochemical results in this study highly suggest a hepatic progenitor cell origin of combined hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma (CLC type).
26956768	Distinct Metabolic Signature of Human Bladder Cancer Cells Carrying an Impaired Fanconi Anemia Tumor-Suppressor Signaling Pathway.	Metabolic profiling has great potential to help the diagnosis and prognosis of cancer patients. Fanconi Anemia (FA) tumor-suppressor signaling has been instrumental in understanding human tumorigenesis. However, this instrumental understanding has never been demonstrated at the metabolic level. Here, we show that impaired FA signaling can lead cells to exhibit metabolic signatures of tumorigenesis. This is consistent with our original studies of the roles of FA signaling in suppressing non-FA tumorigenesis at functional and genetic levels. Using ultraperformance liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, we characterized metabolic alterations in bladder cancer cells carrying an intact or impaired FA pathway. The latter was obtained by ectopically expressing FAVL (FAVL-high), which we previously found to be capable of inactivating FA signaling. A total of 18 metabolites, end products of cell proliferation or apoptosis, were significantly different between FAVL-high and -low cells. Methionine, phenylalanine, and threonine, resulting from a tumorigenic process, were substantially increased in FAVL-high cells. With this study, we achieved genomic, functional, and metabolomic characterization of the roles of FA signaling in the development of human cancer. Furthermore, this study provides novel insights into how to translate FA basic research into strategies for producing effective biomarkers in human cancer diagnosis and prognosis.
26956094	Higher risk of urothelial carcinoma in the upper urinary tract than in the urinary bladder in hemodialysis patients.	Purpose This study used the a nationwide population-based retrospective cohort study with the claims data from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database to investigate the risk of urothelial carcinoma (UC) for hemodialysis (HD) patients. Methods The study population consisted of 2689 patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) newly diagnosed in 2000-2002 and underwent maintenance HD. Then, 21,449 reference patients were collected without HD randomly selected and matched with sex and age. The exclusion criteria were previous long-term analgesics and Chinese medication usage. Incidence density rates of UC in upper urinary tract (UTUC) and bladder (UBUC) were estimated for both cohorts by the end of 2012. Hazard ratios (HRs) of UC were measured in association with HD, covariates, and comorbidity. Results The incidence of UC was significantly higher in the HD cohort than in the reference cohort for both UT (21.8 vs. 0.65 per 10,000 person-years) and UB (17.7 vs. 3.55 per 10,000 person-years). The multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression analysis showed that the HRs of UTUC in HD cohort was 33.3 (95% CI = 15.9-69.5) and 5.14 for UBUC (95% CI = 3.24-8.15). The risk increased further for HD patients with comorbidity of hematuria, urinary tract infection (UTI) or hydronephrosis. Conclusion Patients with ESRD on HD are at a high risk of developing UC, especially UTUC in Taiwan. They will be paid more frequent to check urine analysis, urine cytology, and upper urinary tract survey.
26955879	Clarification of the molecular pathway of Taiwan local pomegranate fruit juice underlying the inhibition of urinary bladder urothelial carcinoma cell by proteomics strategy.	BACKGROUND: Pomegranate fruit has been shown to exhibit the inhibitory activity against prostate cancer and lung cancer in vitro and in vivo, which might be a resource for chemoprevention and chemotherapy of cancer. Our previous documented findings indicated that treatment of urinary bladder urothelial carcinoma cell with the ethanol extract isolated from the juice of pomegranate fruit grown in Taiwan could inhibit tumor cell. In this study we intended to uncover the molecular pathway underlying anti-cancer efficacy of Taiwan pomegranate fruit juice against urinary bladder urothelial carcinoma. METHODS: We exploited two-dimensional gel electrophoresis coupled with tandem mass spectrometry to find the de-regulated proteins. Western immunoblotting was used to confirm the results collected from proteomics study. RESULTS: Comparative proteomics indicated that 20 proteins were differentially expressed in ethanol extract-treated T24 cells with 19 up-regulated and 1 down-regulated proteins. These de-regulated proteins were involved in apoptosis, cytoskeleton regulation, cell proliferation, proteasome activity and aerobic glycolysis. Further studies on signaling pathway demonstrated that ethanol extract treatment might inhibit urinary bladder urothelial carcinoma cell proliferation through restriction of PTEN/AKT/mTORC1 pathway via profilin 1 up-regulation. It also might evoke cell apoptosis through Diablo over-expression. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study provide a global picture to further investigate the anticancer molecular mechanism of pomegranate fruit.
26954073	MicroRNAs as noninvasive biomarkers in bladder cancer detection: a diagnostic meta-analysis based on qRT-PCR data.	OBJECTIVE: As the diagnostic significance of microRNAs (miRNAs) in the detection of bladder cancer is controversial, we aimed to perform a meta-analysis to comprehensively assess the diagnostic value of miRNAs in blood and urine for detecting bladder cancer. METHODS: A systematic literature search of public databases was conducted to obtain qualified studies. Sensitivity was utilized to plot the summary receiver operator characteristic (SROC) curve against specificity and the area under the SROC curve (AUC) was generated to evaluate the pooled diagnostic efficiency. Subgroup analyses and meta-regression were applied to investigate the underlying sources of heterogeneity. The STATA 12.0 software was used to perform all statistic analyses. RESULTS: A total of 58 studies from 22 articles comprising 4,558 bladder cancer patients and 4,456 controls were included in our meta-analysis. MiRNAs in blood and urine manifested relatively good diagnostic efficiency in detecting bladder cancer, with a sensitivity of 0.74, a specificity of 0.78, and an AUC of 0.83. Multiple-miRNA assays were more accurate than single-miRNA ones in bladder cancer diagnosis. Blood-based miRNA assays displayed better diagnostic performance than urine-based ones. In addition, miRNAs showed reduced diagnostic value in bladder cancer among Caucasians compared with Asians. CONCLUSIONS: MiRNAs in blood and urine, especially the combination of multiple miRNAs, may serve as hopeful noninvasive biomarkers for early diagnosis of bladder cancer. Further extensive prospective research is needed to verify their clinical significance in bladder cancer diagnosis.
26952546	Atezolizumab in patients with locally advanced and metastatic urothelial carcinoma who have progressed following treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy: a single-arm, multicentre, phase 2 trial.	BACKGROUND: Patients with metastatic urothelial carcinoma have few treatment options after failure of platinum-based chemotherapy. In this trial, we assessed treatment with atezolizumab, an engineered humanised immunoglobulin G1 monoclonal antibody that binds selectively to programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1), in this patient population. METHODS: For this multicentre, single-arm, two-cohort, phase 2 trial, patients (aged >/=18 years) with inoperable locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma whose disease had progressed after previous platinum-based chemotherapy were enrolled from 70 major academic medical centres and community oncology practices in Europe and North America. Key inclusion criteria for enrolment were Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1, measurable disease defined by Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1), adequate haematological and end-organ function, and no autoimmune disease or active infections. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumour specimens with sufficient viable tumour content were needed from all patients before enrolment. Patients received treatment with intravenous atezolizumab (1200 mg, given every 3 weeks). PD-L1 expression on tumour-infiltrating immune cells (ICs) was assessed prospectively by immunohistochemistry. The co-primary endpoints were the independent review facility-assessed objective response rate according to RECIST v1.1 and the investigator-assessed objective response rate according to immune-modified RECIST, analysed by intention to treat. A hierarchical testing procedure was used to assess whether the objective response rate was significantly higher than the historical control rate of 10% at an alpha level of 0.05. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02108652. FINDINGS: Between May 13, 2014, and Nov 19, 2014, 486 patients were screened and 315 patients were enrolled into the study. Of these patients, 310 received atezolizumab treatment (five enrolled patients later did not meet eligibility criteria and were not dosed with study drug). The PD-L1 expression status on infiltrating immune cells (ICs) in the tumour microenvironment was defined by the percentage of PD-L1-positive immune cells: IC0 (<1%), IC1 (>/=1% but <5%), and IC2/3 (>/=5%). The primary analysis (data cutoff May 5, 2015) showed that compared with a historical control overall response rate of 10%, treatment with atezolizumab resulted in a significantly improved RECIST v1.1 objective response rate for each prespecified immune cell group (IC2/3: 27% [95% CI 19-37], p<0.0001; IC1/2/3: 18% [13-24], p=0.0004) and in all patients (15% [11-20], p=0.0058). With longer follow-up (data cutoff Sept 14, 2015), by independent review, objective response rates were 26% (95% CI 18-36) in the IC2/3 group, 18% (13-24) in the IC1/2/3 group, and 15% (11-19) overall in all 310 patients. With a median follow-up of 11.7 months (95% CI 11.4-12.2), ongoing responses were recorded in 38 (84%) of 45 responders. Exploratory analyses showed The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) subtypes and mutation load to be independently predictive for response to atezolizumab. Grade 3-4 treatment-related adverse events, of which fatigue was the most common (five patients [2%]), occurred in 50 (16%) of 310 treated patients. Grade 3-4 immune-mediated adverse events occurred in 15 (5%) of 310 treated patients, with pneumonitis, increased aspartate aminotransferase, increased alanine aminotransferase, rash, and dyspnoea being the most common. No treatment-related deaths occurred during the study. INTERPRETATION: Atezolizumab showed durable activity and good tolerability in this patient population. Increased levels of PD-L1 expression on immune cells were associated with increased response. This report is the first to show the association of TCGA subtypes with response to immune checkpoint inhibition and to show the importance of mutation load as a biomarker of response to this class of agents in advanced urothelial carcinoma.

26951512	Insight into the molecular basis of Schistosoma haematobium-induced bladder cancer through urine proteomics.	Infection due to Schistosoma haematobium is carcinogenic. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying urogenital schistosomiasis (UGS)-induced carcinogenesis have not been well defined. Conceptually, early molecular detection of this phenomenon, through non-invasive procedures, seems feasible and is desirable. Previous analysis of urine collected during UGS suggests that estrogen metabolites, including depurinating adducts, may be useful for this purpose. Here, a new direction was pursued: the identification of molecular pathways and potential biomarkers in S. haematobium-induced bladder cancer by analyzing the proteome profiling of urine samples from UGS patients. GeLC-MS/MS followed by protein-protein interaction analysis indicated oxidative stress and immune defense systems responsible for microbicide activity are the most representative clusters in UGS patients. Proteins involved in immunity, negative regulation of endopeptidase activity, and inflammation were more prevalent in UGS patients with bladder cancer, whereas proteins with roles in renal system process, sensory perception, and gas and oxygen transport were more abundant in subjects with urothelial carcinoma not associated with UGS. These findings highlighted a Th2-type immune response induced by S. haematobium, which seems to be further modulated by tumorigenesis, resulting in high-grade bladder cancer characterized by an inflammatory response and complement activation alternative pathway. These findings established a starting point for the development of multimarker strategies for the early detection of UGS-induced bladder cancer.
26951481	The effect of disgust-related side-effects on symptoms of depression and anxiety in people treated for cancer: a moderated mediation model.	As maladaptive disgust responses are linked to mental health problems, and cancer patients may experience heightened disgust as a result of treatments they receive, we explored the associations between disgust-related side-effects and symptoms of depression and anxiety in people treated for cancer. One hundred and thirty two (83 women, M age = 57.48 years) participants answered questions about their treatments, side-effects, disgust responding, and mental health. Experiencing bowel and/or bladder problems, sickness and/or nausea (referred to here as "core" disgust-related side-effects) was significantly related to greater symptoms of depression and borderline increased anxiety. Further, these links were explained by a moderated mediation model, whereby the effects of core disgust side-effects on depression and anxiety were mediated by (physical and behavioural) self-directed disgust, and disgust propensity moderated the effect of core disgust side-effects on self-disgust. These findings stress the importance of emotional responses, like disgust, in psychological adaptation to the side-effects of cancer treatments.
26951070	Invasive urothelial carcinoma, lymphoma-like/plasmacytoid variant, successfully treated by radical cystectomy with adjuvant chemotherapy: a case report.	BACKGROUND: Invasive urothelial carcinoma, lymphoma-like/plasmacytoid variant, is a rare histological type of bladder cancer similar to plasma cells and is an aggressive variant of urothelial carcinoma associated with a poor prognosis. CASE PRESENTATION: A 41-year-old Asian man was referred to our hospital due to macroscopic hematuria. Cystoscopy detected a non-papillary tumor, and a transurethral resection of the bladder tumor revealed pT1N0M0 bladder cancer. A pathological examination showed high-grade invasive urothelial carcinoma and a component of signet ring cell carcinoma. A follow-up of the transurethral resection with radical cystectomy was carried out, and a pathological examination showed infiltrating urothelial carcinoma, with partial features of the plasmacytoid variant. We added chemotherapy treatment with gemcitabine and cisplatin for two cycles. Our patient has been free from recurrence for 2 years. CONCLUSIONS: We herein report the case of a patient with a plasmacytoid variant of urothelial carcinoma controlled with radial cystectomy and subsequent chemotherapy.
26951061	Targeting of Peptide Cytotoxins to LHRH Receptors For Treatment of Cancer.	Receptors for LHRH (luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone) are expressed in about 80% of human endometrial, ovarian and prostate cancers and are also found in more than 50% of breast cancers including triple negative breast cancers. In the human body, LHRH receptors are found at significant levels in the pituitary and reproductive organs. Other benign tissues or hematopoietic stem cells express only low levels of receptors for LHRH or no receptors. Thus LHRH receptors are promising targets for a receptor- mediated chemotherapy with cytotoxic hybrid molecules. Cytotoxic analogs of LHRH consist of a LHRH agonist, which is used as a carrier peptide and DOX or its derivatives. Cytotoxic analogs of LHRH, AEZS-108 (formerly known as AN-152) and AN-207, exhibit anti-cancer activity in various in vitro and in vivo models of LHRH-receptor positive cancers. In AEZS-108 (zoptarelin DOX) DOX is covalently linked to the LHRH agonist [D-Lys(6)]LHRH. Results of phase I and II clinical studies in patients with breast, endometrial and ovarian cancers demonstrated good anticancer activity with moderate toxic side effects and without any sign of cardiotoxicity so far. AEZS-108 is also being evaluated in phase I/II studies in castration resistant prostate cancer and metastatic bladder cancer. Because of the very promising phase II results in endometrial cancer, a multinational, multicenter phase III study of this malignancy has been initiated and is currently recruiting patients.
26949706	Circulating Long Noncoding RNA UCA1 as a Novel Biomarker of Acute Myocardial Infarction.	Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is the most serious cardiovascular disease with high morbidity and mortality. Recent studies have showed that long noncoding RNAs (lnc RNA) play important roles in pathophysiology of cardiovascular diseases, but the investigations are still in their infancy. An lnc RNA named urothelial carcinoma-associated 1 (UCA1) is found in tumors such as bladder cancers and lung cancer. And the UCA1 could be as a predictive biomarker for bladder cancer in urine samples or lung cancer in plasma, respectively. In normal states, UCA1 is specifically expressed in heart of adult, indicating that UCA1 might be as a biomarker for heart diseases such as AMI. To test the speculation, we detect the level of UCA1 in plasma of AMI patients and health control using quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). In addition, we also test the level of miR-1 as it is reported to regulate the expression of UCA1. The results show that the level of plasma UCA1 is decreased at the early state of AMI patients and increased at day 3 after AMI. In addition, the UCA1 alteration is inversely associated with the expression of miR-1. These findings indicate that the circulating UCA1 could be used as a promising novel biomarker for the diagnosis and/or prognosis of AMI.
26948031	Early toxicity of hypofractionated radiotherapy for prostate cancer.	BACKGROUND: Hypofractionated accelerated radiotherapy (HART) is now a feasible option for prostate cancer treatment apropos toxicity, biochemical control and shortening of treatment. The aim of this study was to investigate hypofractionated schedules in the treatment of patients with localized prostate cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 2011-2014, 158 patients were treated using the RapidArc technique with IGRT. The target volume for low risk patients was the prostate alone with a prescribed dose of 20x3.0 Gy (EQD2=77 Gy). Targets volumes for intermediate and high risk patients were prostate and two thirds of the seminal vesicles with a prescribed dose 21-22x3.0/2.1 Gy (EQD2=81/45.4-84.9/47.5). Based on radiobiological modelling of early toxicity, we used four fractions per week in the low risk group and four fractions in odd weeks and three fractions in even weeks in intermediate and high risk groups. The RTOG/EORTC toxicity scale was used. RESULTS: Early genitourinary (GU) toxicity was observed for grades 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4 in 73 (46%), 60 (38%), 22 (14%), 0 and 3 (2%), respectively; early gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity was recorded for grades 0, 1, 2 and 3 in 119 (75%), 37 (23%), and 2 (1%) patients, respectively. CONCLUSION: A combination of moderate hypofractionation, number of fractions per week adapted to target volume and precise dose delivery technique with image guidance appears safe with low early toxicity. Longer follow up is needed to assess late toxicity and tumor control probability.
26947956	Risk of Lung Cancer in Workers Exposed to Benzidine and/or Beta-Naphthylamine: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.	Benzidine (BZ) and beta-naphthylamine (BNA) have been classified as definite human carcinogens for bladder cancer by the International Agency for Research on Cancer. However, the epidemiological evidence for an association between exposure to BZ and/or BNA and lung cancer has been inconclusive. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine the risk for lung cancer among workers exposed to BZ/BNA. A systematic literature search was conducted to identify studies that had reported occupational BZ/BNA exposure and the outcome of interest (lung cancer death and/or incidence). Meta-analyses were performed using random effects models to combine standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) or standardized incidence ratios (SIRs). We identified 23 retrospective cohort studies including 1745 cases of lung cancer; only one study reported smoking-adjusted lung cancer risk. A significantly increased lung cancer risk (pooled SMR/SIR 1.28; 95% CI, 1.14-1.43) was observed by combining all studies, with significant heterogeneity among studies (I(2) = 64.1%, P < 0.001). Effect estimates were higher for studies with direct BZ/BNA exposure (ie, dyestuff and manufacturing industries) (pooled SMR/SIR 1.58; 95% CI, 1.31-1.89), and studies that identified BZ/BNA-associated bladder cancer with SMR/SIR >/=4.7 (pooled SMR/SIR 1.68; 95% CI, 1.35-2.09). Effect estimates were similar for studies with and without concomitant occupational exposure to chromium, asbestos, arsenic, or bis(chloromethyl) ether. The cumulative meta-analysis showed that the evidence of association between occupational BZ/BNA exposure and lung cancer has been stable since 1995. Although the results of this meta-analysis have the potential for confounding by smoking and heterogeneity, our findings suggest that a finding of lung cancer following occupational BZ/BNA exposure should be considered to be a potential occupational disease.
26947944	Effect of statin and aspirin use on toxicity and pathological complete response rate of neo-adjuvant chemoradiation for rectal cancer.	AIM: To retrospectively evaluate the potential impact of statin and aspirin use on acute toxicity and pathological complete response (pCR) rate in rectal cancer patients receiving neo-adjuvant long-course radiation therapy (LCRT) with concurrent chemotherapy. METHODS: A retrospective review was performed of all patients undergoing neo-adjuvant LCRT for rectal adenocarcinoma at the Regional Cancer Treatment Service between 1 September 2007 and 1 June 2011. Data obtained include demographic details; date and radiological TNM stage at diagnosis; medication taken at time of RT; toxicity during LCRT; and surgical histology to determine if a pCR was obtained following LCRT. RESULTS: Neo-adjuvant LCRT was administered to 142 patients for rectal cancer during this period; concurrent chemotherapy was omitted in 13 due to significant comorbidities. TNM stage was 2 or 3 radiologically at diagnosis in 127 (89.4%) of patients. At the time of LCRT, 23% were taking a statin and 25% were taking aspirin. Of 135 assessable patients, 34 (13%) achieved a pCR at surgery. On logistic regression, pCR was not significantly associated with the use of chemotherapy, statins, aspirin, other NSAIDs, T-stage or N-stage. There was no significant correlation between statin or aspirin use with bladder or rectal toxicity. Actuarial time to maximum rectal toxicity was not different in statin users or nonusers. CONCLUSION: In contrast to other larger retrospective series, this study did not find improvements in toxicity or pCR rate through statin or aspirin use in rectal cancer patients undergoing LCRT. Their potential benefits in this setting would be best studied prospectively in a large randomized trial.
26947436	Primary Urinary Bladder Angiosarcoma with Osteoclast-Like Multinucleated Giant Cells: A Case Report and Literature Review.	BACKGROUND: Angiosarcoma is a fatal and aggressive mesenchymal tumor. It occurs in skin, breast, and parenchymal organs. It rarely arises primarily in the urinary bladder. Only 13 cases of primary urinary bladder angiosarcoma have been reported in the English literature. CASE REPORT: The patient was a 68-year-old man who presented to the Emergency Department with inability to void. Computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis showed a urinary bladder mass. Surgical excision of the mass was performed. Pathological examination results were consistent with angiosarcoma. In addition to the unusual location of this tumor, the pathology was different from the previously reported cases in that this case was rich with osteoclast-like multinucleated giant cells. CONCLUSIONS: The pathological diagnosis of primary urinary bladder angiosarcoma is challenging. Histological patterns and immunophenotypes are variable. Here, we review all reported cases of primary urinary bladder angiosarcoma, highlight the clinical and morphological features of this malignant neoplasm, and report a unique case of primary urinary bladder angiosarcoma with osteoclast-like multinucleated giant cells.
26946714	[Novelties in Urology in 2015].	This paper brings to the general practitioner some clarifications with regard to open questions - such as prostate cancer screening - and points at some disease management in different fields - such as urinary stones, overactive bladder and immunotherapy in bladder cancer.
26945656	Impact of Body Habitus on Operative Difficulties during Extraperitoneal Laparoscopic Radical Prostatectomy.	PURPOSE: The aim of the present study was to investigate whether patients' body habitus affects the operative difficulties associated with extraperitoneal laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (LRP). Therefore, the associations between body habitus and perioperative outcomes of surgery, including bleeding, operative time, and resection margins, were evaluated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between August 2010 and July 2012, 40 consecutive patients with preoperative magnetic resonance imaging and abdominal X-ray examinations underwent extraperitoneal LRP for localized prostate cancer at our institution. The associations between anthropometric measurements and demographics of patients, operation duration, estimated blood loss (EBL), and resection margins were analyzed retrospectively. Multivariate analyses were performed, and P < .05 was considered significant. RESULTS: On multiple regression analysis, the view of the prostatic apex (VPA) was significantly associated with EBL (P = .02), and body mass index (BMI) was significantly associated with operative time (P = .02). On multiple logistic regression analysis, protrusion of the prostate into the bladder was significantly associated with positive resection margins (P = .04). CONCLUSION: The findings of the present study suggest that poor VPA, protrusion of the prostate into the bladder, and high BMI were related to operative difficulties in extraperitoneal LRP. If operative difficulty is predicted preoperatively, it would be better to prepare blood for transfusion and/or special instruments (e.g. flexible scope), or switch to other therapeutic procedures.
26945358	Impact of Albumin on Coagulation Competence and Hemorrhage During Major Surgery: A Randomized Controlled Trial.	For patients exposed to a massive blood loss during surgery, maintained coagulation competence is important. It is less obvious whether coagulation competence influences bleeding during elective surgery where patients are exposed to infusion of a crystalloid or a colloid. This randomized controlled trial evaluates whether administration of 5% human albumin (HA) or lactated Ringer solution (LR) affects coagulation competence and in turn blood loss during cystectomy due to bladder cancer. Forty patients undergoing radical cystectomy were included to receive either 5% HA (n = 20) or LR (n = 20). Nineteen patients were analyzed in the HA group and 20 patients in the lactated Ringer group. Blinded determination of the blood loss was similar in the 2 groups of patients: 1658 (800-3300) mL with the use of HA and 1472 (700-4330) mL in the lactated Ringer group (P = 0.45). Yet, by thrombelastography (TEG) evaluated coagulation competence, albumin affected clot growth (TEG-angle 69 +/- 5 vs 74 degrees +/- 3 degrees , P < 0.01) and strength (TEG-MA: 59 +/- 6 vs 67 +/- 6 mm, P < 0.001) more than LR. Furthermore, by multivariate linear regression analyses reduced TEG-MA was independently associated with the blood loss (P = 0.042) while administration of albumin was related to the changes in TEG-MA (P = 0.029), aPPT (P < 0.022), and INR (P < 0.033). This randomized controlled trial demonstrates that administration of HA does not affect the blood loss as compared to infusion of LR. Also the use of HA did not affect the need for blood transfusion, the incidence of postoperative complications, or the hospital in-stay. Yet, albumin decreases coagulation competence during major surgery and the blood loss is related to TEG-MA rather than to plasma coagulation variables.
26944862	Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio is a prognostic marker in bladder cancer patients after radical cystectomy.	BACKGROUND: There is no reliable biomarker for predicting the prognosis of patients who undergo radical cystectomy for bladder cancer. Recent studies have shown that the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) could function as a useful prognostic factor in several types of malignancies. This study aimed to assess the usefulness of NLR in bladder cancer. METHODS: A total of 74 patients who underwent radical cystectomy in our institutions from 1999 to 2014 were analyzed. The NLR was calculated using the patients' neutrophil and lymphocyte counts before radical cystectomy. An immunohistochemical analysis was also performed to detect tumor infiltrating neutrophils (CD66b) and lymphocytes (CD8) in bladder cancer specimens. RESULTS: A univariate analysis showed that the patients with a high NLR (>/=2.38; HR = 4.84; p = 0.007), high C-reactive protein level (>0.08; HR = 10.06; p = 0.030), or pathological lymph node metastasis (HR = 4.73; p = 0.030) had a significantly higher risk of cancer-specific mortality. Kaplan-Meier and log-rank tests further revealed that NLR was strongly correlated with overall survival (p = 0.018), but not progression-free survival (p = 0.137). In a multivariate analysis, all of these were found to be independent risk factors (HR = 4.62, 10.8, and 12.35, respectively). The number of CD8-positive lymphocytes was significantly increased in high-grade (p = 0.001) and muscle-invasive (p = 0.012) tumors, in comparison to low-grade and non-muscle-invasive tumors, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The NLR predicted the prognosis of patients who underwent radical cystectomy and might therefore function as a reliable biomarker in cases of invasive bladder cancer.
26944424	Modeling indoor TV/screen viewing and adult physical and mental health: Health Survey for England, 2012.	The aim of the present study was to model indoor TV/screen viewing and a series of adult health conditions and cognitive performance in a country-wide, population-based setting in recent years. Data was retrieved from Health Survey for England, 2012. Information on demographics, lifestyle factors, self-reported health conditions, and TV and/or screen watching hours in adults was collected by household interviews. Chi-square test and survey-weighted logistic and multi-nominal modeling were performed. Of 8114 English adults aged 18-98, 4138 people (51.1 %) watched TV and/or screen daily for 2 h or more on average. Two thousand five-hundred people (30.9 %) watched for 3 h or more. TV and/or screening watching for 2+ hours was associated with endocrine or metabolic disorders, diabetes, mental disorders (including poor scores in General Health Questionnaire and Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale), nervous system disorders, eye complaints, circulatory system disorders, respiratory system disorders, musculoskeletal system disorders, and self-rated health. TV and/or screen watching for 3+ hours was associated with digestive disorders and clotting disorder. TV and/or screen watching for 5+ hours was associated with cancer. TV and/or screen watching for 6+, 8+, or 11+ hours was associated with bladder disease, genito-urinary system disorders or bowel disease, respectively. There were no risk associations (within 20 h) found with ear complaints, infectious disease, and blood system disorders. Future educational and public health programs minimizing TV and/or screen viewing in order to protect from physical inactivity and X-radiation might be needed while research on the combined effect of physical inactivity and X-radiation should be explored.
26943666	[Multimodal therapy of locally advanced prostate cancer].	Locally advanced prostate cancer (LAPCA) comprises about 5-10 % of all newly diagnosed prostate cancers and is associated with the highest prostate cancer specific mortality (approximately 8-20 %). LAPCA is defined by the presence of extraprostatic extension, seminal vesicle invasion, and bladder neck infiltration of pelvic lymph node metastases. It is evident that prognosis can only be improved by interdisciplinary multimodality treatment strategies. Adequate local staging by multiparametric MRI is one of the cornerstones for an individualized, risk-adapted treatment approach. This might consist of extended radical prostatectomy with an extended pelvic lymphadenectomy or intensity-modulated radiation therapy with androgen deprivation as the primary local therapeutic approach. Both treatment strategies may be combined with neoadjuvant or adjuvant radiation therapy or salvage surgery. Combination with neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy and new androgen receptor pathway inhibitors might also be possible. This article summarizes the current treatment strategies for LAPCA.
26943643	The importance of clinical stage among patients with a complete pathologic response at radical cystectomy after neoadjuvant chemotherapy.	PURPOSE: Patients without evidence of disease at radical cystectomy (RC) following neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) have the greatest potential for survival in muscle-invasive bladder cancer. Historically, 15 % of such patients will experience disease recurrence and cancer-specific mortality. We sought to evaluate the effect of pre-treatment clinical factors on the risk of recurrence in patients who were ypT0N0 at RC. METHODS: We performed a multi-institutional review of patients treated with NAC + RC for muscle-invasive bladder cancer (>/=cT2) without pathologic evidence of disease at surgery (ypT0N0). The association of pre-treatment clinicopathologic features with recurrence was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards. RESULTS: A total of 78 patients were identified with ypT0 disease at RC after NAC. Median postoperative follow-up was 32.4 months (IQR 16.8, 60.0), during which time 17 patients recurred at a median of 6.4 months after RC. Estimated 3-year recurrence-free survival (RFS) of this cohort was 74.8 %. In univariate analysis, cT4 disease (HR 3.12; p = 0.04) and time to RC (HR 1.17 for each month increase; p < 0.01) were associated with inferior RFS. CONCLUSION: Patients without evidence of disease at the time of RC are still at risk of recurrence and death from bladder cancer. Higher clinical stage and increased time to RC were associated with an increased risk of recurrence and subsequent death. These data highlight the importance of timely RC and the continued risk of recurrence in higher clinically staged patients-underscoring the need for close monitoring and patient counseling.
26942590	Bladder Sparing Approaches for Muscle-Invasive Bladder Cancers.	OPINION STATEMENT: Organ preservation has been increasingly utilised in the management of muscle-invasive bladder cancer. Multiple bladder preservation options exist, although the approach of maximal TURBT performed along with chemoradiation is the most favoured. Phase III trials have shown superiority of chemoradiotherapy compared to radiotherapy alone. Concurrent chemoradiotherapy gives local control outcomes comparable to those of radical surgery, but seemingly more superior when considering quality of life. Bladder-preserving techniques represent an alternative for patients who are unfit for cystectomy or decline major surgical intervention; however, these patients will need lifelong rigorous surveillance. It is important to emphasise to the patients opting for organ preservation the need for lifelong bladder surveillance as risk of recurrence remains even years after radical chemoradiotherapy treatment. No randomised control trials have yet directly compared radical cystectomy with bladder-preserving chemoradiation, leaving the age-old question of superiority of one modality over another unanswered. Radical cystectomy and chemoradiation, however, must be seen as complimentary treatments rather than competing treatments. Meticulous patient selection is vital in treatment modality selection with the success of recent trials within the field of bladder preservation only being possible through this application of meticulous selection criteria compared to previous decades. A multidisciplinary approach with radiation oncologists, medical oncologists, and urologists is needed to closely monitor patients who undergo bladder preservation in order to optimise outcomes.
26941372	Cigarette smoking and bladder cancer risk: an evaluation based on a systematic review of epidemiologic evidence in the Japanese population.	OBJECTIVE: Although several epidemiological studies have demonstrated that cigarette smoking is an important risk factor for bladder cancer, no systematic review in the Japanese population has yet been performed. Accurate evaluation of bladder cancer risk in relation to smoking for Japanese populations can provide necessary information for Japanese policy-makers and doctors to enlighten the importance of smoking cessation. We reviewed epidemiologic data to estimate the strength of the association between cigarette smoking and bladder cancer in the Japanese population. METHODS: We identified previous cohort and case-control studies, extracting data from databases in the MEDLINE (PubMed) and Ichushi. The magnitude of association and strength of evidence were evaluated in each study, and a meta-analysis was conducted to obtain summary estimates for the overall magnitude of association. RESULTS: Three cohort and eight case-control studies were identified. Except for one case-control study, all studies showed a strong positive association between cigarette smoking and bladder cancer. The summary relative risk for ever smokers relative to never smokers was 2.14 (95% confidence interval 1.87-2.44) in a fixed-effect model. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that cigarette smoking is a convincing risk factor for bladder cancer among Japanese.
26940971	Stem cells, biomarkers and genetic profiling: approaching future challenges in Urology.	Urological research is facing future challenges, the most difficult one is the fast and meaningful transfer of the massive amount of data from research basic to clinical practice. Between the most important issues that research should focus in the next years are targeting of tumor stem cells, clinical application of biomarkers, and wide application of genetic profiling of urological neoplasms. Several clinical implications are expected, from diagnosis to selection of candidates for different treatment modalities, to modulation of sequential treatment plans, to prognosis. A number of clinical trials based on research data from the hottest issues are in the pipeline. In this review, we will focus on new insights from recent work worlwide in urological research, with particular attention to high-risk nonmuscle-invasive and muscle-invasive bladder cancer, prostate cancer, and kidney cancer. Cancer care is moving towards a personalized approach in patient management. The most important issues in urological research point strongly in this direction and show an enormous potential for the rapid landing of Urology in the era of personalized medicine.
26940959	Patterns of failure after use of (18)F-FDG PET/CT in integration of extended-field chemo-IMRT and 3D-brachytherapy plannings for advanced cervical cancers with extensive lymph node metastases.	BACKGROUND: The study is to evaluate the patterns of failure, toxicities and long-term outcomes of aggressive treatment using (18)F-FDG PET/CT-guided chemoradiation plannings for advanced cervical cancer with extensive nodal extent that has been regarded as a systemic disease. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 72 consecutive patients with (18)F-FDG PET/CT-detected widespread pelvic, para-aortic and/or supraclavicular lymph nodes treated with curative-intent PET-guided cisplatin-based extended-field dose-escalating intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) and adaptive high-dose-rate intracavitary 3D-brachytherapy between 2002 and 2010. The failure sites were specifically localized by comparing recurrences on fusion of post-therapy recurrent (18)F-FDG PET/CT scans to the initial PET-guided radiation plannings for IMRT and brachytherapy. RESULTS: The median follow-up time for the 72 patients was 66 months (range, 3-142 months). The 5-year disease-free survival rate calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method for the patients with extensive N1 disease with the uppermost PET-positive pelvic-only nodes (26 patients), and the patients with M1 disease with the uppermost PET-positive para-aortic (31 patients) or supraclavicular (15 patients) nodes was 78.5 %, and 41.8-50 %, respectively (N1 vs. M1, p = 0.0465). Eight (11.1 %), 18 (25.0 %), and 3 (4.2 %) of the patients developed in-field recurrence, out-of-field and/or distant metastasis, and combined failure, respectively. The 6 (8.3 %) local failures around the uterine cervix were all at the junction between IMRT and brachytherapy in the parametrium. The rate of late grade 3/4 bladder and bowel toxicities was 4.2 and 9.7 %, respectively. When compared to conventional pelvic chemoradiation/2D-brachytherapy during 1990-2001, the adoption of (18)F-FDG PET-guided extended-field dose-escalating chemoradiation plannings in IMRT and 3D-brachytherapy after 2002 appeared to provide higher disease-free and overall survival rates with acceptable toxicities in advanced cervical cancer patients. CONCLUSIONS: For AJCC stage M1 cervical cancer with supraclavicular lymph node metastases, curability can be achieved in the era of PET and chemo-IMRT. However, the main pattern of failure is still out-of-field and/or distant metastasis. In addition to improving systemic treatment, how to optimize and integrate the junctional doses between IMRT and 3D-brachytherapy in PET-guided plannings to further decrease local recurrence warrants investigation.
26940077	Photodynamic killing of cancer cells by a Platinum(II) complex with cyclometallating ligand.	Photodynamic therapy that uses photosensitizers which only become toxic upon light-irradiation provides a strong alternative to conventional cancer treatment due to its ability to selectively target tumour material without affecting healthy tissue. Transition metal complexes are highly promising PDT agents due to intense visible light absorption, yet the majority are toxic even without light. This study introduces a small, photostable, charge-neutral platinum-based compound, Pt(II) 2,6-dipyrido-4-methyl-benzenechloride, complex 1, as a photosensitizer, which works under visible light. Activation of the new photosensitizer at low concentrations (0.1-1 muM) by comparatively low dose of 405 nm light (3.6 J cm(-2)) causes significant cell death of cervical, colorectal and bladder cancer cell lines, and, importantly, a cisplatin resistant cell line EJ-R. The photo-index of the complex is 8. We demonstrate that complex 1 induces irreversible DNA single strand breaks following irradiation, and that oxygen is essential for the photoinduced action. Neither light, nor compound alone led to cell death. The key advantages of the new drug include a remarkably fast accumulation time (diffusion-controlled, minutes), and photostability. This study demonstrates a highly promising new agent for photodynamic therapy, and attracts attention to photostable metal complexes as viable alternatives to conventional chemotherapeutics, such as cisplatin.
26939911	An interesting case of profound hypoxemia.	A 58 year old male with a history of cirrhosis (hepatitis B and C), a long smoking history, and a recently diagnosed high-grade transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder wall presented three days after a biopsy procedure with abdominal pain, nausea, and new hypoxemia on room air. The chest radiograph was clear and the CT angiogram showed only a borderline large pulmonary artery, two small nodules (3mm and 4mm) in the right middle lobe of the lung, and emphysematous changes throughout the lung parenchyma. There was no evidence of pulmonary embolism. A wide range of diagnostic possibilities were entertained, including pneumonia (community or aspiration related to the procedure), COPD exacerbation, pulmonary emboli, porto-pulmonary syndrome, pulmonary hypertension with right to left shunt, tumor emboli, allergic reaction to a medication or chemotherapeutic agent, or lymphangitic/hematogenous spread of tumor to the lungs. The diagnosis was only established on a post mortem examination. The progressive hypoxia was due to diffuse spread of tumor within alveolar capillaries.
26939677	The safety and efficacy of bladder cryoablation in a beagle model by using a novel balloon cryoprobe.	The poor quality of initial transurethral resection (TUR) would leave residual tumor and compromise the prognosis. The common therapeutic option is to perform re-TUR, which adds burden to patients. We assumed that cryoablation could be applied as adjuvant therapy combined with TUR, thus lead to maxium tumor control. In our study, we investigated the safety and effects of focal bladder wall cryoablation in beagle model using a novel cryoablation balloon probe. Temperature was recorded throughout the freeze process in different parts of the bladder. The bladder was harvested immediately, 2 weeks or 3 months after surgery for histological evaluation. The results demonstrated cryoablation using our newly designed probe is safe and effective. Two-minute cryoablation could induce necrosis within 2-cm range in diameter to superficial muscle layer. The findings provided us reference before cryoablation could be applied in clinical practice.
26937750	Surgical Treatment of Metastatic Ovarian Tumors From Extragenital Primary Sites.	OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the outcomes and prognostic factors of metastasectomy in patients with metastatic ovarian tumors from extragenital primary sites. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All patients with pathologically confirmed metastatic ovarian tumors between January 1997 and June 2015 were included in this study. A total of 131 patients were identified. The data were obtained from the patients' medical records. Clinicopathological features were evaluated by both univariate and multivariate analyses. RESULTS: The primary sites were colorectal region (53.4%), stomach (26%), and breast (13%). Preoperative serum CA 125 and CA 19-9 levels were elevated in 29.4% and 39.8% of the patients, respectively. Cytoreductive surgery was performed in 41.2% of the patients. Seventy-three (55.7%) patients had no residual disease after surgery. Sixty-six (49.6%) patients had combined metastases at the time of the surgery to sites including the liver, pancreas, lung, bone, lymph nodes, bladder, or the intestine. With a median follow-up of 33 months, the median survival time was 22 months. The estimated 5-year survival probability is 0.26. On univariate analysis, primary cancer site, combined metastasis outside the ovaries, residual disease, preoperative serum CA 125 and CA 19-9 levels, and histologic type were significant parameters for overall survival. Furthermore, residual disease, preoperative serum CA 19-9 level, and primary cancer site were found to be independent prognostic factors on multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS: The most common primary sites for ovarian metastasis are gastrointestinal tract. Metastasectomy may have beneficial effects on survival, especially if the residual disease is less than 5 mm. Prospective studies warranted to evaluate the value of metastasectomy in patients with ovarian metastasis.
26936706	Sample size requirements for knowledge-based treatment planning.	PURPOSE: To determine how training set size affects the accuracy of knowledge-based treatment planning (KBP) models. METHODS: The authors selected four models from three classes of KBP approaches, corresponding to three distinct quantities that KBP models may predict: dose-volume histogram (DVH) points, DVH curves, and objective function weights. DVH point prediction is done using the best plan from a database of similar clinical plans; DVH curve prediction employs principal component analysis and multiple linear regression; and objective function weights uses either logistic regression or K-nearest neighbors. The authors trained each KBP model using training sets of sizes n = 10, 20, 30, 50, 75, 100, 150, and 200. The authors set aside 100 randomly selected patients from their cohort of 315 prostate cancer patients from Princess Margaret Cancer Center to serve as a validation set for all experiments. For each value of n, the authors randomly selected 100 different training sets with replacement from the remaining 215 patients. Each of the 100 training sets was used to train a model for each value of n and for each KBT approach. To evaluate the models, the authors predicted the KBP endpoints for each of the 100 patients in the validation set. To estimate the minimum required sample size, the authors used statistical testing to determine if the median error for each sample size from 10 to 150 is equal to the median error for the maximum sample size of 200. RESULTS: The minimum required sample size was different for each model. The DVH point prediction method predicts two dose metrics for the bladder and two for the rectum. The authors found that more than 200 samples were required to achieve consistent model predictions for all four metrics. For DVH curve prediction, the authors found that at least 75 samples were needed to accurately predict the bladder DVH, while only 20 samples were needed to predict the rectum DVH. Finally, for objective function weight prediction, at least 10 samples were needed to train the logistic regression model, while at least 150 samples were required to train the K-nearest neighbor methodology. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, the minimum required sample size needed to accurately train KBP models for prostate cancer depends on the specific model and endpoint to be predicted. The authors' results may provide a lower bound for more complicated tumor sites.
26936429	Silybin suppresses cell proliferation and induces apoptosis of multiple myeloma cells via the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway.	Silybin is a biologically active component extracted from the seeds of Silybum marianum, which has been shown to have inhibitory effects on prostate, skin, bladder, lung and colon cancer cells, in addition to its efficacy in the treatment of liver diseases, including hepatitis and cirrhosis. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether silybin suppresses the proliferation and induces apoptosis of multiple myeloma (MM) cells and to elucidate its molecular targets. The proliferative and apoptotic rates of the U266 MM cell line were assessed using MTT and flowcytometric assays, respectively. Western blot analysis was used to assess the protein levels of phosphoinositide3 kinase (PI3K), phosphorylated (p)Akt and pmammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) in U266 cells. In addition, PI3K inhibitor LY294002 or activator insulinlike growth factor 1 were used to investigate the involvement of the PI3K/AktmTOR signaling pathway in the effect of silybin on U266 cells. The results revealed that silybin restrained the proliferation and enhanced the apoptosis of U266 cells. Furthermore, silybin inhibited the protein expression of PI3K, pAkt and pmTOR in U266 cells. Of note, inhibition of PI3K facilitated silybinmediated reduction of mTOR activation, cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis in U266 cells, while activation of PI3K attenuated the effects of silybin. In conclusion, silybin suppressed cell proliferation and promoted apoptosis of U266 cells via PI3K/Akt-mTOR signaling pathways.
26936428	The importance of surgical margins in renal cell and urothelial carcinomas.	This chapter reviews the prevalence, outcomes, and management of positive surgical margins for patients with either renal cell or urothelial carcinomas. Though renal cell carcinoma tends to be resistant to conventional radio- or chemotherapy, kidney cancer patients with positive surgical margins can often be managed with close surveillance with acceptable outcomes. On the other hand, urothelial tumors tend to be more aggressive, and positive surgical margins after radical cystectomy often requires adjuvant therapy.
26936410	Second malignancies after radiotherapy for prostate cancer: systematic review and meta-analysis.	OBJECTIVE: To determine the association between exposure to radiotherapy for the treatment of prostate cancer and subsequent second malignancies (second primary cancers). DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies. DATA SOURCES: Medline and Embase up to 6 April 2015 with no restrictions on year or language. STUDY SELECTION: Comparative studies assessing the risk of second malignancies in patients exposed or unexposed to radiotherapy in the course of treatment for prostate cancer were selected by two reviewers independently with any disagreement resolved by consensus. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Two reviewers independently extracted study characteristics and outcomes. Risk of bias was assessed with the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. Outcomes were synthesized with random effects models and Mantel-Haenszel weighting. Unadjusted odds ratios and multivariable adjusted hazard ratios, when available, were pooled. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Second cancers of the bladder, colorectal tract, rectum, lung, and hematologic system. RESULTS: Of 3056 references retrieved, 21 studies were selected for analysis. Most included studies were large multi-institutional reports but had moderate risk of bias. The most common type of radiotherapy was external beam; 13 studies used patients treated with surgery as controls and eight used patients who did not undergo radiotherapy as controls. The length of follow-up among studies varied. There was increased risk of cancers of the bladder (four studies; adjusted hazard ratio 1.67, 95% confidence interval 1.55 to 1.80), colorectum (three studies; 1.79, 1.34 to 2.38), and rectum (three studies; 1.79, 1.34 to 2.38), but not cancers of the hematologic system (one study; 1.64, 0.90 to 2.99) or lung (two studies; 1.45, 0.70 to 3.01), after radiotherapy compared with the risk in those unexposed to radiotherapy. The odds of a second cancer varied depending on type of radiotherapy: treatment with external beam radiotherapy was consistently associated with increased odds while brachytherapy was not. Among the patients who underwent radiotherapy, from individual studies, the highest absolute rates reported for bladder, colorectal, and rectal cancers were 3.8%, 4.2%, and 1.2%, respectively, while the lowest reported rates were 0.1%, 0.3%, and 0.3%. CONCLUSION: Radiotherapy for prostate cancer was associated with higher risks of developing second malignancies of the bladder, colon, and rectum compared with patients unexposed to radiotherapy, but the reported absolute rates were low. Further studies with longer follow-up are required to confirm these findings.
26935245	Complications and quality of life in elderly patients with several comorbidities undergoing cutaneous ureterostomy with single stoma or ileal conduit after radical cystectomy.	OBJECTIVES: To compare peri-operative outcomes and quality of life (QoL) in a series of elderly patients with high comorbidity status who underwent single stoma cutaneous ureterostomy (CU) or ileal conduit (IC) after radical cystectomy (RC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: The clinical records of patients aged >75 years with an American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score >2 who underwent RC at a single institution between March 2009 and March 2014 were retrospectively analysed. After RC, all patients included in the study received an IC urinary diversion or a CU with single stoma urinary diversion. Preoperative clinical characteristics as well as intra- and postoperative outcomes were evaluated and compared between the two groups. In addition, the Bladder Cancer Index (BCI) was used to assess QoL. RESULTS: A total of 70 patients were included in the final comparative analyses. Of these, 35 underwent IC diversion and 35 CU single stoma diversion. The two groups were similar with regard to age, gender, ASA score, type of indication and pathological features. Operating times (P < 0.001), estimated blood loss (P < 0.001), need for intensive care unit stay (P = 0.01), time to drain removal (P < 0.001) and length of hospital stay (P < 0.001) were significantly higher in patients undergoing IC diversion. The number of patients with intra- (P = 0.04) and early postoperative (P = 0.02) complications was also significantly higher among those undergoing IC diversion. Interestingly, the mean BCI scores were overlapping in the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: The present results show that CU with a single stoma can represent a valid alternative to IC in elderly patients with relevant comorbidities, reducing peri-operative complications without a significant impairment of QoL.
26935146	Identification of long-non coding RNA UCA1 as an oncogene in renal cell carcinoma.	Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is the most common type of kidney cancer in adults, which is associated with poor prognosis and high recurrence. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been reported to be dysregulated in cancer and to be important in the regulation of carcinogenesis, thus suggesting that this class of molecules may be used as biomarkers in cancer. The lncRNA urothelial carcinoma associated 1 (UCA1) has been observed to be upregulated and to function as an oncogene in certain types of cancer; however, the role of UCA1 in RCC remains to be elucidated. The present study aimed to determine the expression and function of UCA1 in RCC. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was used to determine the expression levels of UCA1 in 46 paired RCC and adjacent normal tissue samples. Furthermore, qPCR was used to determine the expression levels of UCA1 in four RCC cell lines compared with the human embryonic kidney 293T cell line. The impact of UCA1 on cell migration, proliferation and apoptosis was investigated by wound scratch assay, MTT and flow cytometry, respectively. The results of the present study demonstrated that UCA1 expression levels were significantly increased in RCC tissues and cells, as compared with the controls. Ectopic expression and gene silencing of UCA1 in RCC cell lines exerted opposite effects on cellular proliferation, migration and apoptosis, and the results suggested that UCA1 may function as an oncogene in RCC. These results indicated that UCA1 may be considered as a promising biomarker for diagnosis, and a therapeutic target in RCC. Further research is required to elucidate the role and target genes of UCA1 in RCC.
26934821	Dosimetric advantages of proton therapy compared with photon therapy using an adaptive strategy in cervical cancer.	Background Image-guided adaptive proton therapy (IGAPT) can potentially be applied to take into account interfraction motion while limiting organ at risk (OAR) dose in cervical cancer radiation therapy (RT). In this study, the potential dosimetric advantages of IGAPT compared with photon-based image-guided adaptive RT (IGART) were investigated. Material and methods For 13 cervical cancer patients, full and empty bladder planning computed tomography (CT) images and weekly CTs were acquired. Based on both primary clinical target volumes (pCTVs) [i.e. gross tumor volume (GTV), cervix, corpus-uterus and upper part of the vagina] on planning CTs, the pretreatment observed full range primary internal target volume (pITV) was interpolated to derive pITV subranges. Given corresponding ITVs (i.e. pITVs including lymph nodes), patient-specific photon and proton plan libraries were generated. Using all weekly CTs, IGART and IGAPT treatments were simulated by selecting library plans and recalculating the dose. For each recalculated IGART and IGAPT fraction, CTV (i.e. pCTV including lymph nodes) coverage was assessed and differences in fractionated substitutes of dose-volume histogram (DVH) parameters (V15Gy, V30Gy, V45Gy, Dmean, D2cc) for bladder, bowel and rectum were tested for significance (Wilcoxon signed-rank test). Also, differences in toxicity-related DVH parameters (rectum V30Gy, bowel V45Gy) were approximated based on accumulated dose distributions. Results In 92% (96%) of all recalculated IGAPT (IGART) fractions adequate CTV coverage (V95% >98%) was obtained. All dose parameters for bladder, bowel and rectum, except the fractionated substitute for rectum V45Gy, were improved using IGAPT. Also, IGAPT reduced the mean dose to bowel, bladder and rectum significantly (p < 0.01). In addition, an average decrease of rectum V30Gy and bowel V45Gy indicated reductions in toxicity probabilities when using IGAPT. Conclusion This study demonstrates the feasibility of IGAPT in cervical cancer using a plan-library based plan-of-the-day approach. Compared to photon-based IGART, IGAPT maintains target coverage while significant dose reductions for the bladder, bowel and rectum can be achieved.
26934010	[Nephrotic Syndrome in Adult Patients--Etiology and Complications].	The nephrotic syndrome (NS) in adult patients is a rare entity. It is characterized by a tetrad consisting of edema, proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia and hypercholesterolemia. NS can be caused by intrinsic glomerular disorders or secondary damage to the glomerulus triggered by systemic diseases, infections or drugs. The responsibility of the primary care physician is to distinguish NS from other edematous disorders. Patients should be referred to a nephrologist for further diagnosis and treatment. NS is associated with various complications. Affected individuals are prone to infections and may suffer from thrombophilia, acute renal failure and Vitamin D deficiency. Immunosuppressive therapy of the underlying disorder may cause late onset complications such as skin cancer or urothelial carcinoma. Aside from causative therapy adequate management of these complications is crucial for the treatment of patients suffering from NS.
26932432	Anticipatory extended cholecystectomy: the 'Lucknow' approach for thick walled gall bladder with low suspicion of cancer.	BACKGROUND: Gall stones (GS) cause inflammation of the gall bladder (GB) i.e., chronic cholecystitis (CC) and xantho-granulomatous cholecystitis (XGC) which can result in a thick walled GB (TWGB). Gall bladder cancer (GBC) may also present as TWGB. While CC and XGC can be treated with simple cholecystectomy (SC), GBC merits extended cholecystectomy (EC). We propose a new surgical approach, anticipatory extended cholecystectomy (AEC), for doubtful TWGB in the belief that AEC would not violate the sacrosanct cholecysto-hepatic plane in doubtful cases and thereby not ruin the chances of cure for a patient whose GB demonstrates malignancy on frozen section histopathology. The addition of lymphadenectomy in cases which turn out to be malignant completes the procedure for GB cancer, but spares all problems related to lymphadenectomy in an undeserving patient. METHODS: AEC involves removal of GB with a 2-cm wedge of liver, which is then subjected to frozen section histological examination. Lymphadenectomy is performed if GBC is confirmed. AEC was performed in 13 patients between January 2011 and June 2014. During the same period, 1,673 SC for CC/XGC and 116 EC for GBC were performed. RESULTS: All patients were symptomatic for GS (3 with acute cholecystitis). Ultrasonography (US) raised suspicion of GBC in 11 patients. CT raised suspicion of GBC in 9 patients. Preoperative FNAC was done in 2 patients; in 1 it was negative and in 1 it was suspicious for malignancy. Preoperative diagnosis was GBC in 8, TWGB in 2, XGC, porcelain GB and GB perforation in 1 each. AEC and frozen section was done in all 13 patients. It was reported as GBC in 2 patients and as suspicious of GBC in 1 patient; lymphadenectomy was performed in these 3 patients. Final histopathology revealed XGC in 9, CC in 2 and GBC in 2 patients. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with TWGB on US/ CT with low suspicion of cancer, AEC serves as a triage-if frozen section biopsy turns out to be positive for GBC, AEC can be completed to EC by performing lymphadenectomy. We wish to name this approach as the 'Lucknow' approach for TWGB.
26932430	beta-catenin and SKP2 proteins as predictors of grade and stage of non-muscle invasive urothelial bladder carcinoma.	BACKGROUND: To evaluate the expression of beta-catenin (beta-catenin) and SKP2 proteins in superficial bladder cancer cases and their correlation with tumor grade and stage. METHODS: After institutional review board approval, we retrospectively evaluated the expression of beta-catenin and SKP2 proteins in tissue specimens from patients with non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) and compared their results with a cohort of chronic nonspecific cystitis's. Then we and explored these markers association with tumor grade and stage. RESULTS: A total of 40 patients were retrospectively identified, 50% was NMIBC and the rest were chronic nonspecific cystitis. beta-catenin was expressed in 18 (90%) patients of the NMIBC group in comparison to 14 (70%) of the control group with (P=0.1), while SKP2 protein was only expressed in NMIBC groups (P=0.03). A statistically significant correlation was identified between nucleocytoplasmic localization of beta-catenin and SKP2 with tumor grade, stage. CONCLUSIONS: beta-catenin and SKP2 expression are providing promising results for differentiating higher grade and stage non muscle invasive bladder cancers.
26932334	[Advanced Adenocarcinoma of the Bladder after Augmentation Gastrocystoplasty].	A 29-year-old woman had undergone gastrocystoplasty with Mitrofanoff appendicovesicostomy for urethral trauma at 9 years of age. Since then, she was being followed up for performing clean intermittent self-catheterization at regular intervals. Twenty years after the surgery, she presented with gross hematuria. Ultrasonographic findings revealed bilateral hydronephrosis. Cystoscopy and computed tomography (CT) revealed invasive bladder cancer with pelvic lymph node metastases. A biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of adenocarcinoma with signet ring cell carcinoma. Subsequently, neo-adjuvant combination chemotherapy with TS-1 and cisplatin (CDDP) was initiated, which was followed by open radical cystectomy with extended pelvic lymphadenectomy. The tumor was found to infiltrate from the anastomotic site into the entire native bladder and histopathological diagnosis was muscle invasive adenocarcinoma with neuroendocrine differentiation and lymph node metastasis (ypT3bN2). TS-1 was continued as adjuvant chemotherapy and the patient did not have any evidence of recurrence for 12 months postoperatively.
26932332	[A Case Report of Suspected Tuberculous Granuloma in the Kidney after BCG Perfusion Therapy for Urothelial Carcinoma of the Renal Pelvis].	A 66-year-old male patient was referred to our hospital for bilateral renal pelvic tumors. Ureteroscopic biopsy revealed urothelial carcinoma (UC) of low grade (G1) of the renal pelvis. Renal sparing treatment with systemic chemotherapy and percutaneous tumor resection was performed. However, during subsequent follow up, a recurrent tumor was found on the left ureter. After ureteroscopic laser ablation of the tumor, Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) perfusion therapy (once a week, total 6 weeks) was performed via a single J ureteral catheter with no adverse events. Later, another recurrent recurrence was found on the right ureter, and was managed by ureteroscopic laser ablation followed by BCG perfusion therapy via a single J ureteral catheter. However, the patient developed high fever with chill from the day after initial BCG perfusion therapy on the right side. Although we started antibiotics, high fever continued. Then antituberculous drugs were administered and his condition was improved. Computed tomographic scan revealed a right renal mass 57 mm in diameter, which was consistent with tuberculous granuloma. The tuberculous granuloma persisted despite the continuation of anti-tuberculous drugs. In exceptional cases of upper tract UC such as single kidney and bilateral tumor, BCG perfusion therapy has been used as adjunctive treatment to cure or prevent UC. However, dosages and administration methods of BCG perfusion therapy for upper tract UC still remain to be standardized. Serious adverse events after BCG perfusion therapy require prompt and proper management including the use of anti-tuberculous drugs.
26932328	[Clinical Significance of Primary Tumor Resection in Patients with Metastatic Urothelial Carcinoma at Initial Presentation].	We retrospectively reviewed 67 patients who presented with metastatic urothelial carcinoma to the Department of Urology, Asahikawa Medical University Hospital between 2000 and 2013. Furthermore, 13 patients with comparatively longer survival (2 years or longer after diagnosis) were analyzed to find any clinical characteristics among these patients. The primary site was the upper tract in 41 patients and bladder in 26. The most frequent metastatic site was regional lymph nodes (49 patients), followed by viscera (36 patients) and distant lymph nodes (17 patients). Primary tumor resections were performed on 83% of the patients with only regional lymph node metastasis, but on only 35% of the patients with distant metastasis. Median overall survival (OS) of patients was 8.5 months in this series. Median OS of patients with only regional lymph node metastasis was 15 months, which was significantly longer than that (8 months) of patients with distant metastasis. Multivariate analysis revealed only regional lymph node metastasis and the number of metastatic sites were significant prognostic factors for OS. We further investigated the clinical characteristics of 13 patients with comparatively longer survival. Other than a small number of metastatic sites (1 or 2) and no distant lymph node metastasis, we could not find any significant characteristics to predict longer prognosis. The present study showed that primary tumor resection did not have a significant benefit on survival in patients with metastatic urothelial carcinoma at initial presentation. However, primary tumor resection should be considered when there is only regional lymph node metastasis and few metastatic sites.
26932233	Adsorption according to the Langmuir-Freundlich model is the detection mechanism of the antigen p53 for early diagnosis of cancer.	Biosensors for early detection of cancer biomarkers normally depend on specific interactions between such biomarkers and immobilized biomolecules in the sensing units. Though these interactions are expected to yield specific, irreversible adsorption, the underlying mechanism appears not to have been studied in detail. In this paper, we show that adsorption explained with the Langmuir-Freundlich model is responsible for detection of the antigen p53 associated with various types of cancers. Irreversible adsorption was proven between anti-p53 antibodies immobilized on the biosensors and the antigen p53, with the adequacy of the Langmuir-Freundlich model being confirmed with three independent experimental methods, viz. polarization-modulated infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy (PM-IRRAS), nanogravimetry using a quartz crystal microbalance and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The method based on this irreversible adsorption was sufficiently sensitive (limit of detection of 1.4 pg mL(-1)) for early diagnosis of Hodgkin lymphoma, pancreatic and colon carcinomas, and bladder, ovarian and lung cancers, and could distinguish between MCF7 cells containing the antigen p53 from Saos-2 cells that do not contain it.
26931741	HOXB13 protein expression in metastatic lesions is a promising marker for prostate origin.	The HOXB13 gene is a member of the homeobox gene family, and prostate development depends on HOXB13 function. HOXB13 is a very sensitive and specific marker of prostate tissue and prostate cancer. When the origin of a tumor in a resection specimen or in biopsy material is unclear, it allows determining the prostate as the primary. Our aim was to determine whether HOXB13 has similar sensitivity for determining prostate origin of lymph node and bone metastases. We retrieved cases of lymph node and bone metastases of histologically confirmed prostate cancer (PCa) and selected lymph node metastases of urothelial carcinoma (UCa). A panel of antibodies against HOXB13, PSA, ERG, Androgen receptors, p504S, p63, GATA-3, CK7, and Uroplakin 2 and 3 was tested on these tissue samples. Two pathologists analysed and scored staining as either 0 (negative) or + (positive). The selected cohort consisted of 74 cases of lymph node and 15 of bone metastases of PCa and 15 of lymph node metastases of UCa. HOXB13 was expressed in 93 % of lymph node and in 33 % of bone metastases of PCa. All lymph node metastases of UCa were negative. Sensitivity of HOXB13 as a marker for prostate origin in lymph node metastases was 93 % and for bone metastases 33 %. Inter-observer variability in assessment of staining was good, as only two (1.9 %) of lymph node metastasis of PCa were discordant. HOXB13 is a useful marker for prostate origin when doubt exists regarding the site of the primary of a metastatic lesion. On bone metastases, HOXB13 immunohistochemistry performed less well, probably due to the use of tissue decalcification.
26931119	Anti-tumor effects of Atractylenolide I on bladder cancer cells.	BACKGROUND: Atractylenolide I (ATR-1), an active component of Rhizoma Atractylodis Macrocephalae, possesses cytotoxicity against various carcinomas. However, little is known about the effects of ATR-1on bladder cancer. In the present study, the anti-tumor activity of ATR-1 was examined on bladder cancer cells both in vivo and in vitro. METHODS: MTT assay was used to assess the cytotoxic effect of ATR-1. Cell cycle distribution and apoptosis levels were evaluated using flow cytometry. Western blotting assay was applied to measure the levels of proteins associated with the apoptotic pathway, cell cycle progression and PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway. Tumor models in nude mice were induced by injection of T-24 and 253J human bladder cancer cells. RESULTS: ATR-1 inhibited bladder cancer cell proliferation, arrested cell cycle in G2/M phase through up-regulation of p21 and down-regulation of cyclin B1, CDK1 and Cdc25c. Meanwhile, ATR-1 also triggered cellular apoptosis depending on the activation of mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. Mechanism investigation indicated that ATR-1 exerts its anti-tumor effect also relies on the inhibition of PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway. Finally, mice studies showed that ATR-1 blocked the T-24 or 253J-induced xenograft tumor growth without noticeable toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: ATR-1 may be served as a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of bladder cancer.
26930657	ADAM15 Is Functionally Associated with the Metastatic Progression of Human Bladder Cancer.	ADAM15 is a member of a family of catalytically active disintegrin membrane metalloproteinases that function as molecular signaling switches, shed membrane bound growth factors and/or cleave and inactivate cell adhesion molecules. Aberrant metalloproteinase function of ADAM15 may contribute to tumor progression through the release of growth factors or disruption of cell adhesion. In this study, we utilized human bladder cancer tissues and cell lines to evaluate the expression and function of ADAM15 in the progression of human bladder cancer. Examination of genome and transcriptome databases revealed that ADAM15 ranked in the top 5% of amplified genes and its mRNA was significantly overexpressed in invasive and metastatic bladder cancer compared to noninvasive disease. Immunostaining of a bladder tumor tissue array designed to evaluate disease progression revealed increased ADAM15 immunoreactivity associated with increasing cancer stage and exhibited significantly stronger staining in metastatic samples. About half of the invasive tumors and the majority of the metastatic cases exhibited high ADAM15 staining index, while all low grade and noninvasive cases exhibited negative or low staining. The knockdown of ADAM15 mRNA expression significantly inhibited bladder tumor cell migration and reduced the invasive capacity of bladder tumor cells through MatrigelTM and monolayers of vascular endothelium. The knockdown of ADAM15 in a human xenograft model of bladder cancer inhibited tumor growth by 45% compared to controls. Structural modeling of the catalytic domain led to the design of a novel ADAM15-specific sulfonamide inhibitor that demonstrated bioactivity and significantly reduced the viability of bladder cancer cells in vitro and in human bladder cancer xenografts. Taken together, the results revealed an undescribed role of ADAM15 in the invasion of human bladder cancer and suggested that the ADAM15 catalytic domain may represent a viable therapeutic target in patients with advanced disease.
26930207	Preoperative Plasma Fibrinogen Level Represents an Independent Prognostic Factor in a Chinese Cohort of Patients with Upper Tract Urothelial Carcinoma.	BACKGROUND: Increased plasma fibrinogen is thought to contribute to tumor progression and metastasis. The association of plasma fibrinogen with clinicopathological characteristics, and the optimal cutoff with an ideal predictive value has not been fully determined in patients with upper tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC). We aimed to investigate the clinical significance of this parameter in a Chinese cohort of patients with UTUC. METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted to analyze the clinical data of 184 operable UTUC patients in a Chinese cohort with a high incidence of chronic kidney disease (CKD). An optimal cutoff was set for further analysis according to validated web-based software. The associations of plasma fibrinogen with clinicopathological characteristics and survival were assessed. Multivariate analyses were performed to determine the independent prognostic factors. RESULTS: Elevated plasma fibrinogen was significantly associated with tumor necrosis, lymph node involvement, and a higher preoperative CKD stage, pathological tumor stage and grade (all P < 0.05). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that plasma fibrinogen >/= 3.54 g/L predicted a poorer overall and cancer-specific survival than < 3.54 g/L (P < 0.001 for both). Multivariate analyses revealed that elevated preoperative plasma fibrinogen was an independent negative prognostic factor for overall survival (HR = 2.026; 95% CI: 1.226-3.349; P = 0.006) and cancer-specific survival (HR = 1.886; 95% CI: 1.019-3.490; P = 0.043). CONCLUSIONS: Increased plasma fibrinogen was an independent prognostic risk factor for poor outcomes in UTUC. This parameter may serve as an effective biomarker with easy accessibility for evaluating prognosis for patients with UTUC.
26929126	Should the BK polyomavirus cytopathic effect be best classified as atypical or benign in urine cytology specimens?	BACKGROUND: According to The Paris System for Reporting Urinary Cytology (TPS), the category of atypical urothelial cells (AUC) should not be applied to specimens in which cellular changes can be entirely attributed to the polyoma (BK) virus cytopathic effect (CPE). Until recently, cases with BK CPE at The Johns Hopkins Hospital were categorized as atypical urothelial cells of uncertain significance (AUC-US), which is equivalent to the TPS AUC category. This study was performed to determine how significantly the rate of AUC-US specimens would decrease if specimens with only BK CPE were classified as benign. METHODS: Two reviewers and 1 adjudicator re-evaluated urinary tract specimens to determine whether sufficient cytological atypia justified an AUC-US diagnosis independent of the presence of BK CPE. For patients with surgical follow-up, the rate of high-grade urothelial carcinoma (HGUC) on tissue biopsy was tracked over a 5-year period. RESULTS: The reclassification rate of AUC-US cases with BK CPE as benign was 62.6%. The rate of subsequent HGUC was 6.0% for cases reclassified as benign and 10.0% for cases still classified as AUC-US. These rates were not significantly elevated in comparison with control cohorts among all-comers. However, for patients without a history of HGUC, the rate of HGUC on follow-up was significantly elevated in comparison with the rate for a benign control cohort and was similar to the rate for the AUC-US control cohort. CONCLUSIONS: Reclassification as benign would have decreased the rate of AUC-US from 24.8% to 20.7% during the study year. However, the high rate of subsequent HGUC among nonsurveillance patients suggests that the reclassification of specimens with BK CPE in these patients may be inappropriate.

26928510	[Spondilodyscitis with medullary and spinal abscess caused by Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG)].	Intravesical therapy with live-attenuated Mycobacterium bovis strain have demonstrated to be effective in the treatment of recurrent and high-grade superficial bladder tumors. The use of this therapy is widely extended; however spreading of bacillus from the injection site could be one rare complication that may cause infection in different locations. An appropriate anamnesis is very important to establish an etiological diagnostic of possible infections caused by M. bovis BCG. Laboratory diagnosis at species level is difficult because of the high genetic similarity (99.9%) with the other member of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex. We present a case report who developed tuberculous spondylodiscitis by M. bovis BCG, which had a history of intravesical instillation for treatment of bladder cancer.
26927612	Bag and loop small bowel contouring strategies differentially estimate small bowel dose for post-hysterectomy women receiving pencil beam scanning proton therapy.	Background Small bowel (SB) dose-volume relationships established during initial computed tomography (CT) simulations may change throughout therapy due to organ displacement and motion. We investigated the impact of organ motion on SB dose-volume histograms (DVHs) in women with gynecologic malignancies treated with pencil beam scanning (PBS) proton therapy and compared PBS SB DVHs to intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT). Material and methods Post-hysterectomy patients (n = 11) treated for gynecologic cancers were enrolled on an image-guided proton therapy protocol involving CT simulation with full (CTF) and empty (CTE) bladders and weekly/biweekly on-treatment scans. IMRT plans were generated for comparative analysis. SB was contoured as bowel loops or bowel bag. Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were used for matched-pair comparisons of SB, bladder, and rectum dose-volumes between CT scans and between PBS and IMRT plans. Results In PBS loops analysis, on-treatment DVH was significantly higher than CTF for doses <45 Gy (p < 0.05), and not significantly different than CTE. Specifically, V15 for loops was higher on-treatment (median 240 cm(3)) compared to CTF (median 169 cm(3), p = 0.03). In PBS bag analysis, on-treatment DVH was not significantly different from CTF across all dose ranges. Bowel bag V45 was not significantly different between on-treatment (median 540 cm(3)) and CTF (median 499 cm(3), p = 0.53). Decreasing bladder volume was associated with increasing V15 for loops and V45 for bowel bag (p < 0.005, both). Comparing PBS and IMRT, PBS resulted in significantly lower DVHs at low dose regions (<38 Gy) and higher DVHs at high dose regions (42.5-45.5 Gy) in both loops and bag analysis. IMRT plans demonstrated higher on-treatment SB loop DVHs and only minimal differences in bowel bag DVHs compared to CTF. Conclusions SB DVHs were well estimated by CTF bowel bag and underestimated by CTF loops in the setting of inconsistent bladder filling. Verifying bladder filling prior to treatment or using CTE for planning may more conservatively estimate SB dose-volume relationships.
26927384	[Expression and clinical significance of 5hmC in bladder urothelial carcinoma].	OBJECTIVE: To investigate the expression of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) in bladder urothelial carcinoma (UC) and its clinical significance. METHODS: The expression of 5hmC in 21 cases of UC tissues and pericarcinous urinary tract epithelium was detected by immunohistochemical staining. Then the expression of 5hmC in the surgical resection of UC tissues in 92 cases was also surveyed. Non parametric U Mann-Whitney test was used to analyze the correlation between 5hmC expression and clinical data. Single factor survival analysis was performed by Kaplan-Meier test. RESULTS: The expression of 5hmC in normal urinary tract epithelium and UC tissues was significantly different, but there was no significant difference in the expression of 5hmC between low and high grades of UC tissues as well as between different TNM grades. Kaplan-Meier single factor survival analysis showed that there was no significant correlation between the 5hmC expression level and the survival rate or the recurrence-free survival of UC patients. CONCLUSION: The expression level of 5hmC in UC tissues is significantly lower than that in pericarcinous urinary tract epithelium. There is no correlation between the 5hmC expression and the progression, prognosis and recurrence of UC.
26927300	Patterns and prognostic significance of clinical recurrences after radical cystectomy for bladder cancer: A 20-year single center experience.	OBJECTIVE: Patients treated with radical cystectomy (RC) due to bladder cancer (BCa) face high risk of clinical recurrence. The aim of our study was to describe recurrence patterns and characteristics related to survival in patients treated with RC due to BCa. METHODS: Years 1992-2012 of a prospectively maintained institutional RC registry were queried for clinical localized urothelial BCa patients. Clinical recurrences were categorized as local, distant or secondary urothelial recurrences. Kaplan Meier analysis assessed time to cancer specific mortality (CSM). Multivariable Cox regression models were constructed to predict recurrence and CSM after recurrence. RESULTS: Data from 1110 patients with urothelial non-metastatic BCa at RC were analyzed with 7.5 years of median follow up. Overall, 324 patients experienced recurrence and 200 (61.7%) were single site recurrence. The locations were: 43 local (22 cystectomy bed and 21 pelvic lymph node dissection template), 138 distant (36 lung, 19 liver, 52 bone, 17 extra pelvic LN, 7 peritoneal, 4 brain and 3 others) and 19 secondary urothelial carcinoma (11 upper urinary tract, 8 urethra). Significant independent predictors of overall recurrence were pathological stage pT3/T4 vs. pT0-2, pathological N positive status and positive surgical margin. Median overall survival after recurrence was 18 months. At multivariate analysis, pathological T3 (Hazard ratio [HR]: 1.62), T4 (HR: 1.58), interval from RC to recurrence (HR: 0.92) and distant (HR: 2.57) recurrences were independently associated with CSM (all p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Overall, one out of three patients treated with RC face recurrence during follow up. Early and distant recurrences are associated with shortest survival expectancies.
26927070	Changes in Immunogenicity during the Development of Urinary Bladder Cancer: A Preliminary Study.	In the present study, we evaluated tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and blood regulatory T lymphocyte (Tregs, CD4+/CD25+/FoxP3+) expression in bladder cancer patients. The number of CD4+, CD8+, CD25+, FoxP3+ and CD20+ TILs was analyzed in association with clinico-pathomorphological features. In more advanced metastasizing tumors, showing non-classic differentiation (ND) and a more aggressive tissue invasion type (TIT), the number of TILs decreased. A low number of CD4+ TILs was associated with poor prognosis. Similarly, Treg frequency before surgery and after surgical treatment was significantly lower in more advanced tumors. The changes in TILs, as well as of local and systemic Tregs, were accompanied by changes in the histological phenotype of urothelial carcinoma regarding pT stage, NDs, TIT, and clinical outcomes. The number of TILs and the frequency of blood Tregs (indicators of antitumor response) may be essential for choosing an immunotherapy that is adjusted to the immune status according to the phase of tumor growth. Moreover, a significant reduction in the number of CD4+ and CD8+ TILs with the development of NDs in more advanced tumors may be associated with lower tumor immunogenicity, resulting in immune tolerance towards tumor tissue. These observations and the tendency of urothelial bladder carcinoma to undergo NDs in a heterogeneous manner during tumor progression suggest complex interactions between bladder cancer immunogenicity and stages of tumor progression.
26927059	Using Copy Number Alterations to Identify New Therapeutic Targets for Bladder Carcinoma.	Bladder cancer represents the ninth most widespread malignancy throughout the world. It is characterized by the presence of two different clinical and prognostic subtypes: non-muscle-invasive bladder cancers (NMIBCs) and muscle-invasive bladder cancers (MIBCs). MIBCs have a poor outcome with a common progression to metastasis. Despite improvements in knowledge, treatment has not advanced significantly in recent years, with the absence of new therapeutic targets. Because of the limitations of current therapeutic options, the greater challenge will be to identify biomarkers for clinical application. For this reason, we compared our array comparative genomic hybridization (array-CGH) results with those reported in literature for invasive bladder tumors and, in particular, we focused on the evaluation of copy number alterations (CNAs) present in biopsies and retained in the corresponding cancer stem cell (CSC) subpopulations that should be the main target of therapy. According to our data, CCNE1, MYC, MDM2 and PPARG genes could be interesting therapeutic targets for bladder CSC subpopulations. Surprisingly, HER2 copy number gains are not retained in bladder CSCs, making the gene-targeted therapy less interesting than the others. These results provide precious advice for further study on bladder therapy; however, the clinical importance of these results should be explored.
26926552	Risk Factors Associated with Severity and Outcomes in Pediatric Patients with Hemorrhagic Cystitis.	PURPOSE: Hemorrhagic cystitis is a complication of treatment of pediatric cancer with considerable variation in severity and morbidity. This study presents an analysis of hemorrhagic cystitis severity and treatment outcomes in a large pediatric population. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with hemorrhagic cystitis treated at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital(R) were identified from 1990 to 2010. Demographic data were gathered along with information pertaining to initial primary diagnosis, hemorrhagic cystitis diagnosis and treatment, and mortality. Statistical analyses were performed to evaluate associations between risk factors and severity of hemorrhagic cystitis as well as treatment outcomes. RESULTS: Of the 285 patients who met inclusion criteria 54% were male. Mean age was 11.41 years. Mean time from initial primary diagnosis to hemorrhagic cystitis onset was 29 months. Noninvasive treatment was performed in 246 patients (86%) and operative intervention was required in 14 (4.9%). Bivariate analysis demonstrated that pelvic radiation therapy (p = 0.0002), any radiation therapy (p = 0.005), acute lymphocytic leukemia (p = 0.01), bone marrow transplantation (p = 0.0225), cyclophosphamide exposure (p = 0.0419) and BK virus positivity (p = 0.0472) were predictors of higher grade hemorrhagic cystitis. Factors correlating with the need for invasive management on bivariate analysis included pelvic radiation therapy (p = 0.0266), bone marrow transplantation (p = 0.0007), hematological malignancy (p = 0.0066), ifosfamide exposure (p = 0.0441) and male gender (p = 0.0383). Multivariate analysis showed independent effects of pelvic radiation therapy (p = 0.001) and delayed onset of hemorrhagic cystitis (p = 0.0444). CONCLUSIONS: Severity of hemorrhagic cystitis and failure of noninvasive management correlate with several identifiable risk factors. Prospective identification of patients with these risk factors may allow for targeted early intervention in those at highest risk.
26924873	Molecular Biomarkers in Bladder Cancer: Novel Potential Indicators of Prognosis and Treatment Outcomes.	Although many clinical and molecular markers for predicting outcomes in bladder cancer (BC) have been reported, their application in clinical practice remains unclear. Bladder carcinogenesis has two distinct molecular pathways that direct the development of BC. FGFR3 mutations are common in low-grade BC, while TP53 mutation or loss of RB1 is associated with muscle-invasive BC. However, no tissue-based gene markers confirmed by prospective large-scale trials in BC have been used in clinical practice. Micro-RNA analyses of BC tissue revealed that miR-145 and miR-29c* function as tumor suppressors, whereas miR-183 and miR-17-5p function as oncogenic miRNAs. In liquid biopsy, circulating tumor cells (CTC), exosomes, or cell-free RNA is extracted from the peripheral blood samples of cancer patients to analyze cancer prognosis. It was reported that detection of CTC was associated with poor prognostic factors. However, application of liquid biopsy in BC treatment is yet to be explored. Although several cell-free RNAs, such as miR-497 in plasma or miR-214 in urine, could be promising novel circulating biomarkers, they are used only for diagnosing BC as the case that now stands. Here, we discuss the application of novel biomarkers in evaluating and measuring BC outcomes.
26923782	Blocking immune checkpoints in prostate, kidney, and urothelial cancer: An overview.	Despite a long history of immunotherapeutic approaches to treatment, most genitourinary malignancies are not cured by existing immunotherapy regimens. More recently, cell surface molecules known as immune checkpoints have become the focus of efforts to develop more effective immunotherapies. Interactions between these molecules and their ligands inhibit the proliferation and function of tumor-specific lymphocytes. A monoclonal antibody blocking 1 of these checkpoints was approved for the treatment of metastatic melanoma and is now being tested in other malignancies. The objective responses seen in these early trials of checkpoint blockade are driving renewed enthusiasm for cancer immunotherapy. There are several ongoing and planned trials in genitourinary malignancies of single-agent inhibitors, as well as combinations targeting multiple checkpoints or adding other types of therapies to checkpoint blockade.
26922914	Systemic therapy for metastatic bladder cancer in 2016 and beyond.	Metastatic urothelial cancer is generally associated with poor outcomes. In the first-line setting, platinum-based chemotherapy is the standard of care but resistance rapidly develops and the vast majority of patients ultimately experience disease progression. Despite several decades of clinical drug development focused on the treatment of platinum-resistant metastatic urothelial cancer, as of late 2015 there are no standard therapies approved by the US FDA in this setting. However, preliminary results from a series of recent trials exploring innovative approaches forecast a 'sea change' in the management of this difficult to treat malignancy. Herein, we review new approaches for the management of patients with metastatic urothelial cancer focused on three key therapeutic target areas: recurrent somatic alterations, the tumor neovasculature and tumor-associated immune escape.
26922699	Impact of image registration surrogates on the planning target volume geometry for bladder radiation therapy.	PURPOSE: The use of Lipiodol and cone beam computed tomography (CT) has facilitated the generation of patient-specific planning target volumes (PTV) to reduce irradiation of normal tissue. However, injecting Lipiodol to demarcate the target volume is an invasive procedure. Center of bladder (COB) and bladder wall surface (BWS) encompassed by the clinical target volume (CTV) are proposed to be the alternative noninvasive surrogates. This study examines the impact of using these 3 surrogates for image registration on the resultant geometry of patient-specific PTVs. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Twenty bladder cancer patients who had Lipiodol injection before planning CT were included. Lipiodol, CTV, and bladder were delineated on the planning CT. In addition, CTVs were delineated on 5 cone beam CT scans from each patient. Cone beam CT scans were registered to planning CT using Lipiodol, COB, and BWS to generate Lipiodol-PTV, COB-PTV, and BWS-PTV. Using Lipiodol as the reference, the difference in the 2-dimensional/3-dimensional displacement values and the geometry of the resultant PTVs were quantified. RESULTS: A total of 1200 displacement values and 60 volumes were included for analysis. The overall median and standard deviation (SD) of the 3-dimensional displacement (mm) measured by Lipiodol, BWS, and COB are 25 (SD, 15), 24 (SD, 14), and 21 (SD, 15), respectively. Lipiodol-PTV has the smallest mean volume, followed by BWS-PTV and COB-PTV. BWS-PTV was more geometrically similar to Lipiodol-PTV when compared with COB-PTV. Six of 20 COB-PTVs who had CTV located at either the dome or the base of the bladder were larger than the corresponding Lipiodol-PTV by more than 20%. CONCLUSION: Lipiodol is the optimal image registration surrogate for partial bladder radiation therapy. However, for patients who are contraindicated for Lipiodol injection, BWS is the preferred noninvasive surrogate because the derived PTV has a smaller geometric variation from the Lipiodol-PTV when compared with COB, especially when the CTV was located at the dome or the base of the bladder.
26922578	Serum-based protein biomarkers of bladder cancer: A pre- and post-operative evaluation.	Urinary bladder cancer (BC) is the fifth most common cancer worldwide with alarming mortality. Shortcomings of urine cytology and cystoscopy and sparse improvements in the survival rate prompt us to evolve surrogate serum based protein biomarkers to identify BC at an early stage. Previously, we showed that aberrant expression of S100A4, S100A8, S100A9, carbonic anhydrase I (CA I) and Annexin V proteins in pre-operative BC serum compared to healthy controls (HC) (Clin Chim Acta, 2014; 36: 97-103). Here we further evaluate and validate these findings with follow-up post-operative BC patients. This study was conducted on 160 sera samples comprising healthy controls (HC, n=52), pre-operative (n=55) and post-operative (n=53) BC patients. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to appraise the aberrantly expressed proteins. ELISA results revealed that the expression levels of S100A8, S100A9, S100A4, and CA I were gradually and significantly reduced; concomitantly, Annexin V was progressively and significantly increased in post-operative compared to pre-operative BC sera samples. Serum protein biomarkers appear to be an encouraging and least-invasive approach for BC identification and prognosticating patient outcomes.
26921394	High Sensitivity of an Ha-RAS Transgenic Model of Superficial Bladder Cancer to Metformin Is Associated with approximately 240-Fold Higher Drug Concentration in Urine than Serum.	While pharmacoepidemiologic and laboratory studies have supported the hypothesis that the antidiabetic drug metformin may be useful in treating or preventing cancer, there is limited evidence to suggest which specific cancer sites may be particularly sensitive. Sensitivity likely is determined both by features of tumor pathophysiology and by pharmacokinetic factors. We used UPII-mutant Ha-ras transgenic mice that develop hyperplasia and low-grade, papillary urothelial cell carcinoma to determine whether metformin has activity in a model of superficial bladder cancer. Metformin significantly improved survival, reduced urinary tract obstruction, reduced bladder weight (a surrogate for tumor volume), and led to clear activation of AMP alpha kinase and inhibition of mTOR signaling in neoplastic tissue. We investigated the basis of the unusual sensitivity of this model to metformin, and observed that following oral dosing, urothelium is exposed to drug concentrations via the urine that are approximately 240-fold higher than those in the circulation. In addition, we observed that bladder cancer cell lines (RT4, UMUC-3, and J82) with homozygous deletion of either TSC1 or PTEN are more sensitive to metformin than those (TEU2, TCCSUP, and HT1376) with wild-type TSC1 and PTEN genes. Our findings provide a strong rationale for clinical trials of oral metformin in treatment of superficial bladder cancer.
26920373	Bacillus Calmette-Guerin therapy after the second transurethral resection significantly decreases recurrence in patients with new onset high-grade T1 bladder cancer.	BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to assess the efficacy of Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) therapy after a second transurethral resection (TUR) in new onset high-grade T1 bladder cancer. METHODS: From January 2008 to September 2013, 207 patients with new onset high-grade T1 bladder cancer after an initial TUR were treated at our university and at affiliated hospitals. Residual cancer rate, intravesical recurrence-free survival (RFS), and risk factors for intravesical recurrence were analyzed. RESULTS: Among a total of 207 patients, 42 patients were treated with BCG therapy following a second TUR (group 1), 23 were treated with second TUR alone (group 2), 72 were treated with BCG alone (group 3), and 70 were treated without a second TUR or BCG. The median patients' age was 72.0 years, and the median follow-up period was 33.5 months. The second TUR revealed that 34 patients (52 %) had residual cancer. Between groups 1 and 2 and groups 1 and 3, the differences in RFS were statistically significant (p = 0.002 and 0.045, respectively). In addition, BCG therapy was the most significant factor to predict RFS after the second TUR. Among the 31 patients whose pathology of the second TUR was pT0, only 1 of 12 patients (8 %) in group 1 and 11 of 19 patients (58 %) in group 2 had a recurrence. CONCLUSIONS: BCG instillation following a second TUR decreases intravesical recurrence, even if the pathology of the second TUR is pT0.
26920266	Evaluation of different extraction methods from pomegranate whole fruit or peels and the antioxidant and antiproliferative activity of the polyphenolic fraction.	Pomegranate is a functional food of great interest, due to its multiple beneficial effects on human health. This fruit is rich in anthocyanins and ellagitannins, which exert a protective role towards degenerative diseases. The aim of the present work was to optimize the extraction procedure, from different parts of the fruit, to obtain extracts enriched in selected polyphenols while retaining biological activity. Whole fruits or peels of pomegranate cultivars, with different geographic origin, were subjected to several extraction methods. The obtained extracts were analyzed for polyphenolic content, evaluated for antioxidant capacity and tested for antiproliferative activity on human bladder cancer T24 cells. Two different extraction procedures, employing ethyl acetate as a solvent, were useful in obtaining extracts enriched in ellagic acid and/or punicalagins. Antioxidative and antiproliferative assays demonstrated that the antioxidant capability is directly related to the phenolic content, whereas the antiproliferative activity is to be mainly attributed to ellagic acid.
26919632	Prognostic value of immunohistochemical expression profile of epidermal growth factor receptor in urothelial bladder cancer.	We studied epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression profile in urothelial bladder carcinoma (UBC) which is a complex and heterogeneous disease with a large spectrum of histological aspects and deadly potential. Using immunohistochemistry (IHC), all GI tumors and pTa cases showed a low expression profile of EGFR. However, we note that when the stage of disease is advanced, tumors over-express EGFR. Indeed, 5% and 25% of GII and GIII tumors over-expressed EGFR, respectively. Further, 0% of pTa, 9,5% of pT1, 15% of pT2, 50% of pT3, and 90% of pT4 tumors were shown to be high EGFR expression (HEE). Moreover, we found a statistically significant correlation between the EGFR over-expression and grade and stage (P < 0.05). Thus, EGFR over-expression could be a potential prognostic marker to predict poor outcome in Tunisian patients with UBC.
26919225	The role of urinary pH in o-phenylphenol-induced cytotoxicity and chromosomal damage in the bladders of F344 rats.	o-Phenylphenol (OPP) is a widely used fungicide and antibacterial agent that at high doses has been shown to cause bladder cancer in male F344 rats. The mechanisms underlying OPP-induced bladder carcinogenicity remain unclear but it has been proposed that a non-enzymatic pH-dependent autoxidation of phenylhydroquinone (PHQ), a primary metabolite of OPP, may be a key step in OPP-induced rat bladder carcinogenesis. To investigate this mechanism and to provide insights into the potential human health relevance of OPP-induced cancer, a series of in vitro and in vivo experiments were conducted. In human lymphoblastoid TK-6 cells and rat bladder epithelial NBT-II cells, strong increases in cytotoxicity were seen at a constant concentration of PHQ by increasing the buffer pH as well as by increasing concentrations of PHQ at a constant pH. In in vivo studies, male rats were administered OPP (4,000 and 8,000 ppm) in a diet supplemented with either 1% ammonium chloride or 3% sodium bicarbonate to produce acidic and alkaline urinary pH, respectively. Significant increases in cell proliferation as detected by 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine incorporation and micronucleus formation were seen in the bladder cells of OPP-treated rats with neutral or alkaline urinary pH but not in animals with the acidified urine. The results from these in vitro and in vivo studies provide support for the autoxidation hypothesis of bioactivation, and provide additional evidence that urinary pH can significantly influence the genotoxicity and carcinogenicity of this important agent.
26916953	Alterations of mTOR and PTEN protein expression in schistosomal squamous cell carcinoma and urothelial carcinoma.	BACKGROUND: mTOR signaling pathway is commonly activated in cancer. PTEN, a tumor suppressor gene, is a potent inhibitor of this pathway. To date the expression pattern of mTOR and PTEN in schistosomal bladder squamous cell carcinoma and urothelial carcinoma was not investigated. Also, whether alterations of these proteins are associated with pathological parameters was not established. HYPOTHESIS: We hypothesize that "expression of mTOR and/or PTEN will be altered in schistosomal-related urothelial and squamous cell carcinomas". PATIENTS AND METHODS: To test our hypothesis we examined the expression pattern of mTOR and PTEN in normal and hyperplastic urothelium, squamous metaplasia, schistosomal urothelial carcinomas (70 cases) and squamous cell carcinomas (47 cases) using immunohistochemical methods. RESULTS: mTOR protein expression was absent in the normal, hyperplastic urothelium and metaplastic squamous epithelium. mTOR was over-expressed in muscle invasive urothelial and high grade squamous cell carcinomas. In contrast, PTEN protein expression was seen in the normal and hyperplastic urothelium. The expression was reduced (metaplastic squamous epithelium) or lost in muscle invasive urothelial and high grade squamous carcinomas. Alterations of these proteins were associated with some clinicopathological features. mTOR expression was negatively correlated with PTEN expression in urothelial carcinoma only. CONCLUSIONS: We report, for the first time, altered expression of mTOR and PTEN proteins in schistosomal urothelial and squamous cell carcinomas. Alterations of these proteins may contribute to the progression and aggressive behavior of schistosomal bladder carcinoma. Targeting mTOR, may be a promising therapeutic strategy in these tumors.
26916216	Circulating microRNAs, miR-92a, miR-100 and miR-143, as non-invasive biomarkers for bladder cancer diagnosis.	The application of microRNAs (miRNAs) as potential biomarkers and therapy targets has been widely investigated in many kinds of cancers. Recent advantages of serum miRNAs open a new realm of possibilities for non-invasive diagnosis and prognosis of bladder cancer (BC). The aim of our study was to identify plasma miR-92a, miR-100 and miR-143 expression signatures in patients with BC to introduce new markers for establishing BC diagnosis and prognosis. Blood samples were collected from 70 BC patients and 62 controls. An expression of three target miRNAs (miR-92a, miR-100 and miR-143) was measured using quantitative real-time PCR method. Results were correlated with clinicopathological data and analysed. Plasma levels of miR-92a, miR-100 and miR-143 were significantly lower in BC patients than in control group. Receiver operator characteristic analysis revealed that the sensitivity and specificity values of miR-92a were 97.1% and 76.7%, respectively, with a cut-off value of 0.573. The sensitivity and specificity values of miR-100 were 90% and 66.7%, respectively, with a cut-off value of 0.644. The sensitivity and specificity values of miR-143 were 78.6% and 93.3%, respectively, with a cut-off value of 0.164. This study explores the existence of specific plasma miRNAs as early diagnostic biomarkers for BC in Egyptian patients; and these findings suggest that plasma miR-92a, miR-100 and miR-143 could be promising novel circulating biomarkers in clinical detection of BC.
26914060	Applications of spectroscopy in diagnosis, staging, and treatment of urologic malignancies.	PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To review the scientific literature on clinical applications of spectroscopy within urologic oncology. Specifically, we address the role of spectroscopy as a novel intraoperative or intraprocedural modality for the management of urothelial carcinoma, renal cell carcinoma, and prostate adenocarcinoma. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent studies have demonstrated that spectroscopy models, suitable for translation to in-vivo clinical use, can differentiate between benign parenchyma and malignant tissue for urothelial carcinoma, renal cell carcinoma, and prostate adenocarcinoma. Recent work has also established spectroscopy as a feasible modality to detect biologically aggressive high-risk disease and classify natural biomarkers. SUMMARY: Spectroscopy has the ability to objectively diagnose and stage malignancies in real time without tissue or cellular disruption. In the future, additional in-vivo studies will be needed to demonstrate that current models remain robust under physiological conditions.
26913727	Effects of contrast materials in IMRT and VMAT of prostate using a commercial Monte Carlo algorithm.	Contrast materials help in contouring in radiotherapy. The primary aim of this study is to investigate the effects of contrast materials in bladder on the dosimetry during prostate intensity modulated radiation therapy and volumetric modulated arc therapy. The study also investigates the difference of the two dose calculation options namely 'dose to medium (Dm)' and 'dose to water (Dw)' in a commercial Monte Carlo based treatment planning system. Eight IMRT treatment plans were retrospectively studied which were used to treat high risk prostate cancer patients. The treatment plans generated in Monaco treatment planning system use seven coplanar beams and calculated 'Dm' as the clinical option. These plans were recalculated, keeping the segments, beam angle and monitor units the same, with different relative electron densities assigned to the structure 'bladder' to mimic the presence of contrast material. The same plans were recalculated using the 'Dw' option. Further, keeping the IMRT constraints and plan calculation properties the same, these plans were re-optimised with the delivery method changed to volumetric modulated arc therapy and calculated using both 'Dm' and 'Dw' options. For all the four scenarios, it was found that for the target volumes CTV and PTV, 'minimum dose' is the only endpoint studied having a significant difference with the presence of contrast material. For bladder, the endpoint V40 Gy is affected. Any significant dosimetric effect is found only when the relative electron density of the contrast material is 1.2 or more. Also, the dosimetric difference is greater when 'Dm' option is used for calculation. For rectum, the dosimetry remains unaffected. Hence, contrast materials should be contoured and assigned appropriate relative electron densities during IMRT and VMAT treatment planning of prostate. Also, the difference in dose reported with the two dose calculation options (Dm and Dw) in the presence of contrast materials is significant.
26910601	Transcripts of circulating tumor cells detected by a breast cancer-specific platform correlate with clinical stage in bladder cancer patients.	PURPOSE: There is increasing interest in circulating tumor cells (CTCs) as a biomarker in bladder cancer (BC). In the present pilot study, we used a platform originally developed for detection of breast cancer CTCs to assess breast cancer-associated transcripts in CTCs of patients with different stages of BC. Moreover, transcripts specific for cancer stem cells and epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) were assessed. METHODS: We prospectively enrolled 83 BC patients and 29 controls. The AdnaTest(R) system was used to enrich epithelial cells in peripheral blood and to detect breast cancer-associated, stem cell-specific or EMT-specific transcripts. Test results were correlated with clinical and pathological stage. RESULTS: A positive AdnaTest(R) BreastCancerDetect was present in 6.9 % of controls (group A), 6.7, 15.0 and 18.7 % of patients with non-muscle-invasive BC (B), cM0 muscle-invasive BC (C) and metastatic BC (D) (p = 0.13). Stem cell-specific transcripts in group A, B, C and D were detected in 10.3, 10.0, 22.5 and 31.3 % (p = 0.03). EMT-associated transcripts were present in 3.5, 3.3, 15.0 and 18.7 % (p = 0.03). In group C, epithelial and stem-like transcripts correlated with tumor stage (p = 0.01 and 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: CTCs with expression of breast cancer-associated transcripts are present in a considerable proportion of patients with BC. EMT and stem cell-specific transcripts of CTCs correlate with clinical stage and can be detected in patients negative for epithelial transcripts. The prognostic relevance of AdnaTest(R) results in BC patients and potential implications for therapy decisions remain to be determined in prospective studies.
26908176	Hexavalent chromium induces chromosome instability in human urothelial cells.	Numerous metals are well-known human bladder carcinogens. Despite the significant occupational and public health concern of metals and bladder cancer, the carcinogenic mechanisms remain largely unknown. Chromium, in particular, is a metal of concern as incidences of bladder cancer have been found elevated in chromate workers, and there is an increasing concern for patients with metal hip implants. However, the impact of hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)) on bladder cells has not been studied. We compared chromate toxicity in two bladder cell lines; primary human urothelial cells and hTERT-immortalized human urothelial cells. Cr(VI) induced a concentration- and time-dependent increase in chromosome damage in both cell lines, with the hTERT-immortalized cells exhibiting more chromosome damage than the primary cells. Chronic exposure to Cr(VI) also induced a concentration-dependent increase in aneuploid metaphases in both cell lines which was not observed after a 24h exposure. Aneuploidy induction was higher in the hTERT-immortalized cells. When we correct for uptake, Cr(VI) induces a similar amount of chromosome damage and aneuploidy suggesting that the differences in Cr(VI) sensitivity between the two cells lines were due to differences in uptake. The increase in chromosome instability after chronic chromate treatment suggests this may be a mechanism for chromate-induced bladder cancer, specifically, and may be a mechanism for metal-induced bladder cancer, in general.
26907917	A Prospective Comparison of the Effects of Interfractional Variations on Proton Therapy and Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy for Prostate Cancer.	PURPOSE: To quantify and compare the impact of interfractional setup and anatomic variations on proton therapy (PT) and intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) for prostate cancer. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Twenty patients with low-risk or intermediate-risk prostate cancer randomized to receive passive-scattering PT (n=10) and IMRT (n=10) were selected. For both modalities, clinical treatment plans included 50.4 Gy(RBE) to prostate and proximal seminal vesicles, and prostate-only boost to 79.2 Gy(RBE) in 1.8 Gy(RBE) per fraction. Implanted fiducials were used for prostate localization and endorectal balloons were used for immobilization. Patients in PT and IMRT arms received weekly computed tomography (CT) and cone beam CT (CBCT) scans, respectively. The planned dose was recalculated on each weekly image, scaled, and mapped onto the planning CT using deformable registration. The resulting accumulated dose distribution over the entire treatment course was compared with the planned dose using dose-volume histogram (DVH) and gamma analysis. RESULTS: The target conformity index remained acceptable after accumulation. The largest decrease in the average prostate D98 was 2.2 and 0.7 Gy for PT and IMRT, respectively. On average, the mean dose to bladder increased by 3.26 +/- 7.51 Gy and 1.97 +/- 6.84 Gy for PT and IMRT, respectively. These values were 0.74 +/- 2.37 and 0.56 +/- 1.90 for rectum. Differences between changes in DVH indices were not statistically significant between modalities. All volume indices remained within the protocol tolerances after accumulation. The average pass rate for the gamma analysis, assuming tolerances of 3 mm and 3%, for clinical target volume, bladder, rectum, and whole patient for PT/IMRT were 100/100, 92.6/99, 99.2/100, and 97.2/99.4, respectively. CONCLUSION: The differences in target coverage and organs at risk dose deviations for PT and IMRT were not statistically significant under the guidelines of this protocol.
26907817	Large leiomyoma of the bladder masquerading as an enlarged prostate gland.	A 56-year-old man was admitted to hospital with shortness of breath and subsequently sustained a cardiac arrest. In the recovery period, he developed acute urinary retention and haematuria. Imaging suggested an enlarged prostate and he was started on clean intermittent catheterisation. Following further imaging and a transurethral biopsy, he was found to have a bladder leiomyoma. This was treated with laparotomy, cystotomy and enucleation of the tumour. At his 6-week follow-up appointment, he had a satisfactory cystogram and a successful void without catheter.
26907506	Robot-Assisted Radical Cystectomy with Total Intracorporeal Urinary Diversion: Comparative Analysis with Extracorporeal Urinary Diversion.	PURPOSE: To compare the perioperative outcomes, postoperative complications, and early oncologic outcomes of intracorporeal urinary diversion (ICUD) with those of extracorporeal urinary diversion (ECUD) following robot-assisted radical cystectomy (RARC) performed by a single surgeon at a tertiary referral hospital. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed a prospectively maintained, institutional review board-approved database of 70 patients treated with RARC and pelvic lymph node (LN) dissection for bladder cancer performed from 2007 through 2014. Data were collected for 64 patients who underwent either ICUD or ECUD. RESULTS: Thirty-eight patients underwent ECUD, and the remaining 26 underwent ICUD. Urinary diversion was performed extracorporeally in the first 37 cases and performed intracorporeally thereafter. There were no significant differences in patient characteristics between the ECUD and ICUD groups. Mean total operative time was 468 minutes for ECUD and 581 minutes for ICUD (P < .05). Mean estimated blood loss was 265 and 148 mL, respectively (P < .05). Minor and total complication rates for patients with the ECUD were higher than in patients with the ICUD (minor: 47.4% vs. 15.4%; total: 57.9% vs. 30.8%; P < .05). All patients showed negative surgical margin, while 21% in the ECUD group and 26.9% in the ICUD group had pathologic stage T3 or T4 (P > .05). The mean LN yield was 23.2 and 31.8, respectively (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: From our experience, the results show that ICUD after RARC can be successful, with the benefits of decreased blood loss and lower transfusion and complication rates than ECUD. A larger series and long-term follow-up data will be necessary to support our results.
26906030	Prognostic value of urinary cytology and other biomarkers for recurrence and progression in bladder cancer: a prospective study.	PURPOSE: Urinary cytology (C) and cystoscopy remain the gold standard for the detection and screening of bladder cancer (BC). In this prospective study, we analyzed whether baseline C, ImmunoCyt (I), BTA Stat (B), hemoglobin dipstick (H), and NMP22 BladderChek (N) can predict recurrence and progression. METHODS: Urinary samples from 91 patients with BC were prospectively collected over an 18-month period. Baseline characteristics of the population included patient demographics, various clinicopathological variables and use of intravesical therapy. Progression and recurrence were then assessed after a median follow-up of 48 months (IQR 23.7-59.5). Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed using COX proportional hazards models. RESULTS: On univariate analysis, C (HR 1.36; p = 0.26), I (HR 0.89; p = 0.66), B (HR 0.80; p = 0.42), H (HR 0.75; p = 0.30), and N (HR 0.82; p = 0.48) were not associated with recurrence-free survival (RFS). With regard to progression-free survival (PFS), C was significantly prognostic (HR 2.67; p = 0.017), whereas I, B, H, and N were not. On multivariable analysis, NMP22 was the only marker to be independently associated with RFS (HR 0.41, p < 0.01) and PFS (HR 0.32, p = 0.02). CONCLUSION: Based on the results of this study, baseline C, B, I, and H were not independently prognostic. Prognostic impact of NMP22 requires further validation in a multicenter larger study.
26905879	C14orf166 is a high-risk biomarker for bladder cancer and promotes bladder cancer cell proliferation.	BACKGROUND: C14orf166 (chromosome 14 open reading frame 166) plays a crucial role in some tumors, but its role in bladder cancer hasn't been explored. METHOD: We determined C14orf166 expression in uroepithelial cell, bladder cancer cells, normal bladder tissues and bladder cancer tissues using quantitative RT-PCR and western blot, we then analyzed the correlation between C14orf166 expression and clinicopathologic characteristics in a cohort of 149 patients with bladder cancer. Finally we downregulated C14orf166 and determined its role in the proliferation of bladder cancer cell lines using MTT assay, colony formation assay and cell cycle assay. RESULTS: We demonstrated C14orf166 was upregulated in bladder cancer cells and tissues, C14orf166 expression was significantly correlated with larger tumor size (P = 0.001), lymph node involvement (P < 0.001), histological differentiation (P < 0.001), survival time and vital states, and high C14orf166 expression correlated with poor survival, these results suggested C14orf166 served as a high-risk marker for bladder cancer. Knockdown of C14orf166 decreased the proliferation rate and colony formation ability of bladder cancer cells, and arrested cell cycle in G1/S transition. Further analysis showed that C14orf166 knockdown caused abnormal expression of key proteins for G1/S transition, such as Cyclin D1, P21, P27 and Rb phosphorylation. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that C14orf166 promotes bladder cancer cell proliferation and can be a novel prognostic biomarker for patients with bladder cancer.
26905370	Intravesical treatment of advanced urothelial bladder cancers with oncolytic HSV-1 co-regulated by differentially expressed microRNAs.	Urothelial bladder cancer is the most common malignancy of the urinary tract. Although most cases are initially diagnosed as non-muscle-invasive, more than 80% of patients will develop recurrent or metastatic tumors. No effective therapy exists currently for late-stage metastatic tumors. By intravesical application, local administration of oncolytic Herpes Simplex virus (oHSV-1) can provide a promising new therapy for this disease. However, its inherent neurotoxicity has been a perceived limitation for such application. In this study, we present a novel microRNA-regulatory approach to reduce HSV-1-induced neurotoxicity by suppressing viral replication in neurons while maintaining oncolytic selectivity toward urothelial tumors. Specifically, we designed a recombinant virus that utilizes differentially expressed endogenous microR143 (non-cancerous, ubiquitous) and microR124 (neural-specific) to regulate expression of ICP-4, a gene essential for HSV-1 replication. We found that expression of ICP-4 must be controlled by a combination of both miR143 and miR124 to achieve the most effective attenuation in HSV-1-induced toxicity while retaining maximal oncolytic capacity. These results suggest that interaction between miR143 and miR124 may be required to successfully regulate HSV-1 replication. Our resent study is the first proof-in-principle that miRNA combination can be exploited to fine-tune the replication of HSV-1 to treat human cancers.
26901860	Renal Function Outcomes and Risk Factors for Stage 3B Chronic Kidney Disease after Urinary Diversion in Patients with Muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer [corrected].	OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of urinary diversion on renal function, we retrospectively investigated renal function over 5 years after urinary diversion using a propensity score matching strategy. METHODS: Between May 1996 and November 2013, 345 consecutive adult patients underwent radical cystectomy and urinary diversion in our hospital; one hundred and fifteen patients with more than a 5-year follow-up were enrolled. Propensity scores were calculated using logistic analysis, and the data used in the analyses included age, gender, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG-PS), clinical tumor stage, presence of cardiovascular disease; hypertension; and type 2 diabetes and preoperative eGFR at the initial visit. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to assess the risk factors for stage 3B chronic kidney disease (CKD) after the different types of urinary diversion. RESULTS: Continent and incontinent diversion were performed in 68 and 47 patients, respectively. The mean preoperative eGFR was significantly lower in the incontinent than in the continent group (P < 0.001). In propensity score-matched patients (n = 34 each), no significant differences were observed in pre- and postoperative eGFR and 5-year eGFR decrease rates between the groups. In the incontinent group, the number of postoperative stage 3B CKD patients was significantly increased than the continent group. Using multivariate analysis, independent risk factors significantly associated with stage 3B CKD at 5 years after surgery were older age, eGFR before surgery, incontinent diversion (cutaneous ureterostomy), and postoperative hydronephrosis. CONCLUSIONS: The types of urinary diversion had no significant impact on renal function decline, whereas older age, preexisting impaired renal function, postoperative hydronephrosis, and cutaneous ureterostomy were independent risk factors for stage 3B CKD at 5 years after radical cystectomy.
26901439	Mitochondrial DNA copy number variation across human cancers.	Mutations, deletions, and changes in copy number of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), are observed throughout cancers. Here, we survey mtDNA copy number variation across 22 tumor types profiled by The Cancer Genome Atlas project. We observe a tendency for some cancers, especially of the bladder, breast, and kidney, to be depleted of mtDNA, relative to matched normal tissue. Analysis of genetic context reveals an association between incidence of several somatic alterations, including IDH1 mutations in gliomas, and mtDNA content. In some but not all cancer types, mtDNA content is correlated with the expression of respiratory genes, and anti-correlated to the expression of immune response and cell-cycle genes. In tandem with immunohistochemical evidence, we find that some tumors may compensate for mtDNA depletion to sustain levels of respiratory proteins. Our results highlight the extent of mtDNA copy number variation in tumors and point to related therapeutic opportunities.
26901393	Ex Vivo and In Vivo Imaging and Biodistribution of Aptamers Targeting the Human Matrix MetalloProtease-9 in Melanomas.	The human Matrix MetalloProtease-9 (hMMP-9) is overexpressed in tumors where it promotes the release of cancer cells thus contributing to tumor metastasis. We raised aptamers against hMMP-9, which constitutes a validated marker of malignant tumors, in order to design probes for imaging tumors in human beings. A chemically modified RNA aptamer (F3B), fully resistant to nucleases was previously described. This compound was subsequently used for the preparation of F3B-Cy5, F3B-S-acetylmercaptoacetyltriglycine (MAG) and F3B-DOTA. The binding properties of these derivatives were determined by surface plasmon resonance and electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Optical fluorescence imaging confirmed the binding to hMMP-9 in A375 melanoma bearing mice. Quantitative biodistribution studies were performed at 30 min, 1h and 2 h post injection of 99mTc-MAG-aptamer and 111In-DOTA-F3B. 99mTc radiolabeled aptamer specifically detected hMMP-9 in A375 melanoma tumors but accumulation in digestive tract was very high. Following i.v. injection of 111In-DOTA-F3B, high level of radioactivity was observed in kidneys and bladder but digestive tract uptake was very limited. Tumor uptake was significantly (student t test, p<0.05) higher for 111In-DOTA-F3B with 2.0%ID/g than for the 111In-DOTA-control oligonucleotide (0.7%ID/g) with tumor to muscle ratio of 4.0. Such difference in tumor accumulation has been confirmed by ex vivo scintigraphic images performed at 1h post injection and by autoradiography, which revealed the overexpression of hMMP-9 in sections of human melanomas. These results demonstrate that F3B aptamer is of interest for detecting hMMP-9 in melanoma tumor.
26901314	Multiplex PCR and Next Generation Sequencing for the Non-Invasive Detection of Bladder Cancer.	BACKGROUND: Highly sensitive and specific urine-based tests to detect either primary or recurrent bladder cancer have proved elusive to date. Our ever increasing knowledge of the genomic aberrations in bladder cancer should enable the development of such tests based on urinary DNA. METHODS: DNA was extracted from urine cell pellets and PCR used to amplify the regions of the TERT promoter and coding regions of FGFR3, PIK3CA, TP53, HRAS, KDM6A and RXRA which are frequently mutated in bladder cancer. The PCR products were barcoded, pooled and paired-end 2 x 250 bp sequencing performed on an Illumina MiSeq. Urinary DNA was analysed from 20 non-cancer controls, 120 primary bladder cancer patients (41 pTa, 40 pT1, 39 pT2+) and 91 bladder cancer patients post-TURBT (89 cancer-free). RESULTS: Despite the small quantities of DNA extracted from some urine cell pellets, 96% of the samples yielded mean read depths >500. Analysing only previously reported point mutations, TERT mutations were found in 55% of patients with bladder cancer (independent of stage), FGFR3 mutations in 30% of patients with bladder cancer, PIK3CA in 14% and TP53 mutations in 12% of patients with bladder cancer. Overall, these previously reported bladder cancer mutations were detected in 86 out of 122 bladder cancer patients (70% sensitivity) and in only 3 out of 109 patients with no detectable bladder cancer (97% specificity). CONCLUSION: This simple, cost-effective approach could be used for the non-invasive surveillance of patients with non-muscle-invasive bladder cancers harbouring these mutations. The method has a low DNA input requirement and can detect low levels of mutant DNA in a large excess of normal DNA. These genes represent a minimal biomarker panel to which extra markers could be added to develop a highly sensitive diagnostic test for bladder cancer.
26901067	Frequent somatic CDH1 loss-of-function mutations in plasmacytoid variant bladder cancer.	Plasmacytoid bladder cancer is an aggressive histologic variant with a high risk of disease-specific mortality. Using whole-exome and targeted sequencing, we find that truncating somatic alterations in the CDH1 gene occur in 84% of plasmacytoid carcinomas and are specific to this histologic variant. Consistent with the aggressive clinical behavior of plasmacytoid carcinomas, which frequently recur locally, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of CDH1 in bladder cancer cells enhanced cell migration.
26901010	Effect of Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy on the Growth Kinetics and Enhancement Pattern of Primary Renal Tumors.	OBJECTIVE: The objective of our study was to assess the growth rate and enhancement of renal masses before and after treatment with stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT). MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study included all patients with renal masses who underwent SBRT during a 5-year period. Orthogonal measurements of renal masses were obtained on pre- and posttreatment CT or MRI. Pre- and posttreatment growth rates were compared for renal mass diameter and volume using the t test. Pre- and posttreatment tumor enhancement values were compared for tumors that underwent multiphasic contrast-enhanced MRI. RESULTS: Forty patients underwent SBRT for the treatment of 41 renal tumors: clear cell renal cell carcinomas (RCCs) (n = 16), papillary RCCs (n = 6), oncocytic neoplasms (n = 8), unclassified RCCs (n = 2), urothelial carcinoma (n = 1), and no pathologic diagnosis (n = 8). The mean maximum tumor diameter before treatment was 3.9 cm (range, 1.6-8.3 cm). Three hundred thirty-eight pre- and posttreatment imaging studies were analyzed: 214 MRI studies and 124 CT studies. The mean pre- and posttreatment lengths of observation were 416 days (range, 2-1800 days) and 561 days (83-1366 days), respectively. The mean pretreatment tumor growth rate of 0.68 cm/y decreased to -0.37 cm/y post treatment (p < 0.0001), and the mean tumor volume growth rate of 21.2 cm(3)/y before treatment decreased to -5.35 cm(3)/y after treatment (p = 0.002). Local control-defined as less than 5 mm of growth-was achieved in 38 of 41 (92.7%) tumors. The Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 showed progression in one tumor (2.4%), stability in 31 tumors (75.6%), partial response in eight tumors (19.5%), and complete response in one tumor (2.4%). No statistically significant change in tumor enhancement was shown (mean follow-up, 142 days; range, 7-581 days). CONCLUSION: Renal tumors treated with SBRT show statistically significant reductions in growth rate and tumor size after treatment but do not show statistically significant differences in enhancement in the initial (mean, 142 days) posttreatment period.
26898937	Novel fusion transcripts in bladder cancer identified by RNA-seq.	Urothelial carcinoma (UC) is the most common type of bladder cancer and is the second most frequently diagnosed genitourinary tumor. The identification of fusion genes in bladder cancer might provide new perspectives for its classification and significance. In this study, we present a thorough search on three UC samples for novel fusion transcripts in bladder cancer using high-throughput RNA sequencing. We used stringent requirements for 819 fusion candidates and nominated 10 candidate fusion transcripts. Among them four novel fusion genes SEPT9/CYHR, IGF1R/TTC23, SYT8/TNNI2 and CASZ1/DFFA were validated and characterized in 48 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) specimens of bladder cancer. Chromosomal rearrangements of regions 17q25, 15q26.3 and 1p36.22 resulting in the fusion transcripts SEPT9/CYHR, IGF1R/TTC23 and CASZ1/DFFA, appeared to be rare or unique events because they were not detected in the 48 UC samples. In contrast, the SYT8/TNNI2 fusion transcript resulting from transcription-induced chimerism by read-through mechanisms was a rather common and tumor-specific event occurring in 37.5% (18/48) of the UC specimens. Further investigation of functional and clinical relevance of novel fusion genes remains to be elucidated to reveal their role in bladder carcinogenesis.
26897774	[MULTICENTER EXPERIENCE WITH ALLIUM URETERAL STENT FOR THE TREATMENT OF URETERAL STRICTURE AND FISTULA].	INTRODUCTION: Chronic ureteral stricture and ureteral fistula are treated with urinary diversion using percutaneous nephrostomy or double pigtail stent. Both of these techniques require replacement of the tube every few months in order to prevent encrustations and obstruction. OBJECTIVES: To report the long-term efficacy of the new Allium Ureteral Stent (URS) in the treatment of ureteral stricture and fistula. METHODS: The Allium URS is a newly-developed ureteral stent made of nickel-titanium (Nitinol), which is inserted in a small diameter and spontaneously expands into and preserves a large-caliber. The stent is coated with a biochemical co-polymer which prevents tissue ingrowth and incrustations. The stent is inserted antegradely or retrogradely with intraoperative x-ray guidance after dilation of the stricture. The Allium URS stent was inserted into 107 ureters of 92 patients in 5 different centers worldwide; 69 patients carried a percutaneous nephrostomy before the procedure and 38 patients had a ureteral stent. The etiologies underlying the strictures were: gynecological cancer (with or without irradiation), bladder cancer, iatrogenic stricture, ureteroileal stenosis, stricture following uretero-pelvic junction obstruction repair and iatrogenic ureteral fistula. RESULTS: During a mean follow-up of 27 months, only one stent was obstructed after eleven-indwelling months; 21 patients died of their primary disease carrying the stent. Stent migration was seen in 11 patients within 8 months after its insertion, and these stents were removed. In 4 patients with early stent migration, the stents were replaced. In 18 patients the stents were removed as planned after one year of indwelling time, and these patients were asymptomatic in a follow-up period of up to 59 months. CONCLUSION: The results of our study show that the use of Allium URS for the treatment of ureteral strictures is feasible, safe and effective. The relative ease of its insertion could encourage its use in a wide range of other indications. DISCUSSION: Due to its unique structure, the Allium URS is superior to the regular pigtail stents in the treatment of ureteral strictures. Stent migration was seen in only 10.7% of the patients, mainly in patients with stricture of the mid-ureter. SUMMARY: The use of the Allium URS stent in the treatment of proximal and distaL ureteral strictures is safe and effective.
26897070	Detection of bladder metabolic artifacts in (18)F-FDG PET imaging.	Positron emission tomography using (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose ((18)F-FDG-PET) is a widely used imaging modality in oncology. It enables significant functional information to be included in analyses of anatomical data provided by other image modalities. Although PET offers high sensitivity in detecting suspected malignant metabolism, (18)F-FDG uptake is not tumor-specific and can also be fixed in surrounding healthy tissue, which may consequently be mistaken as cancerous. PET analyses may be particularly hampered in pelvic-located cancers by the bladders physiological uptake potentially obliterating the tumor uptake. In this paper, we propose a novel method for detecting (18)F-FDG bladder artifacts based on a multi-feature double-step classification approach. Using two manually defined seeds (tumor and bladder), the method consists of a semi-automated double-step clustering strategy that simultaneously takes into consideration standard uptake values (SUV) on PET, Hounsfield values on computed tomography (CT), and the distance to the seeds. This method was performed on 52 PET/CT images from patients treated for locally advanced cervical cancer. Manual delineations of the bladder on CT images were used in order to evaluate bladder uptake detection capability. Tumor preservation was evaluated using a manual segmentation of the tumor, with a threshold of 42% of the maximal uptake within the tumor. Robustness was assessed by randomly selecting different initial seeds. The classification averages were 0.94+/-0.09 for sensitivity, 0.98+/-0.01 specificity, and 0.98+/-0.01 accuracy. These results suggest that this method is able to detect most (18)F-FDG bladder metabolism artifacts while preserving tumor uptake, and could thus be used as a pre-processing step for further non-parasitized PET analyses.
26895703	Small-area spatio-temporal analyses of bladder and kidney cancer risk in Nova Scotia, Canada.	BACKGROUND: Bladder and kidney cancers are the ninth and twelfth most common type of cancer worldwide, respectively. Internationally, rates vary ten-fold, with several countries showing rising incidence. This study describes the spatial and spatio-temporal variations in the incidence risk of these diseases for Nova Scotia, a province located in Atlantic Canada, where rates for bladder and kidney cancer exceed those of the national average by about 25% and 35%, respectively. METHODS: Cancer incidence in the 311 Communities of Nova-Scotia was analyzed with a spatial autoregressive model for the case counts of bladder and kidney cancers (3,232 and 2,143 total cases, respectively), accounting for each Community's population and including variables known to influence risk. A spatially-continuous analysis, using a geostatistical Local Expectation-Maximization smoothing algorithm, modeled finer-scale spatial variation in risk for south-western Nova Scotia (1,810 bladder and 957 kidney cases) and Cape Breton (1,101 bladder, 703 kidney). RESULTS: Evidence of spatial variations in the risk of bladder and kidney cancer was demonstrated using both aggregated Community-level mapping and continuous-grid based localized mapping; and these were generally stable over time. The Community-level analysis suggested that much of this heterogeneity was not accounted for by known explanatory variables. There appears to be a north-east to south-west increasing gradient with a number of south-western Communities have risk of bladder or kidney cancer more than 10% above the provincial average. Kidney cancer risk was also elevated in various northeastern communities. Over a 12 year period this exceedance translated in an excess of 200 cases. Patterns of variations in risk obtained from the spatially continuous smoothing analysis generally mirrored those from the Community-level autoregressive model, although these more localized risk estimates resulted in a larger spatial extent for which risk is likely to be elevated. CONCLUSIONS: Modelling the spatio-temporal distribution of disease risk enabled the quantification of risk relative to expected background levels and the identification of high risk areas. It also permitted the determination of the relative stability of the observed patterns over time and in this study, pointed to excess risk potentially driven by exposure to risk factors that act in a sustained manner over time.
26895479	The use of personal hair dye and its implications for human health.	Hair dye products now represent one of the most rapidly growing beauty and personal care industries as both men and women commonly change hair color to enhance youth and beauty and to follow fashion trends. Irrespective of economic and education status, people dye their hair to emphasize the importance given to appearance. Despite adverse reactions, many people continue dyeing mainly for cosmetic purposes. This paper provides a comprehensive review on various aspects of hair dying products, especially with respect to the hair-coloring process, classification, chemical ingredients, possible human health impacts, and regulations. Permanent hair dye, which is the most commonly used product type, is formed by an oxidative process involving arylamines to bring about concerns with long-term exposure. Hence, significant efforts have been put to understand the possible side effects of such exposure including cancer risk. However, hair dyes and their ingredients are mainly identified to have moderate to low acute toxicity such as the cause of allergic contact dermatitis. Although some hair dye components are reported to be carcinogenic in animals, such evidence is not consistent enough in the case of human studies. Consequently, further research is desirable to critically address the significance of this issue, especially with respect to the safety of hair dye ingredients.
26894333	Treatment optimization with concurrent SBRT and intracavitary brachytherapy for locally advanced cervical cancer.	This work is aimed at investigating treatment planning strategies to optimally com-bine stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) with intracavitary brachytherapy (ICBT) for the treatment of locally advanced cervical cancer. Forty patients (stage IIB - IIIB) previously treated with combined SBRT and ICBT were randomly selected for this retrospective study. All patients were CT- and MR-scanned with a ring applicator in situ. HR-CTV and OARs were contoured according to fused CT and MR images. Several ICBT plans were generated for each patient based on different dose prescription points, and then a matching SBRT plan was generated for each ICBT plan. The dose distribution of each composite plan was analyzed with a focus on the doses received by 90% and 100% of the target volume (D90 and D100), the target volume receiving 100% of the prescription dose (V100%), and the doses received by 2 cc and 40% of the OARs (D2 cc and D40). As the distance, d, between the prescription point and the tandem varied within 1.0 and 1.9 cm, the D90, D100 and V100% for the target, as well as D2 cc and D40 for the bladder and rectum approached their optimal values for d value between 1.0 and 1.4 cm. When design-ing a combined ICBT + SBRT plan, one should measure the size of the cervix and set the prescription isodose line 1.0 to 1.4 cm away from the tandem for the ICBT plan first and then optimize the SBRT plan based on the ICBT dose distribution to achieve the best target coverage and critical structures sparing.
26894268	Tumor Suppressor in Lung Cancer-1 Is a Prognostic Predictor for the Recurrence and Progression of Non-Muscle-Invasive Bladder Cancer.	OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between the expression of tumor suppressor in lung cancer-1 (TSLC1) and clinicopathological characteristics of patients with non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) and evaluate the prognostic significance of TSLC1. METHODS: TSLC1 expression in 241 specimens of NMIBC was examined by immunohistochemistry. The correlation between TSLC1 expression and clinicopathological characteristics was evaluated using the chi-square test. The prognostic significance of TSLC1 was analyzed by univariate, multivariate analysis and Kaplan-Meier survival curves. RESULTS: The total negative rate of TSLC1 expression was 47.3% in NMIBC. Decreased expression of TSLC1 was correlated with a higher clinical stage, higher pathological grade, the number of tumors, lager tumor size, tumor recurrence and progression. TSLC1 expression was an independent risk factor for predicting tumor recurrence (p = 0.005) and progression (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Decreased expression of TSLC1 is correlated with the malignancy of NMIBC tissues and low TSLC1 expression may serve as a predictor for bladder cancer recurrence and progression.
26893557	Heterogeneous response of different tumor cell lines to methotrexate-coupled nanoparticles in presence of hyperthermia.	Today, the therapeutic efficacy of cancer is restricted by the heterogeneity of the response of tumor cells to chemotherapeutic drugs. Since those therapies are also associated with severe side effects in nontarget organs, the application of drugs in combination with nanocarriers for targeted therapy has been suggested. Here, we sought to assess whether the coupling of methotrexate (MTX) to magnetic nanoparticles (MNP) could serve as a valuable tool to circumvent the heterogeneity of tumor cell response to MTX by the combined treatment with hyperthermia. To this end, we investigated five breast cancer cell lines of different origin and with different mutational statuses, as well as a bladder cancer cell line in terms of their response to exposure to MTX as a free drug or after its coupling to MNP as well as in presence/absence of hyperthermia. We also assessed whether the effects could be connected to the cell line-specific expression of proteins related to the uptake and efflux of MTX and MNP. Our results revealed a very heterogeneous and cell line-dependent response to an exposure with MTX-coupled MNP (MTX-MNP), which was almost comparable to the efficacy of free MTX in the same cell line. Moreover, a cell line-specific and preferential uptake of MTX-MNP compared with MNP alone was found (probably by receptor-mediated endocytosis), agreeing with the observed cytotoxic effects. Opposed to this, the expression pattern of several cell membrane transport proteins noted for MTX uptake and efflux was only by tendency in agreement with the cellular toxicity of MTX-MNP in different cell lines. Higher cytotoxic effects were achieved by exposing cells to a combination of MTX-MNP and hyperthermal treatment, compared with MTX or thermo-therapy alone. However, the heterogeneity in the response of the tumor cell lines to MTX could not be completely abolished - even after its combination with MNP and/or hyperthermia - and the application of higher thermal dosages might be necessary.
26892153	Morphologic, Immunophenotypic, and Molecular Features of Epithelial Ovarian Cancer.	Epithelial ovarian cancer comprises a heterogeneous group of tumors. The four most common subtypes are serous, endometrioid, clear cell, and mucinous carcinoma. Less common are transitional cell tumors, including transitional cell carcinoma and malignant Brenner tumor. While in the past these subtypes were grouped together and designated as epithelial ovarian tumors, these tumor types are now known to be separate entities with distinct clinical and biologic behaviors. From a therapeutic standpoint, current regimens employ standard chemotherapy based on stage and grade rather than histotype. However, this landscape may change in the era of personalized therapy, given that most subtypes (with the exception of high-grade serous carcinoma) are relatively resistant to chemotherapy. It is now well-accepted that high-grade and low-grade serous carcinomas represent distinct entities rather than a spectrum of the same tumor type. While they are similar in that patients present with advanced-stage disease, their histologic and molecular features are entirely different. High-grade serous carcinoma is associated with TP53 mutations, whereas low-grade serous carcinomas are associated with BRAF and KRAS mutations. Endometrioid and clear cell carcinomas typically present as early-stage disease and are frequently associated with endometriosis. Mucinous carcinomas typically present as large unilateral masses and often show areas of mucinous cystadenoma and mucinous borderline tumor. It must be emphasized that primary mucinous carcinomas are uncommon tumors, and metastasis from other sites such as the appendix, colon, stomach, and pancreaticobiliary tract must always be considered in the differential diagnosis. Lastly, transitional cell tumors of the ovary, specifically malignant Brenner tumors, are quite uncommon. High-grade serous carcinoma often has a transitional cell pattern, and adequate sampling in most cases shows more typical areas of serous carcinoma. Immunohistochemical markers are routinely employed in the diagnosis of epithelial ovarian carcinomas. However, molecular testing of these tumors, unlike in endometrial carcinoma, is not routinely used in clinical practice.
26892061	Primary malignant melanoma of the urinary bladder and ureter.	Primary malignant melanoma of the urinary bladder is a rare lesion. We report the case of a 78-year-old male with no previous history of cutaneous melanoma who presented with hematuria. Further investigation with imaging and cystoscopy raised suspicion of a primary bladder and ureteric melanoma, which had subsequently metastasized. This was confirmed with histological assessment and a thorough search for alternative primary lesions. Unfortunately, our patient passed away prior to receiving any oncological treatment for his metastatic melanoma, underscoring both the high mortality of this lesion and the need for a consensus on definitive treatment.
26889680	Analytical Performance of ELISA Assays in Urine: One More Bottleneck towards Biomarker Validation and Clinical Implementation.	ELISA is the main approach for the sensitive quantification of protein biomarkers in body fluids and is currently employed in clinical laboratories for the measurement of clinical markers. As such, it also constitutes the main methodological approach for biomarker validation and further qualification. For the latter, specific assay performance requirements have to be met, as described in respective guidelines of regulatory agencies. Even though many clinical ELISA assays in serum are regularly used, ELISA clinical applications in urine are significantly less. The scope of our study was to evaluate ELISA assay analytical performance in urine for a series of potential biomarkers for bladder cancer, as a first step towards their large scale clinical validation. Seven biomarkers (Secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine, Survivin, Slit homolog 2 protein, NRC-Interacting Factor 1, Histone 2B, Proteinase-3 and Profilin-1) previously described in the literature as having differential expression in bladder cancer were included in the study. A total of 11 commercially available ELISA tests for these markers were tested by standard curve analysis, assay reproducibility, linearity and spiking experiments. The results show disappointing performance with coefficients of variation>20% for the vast majority of the tests performed. Only 3 assays (for Secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine, Survivin and Slit homolog 2 protein) passed the accuracy thresholds and were found suitable for further application in marker quantification. These results collectively reflect the difficulties in developing urine-based ELISA assays of sufficient analytical performance for clinical application, presumably attributed to the urine matrix itself and/or presence of markers in various isoforms.
26891233	Carcinosarcoma of the upper urinary tract with an aggressive angiosarcoma component.	Carcinosarcomas (CS) are biphasic tumors with malignant epithelial and mesenchymal elements. The sarcomatoid elements of CS can include chondrosarcoma, malignant fibrous histiocytoma, osteosarcoma, leiomyosarcoma, fibrosarcoma, or liposarcoma. CS of the upper urinary tract are extremely rare but are associated with a poor prognosis. We report a case of a 44-year-old man with a localized right renal pelvis mass treated with a right nephroureterectomy. The pathological examination showed a high-grade urothelial carcinoma of the renal pelvis, stage III (pT3aNxM0). A few days later, he developed lower back pain, hematuria, cough with hemoptoic sputum and progressive dyspnea. Radiological explorations showed multiple bilateral lung nodules and a retroperitoneal mass. A CT-guided biopsy of the retroperitoneal mass revealed a high-grade angiosarcoma. A review of the nephrectomy specimen showed a microscopic focus of angiosarcoma in the urothelial carcinoma. Therefore, the initial diagnosis was changed to CS of the renal pelvis with an angiosarcoma component. The patient developed progressive respiratory failure and died 8 weeks after surgery. An autopsy revealed a large retroperitoneal mass with metastatic nodules to the abdominal wall, diaphragm, small intestine, liver, spleen, and lung. All lesions were angiosarcoma, with no evidence of urothelial carcinoma. This is the first case reported of a patient with CS of the upper urinary tract with an angiosarcoma component with a very aggressive course that caused the immediate appearance of multiple angiosarcoma metastases. We also describe the clinical and molecular characteristics of CS, which will help to contribute to a better understanding of this type of tumor.
26889312	Cavernous hemangioma of the bladder: an additional case managed by partial cystectomy and augmentation cystoplasty.	Cavernous Hemangioma of the Bladder (CHB) is benign and rare lesions. Clinical presentation has no pathognomonic signs although gross painless hematuria is the most frequent complain. CHB is suspected by cystoscopy and radiologic findings and confirmed by pathologic examinations. Management is controversial due to the bleeding risk of this highly vascularized lesion. Partial cystectomy is the treatment of choice for surgically accessible lesions. However, it appears that small lesions could be treated using transurethral resection. Since CHB is a rare case, we report another case treated successfully with a partial cystectomy associated with an augmentation cystoplasy.
26887985	Prognostic role of urinary collecting system invasion in renal cell carcinoma: a systematic review and meta-analysis.	The relationship between urinary collecting system invasion (UCSI) and oncological outcomes in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) patients has attracted extensive attention recent years. However, the reports were inconsistent and remain controversial. Thus, we performed a systematic literature search of PubMed, Embase, Web of Science and The Cochrane Library databases to identify relevant studies up to June 2015 and conducted a standard meta-analysis of survival outcomes. 17 studies containing 9012 RCC patients satisfied the inclusion criteria. Pooled HRs for overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) were 1.45 (95%CI, 1.26-1.66, P < 0.001) and 2.27 (95% CI, 1.54-3.34, P < 0.001), respectively. Further subgroup analysis suggested that UCSI was significant associated with poor cancer-specific survival (CSS) in stage T1-T2 RCC (HR = 2.05, 95%CI: 1.43-2.96, P < 0.001) but not in stage T3-T4 tumors (HR = 1.08, 95%CI: 0.63-1.85, P = 0.771). Current evidence revealed that UCSI has a significant negative impact on OS and RFS in RCC patients and could be used to predict CSS especially in localized RCC. Thus, RCC patients with UCSI should be paid more attention by clinician and pathologist and require close follow up for their poor prognosis.
26887872	[Long-term oncological outcomes after laparoscopic versus abdominal radical hysterectomy in stage I a2- II a2 cervical cancer: a matched cohort study].	OBJECTIVE: To investigate the long- term oncological outcomes of laparoscopic radical hysterectomy (LRH) plus lymph node dissection (LND) and abdominal radical hysterectomy (ARH) plus LND for patients with stage Ia2-IIa2 cervical cancer. METHODS: A retrospective review of stage Ia2- II a2 cervical cancer patients who underwent LRH + LND (n=372) and ARH + LND (n=434) at the First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat- sen University from Jan. 2005 to Aug. 2013 was performed. Individual patient matching was performed by the risk factors for recurrence [tumor size, lymph vascular space invasion (LVSI), depth of cervical stromal invasion, lymph node metastasis, parametrial involvement, and resection margin involvement] between two groups. After matched, a total of 203 patient pairs (LRH- ARH) were enrolled. The survival data, surgery data, intraoperative and postoperative complications were compared between the two groups. To assess the prognosis factors, the univariate and multivariate Cox's proportional hazards model analysis were conducted. Stratified analysis was performed based on the independent prognosis factors to investigate the survival data between the two surgery groups. RESULTS: (1) Surgery data: The operating time [(239+/-44) vs (270+/-42) minutes], estimated blood loss [(210+/-129) vs (428+/-320) ml], the duration of bowel motility return [(2.0+/-0.8) vs (3.0+/-1.6) days] and hospital stay [(11+/-6) vs (13+/-6) days] in the LRH group were significantly shorter than those in ARH group (all P<0.01). (2) Intraoperative and postoperative complications: The intraoperative complications rate was similar betweentwo groups [6.4%(13/203) vs 6.9%(14/203), P=1.000]. The rate of postoperative complications (excluded bladder dysfunction) in the LRH group were significantly lower than those in the ARH group [9.4% (19/203) vs 20.2% (41/203), P=0.002]. While there was no significant difference in the rates of bladder dysfunction between two groups [36.5% (74/203) vs 37.4% (76/203), P=0.910]. (3) Recurrence and survival data: There was no significant difference in the recurrence rates between the LRH group and ARH groups [7.9% (16/203) vs 9.4% (19/203), P=0.850]. There were similar 5-year recurrence-free survival (RFS; 92.1% vs 91.1%, P=0.790) and 5-year overall survival (OS; 93.7% vs 96.1%, P=0.900). (4) Prognosis factor: In univariate analysis, the results showed that tumor size, International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage, adjuvant therapy, LVSI, stromal invasion, parametrium invasion, pelvic lymph node metastasis, and para-aortic lymph node metastasis were significantly associated with poor prognosis (all P<0.01). However, age, body mass index (BMI), surgery type, histological type, grade were not significantly associated with poor prognosis (all P>0.05). The multivariate analysis results, showed that tumor size, pelvic lymph node metastasis,and para- aortic lymph node metastasis were significantly associated with poor prognosis (all P<0.01). Stratified analysis showed that, even in patients with tumor size >4 cm, pelvic lymph node metastasis positive, and para-aortic lymph node metastasis positive in all subgroups, there were not significant difference for the estimated 5-year RFS and 5-year OS between LRH and ARH group (all P>0.05). CONCLUSION: For patients with stage Ia2-IIa2 cervical cancer, LRH plus lymph node dissection is an oncologically safe and surgical feasible alternative to ARH.
26887772	[Ovarian clear cell carcinoma derived from endometriotic cyst: a clinicopathological analysis of 54 cases].	OBJECTIVE: To clarify the clinicopathological features of ovarian clear cell carcinoma derived from endometriotic cyst (EC-OCCC). METHODS: Totally 54 cases of EC-OCCC were recruited in the current retrospective study. The relation between ages, clinical symptoms and signs, surgical and pathological stages, serum CA125, findings of ultrasound, treatments and the sites of tumors, macro- and micro-features and expression of immunostainings were analyzed. RESULTS: (1) Clinical features: the ages of patients were (50+/-6) years old (range 31-62 years old). Pelvic mass was the major complaint of 50 patients (93% , 50/54). Forty-five cases belonged to International federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage I, 4 cases were stage II and another 5 cases were stage III. Serum CA125 was elevated in 21 cases (54%, 21/39) before therapy. Doppler ultrasound showed 46 cases (85%, 46/54) had solid masses in pelvis. (2) Pathological findings: 52 cases (96%, 52/54) had their tumor unilaterally, and 2 cases (4%, 2/54) occurred bilaterally. The maximal diameters of endometriotic cyst (EC) ranged from 1.5 to 23.0 cm and maximal diameters of ovarian clear cell carcinoma (OCCC) components were from 0.5 to 12.0 cm. Fifty-one cases (94%, 51/54) had their tumor within EC, which showed focally irregular protrudings, grey-white papillae or solid nodules attached to the cyst wall. Three cases (6%, 3/54) appeared as irregular thickened wall of the cysts, ranged from 1.5 to 6.0 cm in the maximal length, with the microscopic features of EC and OCCC and the transitional areas between the 2 morphologies. All cases expressed cytokeratin (CK) 7 and pan-CK AE1/AE3, 17 cases (33%, 17/51) expressed ER and 5 cases (10%, 5/51) expressed PR. TP53 showed mutational phenotype in 19 cases (36%, 19/53). Sixteen cases (30%, 16/54) combined with uterine adenomyosis and 25 cases (46%, 25/54) with endometriosis at other sites. (3) Survival survey: during the period of 39.1 months follow-up, 3 cases relapsed and 2 cases died. (4) There was a significant difference of serum CA125 between patients of early-and advanced-stages (P=0.049). There were no differences identified in ages, diameters of EC and OCCC, the expression level of ER, PR and TP53, the co-existence of adenomyosis and endometrosis, as well as ultrasonic findings (P>0.05). CONCLUSION: EC-OCCC could be recognized in early stage by symptoms and ultrasound due to accompanied endometriotic cysts, resulting in relatively good prognosis.
26887348	The impact of KRAS mutations on prognosis in surgically resected colorectal cancer patients with liver and lung metastases: a retrospective analysis.	BACKGROUND: KRAS mutations are common in colorectal cancer (CRC). The role of KRAS mutation status as a prognostic factor remains controversial, and most large population-based cohorts usually consist of patients with non-metastatic CRC. We evaluated the impact of KRAS mutations on the time to recurrence (TTR) and overall survival (OS) in patients with metastatic CRC who underwent curative surgery with perioperative chemotherapy. METHODS: Patients who underwent curative resection for primary and synchronous metastases were retrospectively collected in a single institution during a 6 year period between January 2008 and June 2014. Patients with positive surgical margins, those with known BRAF mutation, or those with an unknown KRAS mutation status were excluded, and a total of 82 cases were identified. The pathological and clinical features were evaluated. Patients' outcome with KRAS mutation status for TTR and OS were investigated by univariate and multivariate analysis. RESULTS: KRAS mutations were identified in 37.8% of the patients and not associated with TTR or OS between KRAS wild type and KRAS mutation cohorts (log-rank p = 0.425 for TTR; log-rank p = 0.137 for OS). When patients were further subdivided into three groups according to mutation subtype (wild-type vs. KRAS codon 12 mutation vs. KRAS codon 13 mutation) or amino acid missense mutation type (G > A vs. G > T vs. G > C), there were no significant differences in TTR or OS. Mutational frequencies were significantly higher in patients with lung metastases compared with those with liver and ovary/bladder metastases (p = 0.039), however, KRAS mutation status was not associated with an increased risk of relapsed in the lung. CONCLUSIONS: KRAS mutation was not associated with TTR or OS in patients with metastatic CRC who underwent curative surgery with perioperative chemotherapy.
26887180	[NURSING CARE TO A PATIENT WITH INTRAVESICAL TREATMENT].	INTRODUCTION: Bladder cancer is one of the most frequent in developed countries. It is the 4th most frequent cancer in men and the 9th in women. The main risk factor is the smoking habit and its main symptom is hematuria. One of the therapies used in its treatment is the Bacillus Calmette-Guerin intravesical (BCG). OBJECTIVE: TO carry out a specific care plan to a patient treated with BCG and improve the information delivered to the patient and family. MATERIAL AND METHODS: An observational study of a nursing plan of care through a clinical case. A bibliographical research was carried out in the main Spanish and English databases to collect articles published in the last 5 years. Subsequently, the studies of the Spanish M.a T Luis, C. Ferndndez and M.a V. Navarro were adopted in the model suggested by V. Henderson and NANDA, NIC and NOC taxonomy. RESULTS: The nursing assessment is performed through V. Henderson's 14 needs and the Collaboration Problem was detected: Hematuria, secondary to bladder cancer and the nursing diagnosis: <<Disposition to improve the management of the own health expressed by the wish of managing the disease>>. For the planning and execution the following NOC were selected: Knowledge: management of the cancer and Knowledge: therapeutic procedure, and the NIC and its corresponding activities and their evaluation. CONCLUSION: The Nursing Care Process application with a personalised and standardised language, guarantees a quality healthcare and continuity. Moreover, it sets common targets for the nursing team. It tries to show how an appropriate control of the symptoms can be carried out at home, when the cares are taught and organised by adapting the oral or written information to each patient.
26886598	Absence of Bladder Outlet Obstruction Is an Independent Risk Factor for Prostate Cancer in Men Undergoing Prostate Biopsy.	The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between bladder outlet obstruction (BOO) and the risk of being diagnosed with prostate cancer (PCa).Study population consisted of 2673 patients scheduled for the first prostate biopsy (PBx). All patients underwent uroflowmetry before PBx; those with a peak flow rate (PFR) <10 mL/s were considered to have BOO.The incidence of PCa was 41.3% (1104/2673) in the overall population and 34.1% (659/1905) in patients with serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) </= 10 ng/mL. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses showed that patients with BOO had a significantly (P < 0.0001) lower risk than those without BOO of being diagnosed with PCa (33.1% vs 66.9% in the overall population; 30% vs 70% in patients with PSA </= 10 ng/mL). As the presence of BOO was significantly correlated to a large prostate volume, another independent predictor of PBx outcome, we tested whether these parameters could be used to identify, in the subset of patients with PSA</=10 ng/mL, those who could potentially be spared from a PBx. If we would have not biopsied patients with BOO and prostate volume >/=60 mL, 14.5% of biopsies could have been avoided while missing only 6% of tumors. Only 10% of the tumors that would have been missed were high-risk cancers.In conclusion, in men undergoing PBx, the absence of BOO, as determined by a PFR >/=10 mL/s, is an independent risk factor for PCa. Our study provides ground for this simple, noninvasive, objective parameter being used, alone or in combination with prostate volume, in the decision-making process of men potentially facing a PBx.
26884578	Burden of Geriatric Events Among Older Adults Undergoing Major Cancer Surgery.	PURPOSE: Most malignancies are diagnosed in older adults who are potentially susceptible to aging-related health conditions; however, the manifestation of geriatric syndromes during surgical cancer treatment is not well quantified. Accordingly, we sought to assess the prevalence and ramifications of geriatric events during major surgery for cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Using Nationwide Inpatient Sample data from 2009 to 2011, we examined hospital admissions for major cancer surgery among elderly patients (ie, age >/= 65 years) and a referent group age 55 to 64 years. From these observations, we identified geriatric events that included delirium, dehydration, falls and fractures, failure to thrive, and pressure ulcers. We then estimated the collective prevalence of these events according to age, comorbidity, and cancer site and further explored their relationship with other hospital-based outcomes. RESULTS: Within a weighted sample of 939,150 patients, we identified at least one event in 9.2% of patients. Geriatric events were most common among patients age >/= 75 years, with a Charlson comorbidity score >/= 2, and who were undergoing surgery for cancer of the bladder, ovary, colon and/or rectum, pancreas, or stomach (P < .001). Adjusting for patient and hospital characteristics, those patients who experienced a geriatric event had a greater likelihood of concurrent complications (odds ratio [OR], 3.73; 95% CI, 3.55 to 3.92), prolonged hospitalization (OR, 5.47; 95% CI, 5.16 to 5.80), incurring high cost (OR, 4.97; 95% CI, 4.58 to 5.39), inpatient mortality (OR, 3.22; 95% CI, 2.94 to 3.53), and a discharge disposition other than home (OR, 3.64; 95% CI, 3.46 to 3.84). CONCLUSION: Many older patients who receive cancer-directed surgery experience a geriatric event, particularly those who undergo major abdominal surgery. These events are linked to operative morbidity, prolonged hospitalization, and more expensive health care. As our population ages, efforts focused on addressing conditions and complications that are more common in older adults will be essential to delivering high-quality cancer care.
26883632	The landscape of somatic mutations in protein coding genes in apparently benign human tissues carries signatures of relaxed purifying selection.	Mutations acquired during development and aging lead to inter- and intra-tissue genetic variations. Evidence linking such mutations to complex traits and diseases is rising. We detected somatic mutations in protein-coding regions in 140 benign tissue samples representing nine tissue-types (bladder, breast, liver, lung, prostate, stomach, thyroid, head and neck) and paired blood from 70 donors. A total of 80% of the samples had 2-39 mutations detectable at tissue-level resolution. Factors such as age and smoking were associated with increased burden of detectable mutations, and tissues carried signatures of distinct mutagenic processes such as oxidative DNA damage and transcription-coupled repair. Using mutational signatures, we predicted that majority of the mutations in blood originated in hematopoietic stem and early progenitor cells. Missense to silent mutations ratio and the persistence of potentially damaging mutations in expressed genes carried signatures of relaxed purifying selection. Our findings have relevance for etiology, diagnosis and treatment of diseases including cancer.
26883573	Cigarette smoke extract induces the proliferation of normal human urothelial cells through the NF-kappaB pathway.	Bladder cancer is a common genitourinary malignant disease worldwide. Convincing evidence shows that cigarette smoke (CS) is a crucial risk factor for bladder cancer, yet the role of the NF-kappaB signaling pathway in the development of CS-associated bladder cancer has not been fully elucidated. In the present study, we found that exposure to cigarette smoke extract (CSE) induced proliferation and triggered the transition of normal human urothelial cells from G1 to S phase. Moreover, CSE exposure enhanced the expression of cyclin D1 and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and decreased the expression of p21 in SV-HUC-1 cells. Furthermore, the levels of nuclear NF-kappaB p65/p50 were significantly elevated by CSE. Pre-treatment with the NF-kappaB inhibitor (PDTC) reversed CSE-triggered cell proliferation. Taken together, our study revealed that CSE induced proliferation of normal human urothelial cells through the NF-kappaB pathway, and these data enhance our understanding of the CSE-related carcinogenesis of bladder cancer.
26883564	Vaginal Dose Is Associated With Toxicity in Image Guided Tandem Ring or Ovoid-Based Brachytherapy.	PURPOSE: To calculate vaginal doses during image guided brachytherapy with volume-based metrics and correlate with long-term vaginal toxicity. METHODS AND MATERIALS: In this institutional review board-approved study, institutional databases were searched to identify women undergoing computed tomography and/or magnetic resonance-guided brachytherapy at the Duke Cancer Center from 2009 to 2015. All insertions were contoured to include the vagina as a 3-dimensional structure. All contouring was performed on computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging and used a 0.4-cm fixed brush to outline the applicator and/or packing, expanded to include any grossly visible vagina. The surface of the cervix was specifically excluded from the contour. High-dose-rate (HDR) and low-dose-rate (LDR) doses were converted to the equivalent dose in 2-Gy fractions using an alpha/beta of 3 for late effects. The parameters D0.1cc, D1cc, and D2cc were calculated for all insertions and summed with prior external beam therapy. Late and subacute toxicity to the vagina were determined by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0 and compared by the median and 4th quartile doses, via the log-rank test. Univariate and multivariate hazard ratios were calculated via Cox regression. RESULTS: A total of 258 insertions in 62 women who underwent definitive radiation therapy including brachytherapy for cervical (n=48) and uterine cancer (n=14) were identified. Twenty HDR tandem and ovoid, 32 HDR tandem and ring, and 10 LDR tandem and ovoid insertions were contoured. The median values (interquartile ranges) for vaginal D0.1cc, D1cc, and D2cc were 157.9 (134.4-196.53) Gy, 112.6 (96.7-124.6) Gy, and 100.5 (86.8-108.4) Gy, respectively. At the 4th quartile cutoff of 108 Gy for D2cc, the rate of late grade 1 toxicity at 2 years was 61.2% (95% confidence interval [CI] 43.0%-79.4%) below 108 Gy and 83.9% (63.9%-100%) above (P=.018); grade 2 or greater toxicity was 36.2% (95% CI 15.8%-56.6%) below 108 Gy and 70.7% (95% CI 45.2%-96.2%) above (P=.004); and grade 3 or worse toxicity was 9.9% (95% CI 0.0%-23.6%) below 108 Gy and 30.0% (95% CI 4.7%-55.3%) above (P=.025). This association was maintained on multivariate analysis, independent of covariates such as applicator type, age, and dose rate. CONCLUSIONS: Vaginal dose was associated with all grades of vaginal toxicity. Confirmation at other sites using this methodology will be necessary to establish reproducibility; however, the integration of routine calculation of vaginal dose may be warranted.
26883396	The c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway is activated in human interstitial cystitis (IC) and rat protamine sulfate induced cystitis.	The pathogenesis of bladder pain syndrome/interstitial cystitis (BPS/IC) is currently unclear. However, inflammation has been suggested to play an important role in BPS/IC. JNK downstream signaling plays an important role in numerous chronic inflammatory diseases. However, studies of the JNK pathway in BPS/IC are limited. In this study, we investigated the role of the JNK pathway in human BPS/IC and rat protamine sulfate (PS)-induced cystitis and examined the effect of the selective JNK inhibitor SP600125 on rat bladder cystitis. In our study, we demonstrated that the JNK signaling pathway was activated (the expression of JNK, c-Jun, p-JNK, p-c-Jun, IL-6 and TNF-alpha were significantly increasing in BPS/IC compared to the non-BPS/IC patients) and resulted in inflammation in human BPS/IC. Further animal models showed that the JNK pathway played an important role in the pathogenesis of cystitis. JNK inhibitors, SP600125, effectively inhibited the expression of p-JNK, p-c-Jun, IL-6 and TNF-alpha. The inhibition of these pathways had a protective effect on PS-induced rat cystitis by significantly decreasing histological score and mast cell count and improving bladder micturition function (micturition frequency significantly decreasing and bladder capacity significantly increasing). Therefore, JNK inhibition could be used as a potential treatment for BPS/IC.
26883330	Single-phase DECT with VNCT compared with three-phase CTU in patients with haematuria.	OBJECTIVE: To retrospectively evaluate the diagnostic performance of single-phase dual-energy CT (DECT) with virtual non-contrast CT (VNCT) compared with three-phase CT urography (CTU) in patients with haematuria. METHODS: A total of 296 patients underwent three-phase CTU (NCT at 120 kVp; nephrographic phase and excretory phase DECTs at 140 kVp and 80 kVp) owing to haematuria. Diagnostic performances of CT scans were compared for detecting urothelial tumours and urinary stones. Dose-length product (DLP) was compared in relation to single-phase DECT and three-phase CTU Dose-length product (DLP) was compared in relation to single-phase DECT and three-phase CTU. RESULTS: Sensitivity and specificity for tumour were 95 % (19/20) and 98.9 % (273/276) on CTU, 95 % (19/20) and 98.2 % (271/276) on nephrographic phase DECT, and 90 % (18/20) and 98.2 % (271/276) on excretory phase DECT (P > 0.1). Of the 148 stones detected on NCT, 108 (73 %) and 100 (67.6 %) were detected on nephrographic phase and excretory phase VNCTs, respectively. The mean size of stones undetected on nephrographic and excretory VNCTs was measured as 1.5 +/- 0.5 mm and 1.6 +/- 0.6 mm, respectively. The mean DLPs of three-phase CTU, nephrographic phase DECT and excretory phase DECT were 1076 +/- 248 mGy . cm, 410 +/- 98 mGy . cm, and 360 +/- 87 mGy . cm, respectively (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Single-phase DECT has a potential to replace three-phase CTU for detecting tumours with a lower radiation dose. KEY POINTS: * Single-phase DECT with virtual NCT may replace three-phase CTU for detecting tumours. * Virtual NCT cannot replace NCT for detecting small urinary stones. * Single-phase DECT may reduce the radiation dose by 62-67 % compared to three-phase CTU. * Nephrographic phase DECT is superior to excretory phase DECT for assessing haematuria.

26882458	Evolution of the neobladder: A critical review of open and intracorporeal neobladder reconstruction techniques.	Orthotopic neobladder is an attractive alternative to the ileal conduit following radical cystectomy. Robotic cystectomy is gaining popularity although the uptake of neobladder reconstruction is low, with the majority of cases being constructed extracorporeally via a mini-laparotomy. Minimally invasive cystectomy using the robotic platform facilitates intracorporeal neobladder reconstruction and several techniques have been described. This review discusses issues relating to patient selection, and describes existing techniques of open surgical neobladder reconstruction and their evolution to suit an intracorporeal approach. A Medline search for publications from January 1970 to September 2015 with the following keyword search criteria was performed: radical cystectomy, robotic cystectomy, intracorporeal, neobladder, orthotopic bladder reconstruction, surgical technique, patient selection and ureteric-ileal anastomosis.
26881655	Space occupying lesion (paraganglioma) of the urinary bladder in a young male: A case report and brief review of the literature.	Urinary bladder paragangliomas are rare with a reported incidence of <1% of bladder tumors. In the absence of typical clinical features, histopathology helps in rendering definitive diagnosis. We describe a case of nonfunctional urinary bladder paraganglioma in a 28-year-old male who presented with the chief complaint of abdominal pain. The final diagnosis was made by histopathological and immunohistochemical analysis. It is important to distinguish paraganglioma from urothelial carcinoma as the treatment differs. This is an additional case of nonfunctional urinary bladder paraganglioma in a male patient with a brief review of the literature.
26881627	Adenocarcinoma of urinary bladder: A report of two patients.	Adenocarcinoma of the bladder is a rare tumor. Primary and metastatic adenocarcinomas of urinary bladder are morphologically similar, but histogenetically different. We present two cases, a signet ring cell adenocarcinoma with follow-up and another of glandular adenocarcinoma of urinary bladder. Pathological evaluation and immunohistochemical panel of eight markers (E-cadherin, CK20, CK7, CDX2, estrogen receptor (ER), gross cystic disease fluid protein 15 (GCDFP15), 34bE12, and prostate specific antigen (PSA) provides a diagnostic confirmation of primary adenocarcinoma with the positive expression of E-cadherin and CK20 in case 1 and metastatic adenocarcinoma of prostate with profile of E-cadherin+, CK20-, GCDFP15+, 34bE12+, and PSA+ in case 2.
26881605	Calcification in transitional cell carcinoma of urinary bladder: Does it have any implication on calcium metabolism and its management?	Although transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) is most common histological subtype, calcification in TCC is rarely seen. We report a 64-year-old gentleman who on evaluation found to have calcification in TCC of urinary bladder and its implication on calcium metabolism and management.
26881604	Disseminated tuberculosis in a patient with recurrent transitional cell carcinoma of renal pelvis and bladder following intravesical BCG therapy: A report of a rare case.	Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) has been used as an intravesical instillation for nonmuscle invasive (superficial) bladder cancer for the last 3 decades. Although intravesical BCG therapy is well-tolerated by most of the patients, adverse reactions have also been reported which are usually local, benign, and self-limited. Systemic complications such as miliary tuberculosis (TB) are very rare with few documented reports in literature. We hereby report a rare case of disseminated TB in bilateral lungs, adrenal, cervical, mediastinal, and para-aortic lymph nodes in a patient with recurrent transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) of renal pelvis and urinary bladder. Peculiar feature of this case was the development of TB 2 years following last BCG instillation, which is unlike most of the cases in the literature where TB developed within few weeks of last dose of BCG.
26881509	Malpingian carcinoma of the urinary bladder: A case series.	CONTEXT: Malpingian carcinoma (MC) of the bladder is a rare entity. Although distant metastases are very rare it is, usually, diagnosed in the advanced stage, and most patients die. AIMS: The aim was to reveal the characteristics of this tumor and discuss reasons explaining its particular biological behavior. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: The pathologic and clinical characteristics, as well as treatment and outcome of six consecutive cases, were retrospectively studied. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Medical records of patients with bladder tumors who were treated in our hospital from 2004 onward were reviewed in order to identify those with MC of the bladder. RESULTS: We identified found seven cases. Almost all had locally advanced disease. Three developed visceral metastases and died within few months from the time of diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Monitoring protocols required for the early control of local recurrence.
26881505	Radiotherapy concurrent with weekly gemcitabine after transurethral tumor resection in muscle invasive bladder cancer.	OBJECTIVE: In this report, we determined the efficacy and the toxicity of low dose weekly gemcitabine with radiotherapy, in medically unfit or refused surgery muscle-invasive bladder cancer (BC) patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From 2008 to 2012, 15 patients were included into the retrospective analysis. Weekly gemcitabine was administered at a rate of 50 mg/m(2) with a median dose of 63 Gy radiotherapy. RESULTS: The median age was 69 (range, 55-86). Median follow-up was 15 months (range, 5-53 months). A complete response was achieved in 12 patients (80%). Median progression free survival and overall survival were 15 months (range, 7-23 months) and 18 months (range not calculated), respectively. Local recurrence was found in 3 patients (20%) and distant recurrence was found in 5 patients (33.3%) for the entire group. While salvage surgery was performed on 1 patient, salvage chemotherapy was delivered for 4 patients. Treatment was well tolerated, there was no treatment interruption or instances of toxic death. A serious toxicity (grade 3) cystitis was seen in only 1 patient. CONCLUSIONS: Multimodality treatment of muscle invasive BC proved a feasible and effective treatment option. Gemcitabine based chemoradiation is an active treatment option with a low toxicity profile for patients with muscle invasive BC, who are not suitable medically or refused to surgery.
26881258	Noninsulin Antidiabetic Drugs for Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: Are We Respecting Their Contraindications?	AIM: To assess prescribing practices of noninsulin antidiabetic drugs (NIADs) in T2DM with several major contraindications according to prescribing information or clinical guidelines: renal failure, heart failure, liver dysfunction, or history of bladder cancer. METHODS: Cross-sectional, descriptive, multicenter study. Electronic medical records were retrieved from all T2DM subjects who attended primary care centers pertaining to the Catalan Health Institute in Catalonia in 2013 and were pharmacologically treated with any NIAD alone or in combination. RESULTS: Records were retrieved from a total of 255,499 pharmacologically treated patients. 78% of patients with some degree of renal impairment (glomerular filtration rate (GFR) < 60 mL/min) were treated with metformin and 31.2% with sulfonylureas. Even in the event of severe renal failure (GFR < 30 mL/min), 35.3% and 22.5% of patients were on metformin or sulfonylureas, respectively. Moreover, metformin was prescribed to more than 60% of patients with moderate or severe heart failure. CONCLUSION: Some NIADs, and in particular metformin, were frequently used in patients at high risk of complications when they were contraindicated. There is a need to increase awareness of potential inappropriate prescribing and to monitor the quality of prescribing patterns in order to help physicians and policymakers to yield better clinical outcomes in T2DM.
26880857	Systemic Inflammatory Response Based on Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte Ratio as a Prognostic Marker in Bladder Cancer.	A growing body of evidence suggests that systemic inflammatory response (SIR) in the tumor microenvironment is closely related to poor oncologic outcomes in cancer patients. Over the past decade, several SIR-related hematological factors have been extensively investigated in an effort to risk-stratify cancer patients to improve treatment selection and to predict posttreatment survival outcomes in various types of cancers. In particular, one readily available marker of SIR is neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), which can easily be measured on the basis of absolute neutrophils and absolute lymphocytes in a differential white blood cell count performed in the clinical setting. Many investigators have vigorously assessed NLR as a potential prognostic biomarker predicting pathological and survival outcomes in patients with urothelial carcinoma (UC) of the bladder. In this paper, we aim to present the prognostic role of NLR in patients with UC of the bladder through a thorough review of the literature.
26880824	Dysuria and fever in a young woman diagnosed as having inflammatory myofibroblastic tumour of the urinary bladder.	A 38-year-old woman presented with dysuria and fever. Her medical and family histories were unremarkable. CT scan of the abdomen revealed a polypoid mass of 4x2.6x2.2 cm. Her cystoscopy showed a 4x2 cm solid broad-based growth at trigone of the urinary bladder. She underwent transurethral resection of the urinary bladder tumour (TURBT). Histopathology revealed a poorly circumscribed proliferation of spindle cells arranged in a haphazard and fascicular manner along with many traversing blood vessels in a myxoid and hyalinised stroma. Immunohistochemistry was positive for anaplastic lymphoma kinase-1, smooth muscle actin, CD10, cytokeratin and desmin; and negative for CD34 and S-100 protein. Ki-67 proliferative index in the tumour was <1%. The patient was diagnosed as having inflammatory myofibroblastic tumour of the urinary bladder. After TURBT, her fever and urinary symptoms resolved. Her 1-month postoperative period was uneventful. She has been advised regular follow-up.
26879287	Urinary bladder dose-response relationships for patient-reported genitourinary morbidity domains following prostate cancer radiotherapy.	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Radiotherapy (RT) induced genitourinary (GU) morbidity is typically assessed by physicians as single symptoms or aggregated scores including symptoms from various domains. Here we apply a method to group patient-reported GU symptoms after RT for localized prostate cancer based on their interplay, and study how these relate to urinary bladder dose. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data were taken from two Scandinavian studies (N=207/276) including men treated with external-beam RT (EBRT) to 78/70Gy (2Gy/fraction; median time-to-follow-up: 3.6-6.4y). Within and across cohorts, bladder dose-volume parameters were tested as predictors for GU symptom domains identified from two study-specific questionnaires (35 questions on frequency, incontinence, obstruction, pain, urgency, and sensory symptoms) using univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis (MVA) with 10-fold cross-validation. Performance was evaluated using Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (Az). RESULTS: For the identified Incontinence (2-5 symptoms), Obstruction (3-5 symptoms), and Urgency (2-7 symptoms) domains, MVA demonstrated that bladder doses close to the prescription doses were the strongest predictors for Obstruction (Az: 0.53-0.57) and Urgency (Az: 0.60). For Obstruction, performance increased for the across cohort analysis (Az: 0.61-0.64). CONCLUSIONS: Our identified patient-reported GU symptom domains suggest that high urinary bladder doses, and increased focus on both obstruction and urgency is likely to further add to the understanding of GU tract RT responses.
26876462	PLK-1 Silencing in Bladder Cancer by siRNA Delivered With Exosomes.	OBJECTIVE: To use exosomes as a vector to deliver small interfering ribonucleic acid (siRNA) to silence the polo-like kinase 1 (PLK-1) gene in bladder cancer cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Exosomes were isolated from both human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cell and mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) conditioned media. Fluorescently labeled exosomes were co-cultured with bladder cancer and normal epithelial cells and uptake was quantified by image cytometry. PLK-1 siRNA and negative control siRNA were loaded into HEK293 and MSC exosomes using electroporation. An invasive bladder cancer cell line (UMUC3) was co-cultured with the electroporated exosomes. Quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction was performed. Protein analysis was performed by Western blot. Annexin V staining and MTT assays were used to investigate effects on apoptosis and viability. RESULTS: Bladder cancer cell lines internalize an increased percentage of HEK293 exosomes when compared to normal bladder epithelial cells. Treatment of UMUC3 cells with exosomes electroporated with PLK-1 siRNA achieved successful knockdown of PLK-1 mRNA and protein when compared to cells treated with negative control exosomes. CONCLUSION: HEK293 and MSC exosomes were effectively used as a delivery vector to transport PLK-1 siRNA to bladder cancer cells in vitro, resulting in selective gene silencing of PLK-1. The use of exosomes as a delivery vector for potential intravesical therapy is attractive.
26874533	A Review Comparing Experience and Results with Bipolar Versus Monopolar Resection for Treatment of Bladder Tumors.	The standard treatment of non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) is transurethral resection (TUR) commonly using a monopolar electrocautery system. This system requires high energy and voltage to allow an electric current to run from the loop to the patient's skin. The heat generated leads to desiccation of small cells and difficulty to perform adequate histological analysis for severely cauterized pieces of tissues. On contrary, the electric current in bipolar systems does not traverse the patient and hence lower energy and voltage are used and minimal tissue damage is anticipated. In addition, the use of saline as an irrigant fluid eliminates the potential TUR syndrome from excess hypotonic fluid reabsorption. Furthermore, the lower energy dissipates as heat in tissues contributing to adequate hemostasis. This review presents the most recent studies and evidence on the differences between monopolar and bipolar systems for TUR of NMIBC as regards the perioperative and long-term outcomes.
26874236	Multiplex bead-based immunoassay for the free soluble forms of the HLA-G receptors, ILT2 and ILT4.	Human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-G is an immune-inhibitory molecule that exerts its function via interaction with two main inhibitory receptors: ILT2 and ILT4. This interaction is considered to be an immune checkpoint. HLA-G can be found as a soluble molecule, but it is not known if its receptors can also be found as soluble molecules. In this work, we present a multiplex luminex-based assay to measure soluble ILT2 (sILT2) and soluble ILT4 (sILT4) molecules together. It is based on two antibody pairs, GHI/75 and HP-F1-PE for ILT2 and 27D6 and 42D1-PE for ILT4. The characterization of our method reveals that it specifically detects the free soluble forms of sILT2 and sILT4, and not those complexed to HLA Class I molecules such as their ligand of highest affinity HLA-G. A study on two small cohorts of cancer patients demonstrated that soluble ILT2 and ILT4 molecules were of low abundance in the plasma of healthy controls, but that elevated levels of plasmatic sILT2 were present in non-muscle-infiltrating bladder cancer patients. This demonstrated that the titration test is indeed working, and that soluble ILT2 molecules do exist in pathological contexts, which relevance may now be sought on larger cohorts and other pathologies.
26873642	An open-label, single-arm, phase 2 study of the Aurora kinase A inhibitor alisertib in patients with advanced urothelial cancer.	BACKGROUND: Progress in developing effective salvage therapies for UC is warranted. Alisertib is an orally available, selective inhibitor of the aurora kinase A. METHODS: A single-group, phase 2 trial was conducted with alisertib 50 mg orally BID for 7 days, with 14d rest until disease progression (PD) (NCT02109328). The primary endpoint (EP) was RECIST 1.1 objective response-rate (ORR, H0 </= 5%, H1 >/= 20%, alpha = 10% and beta = 20%). Eligibility included failure of at least one platinum-based regimen. RESULTS: From 10/2014 to 04/2015, 22 patients were enrolled (20 evaluable for response), 8 (36.4%) in second-line and 14 (63.6 %) beyond the second-line. Eight (36.4%) had an ECOG-performance status 1-2. Two partial responses (PR, ORR: 9.1%), 7 stable disease (SD) and 11 PD were obtained. Median follow-up was 8.3 months (IQR: 7-10.3), 6-month progression-free survival (PFS) was 13.6% (95%CI: 4.8-39.0). Two SD are still receiving treatment after 11.5 and 6.3 months. Median overall survival (OS) was not reached (6-month OS: 59.1%, 95%CI: 41.7-83.7). Hb < 10 g/dl was significantly associated with shorter PFS and OS multivariably (p = 0.031 and p = 0.033). Tissue of the case with 11.5 month SD harbored a missense mutation of mTOR (E1813D), the nonsense mutation Q527STOP of TSC1, HER3 and TAF1L missense mutations. Grade 3-4 adverse events (AE) were: 40.9% mucositis, 36.4% fatigue, 18.2% neutropenia (13.6% febrile neutropenia). There were 2 treatment-related deaths. CONCLUSIONS: The study did not meet the primary EP, yet sustained disease control was obtained in about 14% of patients. The incidence of AE and the issue of patient selection are two major concerns.
26873485	The SMAD2/3 pathway is involved in hepaCAM-induced apoptosis by inhibiting the nuclear translocation of SMAD2/3 in bladder cancer cells.	The aim of this study was to explore the correlation between hepatocyte cell adhesion molecule (hepaCAM) and SMAD family member 2/3 (SMAD2/3) in bladder carcinoma, and the involvement of the SMAD2/3 pathway in hepaCAM-induced tumor apoptosis. Immunohistochemistry was used to measure hepaCAM and p-SMAD2/3 protein levels in bladder cancer tissues. Flow cytometry and Hoechst staining were used to study the effect of hepaCAM on cellular apoptosis. Western blot was employed to determine the expression of hepaCAM and SMAD2/3/caspase pathway molecules using a hepaCAM overexpression adenovirus, a caspase inhibitor (Z-VAD-FMK), and a SMAD2/3 activator (transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1), respectively. Translocation of p-SMAD2/3 was measured by immunofluorescence and western blot. HepaCAM proteins were significantly decreased (P < 0.05), while p-SMAD2/3 proteins were remarkably increased (P < 0.05) in bladder carcinoma compared to adjacent tissues. However, the low hepaCAM and high p-SMAD2/3 were not statistically associated with clinicopathological characteristics of the patients. A negative linear correlation between hepaCAM and p-SMAD2/3 was observed according to Pearson analysis (r = -0.712/-0.724, P = 0.008/0.011). Overexpression of hepaCAM activated caspase 3/8/9 and downregulated poly-ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) and p-SMAD2/3. Treatment of bladder cancer cells with Z-VAD-FMK + hepaCAM significantly downregulated procaspase 3/8/9 and PARP and induced cellular apoptosis, compared with that using Z-VAD-FMK alone. Similarly, combined treatment of TGF-beta1 + hepaCAM significantly downregulated p-SMAD2/3, procaspase 3/8/9, and PARP and induced apoptosis of bladder cancer cells, compared with TGF-beta1 alone. Overexpression of hepaCAM prevented the p-SMAD2/3 translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus in bladder cancer cells BIU-87 and T24. Our findings uncover that the p-SMAD2/3 pathway is critical for hepaCAM-induced cancer cell apoptosis and provide valuable insights for current and future Ad-hepaCAM and p-SMAD2/3 clinical trials.
26873028	Oncologic surveillance in bladder cancer following radical cystectomy: A systematic review and meta-analysis.	PURPOSE: The existing guidance on bladder cancer surveillance following radical cystectomy is limited and variable. Additionally, the effect of surveillance on mortality is debatable. Herein, we perform a systematic review to evaluate the characteristics of alternative oncologic surveillance protocols and determine the association of detection of asymptomatic vs. symptomatic recurrences on mortality. METHODS: An electronic search of PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases was performed from 1970 to 2015. In all, 3 reviewers independently assessed the 1,729 candidate studies for eligibility and abstracted data based on an a priori established protocol. Outcomes were pooled using random effects meta-analysis. RESULTS: We identified 7 studies for inclusion that were uncontrolled and thereby represented a body of evidence at high risk of bias; 5 studies developed surveillance protocols using a methodology similar to that of established guidelines. The majority proposed a pathologic stage-stratified approach, but ended surveillance for all patients at 5 years. Detection of asymptomatic recurrences was associated with a nonsignificant reduction in mortality (relative risk = 0.78; 95% CI: 0.58-1.04). This effect became statistically significant when upper and lower urinary tract recurrences were included in the analyses (relative risk = 0.69; 95% CI: 0.59-0.79). CONCLUSIONS: Only sparse evidence supports alternative oncologic surveillance protocols for bladder cancer following radical cystectomy. The majority of existing protocols proposed similar strategies to those recommended by published guidelines. Detecting asymptomatic recurrences may lead to a reduction in overall mortality, which could provide a rationale for surveillance.
26872591	A Case for Nephron Sparing Surgery in the Management of Upper Tract Urothelial Carcinoma.	Upper tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC) is rare and its management presents many challenges. Outside of distal ureterectomy for select cases, management has been primarily radical nephroureterectomy. Endoscopic nephron sparing management (NSM) is recognized to have some role in UTUC treatment; however, it is yet to gain firm footing in the treatment algorithm. In this review, we discuss the benefits of NSM with regards to oncologic outcomes, renal function preservation, and cost savings. Finally, we propose recognition of endoscopic NSM as a first-line treatment in selected patients with low risk disease.
26871835	Rosiglitazone Use and the Risk of Bladder Cancer in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes.	Patients with diabetes have a higher incidence of bladder cancer; however, the association between thiazolidinedione use and bladder cancer risk has been controversial. We aimed to investigate whether pioglitazone or rosiglitazone use is associated with bladder cancer risk in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.This nationwide nested case-control study used data set obtained from the Korean National Health Insurance Service National Sample Cohort 2002 to 2013. Among the 47,738 patients with incident diabetes, 85 cases of newly diagnosed bladder cancer and 850 controls (1:10 matched by age, sex, index year, and diabetes diagnosis year) were recruited. Type 2 diabetes mellitus and bladder cancer were diagnosed using the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th Revision code.More cases of bladder cancer were diagnosed in men (81.2%), and the stratified age peaked at 70 to 79 years old. Exclusive rosiglitazone use raised the incidence of bladder cancer (odds ratio [OR] = 3.07, 95% confidence interval [CI ] = 1.48-6.37). The risk of bladder cancer started to increase after less than 3 months use (OR = 3.30, 95% CI = 1.02-10.70) and peaked at 3 to 12 months of rosiglitazone use (OR = 4.48, 95% CI = 1.51-13.31). Patients were first exposed to exclusive rosiglitazone within 1 year (OR = 11.74, 95% CI = 2.46-56.12) and those who had consistently used it for 1 year (OR = 4.48 95% CI = 1.51-13.31), had higher risks of bladder cancer compared with nonthiazolidinedione users. Neither pioglitazone use nor exclusive pioglitazone use were associated with an increased incidence of bladder cancer.Rosiglitazone use is associated with an increased risk of incident bladder cancer independent of age and sex in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The highest odds of bladder cancer in rosiglitazone users was seen in those with <1 year of exposure.

The third part of the European Federation of Societies for Ultrasound in Medicine and Biology (EFSUMB) Guidelines on Interventional Ultrasound assesses the evidence for ultrasound-guided and assisted interventions in abdominal treatment procedures. Recommendations for clinical practice are presented covering indications, contraindications, safety and efficacy of the broad variety of these techniques. In particular, drainage of abscesses and fluid collections, interventional tumor ablation techniques, interventional treatment of symptomatic cysts and echinococcosis, percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography and drainage, percutaneous gastrostomy, urinary bladder drainage, and nephrostomy are addressed (short version; a long version is published online).
26869491	Overexpression of RNF2 Is an Independent Predictor of Outcome in Patients with Urothelial Carcinoma of the Bladder Undergoing Radical Cystectomy.	RNF2 (ring finger protein 2) is frequently overexpressed in several types of human cancer, but the status of RNF2 amplification and expression in urothelial carcinoma of the bladder (UCB) and its clinical/prognostic significance is unclear. In this study, immunohistochemical analysis and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) were used to examine the expression and amplification of RNF2 in 184 UCB patients after radical cystectomy. Overexpression of RNF2 was observed in 44.0% of UCBs and was found to significantly associate with shortened overall and cancer-specific survival (P < 0.001). In different subsets of UCBs, RNF2 overexpression was also identified as a prognostic indicator in patients with pT1, pT2, pN(-), and/or negative surgical margins (P < 0.05). Importantly, RNF2 overexpression together with pT status and surgical margin status provided significant independent prognostic parameters in multivariate analysis (P < 0.01). FISH results showed amplification of RNF2 in 8/79 (10.1%) of informative UCB cases. Additionally, RNF2 overexpression was significantly associated with RNF2 gene amplification (P = 0.004) and cell proliferation (P = 0.003). These findings suggested that overexpression of RNF2, as examined by immunohistochemical analysis, might serve as a novel prognostic biomarker and potential therapeutic target for UCB patients who undergo radical cystectomy.
26867922	Pictorial review of orthotopic neobladder reconstruction: indication, normal postsurgical anatomy, and complications.	Radical cystectomy with urinary diversion is a common urological procedure performed for the treatment of bladder cancer. Numerous surgical procedures have been developed for urinary diversion. Over the past decade, orthotopic neobladder reconstruction has been used frequently for urinary diversion because of its advantageousness in providing patients with a good quality of life compared with other urinary diversion technique. Knowledge of the indication, surgical procedure, and postsurgical anatomy of orthotopic neobladder reconstruction is essential. While the technique has many advantages, multiple postsurgical complications may occur after reconstruction, including urine leakage, bowel obstruction and fluid collection (lymphocele, urinoma, hematoma, and abscess), neobladder rupture, vesicoureteral reflux, hydronephrosis, urinary tract infection, urinary calculi, abdominal incisional hernia, bowel obstruction, intraneobladder tumor, and tumor recurrence. Radiological imaging including multiple modalities such as intravenous urography, cystography, CT, and MRI plays an important role in the postoperative evaluation of patients with orthotopic neobladder reconstruction and is an accurate method for evaluating complications. In addition, knowledge of appearances on multimodal imaging helps clinicians to select the modality required to achieve an accurate diagnosis of each complication and avoid misdiagnosis.
26867765	UCA1 functions as a competing endogenous RNA to suppress epithelial ovarian cancer metastasis.	Urothelial cancer associated 1 (UCA1) is an example of functional long noncoding RNAs involved in many biologic processes. However, little is known about the association between UCA1 expression and metastasis in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). Findings of this study confirmed that not only UCA1 was aberrantly upregulated in EOC tissues and cells, but also correlated with status of lymph node metastasis and FIGO stage. Furthermore, univariate and multivariate analyses showed that UCA1 was a prognostic factor for overall survival in EOC patients. In vitro, knockdown of UCA1 reduced the invasion and migration ability of EOC cells. The results showed that UCA1 could function as an endogenous sponge by directly binding to miR-485-5p. Depletion of UCA1 was involved in the downregulation of matrix metallopeptidase 14 (MMP14) expression, a target gene of miR-485-5p. In conclusion, our work indicates that UCA1 is a new prognostic biomarker for EOC, establishing a novel connection among UCA1, miR-485-5p, and MMP14 in EOC metastasis.
26867293	Pesticide Exposure in the Caribbean: A Case From Nutmeg Processing.	Many developed countries around the world have implemented regulations to phase out or greatly restrict the use of pesticides. Pesticides are still utilized with minimal restrictions, however, in fumigating agricultural commodities in developing countries such as Grenada. This special report presents the case of a nutmeg factory worker in Grenada who worked with various pesticides including methyl bromide, magnesium phosphide (magtoxin), and aluminum phosphide (phostoxin) without the proper awareness and utilization of health and safety measures. The nutmeg factory worker later developed metastatic bladder cancer, which may have been triggered by a combination of individual risk factors along with long-term occupational exposure to these pesticides. In this special report, the occupational health importance of prevention in a work environment with significant exposure to pesticides is highlighted as well as some of the fundamental deficiencies in awareness among workers in developing nations concerning the deleterious effects of frequent exposure to pesticides.
26866355	Basaloid Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Anus Revisited.	Basaloid squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the anus, previously called cloacogenic carcinoma, is a subtype of SCC. There are very few data on the morphologic variation within basaloid SCC of the anus, which may contribute to misdiagnosis. We retrospectively evaluated cases originally diagnosed as basaloid SCC for histologic characterization. We retrieved and reviewed cases of basaloid SCC from 1994 to 2013. Ten (27%) cases were reclassified after review, including basal cell carcinoma (n=6), melanoma (n=2), and neuroendocrine carcinoma (n=2). The final group of basaloid SCC (n=27) showed a female predominance (median age=60 y; range, 42 to 92 y). Morphologically, basaloid SCC could be categorized into 4 groups: transitional carcinoma like (n=10), basaloid with peripheral palisade (n=13), adenoid cystic carcinoma like (n=3), and mucinous microcystic (n=1). In 19 cases the histologic patterns were pure and were mixed in the remainder. CK5/6, p16, and high-risk HPV were positive in all cases (n=27). SOX2 was positive in 18/22 cases. Clinical follow-up was available on 60% of cases; 9 patients (53%) developed local recurrence or metastasis, and 5 (29%) died of disease. Basaloid SCC of the anus is characterized by 4 major histologic patterns and is consistently HPV driven.
26865331	The use of a gas chromatography-sensor system combined with advanced statistical methods, towards the diagnosis of urological malignancies.	Prostate cancer is one of the most common cancers. Serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is used to aid the selection of men undergoing biopsies. Its use remains controversial. We propose a GC-sensor algorithm system for classifying urine samples from patients with urological symptoms. This pilot study includes 155 men presenting to urology clinics, 58 were diagnosed with prostate cancer, 24 with bladder cancer and 73 with haematuria and or poor stream, without cancer. Principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to assess the discrimination achieved, while linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and support vector machine (SVM) were used as statistical models for sample classification. Leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV), repeated 10-fold cross-validation (10FoldCV), repeated double cross-validation (DoubleCV) and Monte Carlo permutations were applied to assess performance. Significant separation was found between prostate cancer and control samples, bladder cancer and controls and between bladder and prostate cancer samples. For prostate cancer diagnosis, the GC/SVM system classified samples with 95% sensitivity and 96% specificity after LOOCV. For bladder cancer diagnosis, the SVM reported 96% sensitivity and 100% specificity after LOOCV, while the DoubleCV reported 87% sensitivity and 99% specificity, with SVM showing 78% and 98% sensitivity between prostate and bladder cancer samples. Evaluation of the results of the Monte Carlo permutation of class labels obtained chance-like accuracy values around 50% suggesting the observed results for bladder cancer and prostate cancer detection are not due to over fitting. The results of the pilot study presented here indicate that the GC system is able to successfully identify patterns that allow classification of urine samples from patients with urological cancers. An accurate diagnosis based on urine samples would reduce the number of negative prostate biopsies performed, and the frequency of surveillance cystoscopy for bladder cancer patients. Larger cohort studies are planned to investigate the potential of this system. Future work may lead to non-invasive breath analyses for diagnosing urological conditions.
26865049	Mycobacterium phlei cell wall-nucleic acid complex in the treatment of nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer unresponsive to bacillus Calmette-Guerin.	INTRODUCTION: Current guidelines recommend cystectomy in patients with high risk NMIBC who fail to respond to BCG. However due to the significant morbidity and mortality of the procedure, many are not candidates or refuse it. No new treatments for this indication have been approved by the US FDA since 1998. AREAS COVERED: A cell wall-nucleic acid complex (MCNA) from M. phlei has been investigated for possible application in patients with BCG refractory NMIBC. The development of this biological from the original studies is reviewed, together with the clinical trials leading to a submission to the FDA. Its efficacy and safety are presented together with comparative analysis of alternative treatments, most of which are used off-label. In addition, new combinations of standard therapies are described as well as single agents exhibiting activity against these tumors. EXPERT OPINION: MCNA has shown activity against high risk BCG refractory bladder cancer and offers an alternative to current treatments. The clinical experience remains limited and the optimal therapeutic regimen (dose, frequency) have not been firmly established. Patients and clinicians would welcome the introduction of a compound that may delay or prevent the risks and negative impact in quality of life of cystectomy and urinary diversion.
26865042	Lack of association between polymorphisms in the CYP1A2 gene and risk of cancer: evidence from meta-analyses.	BACKGROUND: Polymorphisms in the CYP1A2 genes have the potential to affect the individual capacity to convert pre-carcinogens into carcinogens. With these comprehensive meta-analyses, we aimed to provide a quantitative assessment of the association between the published genetic association studies on CYP1A2 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and the risk of cancer. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, ISI Web of Science and SCOPUS bibliographic online databases and databases of genome-wide association studies (GWAS). After data extraction, we calculated Odds Ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association between the retrieved CYP1A2 SNPs and cancer. Random effect model was used to calculate the pooled ORs. Begg and Egger tests, one-way sensitivity analysis were performed, when appropriate. We conducted stratified analyses by study design, sample size, ethnicity and tumour site. RESULTS: Seventy case-control studies and one GWA study detailing on six different SNPs were included. Among the 71 included studies, 42 were population-based case-control studies, 28 hospital-based case-control studies and one genome-wide association study, including total of 47,413 cancer cases and 58,546 controls. The meta-analysis of 62 studies on rs762551, reported an OR of 1.03 (95% CI, 0.96-1.12) for overall cancer (P for heterogeneity < 0.01; I(2) = 50.4%). When stratifying for tumour site, an OR of 0.84 (95% CI, 0.70-1.01; P for heterogeneity = 0.23, I(2) = 28.5%) was reported for bladder cancer for those homozygous mutant of rs762551. An OR of 0.79 (95% CI, 0.65-0.95; P for heterogeneity = 0.09, I(2) = 58.1%) was obtained for the bladder cancer from the hospital-based studies and on Caucasians. CONCLUSIONS: This large meta-analysis suggests no significant effect of the investigated CYP1A2 SNPs on cancer overall risk under various genetic models. However, when stratifying according to the tumour site, our results showed a borderline not significant OR of 0.84 (95% CI, 0.70-1.01) for bladder cancer for those homozygous mutant of rs762551. Due to the limitations of our meta-analyses, the results should be interpreted with attention and need to be further confirmed by high-quality studies, for all the potential CYP1A2 SNPs.
26864676	Use of an Electronic Medical Record to Assess Patient-Reported Morbidity Following Ureteroscopy.	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: With the extensive documentation afforded by our electronic medical record (EMR), we observed an unusually high number of patient-initiated encounters following ureteroscopy (URS). We sought to quantify and categorize patient encounters following URS to determine if we could identify avoidable common problems. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Following IRB approval, we reviewed the records of 298 consecutive patients with stones who underwent 314 URS procedures between July 2013 and November 2014. Patient demographics, stone characteristics and operative details, as well as telephone encounters, secure online patient-initiated (MyChart) messages, and emergency department (ED) visits following URS were extracted from our EMR (Epic, Verona, WI). We performed univariate (UVA) and multivariate (MVA) analysis to identify factors predictive of postoperative patient encounters and compared URS patients to a group of 56 patients undergoing transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) for number and type of encounters. RESULTS: We identified 443 encounters generated by 201 URS patients, including 334 telephone calls, 71 MyChart messages, and 38 ED visits. Among these encounters, 352 (79%) were medically related (pain comprised 45%) and the remainder involved scheduling issues. By UVA age, bilateral versus unilateral URS, stone location (both kidney and ureter), ureteral access sheath size, and total number of stones predicted a postoperative encounter. By MVA, only younger age and larger UAS size were independent predictors. When compared with TURBT patients, URS patients had a 2.5-fold higher risk of having a pain-related postoperative encounter (OR 2.54, 95% CI 1.08-7.04, P=0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Among patients undergoing URS for stones, two-thirds made unprompted contact with a healthcare provider and 80% of contacts involved postoperative pain, a finding that is distinct from another endoscopic procedure that does not involve upper tract manipulation. Patients do not perceive URS as the benign procedure doctors do.
26864062	[Immune checkpointtargeted cancer immunotherapies].	Tumor cells may express on their surface various characteristic antigens that can induce antitumor immunity. However, cancer in human body may induce an immunosuppressive microenvironment that limits immune response to its antigens. For many years scientists have tried to develop an immunotherapy which would induce a potent antitumor immune response and lead to an elimination of the disease. One of the most promising immunotherapies is blockade of immune checkpoints, i.e. a group of costimulatory molecules negatively regulating the immune system. Their blockade would overcome immune tolerance in the tumor microenvironment and amplify antitumor immunity. What's more, immune checkpoint blockade may turn out even more profitable, as some of immune checkpoints and their ligands are expressed on tumor surface and on tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, contributing to the immunosuppressive cancer microenvironment. Phase III clinical trials have confirmed efficacy of an antiCTLA4 antibody ipilimumab, thereby leading to its acceptance for the treatment of advanced melanoma. Thanks to promising results of the phase I clinical trials, a breakthrough therapy designation and an early approval for the treatment have been granted to antiPD1 antibodies nivolumab (for the treatment of advanced melanoma and advanced nonsmall cell lung cancer) and pembrolizumab (for the treatment of advanced melanoma) and, in the treatment of advanced bladder cancer, an antiPDL1 antibody MPDL3280A as well. Other immune checkpoints, such as LAG3, TIM3, BTLA, B7H3 and B7H4, are also under early evaluation.
26863791	[Pelvic exenteration--our experience].	Pelvic exenteration is an operative method for one-moment removal of pelvic organs, including reproductive tract, bladder and rectosidgmoid. It most common indicated in gynecologic oncology for treatment of locally advanced cancer or recidive with central location. Pelvic exenteration can be used for healing of patients with genital cancer. Frequency of serious complications can reach 50%, that emphasizes the need of careful discuss of risks and benefits with the patients who are indicated for that kind of operation. For the period 2004-2012 common 46 exenterations are performed at FSHOG "St. Sofia", form which 9 are total (TE), 14 anterior (AE), 7 posterior (PE), 16 modified posterior exenterations (MPE). Average operative time is 459 min (237-620 min), depending on the type of operation. Average blood loss is 1200 ml (800-2500 ml). Report of the complications shows that eight patients have had 1-st degree complication.
26863611	Survival after Radical Cystectomy for Bladder Cancer in Relation to Prior Non-Muscle Invasive Disease in Quebec.	INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to assess if there is a difference in survival after radical cystectomy (RC) when examined in relation to prior non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) disease vs. invasive cancer de novo at time of diagnosis. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study of all patients who underwent RC within Quebec health insurance medical services database during the years (2000-2009). Overall survival (OS) outcome was assessed with Kaplan-Meier curves and hazard ratios (HRs) adjusted for age and gender. RESULTS: A total of 2,671 subjects met the eligibility criteria. Among them, 19.8% had presumed prior NMIBC that further progressed to invasive disease. Median survival after RC for patients with presumed prior NMIBC was 4.3 years as compared to patients with presumed invasive disease de novo 3.7 years (p = 0.007, Wilcoxon test). Patients with presumed NMIBC at the time of diagnosis had a 16% decrease in the risk of mortality after RC, when compared to patients with presumed invasive BC de novo (HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.73-0.96 (p = 0.0166)). CONCLUSION: Our results suggest a slightly better prognosis, regarding OS after RC for patients with presumed NMIBC who progressed to invasive disease, when compared to patients with presumed invasive disease de novo at the time of diagnosis.
26863281	Familial Risk in Patients With Carcinoma of Unknown Primary.	IMPORTANCE: Carcinoma of unknown primary (CUP) accounts for 3% to 5% of all cancers and is associated with poor prognosis. Familial clustering of different cancer sites with CUP is unknown and may provide information regarding etiology, as well as elevated cancer risks in relatives. OBJECTIVE: To quantify the risk of cancer by site in first- and second-degree relatives and first cousins of individuals with CUP. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Nested case-control study of patients who received a diagnosis of CUP between 1980 and 2010 identified from the Utah Cancer Registry. Population controls with no CUP diagnosis were sex and age matched 10:1 to patients with CUP. Data about relatives were drawn from the Utah Population Database. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Familial aggregation of cancer risk in relatives of cases compared with controls using Cox regression analysis. RESULTS: For the 4160 index patients (median [interquartile range] age, 72 [62-81] years; 47.6% male) who had received a diagnosis of CUP, first-degree relatives were at an elevated risk of CUP themselves (hazard ratio [HR], 1.35 [95% CI, 1.07-1.70]), as well as lung (HR, 1.37 [95% CI, 1.22-1.54]), pancreatic (HR, 1.28 [95% CI, 1.06-1.54]), myeloma (HR, 1.28 [95% CI, 1.01-1.62]), and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (HR, 1.16 [95% CI, >1.00-1.35]) cancers compared with controls without CUP. When the analysis was restricted to relatives of cancer-free controls, additional increased risks for colon (HR, 1.19 [95% CI, 1.06-1.33]) and bladder (HR, 1.18 [95% CI, >1.00-1.38]) cancers were observed. Second-degree relatives of patients with CUP were at a slight increased risk of lung (HR, 1.14 [95% CI, 1.03-1.26]), pancreatic (HR, 1.17 [95% CI, 1.01-1.37]), breast (HR, 1.09 [95% CI, 1.02-1.16]), melanoma (HR, 1.09 [95% CI, >1.00-1.19]), and ovarian (HR, 1.19 [95% CI, 1.02-1.39]) cancers. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Relatives of patients with CUP are at increased risk of CUP and several other malignant neoplasms, including lung, pancreatic, and colon cancer. The present data may suggest sites of origin for CUP and provide cancer risk information for relatives of patients with CUP that can lead to effective intervention. Relatives of patients with CUP should be aware of the elevated risks for lung, pancreatic, and colon cancer and encouraged to modify risk factors and adhere to site-specific population cancer screening.
26863249	The Influence of Race on Overall Survival in Patients with Newly Diagnosed Bladder Cancer.	BACKGROUND: Previous studies have reported significant lower incidence yet greater risk of death from bladder cancer (BCa) in African-Americans compared with Caucasians. In this study, the overall survival amongst African-Americans and Caucasians with BCa within the state of Florida is evaluated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Florida Cancer Data System and the Florida Agency for Health Care Administration data sets were linked on the basis of unique identifiers, which identified 28,786 patients (27,811 Caucasian and 975 African-Americans) with newly diagnosed BCa from January 1994-December 2009. Data in the database included race/ethnicity, age, smoking history, insurance status, treatment, tumor grade, tumor stage, and overall survival. Chi-square and Mann-Whitney U tests were used to compare variables between African-Americans and Caucasians. Survival rates were calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method while univariate effects were tested by the log-rank test, and multivariate effects were tested by Cox proportional-hazard regression model. P values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. RESULTS: Higher clinical stage bladder tumors including T3/4 disease (14.5 % vs. 8.0 %, p < 0.001), lymph node involvement (7.3 % vs. 3.4 %, p < 0.001), and metastatic disease (5.3 % vs. 1.7 %, p < 0.001), as well as higher grade disease (60.2 % vs. 48 %, p < 0.001) were more commonly reported in African-Americans than in Caucasians with newly diagnosed BCa. African-Americans tended to be treated with more aggressive therapies (e.g., radical cystectomy). After adjusting for all covariates, African-Americans actually had more favorable outcomes as related to overall survival (HR = 0.35, 95 % CI, 0.12-0.98, p = 0.045). CONCLUSIONS: Though African-Americans initially present with more aggressive BCa, African-Americans actually have an improved overall survival compared with Caucasians. Though contrary to previous reports, our results may signify a more complex relationship between race and BCa outcomes and thus warrants further attention.
26862755	Conditional Expression of the Androgen Receptor Increases Susceptibility of Bladder Cancer in Mice.	Bladder cancer represents a significant human tumor burden, accounting for about 7.7% and 2.4% of all cancer cases in males and females, respectively. While men have a higher risk of developing bladder cancer, women tend to present at a later stage of disease and with more aggressive tumors. Previous studies have suggested a promotional role of androgen signaling in enhancing bladder cancer development. To directly assess the role of androgens in bladder tumorigenesis, we have developed a novel transgenic mouse strain, R26hARLoxP/+:Upk3aGCE/+, in which the human AR transgene is conditionally expressed in bladder urothelium. Intriguingly, both male and female R26hARLoxP/+:Upk3aGCE/+ mice display a higher incidence of urothelial cell carcinoma (UCC) than the age and sex matched control littermates in response to the carcinogen, N-butyl-N-(4-hydroxybutyl) nitrosamine (BBN). We detect expression of the human AR transgene in CK5-positive and p63-positive basal cells in bladder urothelium. Further analyses of UCC tissues from R26hARLoxP/+:Upk3aGCE/+ mice showed that the majority of tumor cells are of urothelial basal cell origin. Positive immunostaining of transgenic AR protein was observed in the majority of tumor cells of the transgenic mice, providing a link between transgenic AR expression and oncogenic transformation. We observed an increase in Ki67 positive cells within the UCC lesions of transgenic AR mice. Manipulating endogenous androgen levels by castration and androgen supplementation directly affected bladder tumor development in male and female R26hARLoxP/+:Upk3aGCE/+ mice, respectively. Taken together, our data demonstrate for the first time that conditional activation of transgenic AR expression in bladder urothelium enhances carciongen-induced bladder tumor formation in mice. This new AR transgenic mouse line mimics certain features of human bladder cancer and can be used to study bladder tumorigenesis and for drug development.
26861974	FGFR3 and Cyclin D3 as urine biomarkers of bladder cancer recurrence.	AIM: To assess the diagnostic performance of FGFR3 and Cyclin D3 urinary protein levels in detecting bladder cancer recurrence. PATIENTS & METHODS: Urine of 321 patients in follow-up for bladder cancer and 150 non-neoplastic urine controls was included. Cytology, cystoscopy and FGFR3 and Cyclin D3 expression by western blot were performed. RESULTS: One hundred ten (34.3%) patients had evidence of tumor recurrence. The sensitivity and specificity of cytology/cystoscopy was 80 and 84%, and for FGFR3/Cyclin D3 was of 73 and 90%. CONCLUSION: Combined urinary FGFR3/Cyclin D3 expression shows improved detection rates for bladder cancer recurrence with high specificity and sensitivity, and within the same range of detection shown by cystoscopy, therefore supporting its potential use as noninvasive diagnostic biomarker for bladder cancer recurrence.
26861489	Matrix metalloproteinase-11 as a marker of metastasis and predictor of poor survival in urothelial carcinomas.	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Urothelial carcinomas (UC) of urinary bladder (UB) and upper urinary tract (UT) are heterogeneous diseases with high morbidity and mortality. We looked for genes with metalloendopeptidase activity in a published UBUC transcriptomic database (GSE31684):MMP-11 was the most significant, showing stepwise up-regulation. We analyzed MMP-11 expression and association with clinicopathologic factors and survival in our well-characterized cohort of UCs. METHODS: We determined MMP-11 expression in 295 UBUCs and 340 UTUCs with immunohistochemistry, evaluated by H-score. In a retrospective study, MMP-11 expression was correlated with clinicopathologic features and with disease-specific survival (DSS) and metastasis-free survival (MeFS). The statistical significance was evaluated with univariate and multivariate analyses. RESULTS: High MMP-11 expression was significantly associated with advanced pT status, nodal metastasis, high histological grade, vascular and perineural invasion, and frequent mitoses. In multivariate Cox regression analyses, which adjusted for standard clinicopathologic characteristics, MMP-11 expression was independently associated with cancer-specific mortality (hazard ratio [HR] in UTUC:3.027, P = 0.005; in UBUC: 2.631, P = 0.010) and with metastasis development (HR in UTUC:2.261, P = 0.018; in UBUC:1.801, P = 0.026). CONCLUSIONS: MMP-11 overexpression is associated with aggressive tumor phenotype and unfavorable clinical outcome in UTUC and UBUC, suggesting it may serve as a novel prognostic and therapeutic target.

26861099	[Primary peripheral T-cell lymphoma of the vagina incidentally found at cervical cancer screening].	A 50-year-old woman was referred to our hospital because a mass lesion had been palpable through the vaginal wall during a cervical cancer screening examination. A contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed marked thickening of the vaginal wall, constituting a mass 96 mm in diameter. Abnormal FDG uptake was observed in the vaginal mass, but no other lesions were detected by positron emission tomography (PET/CT). A transvaginal biopsy from the tumor revealed peripheral T-cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified (PTCL-NOS). Although endoscopic examinations revealed no signs of infiltration in either the bladder or the rectum, the MRI findings suggested invasion into the adjacent rectal wall. She achieved complete remission after six courses of biweekly THP-COP therapy, to which field radiation (39.6 Gy) was added. PTCL of the vagina is rare and this case therefore merits description in the literature.
26861061	Inhibiting malignant phenotypes of the bladder cancer cells by silencing long noncoding RNA SChLAP1.	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play key roles in process of cancer cell growth and apoptosis and have received increasing attention. SChLAP1 is a novel lncRNA that is required for development and progression of prostate cancer. We hypothesized that SChLAP1 also has important biological functions in human bladder cancer which is another type of urological cancer. METHODS: The expression of SChLAP1 in bladder cancer was determined using real-time qPCR. Bladder cancer T24 and 5637 cells were transfected with SChLAP1 siRNA or negative control siRNA. Cell proliferation, apoptosis and migration were determined using CCK-8 assay, flow cytometry analysis and wound healing assay, respectively. RESULTS: SChLAP1 was overexpressed in bladder cancer tissues compared to paired normal bladder tissues. Cell growth arrest, apoptosis induction and migration inhibition were also observed in bladder cancer T24 and 5637 cells after transfection with SChLAP1 siRNA. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that SChLAP1 plays oncogenic roles and can be used as a therapeutic target for treating human bladder cancer.
26860905	Squamous Dysplasia of the Urinary Bladder: A Consecutive Cystectomy Series.	Squamous dysplasia of the urinary bladder is uncommon and may represent a precursor to invasive squamous cell carcinoma. Though significant focus has been devoted to squamous differentiation in invasive bladder cancer, relatively little attention has been given to squamous dysplasia. We methodically reviewed microscopic slides from a consecutive cystectomy series at our institution (n = 303; 2001-2014), with special attention given to squamous dysplasia and squamous differentiation within association invasive carcinoma. Of these 303 cases, 3% (9 cases) had squamous dysplasia. The majority (89%; 8/9) had a similar morphological appearance to squamous dysplasia of the head and neck (ie, cytological atypia, architectural disturbances, and abnormal keratinization). Invasive carcinoma was present in 230 of the cystectomy cases. Of these 230 cases with invasive carcinoma, 4% (8 cases) also had squamous dysplasia. The invasive carcinoma had evidence of squamous differentiation in all cases with concurrent squamous dysplasia. Concurrent flat urothelial carcinoma in situ was present in 3 of the 8 cases with both invasive carcinoma and squamous dysplasia. Squamous dysplasia was not associated with clinical outcomes data, including death from bladder cancer and bladder cancer recurrence. The data from this study indicate that squamous dysplasia is uncommon in the cystectomy setting, frequently has the morphology of head and neck dysplasia, and is often associated with invasive carcinoma with squamous differentiation.
26860672	FDG-PET/CT as a post-treatment restaging tool in urothelial carcinoma: Comparison with contrast-enhanced CT.	PURPOSE: To assess the clinical usefulness of FDG-PET/CT in the diagnosis of recurrent and metastatic urothelial carcinoma in comparison with contrast-enhanced CT. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighty-three patients who had undergone treatment for histopathologically proven urothelial carcinoma underwent whole-body FDG-PET/CT and contrast-enhanced CT for suspected recurrence within a time interval of two weeks. Patient-based analysis and lesion sites besides the urinary tract, as interpreted by two experienced readers, were compared between the two modalities using McNemar test. Lesion status was determined on the basis of histopathology, radiological imaging and clinical follow-up for longer than 6 months. RESULT: Patient-based analysis showed that the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of FDG-PET/CT were 97.4%, 93.3% and 95.2%, respectively, whereas those of contrast-enhanced CT were 86.8%, 93.3% and 90.4%, respectively. The sensitivity and accuracy of FDG-PET/CT were higher than contrast-enhanced CT without significant difference (p=0.13). The sensitivity of FDG-PET/CT for diagnosis of bone metastasis was significantly higher than that of contrast-enhanced CT (93.8% vs. 25%, p=0.0026). CONCLUSION: FDG-PET/CT is a more accurate modality than CT for assessment of recurrence outside the urinary tract in patients with urothelial carcinoma, especially for bone lesion. Cystoscopy, urine cytology, and FDG-PET/CT are complementary procedures and may have a definite management role.
26860586	Cost Differential of Chemotherapy for Solid Tumors.	PURPOSE: A significant portion of national cancer expenditure is attributed to chemotherapy.Although the National Comprehensive Cancer Network has generated recommendations for the treatment of various solid tumors, the outlined chemotherapeutic strategies lack information about the cost differential for increasing effectiveness. METHODS: Chemotherapy regimens (curative [adjuvant/neoadjuvant] and metastatic therapy) and dosages outlined in the 2013 National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines were acquired for four common cancers: bladder, breast, colon, and lung. Baseline drug and treatment costs (in US dollars)were calculated for the average US adult male on the basis of the payment allowance in the 2013 Medicare Part B average sales price (ASP) drug pricing files. Costs were extrapolated for a treatment period of 6 months. RESULTS: Of the 62 regimens included, the 6-month mean cost of chemotherapy was $26,989 +/- $29,971, and the median cost was $9,611 (interquartile range, $6,305-$39,383). The mean cost of metastatic cancer therapy regimens (n = 32) was $35,315 +/- 32,962 compared with $18,107 +/- 23,873 for curative therapy (P = .02). Of the 13 regimens with biologics used, the mean costs were $77,278 versus $13,646 for 49 regimens that did not use biologics (P<.001). The cost differential between extremes of costs for regimens with presumed similar efficacy was $90,843 ($79,165 for curative therapy and $90,210 for metastatic cancer therapy). The highest cost differential was noted in breast cancer regimens at $71,041 for metastatic cancer therapy and $63,926 for curative therapy. CONCLUSION: A significant cost differential exists between chemotherapeutic regimens for the most common solid tumors. Incorporation of costs and incremental effectiveness in current guidelines may encourage socially responsible practice patterns.
26860539	Future directions in bladder cancer immunotherapy: towards adaptive immunity.	The clinical management of bladder cancer has not changed significantly in several decades. In particular, intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) immunotherapy has been a mainstay for high-risk nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer since the late 1970s/early 1980s. This is despite the fact that bladder cancer has the highest recurrence rates of any cancer and BCG immunotherapy has not been shown to induce a tumor-specific immune response. We and others have hypothesized that immunotherapies capable of inducing tumor-specific adaptive immunity are needed to impact bladder cancer morbidity and mortality. This article summarizes the preclinical and clinical development of bladder cancer immunotherapies with an emphasis on the last 5 years. Expected progress in the near future is also discussed.
26860012	Extravesical Pagetoid Spread of Urothelial Carcinoma in Situ. A Report of Five Cases.	BACKGROUND: Urothelial carcinoma in situ (CIS) of the bladder is classified as a flat lesion of the urothelium; it has a tendency to be multifocal and carries a high risk of recurrence and persistence. Approximately one-third of patients with urothelial CIS of the bladder develop invasive carcinoma if left untreated. There are a few reported cases of extravesical intramucosal extension (pagetoid spread) of urothelial CIS without prior documentation of primary muscle-invasive carcinoma. CASES: We present 5 cases of urothelial CIS that exhibited pagetoid spread to prostatic ducts, seminal vesicles, and the vagina. CONCLUSION: Pagetoid spread of urothelial CIS of the bladder may introduce uncertainty with regard to assignment of proper disease staging, and therefore uncertainty about appropriate cancer management.
26859939	[NARROWED SPECTRUM DIAGNOSTICS AND COMPUTER CHROMOENDOSCOPY IN THE DIAGNOSIS OF EPITHELIAL NEOPLASMS OF THE LOWER AND UPPER URINARY TRACT].	UNLABELLED: Tumors of epithelial origin occupy the first place in the structure of oncological diseases. This study was aimed to the evaluation of the possibilities of narrowed spectrum endoscopy and computer chromoendoscopy in the diagnosis of epithelial structures of the bladder and upper urinary tract. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Additional diagnostic endoscopic examination of the lower urinary tract was performed in 76 patients (132 urethrocystoscopies). For the evaluation of the efficacy of complementary technologies in the endoscopic examination of the upper urinary tract, 47 patients were examined (57 endoscopic examinations of UUT). RESULTS: During endoscopic examination of the bladder only in the "white light", 80 suspicious lesions were identified and removed. The additional use of NBI--diagnosis allowed to reveale and remove 9 (9.5%), abnormal structures, 6 of them (66.7%) were representatives of transitional cell carcinoma. The additional use of a computer chromoendoscopy revealed 6 (6.3%) neoplasms missed during endoscopy in white light: 4 samples (66.7%) were transitional cell carcinoma, 1 (16.7%)--squamous papilloma. Endoscopic examination of the upper urinary tract only in the "white light" identified and removed 47 suspicious lesions. Additional application of narrowed spectrum regimenhas allowed to identify and remove 8 (12.9%) pathological lesions, 3 (37.5%) of which were morphologically transitional cell carcinoma. The additional use of a computer chromoendoscopy indentified 7 (11.3%) tumors missed during endoscopy of UUT in "white light", 4 (57.1%) of which were transitional cell carcinoma. All other biopsies obtained were representatives of chronic inflammation, or material was not suitable for morphological examination. CONCLUSIONS: Our experience of the use of narrowed spectrum diagnostics and computer chromoendoscopy allowed to improve the diagnosis of bladder cancer by 14.3%, and to improve the detection of transitional cell carcinoma of the upper urinary tract by 14.9% at the stage of development of the method.
26859933	[MARKERS OF KIDNEY DAMAGE AND NEPHROPROTECTIVE THERAPY IN RADICAL CYSTECTOMY].	The comparative analysis of changes of the functional (osmolar clearance and fractional excretion of urea) and structural (NGAL, beta2-microglobulin in the blood plasma, and NGAL, beta2-microglobulin, microalbumin in the urine) biomarkers of kidney damage before and at various stages after radical cystectomy was performed. The study included patients with T2N0M0 stage bladder cancer. The main group consisted of 37 patients receiving nephroprotective treatment (N-acetylcysteine), the comparison group--31 patients receiving background therapy. It was revealed that severity of kidney dysfunction and the incidence of chronic kidney disease in the long-term period after surgery decreased in the main group.
26859439	Initial Series of Four-Arm Robotic Completely Intracorporeal Ileal Ureter.	Ileal ureter formation has been found to be a suitable treatment option for long, chronic ureteral strictures not amendable to less invasive forms of repair. Minimally invasive surgical techniques for this condition have been investigated. We report the first series of robotic completely intracorporeal ileal ureter using a four-arm robotic technique. Three patients underwent this procedure, including one patient with a solitary kidney. All procedures were performed effectively with a median operative time of 450 minutes (range: 420-540) and median estimated blood loss of 100 mL (range: 50-200). Postoperatively, one patient suffered volvulus and subsequent necrosis of small bowel and ileal ureter, which required re-operation and small bowel resection, including the ileal ureter. The other two patients report no surgical complications to date. This early series represents preliminary technical procedure feasibility. Further experience is necessary.
26856118	Arteriovenous Malformation Masquerading as a Bladder Tumor. A Case Report.	BACKGROUND: Arteriovenous malformation (AVM) of the urinary bladder is an extremely rare benign vascular lesion. The clinical significance of bladder AVM lies in its presentation with painless hematuria and a hyperemic sessile bladder wall mass. CASE REPORT: A 47-year-old man presented with irritative symptoms and hematuria. Cystoscopically the lesion appeared as an erythematous, broad-based mass obscuring the right ureteral orifice. The patient underwent cystoprostatectomy for suspected mass lesion. Histologically the bladder tumor was composed of numerous malformed blood vessels of various calibers with myxoid degeneration. Immunohistochemically the bland endothelial cells lining in the vessels were reactive for markers of CD31 and CD34. Ki67 index was < 1%. The patient was free of disease 24 months after surgery. CONCLUSION: Our findings broaden the morphologic spectrum of bladder arteriovenous malformation and emphasize its deceptive presentation.
26854433	Bladder cancer risk from the perspective of genetic polymorphisms in the carcinogen metabolizing enzymes.	Urinary bladder cancer is a socially significant healthcare problem. A diverse array of aromatic and heterocyclic amines, derived from the chemical and transport industry, diet, and cigarette smoke are considered carcinogens for the bladder. To exert their carcinogenic effect and to initiate the carcinogenic response, the arylamines require a metabolic activation by the host enzymes to chemically reactive compounds. The aim of this article was to review the latest and basic research developments on the role of the polymorphisms in the carcinogen metabolizing enzymes N-acetyltransferase (NAT), Glutathione S-transferases (GST), and Soluble sulfotransferases (SULT), with emphasis on the susceptibility to urinary bladder cancer. A PubMed search was conducted to identify original and review articles containing information about these polymophic variants in different populations and according to their prevalence in bladder cancer patients. We noticed that some genotypes were found to be predisposing and some protective for bladder cancer development. The NAT2 slow genotype, together with GSTM1 null genotype facilitated the development of bladder cancer in almost all ethnic groups. The 213His allele of the SULT1A1 gene which is associated with lower enzyme activity and decreased mutagen activation was reported to protect from bladder cancer in almost all studies.
26854384	Beam configuration selection for robust intensity-modulated proton therapy in cervical cancer using Pareto front comparison.	The Pareto front reflects the optimal trade-offs between conflicting objectives and can be used to quantify the effect of different beam configurations on plan robustness and dose-volume histogram parameters. Therefore, our aim was to develop and implement a method to automatically approach the Pareto front in robust intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT) planning. Additionally, clinically relevant Pareto fronts based on different beam configurations will be derived and compared to enable beam configuration selection in cervical cancer proton therapy. A method to iteratively approach the Pareto front by automatically generating robustly optimized IMPT plans was developed. To verify plan quality, IMPT plans were evaluated on robustness by simulating range and position errors and recalculating the dose. For five retrospectively selected cervical cancer patients, this method was applied for IMPT plans with three different beam configurations using two, three and four beams. 3D Pareto fronts were optimized on target coverage (CTV D(99%)) and OAR doses (rectum V30Gy; bladder V40Gy). Per patient, proportions of non-approved IMPT plans were determined and differences between patient-specific Pareto fronts were quantified in terms of CTV D(99%), rectum V(30Gy) and bladder V(40Gy) to perform beam configuration selection. Per patient and beam configuration, Pareto fronts were successfully sampled based on 200 IMPT plans of which on average 29% were non-approved plans. In all patients, IMPT plans based on the 2-beam set-up were completely dominated by plans with the 3-beam and 4-beam configuration. Compared to the 3-beam set-up, the 4-beam set-up increased the median CTV D(99%) on average by 0.2 Gy and decreased the median rectum V(30Gy) and median bladder V(40Gy) on average by 3.6% and 1.3%, respectively. This study demonstrates a method to automatically derive Pareto fronts in robust IMPT planning. For all patients, the defined four-beam configuration was found optimal in terms of plan robustness, target coverage and OAR sparing.
26853333	Role of Surgical Versus Clinical Staging in Chemoradiated FIGO Stage IIB-IVA Cervical Cancer Patients-Acute Toxicity and Treatment Quality of the Uterus-11 Multicenter Phase III Intergroup Trial of the German Radiation Oncology Group and the Gynecologic Cancer Group.	PURPOSE: The Uterus-11 trial was designed to evaluate the role of surgical staging in patients with cervical cancer before primary chemoradiation therapy (CRT). The present report provides the toxicity data stratified by the treatment arm and technique. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A total of 255 patients with carcinoma of the uterine cervix (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage IIB-IVA) were randomized to either surgical staging followed by CRT (arm A) or clinical staging followed by CRT (arm B). Patients with para-aortic metastases underwent extended field radiation therapy (RT). Brachytherapy was mandatory. The present report presents the acute therapy-related toxicities stratified by treatment arm and radiation technique. RESULTS: A total of 240 patients were eligible (n=121 in arm A; n=119 in arm B). Of the 240 patients, 236 (98.3%) underwent external beam RT with a median total dose of 50.4 Gy. The mean treatment duration was 53 days. Of the patients, 60% underwent intensity modulated RT (IMRT). A total of 234 patients (97.5%) underwent chemotherapy, and 231 (96.3%) underwent brachytherapy, with a median single dose of 6 Gy covering the tumor to a median nominal total dose of 28 Gy. Treatment was well tolerated, with 0% grade >/=3 genitourinary and gastrointestinal toxicity, 6% grade 3 nausea, 3% grade 3 vomiting, and <2% grade 3 diarrhea. More patients after surgical staging experienced grade 2 anemia (54.3% in arm A vs 45.3% in arm B; P=.074) and grade 2 leukocytopenia (41.4% vs 31.6%; P=.56). Of the patients who received IMRT versus a 3-dimensional technique, 65.3% versus 33.7% presented with grade 2 anemia. Grade 3 gastrointestinal and grade 2 bladder toxicity were significantly reduced with the use of IMRT. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence and severity of acute therapy-related toxicity compared favorably with those from other randomized trials. Excellent adherence to treatment and treatment quality was achieved compared with patterns of care analyses. Surgical staging led to a doubled number of patients treated with extended field RT. The question of whether surgical staging is beneficial in the context of primary CRT requires further study.
26851957	UCA1 overexpression predicts clinical outcome of patients with ovarian cancer receiving adjuvant chemotherapy.	PURPOSE: Urothelial carcinoma associated 1 (UCA1) functions as an oncogene, which promotes cancer cell proliferation, invasion, and metastasis, and is responsible for drug resistance. This study aimed to determine the expression level of UCA1 in ovarian cancer and to further investigate its clinical significance. METHODS: The expression levels of UCA1 in ovarian cancer and normal ovaries were determined by quantitative real-time PCR. The relationship between UCA1 expression and clinical features and the prognostic value of UCA1 for overall survival were examined. RESULTS: UCA1 expression in ovarian cancer tissues was significantly upregulated compared with normal ovarian tissues. High UCA1 expression was related to lymph node metastasis, FIGO stage, and response to chemotherapy. Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated that high UCA1 expression was associated with poorer overall survival in patients with ovarian cancer. Cox proportional hazards analysis showed that high UCA1 expression was an independent prognostic marker of poor outcome. This effect remained significant in the further stratification analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provided the first evidence that UCA1 may serve as an indicator of response to chemotherapy and prognosis of ovarian cancer. UCA1 may play an important role in the progression of ovarian cancer.
26851754	Diversity in treatment modalities of Stage II/III urothelial cancer in Japan: sub-analysis of the multi-institutional national database of the Japanese Urological Association.	OBJECTIVE: We aimed to survey treatment modalities for the patients with Stage II/III urothelial cancer in Japan. METHODS: We used the multi-institutional national database of the Japanese Urological Association from 348 Japanese institutions, in which a total of 3707 patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer and 1538 with upper urinary tract urothelial carcinoma were registered in 2008 and 2011, respectively. Primary treatment was classified as surgery alone, surgery with chemotherapy, surgery with radiation, radiation alone, chemotherapy alone, combination of radiation and chemotherapy and observation. Overall and cancer-specific survivals were examined using the Kaplan-Meier method, and survival in the subgroups was analyzed using the log-rank test. RESULTS: In Stage II/III bladder cancer patients, 49.7% of those were treated with radical operation and 22.3% received observation only. A total 97.2% of Stage II/III upper urinary tract urothelial carcinoma patients treated with radical surgery. A total 30.4% of Stage II/III bladder cancer patients received chemotherapy. Majority of the patients received cisplatin-based regimen, however, regimens of chemotherapy was rich in variety up to 13 regimens. Chemotherapy regimens for the patients with upper urinary tract urothelial carcinoma were also various up to eight regimens. Overall and cancer-specific survivals were statistically significantly stratified according to the clinical stage. The upper urinary tract urothelial carcinoma patients diagnosed with clinical stage T3 had significantly poor prognosis compared with those diagnosed with clinical stage T2. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated the variety of treatments used for Japanese patients with Stage II/III urothelial cancer. Treatment standardization for these entities may be necessary.
26851042	Prognostic Significance of Preoperative Urine Cytology in Low-grade Non-muscle-invasive Bladder Cancer.	AIM: To examine the clinical significance of preoperative urine cytology in patients with low-grade bladder cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively investigated the records of 155 patients diagnosed with primary low-grade (Ta) urothelial carcinoma of the bladder between January 2000 and September 2014. RESULTS: Patients with class III or greater cytology had significantly higher-grade (G2) (p=0.01), larger tumors (>/=15 mm, p=0.0009) and significantly shorter recurrence-free survival compared to patients with class II or lower cytology (p<0.0001). However, Cox proportional hazards analysis for recurrence-free survival only identified tumor size (>/=15 mm) (hazard ratio=5.97, 95% confidence interval=2.39-17.29; p<0.0001) as a predictor of poor prognosis, although patients with class III or higher preoperative cytology showed a tendency towards frequent intravesical recurrence (hazard ratio=1.98, 95% confidence interval=0.96-4.2; p=0.063). CONCLUSION: Preoperative urine cytology, in addition to tumor size, might be a useful predictor of intravesical recurrence of bladder cancer.
26851031	Treatment Results of Radiotherapy Combined with Balloon-occluded Arterial Infusion Chemotherapy for Invasive Bladder Cancer.	AIM: We present preliminary results from our clinical study evaluating the effectiveness of combination of radiotherapy with balloon-occluded arterial infusion (BOAI) and hemodialysis (HD) for bladder cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We investigated 134 patients with a median age of 67 years (range=38-88 years) and a median follow-up time of 31 months. According to the UICC classification, 89 patients were at clinical stage T2, 40 at T3, and 5 at T4. All patients received external-beam radiation therapy (EBRT) of 50 Gy to the whole pelvis with 10 Gy to the bladder as a boost. During EBRT, BOAI of cisplatin (CDDP) (100 mg/body) was administered from bilateral internal iliac arteries with simultaneous HD to prevent back-flow of CDDP into the systemic circulation. RESULTS: Three-year local control and overall survival (OS) rates were 68% and 80%, respectively, and 3-year bladder preservation rate was 90%. Univariate and multivariate analysis showed that T stage and primary effect were significant prognostic factors for OS. In addition, primary effect was a significant prognostic factor for bladder preservation. None of the patients had grade 2 or more severe hematological toxicity. Late grade >/=3 genitourinary (GU) and gastrointestinal (GI) complications were observed in 6% and 2% of the patients, respectively. CONCLUSION: Combination of radiotherapy with BOAI and HD, associated with reduced hematological toxicity, may be regarded as a curative therapy for patients with bladder cancer. Late GU and GI complications were within acceptable limits. T stage is an important predictive factor for the outcome of this therapy.
26851002	Copper Transporter-CTR1 Expression and Pathological Outcomes in Platinum-treated Muscle-invasive Bladder Cancer Patients.	BACKGROUND/AIM: Platinum (Pt)-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is the standard-of-care for muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC). However, the survival benefit with NAC is driven by patients with pathological response at cystectomy. Non-responders are subject to adverse effects of Pt, with delay in definitive treatment. Copper transporter receptor 1 (CTR1) plays an important role in Pt uptake and the level of expression may influence Pt sensitivity. We hypothesized that tumor CTR1 expression correlated with pathological outcome. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We identified matched paraffin-embedded tissues from pre-NAC transurethral bladder tumor resection (TURBT) and post-NAC radical cystectomy (RC) specimens in 47 patients with MIBC who received Pt-based NAC. Tumor and adjacent normal tissues were stained with CTR1 antibody. CTR1 expression was determined through immunohistochemistry by two pathologists blinded to the outcome (0=undetectable; 1+=barely detectable; 2+=moderate; and 3+=intense staining). Pathological response was defined as either down-staging to non-MIBC (</=pT1N0M0) or complete pathological response (pT0). Pathological outcome was compared between the CTR1 expression groups. RESULTS: Forty-three percent of TURBT and 41% of RC specimens expressed a CTR1 score of 3+. Forty-four percent of patients had a pathological response to NAC, and 17% had pT0 disease at cystectomy. In both pre-NAC TURBT and post-NAC RC specimens, a CTR1 expression score of 3+ correlated with pathological response (p=0.0076 and p=0.023, respectively). CONCLUSION: This is the first study to demonstrate a correlation between CTR1 tumor expression and pathological outcome in Pt-treated MIBC. These findings suggest that CTR1 expression may be a biomarker for Pt sensitivity.
26850064	Perioperative management and oncological outcomes following radical cystectomy for bladder cancer: a matched retrospective cohort study.	PURPOSE: The immune system plays an important role in tumour progression. Systemic opioids are immunosuppressive; thus, theoretically they may promote tumour spread. Our primary aim was to test the hypothesis that general anesthesia (GA) with spinal analgesia (SA) in patients with bladder cancer undergoing radical cystectomy (RC) will both reduce systemic opioid use and improve oncological outcomes. Since blood transfusions also induce immunosuppression, a secondary aim was to evaluate the effect of perioperative transfusions on oncological outcomes. METHODS: One hundred ninety-five patients who underwent RC with GA+SA from 1998-2007 were matched 1:1 to controls who underwent surgery with GA only using propensity scoring and tumour characteristics known to be highly associated with oncological outcomes. Medical records were reviewed for use of opioids and transfusions. Outcomes were tumour recurrence, cancer-specific mortality, and all-cause mortality. Survival was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and associations of anesthetic technique and transfusions with outcomes were analyzed using stratified multivariable proportional hazard regression. RESULTS: Systemic opioid use was reduced with GA+SA relative to GA (P < 0.001). There was no difference between groups with respect to all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 1.09; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.77 to 1.53; P = 0.636), bladder cancer mortality (HR, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.66 to 1.61; P = 0.893), or cancer recurrence (HR, 1.32; 95% CI, 0.86 to 2.02; P = 0.205). Nevertheless, patients who were perioperatively transfused had an increased all-cause mortality (HR, 2.21; 95% CI, 1.11 to 4.40; P = 0.025), and cancer-specific mortality (HR, 2.61; 95% CI, 1.05 to 6.48; P = 0.039). CONCLUSIONS: In patients undergoing RC, the opioid-sparing effect with SA was not associated with improved oncological outcomes, while blood transfusion was associated with increased mortality.
26849813	Updates in the Pathologic Diagnosis and Classification of Epithelial Neoplasms of Urachal Origin.	Since the publication of the World Health Organization "blue book" in 2004, several recent studies have provided new insights on the pathologic aspects of urachal neoplasms. The proposed updates include modified criteria for the diagnosis of urachal carcinoma. A uniform nomenclature for cystic tumors was lacking, and it is recommended that urachal mucinous cystic tumors should be separated and classified in a manner similar to ovarian mucinous neoplasms. The spectrum includes mucinous cystadenoma, mucinous cystic tumor of low malignant potential, mucinous cystic tumor of low malignant potential with intraepithelial carcinoma, and microscopically or frankly invasive mucinous cystadenocarcinoma, with 65% of cystic tumors classified as mucinous cystic tumor of low malignant potential. Most importantly, it has been shown that progression-free survival of noninvasive mucinous cystic tumors is significantly better than noncystic invasive adenocarcinoma. This development, along with prior descriptions of urachal villous adenoma, has also reaffirmed the occurrence of benign tumors of urachal epithelial origin. For noncystic (usual) invasive adenocarcinomas, the traditionally described histologic subtypes of enteric, mucinous, signet ring cell, not otherwise specified, and mixed remain appropriate, with 50% of tumors classified as mucinous subtype. Although this subtyping is helpful in diagnosis and differential diagnosis, the clinical significance of subtyping adenocarcinoma is still uncertain. Rare nonglandular morphologies such as urothelial, squamous, and neuroendocrine carcinoma in urachal carcinomas have been described in detail with proposals for their own set of diagnostic criteria. These criteria are based on unique features of urachal nonglandular carcinomas. Among the immunomarkers studied, only beta-catenin and CK7 may be of help in the distinction of urachal from colorectal adenocarcinoma. Awareness of the expression profile of immunomarkers such as CDX2, P504S (racemase), PSMA, claudin-18, and REG IV in urachal tumors and in tumors in the differential diagnosis is important to avoid overreliance of these markers in the diagnosis. Limited studies have identified KRAS mutations interestingly only in mucinous adenocarcinoma and exclusive of MSI loss, and mutations in BRAF are not present. Several alternative tumor staging approaches (eg, Mayo, Ontario, TNM systems) different from the traditional staging proposed by Sheldon are used that provide better tumor distribution across stages; however, the prognostic utility of the stage substratification has yet to be validated in large prospective studies. Evidence though suggests that staging urachal cancer is most pertinent when dichotomized to tumors that have spread outside versus within the perivesical tissue. Only high tumor stage and residual tumor after surgery have been shown to be independent predictors of outcome. This review updates the contemporary classification of urachal epithelial tumors, which has informed the upcoming 2016 classification of World Health Organization tumors. We provide modified criteria for diagnosing urachal adenocarcinomas, which remains a clinico-pathologic exercise. The role of ancillary diagnostic methodology and issues pertaining to staging and prognostication are presented.
26849153	Post-Radiation Therapy Imaging Appearances in Cervical Carcinoma.	Locally advanced and node-positive cervical cancers are usually treated with external beam radiation therapy and intracavitary brachytherapy with concomitant chemotherapy. In patients with locally advanced cervical cancer, imaging plays a vital role in pretreatment planning, assessment of primary tumor response to treatment, follow-up, and evaluation of treatment-related complications. Radiation therapy planning is crucial to successful local and regional control of disease. Patient selection criteria for radiation therapy with concomitant chemotherapy are described, as is assessment of treatment response of the primary cervical tumor at magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. Image interpretation can be challenging because of radiation therapy-related changes in the pelvic organs. Expected changes in the bladder, bowel, and bone marrow after radiation therapy are described, and multimodality imaging findings at computed tomography, MR imaging, and fluorine 18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography are illustrated. Complications after radiation therapy have declined over recent years because of targeted radiation therapy. These complications can be divided into acute and chronic effects, where acute toxic effects occur within weeks of treatment. Chronic complications include cervical stenosis, small bowel stricture, fistula formation, and insufficiency fractures. Imaging is an essential tool in the care of patients with cervical cancer treated with chemotherapy and radiation therapy. The reporting radiologist should be familiar with the expected imaging appearances of the pelvic organs after radiation therapy, as well as potential complications, to avoid pitfalls in image interpretation.
26848808	Incidence and incidence trends of the most frequent cancers in adolescent and young adult Americans, including "nonmalignant/noninvasive" tumors.	BACKGROUND: Incidence rates and trends of cancers in adolescents and young adults (AYAs) ages 15 to 39 years were reexamined a decade after the US National Cancer Institute AYA Oncology Progress Review Group was established. METHODS: Data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program through 2011 were used to ascertain incidence trends since the year 2000 of the 40 most frequent cancers in AYAs, including tumors with nonmalignant/noninvasive behavior. RESULTS: Seven cancers in AYAs exhibited an overall increase in incidence; in 4, the annual percent change (APC) exceeded 3 (kidney, thyroid, uterus [corpus], and prostate cancer); whereas, in 3, the APC was between 0.7 and 1.4 (acute lymphoblastic leukemia and cancers of the colorectum and testis). Eight cancers exhibited statistically significant decreases in incidence among AYAs: Kaposi sarcoma (KS), fibromatous neoplasms, melanoma, and cancers of the anorectum, bladder, uterine cervix, esophagus, and lung, each with an APC less than -1. AYAs had a higher proportion of noninvasive tumors than either older or younger patients. CONCLUSIONS: An examination of cancer incidence patterns in AYAs observed over the recent decade reveal a complex pattern. Thyroid cancer by itself accounts for most of the overall increase and is likely caused by overdiagnosis. Reductions in cervix and lung cancer, melanoma, and KS can be attributed to successful national prevention programs. A higher proportion of noninvasive tumors in AYAs than in children and older adults indicates a need to revise the current system of classifying tumors in this population.
26847849	Expression profile of hydrogen sulfide and its synthases correlates with tumor stage and grade in urothelial cell carcinoma of bladder.	BACKGROUND: Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is a newly discovered gas transmitter. It is synthesized by cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS), cystathionine gamma-lyase (CSE), and 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (MPST). Endogenous hydrogen sulfide has never been studied in bladder cancer. PURPOSE: We evaluated H2S production and its synthases expression levels in transitional cell carcinoma (urothelial cell carcinoma of bladder [UCB]) of human bladder tissue and cell lines. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Immunostaining was performed in urothelial cell lines and bladder specimens from 94 patients with UCB of different stages/grades. The expression levels/activities of CBS, CSE, and MPST of specimens and cell lines were analyzed by image semiquantity assay, western blot, and a sulfur-sensitive electrode. We tried to find the correlation between hydrogen sulfide and its synthases with tumor stage in UCB. All experiments were repeated at least 3 times. RESULTS: Immunoreactivity for CBS, CSE, and MPST was detected in malignant uroepithelium and muscular layer of all tissues examined and cultured cells. The expression levels of CBS, CSE, and MPST were associated with UCB stage/grade. Muscle-invasive bladder cancer samples showed the highest production of H2S (52.6+/-2.91 nmol/[mg.min]) among all tested samples and EJ cells (transitional cell carcinoma, grade IIIshowed the highest production of H2S among all tested cell lines (53.3+/-7.02nmol/[mg.min]). CONCLUSIONS: Protein levels and catalytic activities of CBS, CSE, and MPST increased with the increase of malignant degrees in human bladder tissues and human UCB cell lines. Our findings may promote the application of these novel enzymes to UCB diagnosis or treatment.
26847528	Bladder Cancer is Associated with Low Plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D Concentrations in Tunisian Population.	Little evidence suggests an impact of vitamin D on bladder cancer risk in Caucasians. This study aimed to investigate association of plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OHD) with urothelial bladder cancer (UBC) risk in Tunisians. A case-control study included 250 patients with UBC and 250 healthy controls. Plasma 25-OHD was assessed by a competitive chemiluminescence immunoassay. Vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency were defined as 25-OHD <30 nmol/L and 30 to 49.99 nmol/L, respectively. Logistic regression models adjusting for gender, age, smoking status, duration of smoking, occupational exposure, and season were applied. Vitamin D deficiency (50.4% vs. 34.8%; P < 0.001) and insufficiency (40.4% vs. 26.8%; P < 0.001) were more frequent in patients than controls. Multivariate analysis showed that UBC is associated with vitamin D deficiency [odd-ratio (95% confidence interval), 3.71 (1.76-7.80); P = 0.001] and vitamin D insufficiency [2.65 (1.40-5.01); P = 0.003]. Other predictors of UBC were female gender, tobacco use, smoking duration, and occupational exposure. Plasma 25-OHD concentrations are low in Tunisian patients with UBC. These findings support experimental and epidemiological evidence of protective role of vitamin D against UBC but could not ascertain causal relationship. Further prospective studies and clinical trials are warranted to check causality.
26847182	The diagnostic accuracy of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography and computed tomography in staging bladder cancer: a single-institution study and a systematic review with meta-analysis.	PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to assess the diagnostic accuracy of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose with positron emission tomography and computed tomography (FDG-PET-CT) to predict nodal metastases in patients with bladder cancer (BC) scheduled to undergo radical cystectomy (RC). METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed records of patients diagnosed with BC and scheduled to undergo RC at our center from January 2011 through February 2015, who also underwent FDG-PET-CT at the time of diagnosis. All patients underwent RC and an extended pelvic lymph node dissection as the reference standard. The primary endpoints were the sensitivity, specificity and overall accuracy of FDG-PET-CT in detecting lymph node metastasis. We also examined its accuracy in identifying distant metastasis. In addition, we conducted a protocol-driven systematic review and meta-analysis of accuracy of FDG-PET-CT for preoperative staging of BC, as compared to CT alone, as reported in individual studies. To assess the methodological quality of eligible studies, we used the QUADAS-2 tool (a revised tool for the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies) and pooled diagnostic accuracy measures using Meta-DiSc statistical software. RESULTS: For detecting nodal metastases in 78 patients, the sensitivity of FDG-PET-CT was 0.56 (95 % CI 0.29-0.80) and the specificity, 0.98 (95 % CI 0.91-1.00). Pooled sensitivity and specificity for detecting lymph node metastasis were 0.57 and 0.95, respectively. Positive likelihood ratio was 9.02. All lesions that were suspicious for distant metastasis were found to be positive on biopsy. CONCLUSION: FDG-PET-CT was more accurate than CT alone in staging BC in patients undergoing surgery. Standardization of FDG-PET-CT protocol and cost-effectiveness analysis are required before widespread implementation of this technology.
26847023	Role of PET CT scan in redefining treatment of incidental gall bladder carcinoma.	INTRODUCTION: Incidental diagnosis of gall bladder cancer is increasing. The role of PET-CT in modifying the extent of surgery and adjuvant treatment is still unclear. We have evaluated the same in this study. METHODS: This is a prospective audit of gall bladder cancer from Tata Memorial Hospital, Mumbai, India. Patients found non-metastatic on initial imaging underwent laparotomy for revision surgery. RESULTS: One hundred and eight patients had a PET-CT scan done before revision surgery. Median duration of PET-CT from primary surgery was 42 days. PET scan of 64 (59.3%) patients had no uptake in body (N-PET). Rest had loco-regional uptake (L-PET). N-PET patients had lesser residual disease than L-PET patients (23% vs. 52%; P = 0.004). N-PET pT1b patients had no residual disease as compared to L-PET patients (0% vs. 33%, P = 0.028). pT1b patients did not have residual disease in liver wedge irrespective of PET status. Majority of the recurrences were distant and happened in pT2 patients. RFS was longer in N-PET than L-PET patients (P = 0.09) and in pT1b patients than pT2 and pT3 (P = 0.006). OS was longer in pT1b patients than pT2 patients (P = 0.038). CONCLUSIONS: PET-CT scan is useful to stratify patients with incidentally diagnosed gall bladder cancer for effective treatment. Liver wedge resection may be avoided in all pT1b patients. PET negative pT1b patients may be observed as chance of relapse is low. There may be a role for giving chemotherapy to all pT2 patients as they have high chance of recurrence and nodal metastases. J. Surg. Oncol. 2016;113:652-658. (c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
26844702	c-Met and CREB1 are involved in miR-433-mediated inhibition of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition in bladder cancer by regulating Akt/GSK-3beta/Snail signaling.	Emerging evidence has suggested that microRNAs (miRNAs) have an important role in tumor development and progression by regulating diverse cellular pathways. Here we describe the function and regulation network of miR-433 in bladder cancer (BCa). miR-433 is frequently downregulated in BCa tissues compared with adjacent non-cancerous tissues. Epigenetic mechanisms may be involved in the regulation of miR-433 expression. Enforced expression of miR-433 significantly inhibits proliferation, colony formation, migration, and invasion in BCa cells. In addition, miR-433 inhibits the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in BCa cells by regulating c-Met/Akt/GSK-3beta/Snail signaling pathway. Both c-Met and CREB1 are downstream target genes of miR-433. CREB1 can also indirectly regulate c-Met/Akt/GSK-3beta/Snail signaling via MITF. Furthermore, CREB1 expression is an independent prognostic factor for overall survival in patients with BCa. Finally, there appears to exist a reciprocal regulation between c-Met and miR-433/miR-409-3p. Taken together, this study reveals that miR-433-c-MET/CREB1-Akt/GSK-3beta/Snail signaling is critical to EMT in BCa. Targeting the pathway described here may open up new prospects to restrict metastatic progression of BCa.
26844474	Risk Factors Predictive of Recurrence and Progression for Patients Who Suffered Initial Recurrence After Transurethral Resection of Stage pT1 Bladder Tumor in Chinese Population: A Retrospective Study.	Bladder cancer is one of the most common malignancies worldwide and the stage pT1nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) has a high probability of recurrence after initial diagnosis and treatment. However, risk factors predictive of repeated recurrence and progression of pT1 bladder tumors after primary relapse have not been uncovered. Thus, we conducted the retrospective study.A total of 418 patients who suffered initial recurrence after transurethral resection (TUR) of pT1 bladder tumor were selected for the analyses. Clinic information of the patients was retrieved from their medical records. Recurrence-free survival (RFS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed using a Cox proportional hazards regression model. The probability of recurrence and progression by multivariate analyses was used as a surrogate marker to construct receiver operating curve (ROC).Results showed that variables including time to prior recurrence time, prior treatment, number of tumor, tumor size, tumor grade, and time of instillation after surgery were associated with the repeated recurrence of pT1 bladder tumor (P < 0.05). The variables including time to prior recurrence time, tumor size, tumor grade, carcinoma in situ (CIS), and time of instillation after surgery were associated with progression of pT1 bladder tumor (P < 0.05). In the present study, the multivariate model showed an area under ROC (AUC) value of 0.754 and 0.798 for tumor recurrence and progression, respectively, which was more effective in prediction than a single risk factor.In conclusion, we have identified several risk factors relevant to RFS and PFS for patients who have had a history of recurrence of pT1 bladder tumor after TUR. These predictive factors may help urologists to stratify patients into distinct risk groups of recurrence and progression, which probably contributes to the individualized treatment for patients.
26844468	Complete Response and Fatigue Improvement With the Combined Use of Cyclophosphamide and Quercetin in a Patient With Metastatic Bladder Cancer: A Case Report.	Bladder cancer is a major cause of cancer-related mortality, with an estimated 74,000 new cases and 16,000 deaths in the United States in 2015. In patients with metastatic disease, vinflunine and taxanes are the most widely used chemotherapy agents in the second-line setting after failure of platinum-based treatment. Cyclophosphamide has been used in combination with paclitaxel in urothelial carcinoma of the bladder, but there are no data about the effectiveness of cyclophosphamide administered as a single agent.We here describe the first case of an advanced bladder cancer patient suffering from grade 2 fatigue.He benefited from administration of third-line single-agent metronomic oral cyclophosphamide plus oral doses of quercetin. A complete, prolonged radiologic response according to the RECIST criteria 1.1 was achieved with minimal toxicity and an improvement in fatigue.Further studies are required to assess the potential benefits associated with the combined use of cyclophosphamide plus quercetin in advanced bladder cancer patients.
26845054	Transurethral Resection of the Prostate Biopsy of Suspected Anterior Prostate Cancers Identified by Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging: A Pilot Study of a Novel Technique.	OBJECTIVE: To describe a novel biopsy technique that involves performing a cognitively directed transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) to diagnose suspected anterior prostate cancers (APCs) detected by multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) in patients with prior negative transrectal ultrasound (TRUS)-guided biopsies. METHODS: This is a prospective study in which participants aged 50-75 were offered inclusion if they had an elevated prostate-specific antigen level, a lesion suspicious for APC on mpMRI, and at least one prior negative TRUS-guided prostate biopsy. Prostatic mpMRI was acquired with a 3-Tesla machine without endorectal coil. Preoperative review of the mpMRI images was used to target the suspected APC on TURP biopsy. The primary outcome was the detection rate of clinically significant prostate cancer, defined as the presence of any Gleason pattern >/= 4 in the specimen. Secondary outcomes included biopsy-related complications including 30-day readmissions. RESULTS: A total of 16 consecutive participants were enrolled. Median age was 64 years, median prostate-specific antigen was 12.4 ng/mL, and participants had a median of 2 prior negative TRUS-guided biopsies. Thirteen (81.3%) participants had clinically significant APCs detected by TURP biopsy. One participant was readmitted within 30-days postprocedure for continuous bladder irrigation. Seven participants (43.8%) underwent radical prostatectomy that confirmed clinically significant disease in all 7 participants. CONCLUSION: Among participants with anterior prostate lesions on mpMRI and prior negative TRUS-guided biopsy, TURP biopsy does detect some clinically significant cancers. This study serves as a proof of concept and further comparative trials are needed prior to widespread adoption.
26844572	Emerging Immunotargets in Bladder Cancer.	Bladder cancer treatment, namely systemic therapy, was dominated in the last three decades due to the absence of newer therapeutic options other than chemotherapy regimens. Chemotherapy, by itself, both in first and second-line seems to have achieved the modest plateau of its possibilities at the cost of non-negligible toxicity. Targeted therapies, which changed the therapy of many different tumors, seem rather ineffective in bladder cancer. More recently, a new generation of Immunotherapy based regimens represent the most promising avenue for the future systemic treatment of bladder cancer. Checkpoint inhibition, namely PD1/PD-L1 pathway inhibition, showed impressive results in many other tumor types and are expected to become a major player in the treatment of bladder cancer. Other immunotherapy strategies such as fusion proteins represent distant, although promising, options. A brief overview of the current status of bladder cancer immunotherapy is presented.
26843415	Does solitary- and organ-confined metastasectomy really improve survival in advanced urologic malignancies?	The role of metastasectomy on survival in advanced/urologic malignancies still remains unclear. Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is the most common solid tumor within the kidney. 25-30 % of patients have metastases at manifestation. Urothelial carcinoma (UC) consists of bladder carcinoma, upper urinary tract urothelial cell carcinoma and urethral carcinoma. Bladder cancer is the ninth most common cancer worldwide. Half of patients with muscle invasive bladder cancer have lymph node or distant metastases. In metastatic disease first-line treatment is multi-agent platinum-based systemic chemotherapy. Testicular cancer is the most common cancer in men between the age of 15 and 35. Testicular tumors represent excellent oncologic outcomes. Prostate cancer is the most common solid tumor in Europe. Surgical resection of metastases can be considered as a treatment choice in advanced/metastatic urologic malignancies to improve survival rates, particularly in RCC and UC. Metastasectomy can be suggested in conjunction with effective chemotherapy if complete resection is possible. Solitary metastasectomy can represent better survival rates compared to multiple metastasectomy even if multiple metastases confined to single organ. Site of metastases is one of the main determinants of successful metastasectomy such as lung metastasectomy in urothelial cell carcinoma and liver metastasectomy in RCC may lead to better oncologic outcomes. Due to the lack of the relevant data it is not possible to make an evidence-based recommendation on the role of metastasectomy for solitary-/organ-confined metastases of prostate cancer, testicular cancer and penile cancer.
26841650	[Renal urothelial carcinoma mainly composed of signet-ring cells].	Autopsy study of an 80-year-old man has identified his renal tumor metastasizing to the heart, lung, and liver as urothelial car- cinoma; at the same time some cells in the main tumor and all cells in the metastases had a signet-ring phenotype, but neither mucicarcimine nor alcian blue stained the cell cytoplasm. The paper provides the histological and immunohistochemical pattern of the tumor and emphasizes its exclusive rarity. Attention is drawn to the possibility of signet-ring cell transformation in the cells of different tumors, including nonepithelial ones.
26838586	Can We Be Less Radical with Surgery for Early Cervical Cancer?	Although a rare cancer in the developed world due to the success of cervical screening programmes, cervical cancer remains one of the most common cancers diagnosed in women under the age of 35 years old. Radical hysterectomy and more recently radical trachelectomy have been highly effective in curing the majority of women with early stage disease. Many, however, are left with long-term 'survivorship' issues including bowel, bladder and sexual dysfunction. In view of these chronic co-morbidities, many clinicians now consider whether a less radical approach to surgery may be an option for some women. This review focuses on the current evidence for the safety of conservative surgery for early stage cervical cancer with regard to cure rates in comparison to standard management, as well as any improvement in short and long-term morbidity associated with a more conservative approach.
26838546	Promotion of mitotic catastrophe via activation of PTEN by paclitaxel with supplement of mulberry water extract in bladder cancer cells.	Paclitaxel is a mitotic inhibitor used in cancer chemotherapy. Mulberry fruit is rich in phenolic compounds and flavonoids and exhibits chemopreventive activities. In this study, mulberry water extract (MWE) was used as a supplement to synergize with the effects of paclitaxel in the treatment of the TSGH 8301 human bladder cancer cell line. Treatment with paclitaxel combined with MWE (paclitaxel/MWE) enhanced the cytotoxicity of paclitaxel and induced severe G2/M arrest, mitotic catastrophe and subsequent apoptosis, as shown by MTT assay, HE staining and flow cytometry analyses. Differences in the expression and activation of Aurora A and Plk1 between cells treated with paclitaxel/MWE and paclitaxel alone suggested that the combined treatment caused a defect in the early steps of cytokinesis. Paclitaxel/MWE decreased EEA1 immunofluorescence staining and increased the expression of PTEN, indicating that the regimen inhibited the formation of the recycling endosome, which is required for cytokinesis. Paclitaxel/MWE also retarded tumor growth in a TSGH 8301 xenograft model via activation of PTEN and Caspase 3. These data demonstrated a synergistic effect on the anticancer efficacy of paclitaxel through MWE supplementation by promoting mitotic catastrophe through the activation of PTEN, providing a novel and effective therapeutic option for bladder cancer treatment strategies.
26838297	Urothelial carcinoma presenting with distant metastasis to the rectum.	Urothelial carcinomas (UC) arise from transitional cells in the urothelial tract. Advanced cases can spread locally to invade surrounding organs, or metastasise distantly to the lungs, bone or liver. We describe a case of an elderly woman with no previous cancer history, presenting with symptoms of an unusual distant metastasis.
26838243	Epidemiology, Incidence and Mortality of Bladder Cancer and their Relationship with the Development Index in the World.	BACKGROUND: Bladder cancer is an international public health problem. It is the ninth most common cancer and the fourteenth leading cause of death due to cancer worldwide. Given aging populations, the incidence of this cancer is rising. Information on the incidence and mortality of the disease, and their relationship with level of economic development is essential for better planning. The aim of the study was to investigate bladder cancer incidence and mortality rates, and their relationship with the the Human Development Index (HDI) in the world. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data were obtained from incidence and mortality rates presented by GLOBOCAN in 2012. Data on HDI and its components were extracted from the global bank site. The number and standardized incidence and mortality rates were reported by regions and the distribution of the disease were drawn in the world. For data analysis, the relationship between incidence and death rates, and HDI and its components was measured using correlation coefficients and SPSS software. The level of significance was set at 0.05. RESULTS: In 2012, 429,793 bladder cancer cases and 165,084 bladder death cases occurred in the world. Five countries that had the highest age-standardized incidence were Belgium 17.5 per 100,000, Lebanon 16.6/100,000, Malta 15.8/100,000, Turkey 15.2/100,000, and Denmark 14.4/100,000. Five countries that had the highest age-standardized death rates were Turkey 6.6 per 100,000, Egypt 6.5/100,000, Iraq 6.3/100,000, Lebanon 6.3/100,000, and Mali 5.2/100,000. There was a positive linear relationship between the standardized incidence rate and HDI (r=0.653, P<0.001), so that there was a positive correlation between the standardized incidence rate with life expectancy at birth, average years of schooling, and the level of income per person of population. A positive linear relationship was also noted between the standardized mortality rate and HDI (r=0.308, P<0.001). There was a positive correlation between the standardized mortality rate with life expectancy at birth, average years of schooling, and the level of income per person of population. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of bladder cancer in developed countries and parts of Africa was higher, while the highest mortality rate was observed in the countries of North Africa and the Middle East. The program for better treatment in developing countries to reduce mortality from the cancer and more detaiuled studies on the etiology of are essential.
26838193	Diabetes is an Important Risk Factor for Metastasis in Non- Muscle-Invasive Bladder Cancer.	BACKGROUND: Epidemiological evidence indicates that individuals with diabetes mellitus (DM) may have a modestly increased risk of bladder cancer. In the present study, we aimed to show any association between DM and risk of metastasis in patients with non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 698 patients between January 2007 and December 2014 who were diagnosed with and underwent transurethral resection of bladder tumors (TUR-BT). Comparisons of means was conducted by independent samples t test, and relations between categorical variables were investigated by non-parametric chi- square test. A p value of 0.05 was accepted as statistically significant in comparisons. RESULTS: We analyzed 418 patients with non muscle invasive bladder cancer. 123 of whom were diabetic and 295 non-diabetic. In diabetic patients, 13 were N1 stage and 11 M1 stage. When compared with non diabetic patients that was statistically significant (p<0.001). TNM stages were more advanced in diabetic patients (p<0.001), but concurrent CIS (p=0.1) and squamous metaplasia did not significantly differ between diabetic and non-diabetic cases (p=1). CONCLUSIONS: Diabetic patients with non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer may suffer metastases earlier than expected although they are non invasive. Therefore such patients must be followed-up carefully and early cystectomy decision may be necessary. Further prospective studies with more patients are needed to confirm these findings.
26838030	Complete loss of STAG2 expression is an indicator of good prognosis in patients with bladder cancer.	Stromal antigen 2 (STAG2) is an important member of cohesin, a conserved complex holding the sister chromatid together. Recent whole-genome sequencing studies have identified that genetic alterations of stag2 are common in bladder cancer (BC). The prognostic implications of STAG2 expression in BC remain unclear; we therefore analyzed its associations with the histopathological characteristics and clinical outcome in a Chinese population. We used immunohistochemistry assay to determine STAG2 protein expression in tumor tissues from 125 BC patients. STAG2 expression was analyzed according to clinicopathological features and patients' survival. Univariable and multivariable analyses were performed to identify predictors for recurrence-free survival (RFS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS). STAG2 expression was detected in 79.2 % of BC tissues, and 20.8 % of the tumor tissues had a complete loss of STAG2 protein expression. This STAG2-negative result was associated with a lower tumor histological grade with P = 0.009. The log-rank analysis revealed that the complete loss of STAG2 expression was associated with a lower risk of recurrence (P = 0.023) and a diminished risk of death (P = 0.034), especially in the subgroup of muscle-invasive BC (P = 0.043 for RFS and P = 0.087 for CSS). In multivariable Cox regression models, the loss of STAG2 expression remained a beneficial factor for RFS and CSS of BC patients. Univariate and multivariate analyses' results indicated that the complete loss of STAG2 expression was predictive for better RFS and CSS, suggesting its potential value as a prognostic biomarker.
26837847	The miR-130 family promotes cell migration and invasion in bladder cancer through FAK and Akt phosphorylation by regulating PTEN.	Bladder cancer causes an estimated 150,000 deaths per year worldwide. Although 15% of the recurrent bladder cancer becomes an invasive type, currently used targeted therapy for malignant bladder cancer is still not efficient. We focused on the miR-130 family (miR-130b, miR-301a, and miR-301b) that was significantly upregulated in bladder cancer specimens than that of the normal urothelial specimens. We analyzed the functional significance of miR-130 family using a 5637 bladder cancer cell line and revealed that miR-130 family of inhibitors suppressed cell migration and invasion by downregulating focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and Akt phosphorylation. Mechanistic analyses indicate that the miR-130 family directly targets phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted from chromosome 10 (PTEN), resulting in the upregulation of FAK and Akt phosphorylation. In clinical bladder cancer specimens, downregulation of PTEN was found to be closely correlated with miR-130 family expression levels. Overall, the miR-130 family has a crucial role in malignant progression of bladder cancer and thus the miR-130 family could be a promising therapeutic target for invasive bladder cancer.
26836010	In vivo electric conductivity of cervical cancer patients based on B(1)(+) maps at 3T MRI.	The in vivo electric conductivity (sigma) values of tissue are essential for accurate electromagnetic simulations and specific absorption rate (SAR) assessment for applications such as thermal dose computations in hyperthermia. Currently used sigma-values are mostly based on ex vivo measurements. In this study the conductivity of human muscle, bladder content and cervical tumors is acquired non-invasively in vivo using MRI. The conductivity of 20 cervical cancer patients was measured with the MR-based electric properties tomography method on a standard 3T MRI system. The average in vivo sigma-value of muscle is 14% higher than currently used in human simulation models. The sigma-value of bladder content is an order of magnitude higher than the value for bladder wall tissue that is used for the complete bladder in many models. Our findings are confirmed by various in vivo animal studies from the literature. In cervical tumors, the observed average conductivity was 13% higher than the literature value reported for cervical tissue. Considerable deviations were found for the electrical conductivity observed in this study and the commonly used values for SAR assessment, emphasizing the importance of acquiring in vivo conductivity for more accurate SAR assessment in various applications.
26835590	Podoplanin serum and urine concentration in transitional bladder cancer.	BACKGROUND: Podoplanin (PDP) is a mucin - a type of transmembrane protein expressed in numerous tissues during ontogeny and in adult animals, including the brain, heart, kidney, osteoblasts and lymphoid organs. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine podoplanin concentration in the blood serum and urine of patients with bladder cancer. Quantifying podoplanin concentration and its correlation with various clinicopathological parameters may be useful for more accurate predictions and identifying high-risk patients. METHODS: The present study included 82 patients with bladder cancer confirmed by transurethral resection or cystectomy and 27 healthy volunteers. The Surface Plasmon Resonance Imaging biosensor was applied for the detection of podoplanin in the serum and urine samples. RESULTS: Significant differences in serum and urine podoplanin concentration levels were observed between bladder cancer patients. The statistically significant higher values of PDP were detected in serum of patients with invasive, more aggressive, larger, multifocal tumors. CONCLUSIONS: The association between podoplanin concentration and clinicopathological features indicates that it might be useful while making therapeutic decisions.
26832795	Induction of miR-137 by Isorhapontigenin (ISO) Directly Targets Sp1 Protein Translation and Mediates Its Anticancer Activity Both In Vitro and In Vivo.	Our recent studies found that isorhapontigenin (ISO) showed a significant inhibitory effect on human bladder cancer cell growth, accompanied with cell-cycle G0-G1 arrest as well as downregulation of Cyclin D1 expression at transcriptional level via inhibition of Sp1 transactivation in bladder cancer cells. In the current study, the potential ISO inhibition of bladder tumor formation has been explored in a xenograft nude mouse model, and the molecular mechanisms underlying ISO inhibition of Sp1 expression and anticancer activities have been elucidated both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, the studies demonstrated that ISO treatment induced the expression of miR-137, which in turn suppressed Sp1 protein translation by directly targeting Sp1 mRNA 3'-untranslated region (UTR). Similar to ISO treatment, ectopic expression of miR-137 alone led to G0-G1 cell growth arrest and inhibition of anchorage-independent growth in human bladder cancer cells, which could be completely reversed by overexpression of GFP-Sp1. The inhibition of miR-137 expression attenuated ISO-induced inhibition of Sp1/Cyclin D1 expression, induction of G0-G1 cell growth arrest, and suppression of cell anchorage-independent growth. Taken together, our studies have demonstrated that miR-137 induction by ISO targets Sp1 mRNA 3'-UTR and inhibits Sp1 protein translation, which consequently results in reduction of Cyclin D1 expression, induction of G0-G1 growth arrest, and inhibition of anchorage-independent growth in vitro and in vivo. Our results have provided novel insights into understanding the anticancer activity of ISO in the therapy of human bladder cancer.
26832677	Dose escalation with external beam radiation therapy and high-dose-rate brachytherapy combined with long-term androgen deprivation therapy in high and very high risk prostate cancer: Comparison of two consecutive high-dose-rate schemes.	PURPOSE: To compare rectal toxicity, urinary toxicity, and nadir+2 PSA relapse-free survival (bRFS) in two consecutive Phase II protocols of high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy used at the authors institution from 2001 to 2012. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Patients with National Comprehensive Cancer Network high risk and very high risk prostate cancer enrolled in studies HDR4 (2001-2007, n = 183) and HDR2 (2007-2012, n = 56) were analyzed. Patients received minipelvis external beam radiation therapy/intensity-modulated external radiotherapy to 54 Gy and 2 years of androgen blockade along with HDR brachytherapy. HDR4 protocol consisted of four 4.75 Gy fractions delivered in 48 hours; the HDR2 protocol delivered two 9.5 Gy fractions in 24 hours. Average 2-Gy equivalent dose (alpha/beta = 1.2) prostate D90 doses for the HDR4 and HDR2 groups were 89.8 Gy and 110.5 Gy, respectively (p = 0.0001). Both groups were well balanced regarding risk factors. Prior transurethral resection of the prostate was more frequent in the HDR2 group (p = 0.001). RESULTS: After a median followup of 7.4 years (range, 2-11.2), there was no difference in adverse grade >/= 2 rectal events (HDR4 = 10.4% vs. HDR2 = 12.5%; p = ns) or grade >/=3 (HDR4 = 2.2% vs. HDR2 = 3.6%; p = ns). No differences in urinary grade >/=2 adverse events (HDR4 = 23% vs. HDR2 = 26.8%; p = ns) or grade >/=3 (HDR4 = 7.7% vs. HDR2 = 8.9%; p = ns) were detected. The 7-year bRFS for HDR4 and HDR2 protocols was 88.7% and 87.8%, respectively (p = ns). CONCLUSIONS: HDR4 and HDR2 protocols produce similar results in terms of toxicity and bRFS at the intermediate time point of 7 years.
26831229	Implementation of Constant Dose Rate and Constant Angular Spacing Intensity-modulated Arc Therapy for Cervical Cancer by Using a Conventional Linear Accelerator.	BACKGROUND: Volumetric-modulated arc therapy (VMAT) can only be implemented on the new generation linacs such as the Varian Trilogy(R) and Elekta Synergy(R). This prevents most existing linacs from delivering VMAT. The purpose of this study was to investigate the feasibility of using a conventional linear accelerator delivering constant dose rate and constant angular spacing intensity-modulated arc therapy (CDR-CAS-IMAT) for treating cervical cancer. METHODS: Twenty patients with cervical cancer previously treated with intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) using Varian Clinical 23EX were retreated using CDR-CAS-IMAT. The planning target volume (PTV) was set as 50.4 Gy in 28 fractions. Plans were evaluated based on the ability to meet the dose volume histogram. The homogeneity index (HI), target volume conformity index (CI), the dose to organs at risk, radiation delivery time, and monitor units (MUs) were also compared. The paired t-test was used to analyze the two data sets. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 19.0 software. RESULTS: Compared to the IMRT group, the CDR-CAS-IMAT group showed better PTV CI (0.85 +/- 0.03 vs. 0.81 +/- 0.03, P = 0.001), clinical target volume CI (0.46 +/- 0.05 vs. 0.43 +/- 0.05, P = 0.001), HI (0.09 +/- 0.02 vs. 0.11 +/- 0.02, P = 0.005) and D95 (5196.33 +/- 28.24 cGy vs. 5162.63 +/- 31.12 cGy, P = 0.000), and cord D2 (3743.8 +/- 118.7 cGy vs. 3806.2 +/- 98.7 cGy, P = 0.017) and rectum V40 (41.9 +/- 6.1% vs. 44.2 +/- 4.8%, P = 0.026). Treatment time (422.7 +/- 46.7 s vs. 84.6 +/- 7.8 s, P = 0.000) and the total plan Mus (927.4 +/- 79.1 vs. 787.5 +/- 78.5, P = 0.000) decreased by a factor of 0.8 and 0.15, respectively. The IMRT group plans were superior to the CDR-CAS-IMAT group plans considering decreasing bladder V50 (17.4 +/- 4.5% vs. 16.6 +/- 4.2%, P = 0.049), bowel V30 (39.6 +/- 6.5% vs. 36.6 +/- 7.5%, P = 0.008), and low-dose irradiation volume; there were no significant differences in other statistical indexes. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with cervical cancer treated with CDR-CAS-IMAT using Varian Clinical 23EX can get equivalent or superior dose distribution compared to those treated with IMRT. CDR-CAS-IMAT has a less treatment time and MU, which can reduce the uncertainty factor and patient discomfort in treatment.
26830645	The effect of sevoflurane versus desflurane on postoperative catheter-related bladder discomfort in patients undergoing transurethral excision of a bladder tumour: a randomized controlled trial.	PURPOSE: Catheter-related bladder discomfort (CRBD) due to an indwelling urinary catheter can cause postoperative distress, and the mechanism underlying CRBD is linked to the activation of muscarinic receptors. Inhalation of anesthetic agents, such as sevoflurane and desflurane, has differential inhibitory effects on muscarinic receptors. We aimed to compare the effect of intraoperative sevoflurane vs desflurane inhalation on postoperative CRBD. METHODS: Eighty-nine patients undergoing transurethral resection of a bladder tumour (TURBT) were randomly allocated to two groups. The sevoflurane group (n = 45) and the desflurane group (n = 44) received the respective inhalational agents for maintenance of general anesthesia. The incidence and severity (mild/moderate/severe) of CRBD were assessed at zero, one, six, and 24 hr postoperatively. RESULTS: Catheter-related bladder discomfort during the first 24 hr postoperatively occurred in 34/45 (76%) patients receiving sevoflurane compared with 41/44 (93%) patients receiving desflurane [absolute difference 18%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2 to 33; P = 0.039]. The differences in the rate of CRBD between the sevoflurane and desflurane groups at zero, one, and six hours postoperatively were 24% (95% CI, 7 to 40; P = 0.012), 33% (95% CI, 15 to 49; P = 0.001), and 26% (95% CI, 6 to 43; P = 0.019), respectively. The incidence of moderate to severe CRBD and the number of patients treated with tramadol for CRBD were comparable between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: As a maintenance agent of general anesthesia, sevoflurane reduced the incidence of early postoperative CRBD in patients undergoing TURBT when compared with desflurane. The protocol for this clinical trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02096224).
26830497	A multiplex immunoassay for the non-invasive detection of bladder cancer.	BACKGROUND: Urine based assays that can non-invasively detect bladder cancer (BCa) have the potential to reduce unnecessary and invasive procedures. The purpose of this study was to develop a multiplex immunoassay that can accurately and simultaneously monitor ten diagnostic urinary protein biomarkers for application as a non-invasive test for BCa detection. METHODS: A custom electrochemiluminescent multiplex assay was constructed (Meso Scale Diagnostics, LLC, Rockville, MD, USA) to detect the following urinary proteins; IL8, MMP9, MMP10, ANG, APOE, SDC1, A1AT, PAI1, CA9 and VEGFA. Voided urine samples from two cohorts were collected prior to cystoscopy and samples were analyzed blinded to the clinical status of the participants. Means (+/-SD) and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis were used to compare assay performance and to assess the diagnostic accuracy of the diagnostic signature. RESULTS: Comparative diagnostic performance analyses revealed an AUROC value of 0.9258 for the multiplex assay and 0.9467 for the combination of the single-target ELISA assays (p = 0.625), so there was no loss of diagnostic utility for the MSD multiplex assay. Analysis of the independent 200-sample cohort using the multiplex assay achieved an overall diagnostic sensitivity of 0.85, specificity of 0.81, positive predictive value 0.82 and negative predictive value 0.84. CONCLUSIONS: It is technically feasible to simultaneously monitor complex urinary diagnostic signatures in a single assay without loss of performance. The described protein-based assay has the potential to be developed for the non-invasive detection of BCa.
26830472	Epitelial-to-mesenchimal transition and invasion are upmodulated by tumor-expressed granzyme B and inhibited by docosahexaenoic acid in human colorectal cancer cells.	BACKGROUND: Granzyme B (GrB) is a serine protease, traditionally known as expressed by cytotoxic lymphocytes to induce target cell apoptosis. However, it is emerging that GrB, being also produced by a variety of normal and neoplastic cells and potentially acting on multiple targets, might represent a powerful regulator of a wide range of fundamental biological processes. We have previously shown that GrB is expressed in urothelial carcinoma tissues and its expression is associated to both pathological tumor spreading and EMT. We have also shown that docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), a dietary omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid with anti-tumor activity, while inhibiting urothelial and pancreatic carcinoma cell invasion also inhibited their GrB expression in vitro. In this study, we characterized a panel of colorectal carcinoma (CRC) cells, with different invasive capabilities, for GrB expression and for the contribution of GrB to their EMT and invasive phenotype. In addition, we investigated the effect of DHA on CRC cell-associated GrB expression, EMT and invasion. METHODS: The expression levels of GrB and EMT-related markers were evaluated by Western blotting. GrB knockdown was performed by Stealth RNAi small interfering RNA silencing and ectopic GrB expression by transfection of human GrB vector. Cell invasion was determined by the BioCoat Matrigel invasion chamber test. RESULTS: GrB was produced in 57.1% CRC cell lines and 100% CRC-derived Cancer Stem Cells. Although GrB was constitutive expressed in both invasive and noninvasive CRC cells, GrB depletion in invasive CRC cells downmodulated their invasion in vitro, suggesting a contribution of GrB to CRC invasiveness. GrB loss or gain of function downmodulated or upmodulated EMT, respectively, according to the analysis of cancer cell expression of three EMT biomarkers (Snail1, E-cadherin, N-cadherin). Moreover, TGF-beta1-driven EMT was associated to the enhancement of GrB expression in CRC cell lines, and GrB depletion led to downmodulation of TGF-beta1-driven EMT. In addition, DHA inhibited GrB expression, EMT and invasion in CRC cells in vitro. CONCLUSIONS: These findings present a novel role for GrB as upmodulator of EMT in CRC cells. Moreover, these results support the use of DHA, a dietary compound without toxic effects, as adjuvant in CRC therapy.
26830151	What is the Asian Consensus Statement on NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology (NCCN-ACS)?	Cancer treatment guidelines are compiled on the basis of established evidence. Such evidence is obtained from epidemiological, pathological and pharmacological study and, most importantly of all, the information gained from clinical trials. However, very little of the kind of evidence that is required for the compilation of treatment guidelines is actually obtained from Asian countries. When one considers the ethnic differences and disparities in medical care, coupled with the tremendous cultural diversity that characterize the Asian region, it would be difficult to conclude that there is currently sufficient evidence that could form the basis for the formulation of guidelines that would be relevant and applicable to all Asian countries. An urgent issue that needs to be addressed in order to achieve a breakthrough in this difficult situation is to build up a body of evidence at an advanced level that is specific to the Asian region and Asian ethnicities. For the interim, however, it is also necessary to efficiently incorporate evidence that has been obtained in Western countries. Furthermore, an effective method of utilizing guidelines that have already been compiled in Western countries is considered to be not by simply translating them into local languages, but rather to engage in a process of adaptation, whereby the guidelines are adjusted or modified to match the circumstances of a particular country or region. The NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines-Asian Consensus Statement (NCCN-ACS) documents have been compiled with this intention in mind, utilizing the NCCN guidelines that are widely used internationally.
26830085	CD47: a potential immunotherapy target for eliminating cancer cells.	The relationship between the immune system and cancer growth and aggravation has been discussed over a century. A number of molecules have been shown to participate in this process. CD47, a normal universally expressed member of the immunoglobulin superfamily, plays multiple functions in immune system. Researches demonstrated that CD47 was also highly expressed on the surface of tumor cells as well as cancer stem cells (CSCs). Whether the highly expressed CD47 was associated with tumor growth, metastasis, recurrence, or drug resistance has become the hotspot. Besides the roles of CD47 in tumor immunoregulation, the monoclonal antibodies targeting CD47 used in acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and bladder CSCs were reported, which shed new light on tumor treatment. CSCs have been recognized as the root of tumor drug resistance and recurrence. Whether CD47 on CSCs could serve as a potential target for future anti-cancer treatment forms the focus of our review. Here we highlight the potential roles of CD47 in immune system, and discuss the promising therapeutic application of anti-CD47 antibodies for eliminating tumor cells.
26828111	Genetic polymorphisms of human UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) genes and cancer risk.	Identification of genetic polymorphisms that contribute to the risk of developing cancers is important for cancer prevention. The most recent human genome GRCh38/hg38 assembly (2013) reveals thousands of genetic polymorphisms in human uridine diphosphoglucuronosyltransferase (UGT) genes. Among these, a large number of polymorphisms at the UGT1A and UGT2B genes have been shown to modulate UGT gene promoter activity or enzymatic activity. Glucuronidation plays an important role in the metabolism and clearance of endogenous and exogenous carcinogenic compounds, and this reaction is primarily catalyzed by the UGT1A and UGT2B enzymes. Therefore, it has long been hypothesized that UGT polymorphisms that reduce the capacity to glucuronidate carcinogens and other types of cancer-promoting molecules (e.g. sex hormones) are associated with an increased risk of developing cancers. A large number of case-control studies have investigated this hypothesis and these studies identified numerous UGT polymorphisms in UGT1A and UGT2B genes as genetic risk factors for a wide variety of cancers, including bladder, breast, colorectal, endometrial, esophageal, head and neck, liver, lung, prostate, and thyroid. These UGT polymorphisms may be cancer causative polymorphisms, or be linked to as yet undefined causative polymorphisms, either in UGT genes or neighboring genes. This article presents a comprehensive review of these case-control studies, discusses current areas of uncertainty, and highlights future research directions in this field.
26825880	Latent Tuberculosis Infection and the Risk of Subsequent Cancer.	The association of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) with subsequent cancer remains unclear. We investigated the risk of future cancer among tuberculosis (TB) contacts with or without subsequent TB activation. Using the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database, we conducted a nationwide population-based study. TB contacts during 1997 to 2012 were included as the study cohort. Patients with antecedent cancer and TB were excluded. Data from 11,522 TB contacts and 46,088 age-, sex-, and enrollment date-matched subjects during 1997 to 2012 were analyzed. The 2 cohorts were monitored until December 31, 2012 for incidence of cancer and TB infection. LTBI was defined as a TB contact with subsequent TB activation. The primary endpoint was occurrence of newly diagnosed cancer. There was no difference in cancer development between the TB contact cohort and comparison cohort (log-rank test, P = 0.714). After multivariate adjustment, the hazard ratio (HR) for cancer among the LTBI patients was 2.29 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.26-4.17; P = 0.007]. There was increase in cancer incidences for several specific cancer types, including multiple myeloma (HR 340.28), lung (HR 2.69), kidney and bladder (HR 6.16), hepatobiliary (HR 2.36), and gastrointestinal (HR 2.99) cancers. None of the 136 TB contacts who received isoniazid prophylaxis developed cancer. LTBI patients had a higher risk of future cancer.
26825038	Radicality of initial surgery for primary malignant melanoma of the vagina.	Radical surgery is considered not to improve the prognosis of primary malignant melanoma of the vagina (PMMV). This study was carried out to review the general consensus. A systematic review was performed on the basis of data from 10 patients in our cohort and 147 patients in the previous literature. The radicality of the initial surgery (RAINS) score was defined as the total number of points in terms of the resected organs. The target organs were the vagina, vulva, urethra, bladder, uterus, anus, rectum, pelvic lymph nodes, and inguinal lymph nodes. Overall survival (OS) according to the RAINS score was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method. Information on tumor stage, size, and depth of invasion was not obtained in 15, 47, and 43% of patients, respectively. The median follow-up period was 18 months. OS with a RAINS score of at least 7 was significantly longer than that with a RAINS score of up to 6 (median survival time, 41 vs. 19 months; log-rank test, P=0.037), despite the fact that the former group included significantly more patients with advanced-stage disease. A significant difference in OS was not found between patients with a RAINS score of at least 6 and up to 5. The therapeutic significance of radical surgery for PMMV has not been assessed appropriately in previous studies because of the lack of comparability among groups and differences in the definitions of surgical radicality. Patients with PMMV might benefit from initial surgery with appropriate surgical radicality, despite incomplete validation of the RAINS score.
