28420378	A cross-sectional survey assessing factors associated with reading cancer screening information: previous screening behaviour, demographics and decision-making style.	BACKGROUND: There is broad agreement that cancer screening invitees should know the risks and benefits of testing before deciding whether to participate. In organised screening programmes, a primary method of relaying this information is via leaflets provided at the time of invitation. Little is known about why individuals do not engage with this information. This study assessed factors associated with reading information leaflets provided by the three cancer screening programmes in England. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey asked screening-eligible members of the general population in England about the following predictor variables: uptake of previous screening invitations, demographic characteristics, and 'decision-making styles' (i.e. the extent to which participants tended to make decisions in a way that was avoidant, rational, intuitive, spontaneous, or dependent). The primary outcome measures were the amount of the leaflet that participants reported having read at their most recent invitation, for any of the three programmes for which they were eligible. Associations between these outcomes and predictor variables were assessed using binary or ordinal logistic regression. RESULTS: After exclusions, data from 275, 309, and 556 participants were analysed in relation to the breast, cervical, and bowel screening programmes, respectively. Notable relationships included associations between regularity of screening uptake and reading (more of) the information leaflets for all programmes (e.g. odds ratio: 0.16 for participants who never/very rarely attended breast screening vs. those who always attended previously; p = .009). Higher rational decision-making scores were associated with reading more of the cervical and bowel screening leaflets (OR: 1.13, p < .0005 and OR: 1.11, p = .045, respectively). Information engagement was also higher for White British participants compared with other ethnic groups for breast (OR: 3.28, p = .008) and bowel (OR: 2.58, p = .015) information; an opposite relationship was observed for older participants (OR: 0.96, p = .048; OR: 0.92, p = .029). CONCLUSIONS: Interventions that increase screening uptake may also increase subsequent engagement with information. Future research could investigate how to improve engagement at initial invitations. There may also be scope to reduce barriers to accessing non-English information and alternative communication strategies may benefit participants who are less inclined to weigh up advantages and disadvantages as part of their decision-making.
28414756	Reduction in the copy number and expression level of the recurrent human papillomavirus integration gene fragile histidine triad (FHIT) predicts the transition of cervical lesions.	Cervical cancer is the second most common cancer and the third leading cause of cancer death in females worldwide, especially in developing countries. High risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) infection causes cervical cancer and precancerous cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). Integration of the HR-HPV genome into the host chromatin is an important step in cervical carcinogenesis. The detection of integrated papillomavirus sequences-PCR (DIPS-PCR) allowed us to explore HPV integration in the human genome and to determine the pattern of this integration. We performed DIPS-PCR for 4 cell lines including 3 cervical cancer cell lines and 40 tissue samples. Overall, 32 HR-HPV integration loci were detected in the clinical samples and the HeLa and SiHa cell lines. Among all the integration loci, we identified three recurrent integration loci: 3p14.2 (3 samples), 13q22.1 (2 samples and a SiHa cell line) and 8q24 (1 sample and a HeLa cell line). To further explore the effect of HR-HPV integration in the 3p14.2 locus, we used fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to determine the copy number of the 3p14.2 locus and immunohistochemistry (IHC) to determine the protein expression levels of the related FHIT gene in the clinical samples. Both the 3p14.2 locus copy number and FHIT protein expression levels showed significant decreases when CIN transitioned to cervical cancer. HPV copy number was also evaluated in these clinical samples, and the copy number of HPV increased significantly between CIN and cervical cancer samples. Finally, we employed receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC curve) analysis to evaluate the potential of all these indexes in distinguishing CIN and cervical cancer, and the HPV copy number, FHIT copy number and FHIT protein expression levels have good diagnostic efficiencies.
28414550	Expression of Long Noncoding RNA Urothelial Cancer Associated 1 Promotes Cisplatin Resistance in Cervical Cancer.	Cisplatin resistance is still one of the main reasons for failure of clinical therapy for cervical cancer. But the underlying molecular mechanisms involved in cisplatin resistance of cervical cancer have still remained unclear. Recent studies reported that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are novel nonprotein-coding transcripts, which might play a key role in cancer biogenesis and prognosis. One of the lncRNAs, urothelial cancer associated 1 (UCA1), has been shown to promote different types of cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. This study showed that overexpression of UCA1 confers cisplatin resistance by promoting cancer cell proliferation and inhibiting apoptosis. In addition, knockdown of UCA1 remarkably decreased cisplatin resistance in cervical cancer cells. Moreover, results also indicated that UCA1 was involved in signaling pathways modulating cell apoptosis and proliferation. UCA1 suppressed apoptosis by downregulating caspase 3 and upregulating CDK2, whereas enhanced cell proliferation by increased level of survivin and decreased level of p21. This study reports for the first time that UCA1 might play an important role in the cisplatin resistance in cervical cancer, and also explain partially how UCA1 promotes cisplatin resistance in cancer cells. These results provide evidence to support that UCA1 can be used as a potential target for a novel therapeutic strategy for cervical cancer.
28410686	Relations between doses cumulated in bone marrow and dose delivery techniques during radiation therapy of cervical and endometrial cancer.	PURPOSE: To compare normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) and average doses in the bone marrow (BM), obtained for five different radiotherapy delivery and planning strategies of cervical and endometrial cancer. MATERIAL/METHODS: 50 patients were taken to analysis. For each case, 3 different dose delivery techniques were used: 4-field, X15MV, 3DCRT; 7-field, X6MV, IMRT; and 2-arc, X6MV, VMAT. Two optimization scenarios were used for the IMRT and VMAT plans generation: with (+) and without (-) the inclusion of the BM as an optimized structure. Average doses and dose-volume histogram parameters for the PTV, BM, bladder, rectum, bowels and femoral heads were compared. In addition, the BM doses were analyzed with respect to the PTV and/or volume of the BM, and NTCP for the BM were computed. RESULTS: The dose in PTV for evaluated plans was similar. The worst doses in organs at risk were obtained for 3DCRT. Using the BM during the optimization of IMRT and VMAT reduces an average dose in BM without increasing the doses in the bladder, rectum and bowels. Differences between doses in BM for IMRT(+) and VMAT(+) plans were similar while NTCP was lower for VMAT(+). A correlation between average dose in BM and the volume ratio of BM and PTV was found for each technique. CONCLUSION: Using the BM during the optimization of the IMRT and VMAT plans effectively reduces the dose in BM without increasing the dose in the bladder, rectum and bowels. The VMAT(+) plans were characterized by the lowest NTCP.
28403015	HR-HPV E6/E7 mRNA In Situ Hybridization: Validation Against PCR, DNA In Situ Hybridization, and p16 Immunohistochemistry in 102 Samples of Cervical, Vulvar, Anal, and Head and Neck Neoplasia.	Dysregulated expression of oncogenic types of E6 and E7 is necessary for human papillomavirus (HPV)-driven carcinogenesis. An HPV E6/E7 mRNA in situ hybridization (ISH) assay covering 18 common high-risk types ("HR-RISH," aka HR-HPV RNA18 ISH) has not been extensively studied in the anogenital tract or validated on automated technology. We herein compare HR-RISH to DNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR), p16 immunohistochemistry, and a previously available HPV DNA ISH assay in HPV-related anogenital and head and neck (H&N) neoplasia. A total of 102 squamous intraepithelial lesions (16 CIN1, 25 CIN3, 3 AIN1, 12 AIN3, 9 VIN3)/invasive squamous cell carcinomas (17 cervical, 2 anal, 18 H&N) as well as 10 normal and 15 reactive cervix samples were collected. HR-RISH, DNA ISH, and p16 immunohistochemistry were performed on whole formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections. RNA ISH for 6 low-risk HPV types (LR-RISH) was also performed. RNA and DNA ISH assays used automated systems. HR-HPV PCR was performed on morphology-directed formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded punches. HR-RISH was >/=97% sensitive for PCR+ and p16+ neoplasia, as well as morphologically defined anogenital high grade squamous intraepithelial lesion/invasive squamous cell carcinoma. HR-RISH was also positive in 78% of anogenital low grade squamous intraepithelial lesion, including 81% of CIN1. Furthermore, a subset of PCR-negative/invalid and p16-negative lesions was positive for HR-RISH. Only 1 problematic reactive cervix sample and no normal cervix samples stained. These results demonstrate that HR-RISH is a robust method for the detection of HR-HPV-related neoplasia and provides insight into HPV pathobiology. Performance meets or exceeds that of existing assays in anogenital and H&N lesions and may play a role in resolving diagnostically challenging CIN1 versus reactive cases.
28389908	Validation of REM score to predict endometrial cancer in patients with ultrasound endometrial abnormalities: results of a new independent dataset.	The risk of endometrial malignancy (REM) score is a model formulated in a previous single-center validation study, which has been shown to predict endometrial cancer in women with ultrasound endometrial abnormalities based on multiple features (clinical, ultrasound and laboratorial). The purpose of this study was to validate the performance of REM score in an external validation setting. A population-based database with patients, who underwent elective hysteroscopy for ultrasound endometrial abnormalities between 2013 and 2016 at Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology of Campus Bio-medico of Rome, was used. Starting from January 2013 to June 2016, 330 patients were enrolled for hysteroscopy. Thirty-two patients were excluded due to Asherman syndrome or cervical stenosis. Therefore, a total of 298 patients were considered for the analysis. Based on pathologic examination, 102 patients were found to have endometrial cancer, and 196 had benign endometrial disease. Using the predefined cutoff of 0.3185, identified in the previous publication, in this independent cohort of patients we correctly classified 93/102 patients with endometrial cancer and 187/196 with benign disease, reporting an overall sensitivity and specificity of 93.9 and 95.4% (PPV = 0.91, NPV = 0.95), respectively. REM score showed a high positive predictive value for endometrial cancer prediction. However, before REM score can be applied in daily clinical practice, data from randomized controlled trials are needed.
28381193	Gene promoter methylation and protein expression of BRMS1 in uterine cervix in relation to high-risk human papilloma virus infection and cancer.	Cervical cancer is strongly related to certain high-risk types of human papilloma virus infection. Breast cancer metastasis suppressor 1 (BRMS1) is a tumor suppressor gene, its expression being regulated by DNA promoter methylation in several types of cancers. This study aims to evaluate the methylation status of BRMS1 promoter in relation to high-risk types of human papilloma virus infection and the development of pre-cancerous lesions and describe the pattern of BRMS1 protein expression in normal, high-risk types of human papilloma virus-infected pre-cancerous and malignant cervical epithelium. We compared the methylation status of BRMS1 in cervical smears of 64 women with no infection by high-risk types of human papilloma virus to 70 women with proven high-risk types of human papilloma virus infection, using real-time methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction. The expression of BRMS1 protein was described by immunohistochemistry in biopsies from cervical cancer, pre-cancerous lesions, and normal cervices. Methylation of BRMS1 promoter was detected in 37.5% of women with no high-risk types of human papilloma virus infection and was less frequent in smears with high-risk types of human papilloma virus (11.4%) and in women with pathological histology (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia) (11.9%). Methylation was detected also in HeLa cervical cancer cells. Immunohistochemistry revealed nuclear BRMS1 protein staining in normal high-risk types of human papilloma virus-free cervix, in cervical intraepithelial neoplasias, and in malignant tissues, where staining was occasionally also cytoplasmic. In cancer, expression was stronger in the more differentiated cancer blasts. In conclusion, BRMS1 promoter methylation and aberrant protein expression seem to be related to high-risk types of human papilloma virus-induced carcinogenesis in uterine cervix and is worthy of further investigation.
28379896	Spectrum of metastatic and nonmetastatic skeletal findings with dual-phase 18F-FECH PET/CT in patients with biochemical relapse of prostate cancer.	INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to evaluate the spectrum of skeletal findings on dual-phase fluorine-18-fluoroethylcholine (F-FECH) PET/CT performed during the work-up of patients referred for suspected prostate cancer relapse. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three hundred F-FECH PET/CT scans were evaluated prospectively. The low-dose CT features of all cases were categorized as isodense, sclerotic, lytic or mixed lytic/sclerotic and maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) values were calculated. Findings on F-FECH PET/CT were correlated with Technetium-99m-methylene diphosphonate planar bone scans and serum prostate-specific antigen. RESULTS: Patient age range was 50-90 years (median 71 years) and prostate-specific antigen values were in the range 0.04-372 ng/ml (Roche Modular method). Seventy-two lesions were detected on F-FECH PET/CT in 45 patients, including 31 (43%) in the pelvis, 17 (23%) in the spine (cervical 3, thoracic 8 and lumbar spine 6) and 10 (13%) in the ribs. Evaluation of low-dose CT in combination with PET helped to characterize benign findings in 21 (29%) lesions. The SUVmax for all except one benign lesion ranged from 0.49 to 2.15. In 51 (71%) lesions because of metastatic disease, SUVmax was 0.6-11.6 for those classified as sclerotic on low-dose CT, 0.7-8.58 for lytic lesions, 1.1-7.65 for isodense lesions and 1.27-3.53 for mixed lytic/sclerotic lesions. Of the 56 F-FECH-avid lesions, 21 lesions showed avidity on bone scan [3 (23%) of the 13 isodense lesions, 14 (40%) of the 35 sclerotic lesions, 2 (50%) of the lytic lesions and 2 (50%) of the mixed sclerotic/lytic lesions]. CONCLUSION: F-FECH PET/CT identified bone lesions in 15% of patients with suspected prostate cancer relapse. SUVmax in isolation cannot be used to characterize these lesions as benign or malignant. Minimal overlap of benign and malignant lesions was observed above SUVmax of 2.5. Low-dose CT of PET/CT is a useful tool to aid characterization.
28368862	Prevalence of Trichomonas vaginalis in women of reproductive age at a family health clinic.	INTRODUCTION: Trichomonas vaginalis is considered the most prevalent curable sexually transmitted infection, and its occurrence exceeds that of gonococcal and chlamydia infections. This parasite has been identified as responsible for the increased risk of transmission of HIV and has also been associated with prostate and cervical cancer. Many carriers of T. vaginalis are asymptomatic and, when experiencing a health problem, they most often have nonspecific symptoms. The aim of this research was to estimate the presence of T. vaginalis and the associated factors in women of childbearing age at a primary health care clinic in the Federal District of Brazil. METHODOLOGY: A cross-sectional study was conducted with consecutive sampling of an outpatient population of women of childbearing age (excluding minors and pregnant women). The women answered a questionnaire and were examined. After vaginal pH measurement and whiff testing, a vaginal secretion sample was obtained for inoculation in TYM, a specific T. vaginalis culture medium. RESULTS: The presence of T. vaginalis was identified in 16% of the sample. Fewer lifetime sexual partners and consistent condom use were identified as factors of protection against the infection. Complaints of dyspareunia were proportionally higher among women with positive cultures for T. vaginalis. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of T. vaginalis infection was high in the sample studied. The infection was positively associated with the number of lifetime sexual partners, and consistent condom use was a protective factor. Vaginal complaints were more common among women with T. vaginalis, but only dyspareunia had significant association.
28364788	The clinical research of Thinprep Cytology Test (TCT) combined with HPV-DNA detection in screening cervical cancer.	Our objective is to explore the clinical value of thinprep cytologic test (TCT) combined with HPV-DNA detection in screening cervical cancer. 420 cervical cancer patients admitted in our hospital between April, 2011-April, 2014 were selected. All patients received TCT and HPV-DNA detection, and cervical tissue biopsy was used to confirm the diagnosis. TCT screening results showed that there were 175 patients were &gt;ASCUS and the positive rate was 41.7%, histopathological screening showed that there were 199 patients were >/=cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) I and the positive rate was 47.4%. HPV-DNA detection showed 180 patients were positive which was 42.9%, and the positive rate of HPV-DNA detection was increased as the disease severity increased. The sensitivity of TCT combined with HPV-DNA detection was higher than single TCT or HPV-DNA, however the specificity was relatively low, and the positive predictive value and negative predictive value were higher which were similar to pathological results. TCT combined with HPV-DNA detection has high sensitivity and accuracy in screening cervical cancer, which is worthy of clinical application.
28355089	CT vaginography: a new CT technique for imaging of upper and middle vaginal fistulas.	OBJECTIVE: Different types of vaginal fistulas is a relatively uncommon condition in the Western world but very frequent in developing countries. In the past, conventional vaginography was the radiological examination of choice for exploring this condition. CT and MRI are now both used for this purpose. Our objective was to test the feasibility and to explore the potential role of a new CT imaging technique implementing vaginal introitus obstruction and opacification of the vagina with iodine contrast agent, to show patency of a fistula. METHODS: We describe the technical protocol of CT-vaginography as performed in Geneva University Hospitals, including vaginal catheterization with a Foley catheter and obstruction of the introitus by inflating the balloon of the catheter. We also report three cases of patients with suspected vaginal fistula who underwent CT-vaginography. RESULTS: The examinations were technically successful. In one patient, it revealed the presence of fistulous pathways from the vaginal fornix along the bilateral infected surgical prostheses. In a second patient, it showed a fistula between the vagina and the necrotic cavity of a recurrent cervical cancer. In a third patient, it proved the absence of a suspected vaginal fistula. CONCLUSION: CT-vaginography is a technically feasible CT protocol that provides anatomical and functional information on clinically suspected vaginal fistulas. Advances in knowledge: After the abandon of conventional vaginography in the era of transaxial imaging, the current modalities of imaging vaginal fistulas provide excellent anatomical detail but less functional information concerning the permeability of a vaginal fistulous pathway. We propose the use of CT-vaginography, a technical protocol that we describe in detail.
28351328	Effect of EBI3 on radiation-induced immunosuppression of cervical cancer HeLa cells by regulating Treg cells through PD-1/PD-L1 pathway.	This study aimed to investigate the effect of EBI3 on radiation-induced immunosuppression of cervical cancer HeLa cells by regulating Treg cells through PD-1/PD-L1 signaling pathway. A total of 43 adult female Wistar rats were selected and injected with HeLa cells in the caudal vein to construct a rat model of cervical cancer. All model rats were randomly divided into the radiotherapy group ( n = 31) and the control group ( n = 12). The immunophenotype of Treg cells was detected by the flow cytometry. The protein expressions of EBI3, PD-1, and PD-L1 in cervical cancer tissues were tested by the streptavidin-peroxidase method. HeLa cells in the logarithmic growth phase were divided into four groups: the blank, the negative control group, the EBI3 mimics group, and the EBI3 inhibitors group. Western blotting was used to detect PD-1 and PD-L1 protein expressions. MTT assay was performed to measure the proliferation of Treg cells. Flow cytometry was used to detect cell cycle and apoptosis, and CD4+/CD8+ T cell ratio in each group. Compared with before and 1 week after radiotherapy, the percentages of CD4+T cells and CD8+T cells were significantly decreased in the radiotherapy group at 1 month after radiotherapy. Furthermore, down-regulation of EBI3 and up-regulation of PD-1 and PD-L1 were observed in cervical cancer tissues at 1 month after radiotherapy. In comparison to the blank and negative control groups, increased expression of EBI3 and decreased expressions of PD-1 and PD-L1 were found in the EBI3 mimics group. However, the EBI3 inhibitors group had a lower expression of EBI3 and higher expressions of PD-1 and PD-L1 than those in the blank and negative control groups. The EBI3 mimics group showed an increase in the optical density value (0.43 +/- 0.05), while a decrease in the optical density value (0.31 +/- 0.02) was found in the EBI3 inhibitors group. Moreover, compared with the blank and negative control groups, the apoptosis rates of Treg/CD4+T/CD8+T cells were decreased in the EBI3 mimics group, but the EBI3 inhibitors group exhibited an increase in apoptosis rate. In conclusion, over-expression of EBI3 could reduce the apoptosis of Treg/CD4+T/CD8+T cells and prevent radiation-induced immunosuppression of cervical cancer HeLa cells by inhibiting the activation of PD-1/PD-L1 signaling pathway.
28351308	Sulfiredoxin may promote metastasis and invasion of cervical squamous cell carcinoma by epithelial-mesenchymal transition.	Sulfiredoxin (Srx), a novel oxidative stress-induced antioxidant protein, has been reported to be expressed in several human tumour tissues. However, the expression and functions of Srx in cervical squamous cell carcinoma remain unknown. Here, we proved that expression of Srx was upregulated in cervical tissues as revealed by immunohistochemistry, and revealed a close correlation between the protein's expression and the expression level of one core epithelial-mesenchymal transition marker, E-cadherin. We demonstrated that Srx was overexpressed in cervical squamous cell carcinoma and its expression level was closely correlated with lymph node metastasis and invasion of cervical squamous cell carcinoma. Meanwhile, Srx expression was negatively correlated with E-cadherin expression. The remission time (tumour-free status after surgery) of the Srx strong staining group was significantly shorter than that of the Srx weak staining group. We silenced Srx by short hairpin RNA in HeLa and SiHa cells. Diminished Srx expression upregulated E-cadherin expression. The cell invasion and migration activity in the ShSrx group were obviously decreased in HeLa and SiHa cells. Moreover, Srx regulated the expression of the other marker of epithelial-mesenchymal transition, vimentin. In conclusion, the study suggested that Srx was highly expressed in cervical squamous cell carcinoma and may promote invasion and metastasis of cervical squamous cell carcinoma via regulating epithelial-mesenchymal transition.
28351298	Aberrant gene-specific DNA methylation signature analysis in cervical cancer.	Multicomponent molecular modifications such as DNA methylation may offer sensitive and specific cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and cervical cancer biomarkers. In this study, we tested cervical tissues at various stages of tumor progression for 5-methylcytosine and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine levels and also DNA promoter methylation profile of a panel of genes for its diagnostic potential. In total, 5-methylcytosine, 5-hydroxymethylcytosine, and promoter methylation of 33 genes were evaluated by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay based technique, and bisulfate-based next generation sequencing. The 5-methylcytosine and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine contents were significantly reduced in squamous cell carcinoma and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed a significant difference in (1) 5-methylcytosine between normal and squamous cell carcinoma tissues (area under the curve = 0.946) and (2) 5-hydroxymethylcytosine levels among normal, squamous intraepithelial lesions and squamous cell carcinoma. Analyses of our next generation sequencing results and data from five independent published studies consisting of 191 normal, 10 low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions, 21 high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions, and 335 malignant tissues identified a panel of nine genes ( ARHGAP6, DAPK1, HAND2, NKX2-2, NNAT, PCDH10, PROX1, PITX2, and RAB6C) which could effectively discriminate among the various groups with sensitivity and specificity of 80%-100% (p < 0.05). Furthermore, 12 gene promoters (ARHGAP6, HAND2, LHX9, HEY2, NKX2-2, PCDH10, PITX2, PROX1, TBX3, IKBKG, RAB6C, and DAPK1) were also methylated in one or more of the cervical cancer cell lines tested. The global and gene-specific methylation of the panel of genes identified in our study may serve as useful biomarkers for the early detection and clinical management of cervical cancer.
28345459	N6-Isopentenyladenosine promoted HeLa cell apoptosis through inhibitions of AKT and transforming growth factor beta-activated kinase 1 activation.	N6-Isopentenyladenosine, a member of the family of plant hormones, possesses anti-cancer activities on a number of cancer cell lines. However, its mode of action in cervical cancer cell remains poorly understood. Our computational docking studies showed that N6-Isopentenyladenosine could bind with the really interesting new gene domain of tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6, which is an ubiquitination E3 ligase. Tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6-mediated ubiquitination is known to activate both protein kinase B (also known as AKT) and transforming growth factor beta-activated kinase 1, and the really interesting new gene domain comprises the core of the ubiquitin ligase catalytic domain. First, we evaluated the effects of iPA on cervical cancer cell line HeLa using MTT and flow cytometry. Second, we examined the effects of iPA on activation of tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6-mediated downstream targets using western blot or immunoprecipitation. iPA could reduce HeLa cell proliferation through apoptosis, and such anti-cancer activity is associated with inhibitions of both AKT and transforming growth factor beta-activated kinase 1 signaling pathways. In addition, suppression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 and elevation of the pro-apoptotic protein Bax were also observed. Anti-proliferation properties of iPA are likely due to its binding at the really interesting new gene domain of tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 and loss of AKT and transforming growth factor beta-activated kinase 1 activities as a result of functional modulations of tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6. These results support the emerging notion that tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 could serve as a viable target for developing new cancer therapeutics.
28336133	Comparison of Cobas(R) HPV and Anyplex II HPV28 assays for detecting and genotyping human papillomavirus.	Persistent infection with high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV-HR) is a recognized cause of cervical cancer. The aim of this study was to compare analytical and clinical performances of the Cobas(R) HPV and Anyplex II HPV28 assays for HPV detection and genotyping. A total of 94 cervical samples were tested. For HPV-HR, the results agreed very well (94.68%), with 100% agreement when detecting CIN2+. The Anyplex II HPV28 assay detected more genotypes than the Cobas(R) HPV Test, but their clinical performances were similar.
28328841	Increased HPV L1 gene methylation and multiple infection status lead to the difference of cervical epithelial cell lesion in different ethnic women of Xinjiang, China.	Human papillomavirus (HPV) L1 gene methylation deeply involved in the progression and heterogeneity of cervical cell epithelial lesions. The DNA ploidy also represented the early lesions of cervical cell, and it was associated with different HPV infection status in different ethnic women. So, the research was to explore whether it was possible that HPV L1 gene methylation and HPV infection status as the risk factors to lead to the differences of cervical epithelial cells' lesions in different ethnics women.The flow-through hybridization and gene chip for HPV genotypes test, general characteristics, and cervical exfoliated cell samples were collected from 94 Uygur and 79 Han women with HPV-16 infection. The cases were divided into the single HPV-16 (sHPV-16) infection group and multiple HPV-16 (mHPV-16) infection group in each ethnic women. The DNA ploidy was analyzed by flow cytometry, and the methylation-sensitive high resolution melting (MS-HRM) was used to test the HPV-16 L1 gene methylation, the results of methylation was segmented into mild methylation, moderate methylation, and severe methylation groups. Multifactor logistic analysis explored the relation between DNA heteroploid and HPV-16 infection status, HPV-16 L1 gene methylation in different ethnic women.The higher proportion of mHPV-16 infection in Uygur than Han women (61.7% vs 38.0%). L1 gene methylation had statistic difference between single and mHPV-16 infection under the same ethnic women. The proportion of DNA heteroploid had statistic difference between different HPV-16 infection status or different L1 gene methylation grades in Han or Uygur women. Both L1 gene methylation and HPV infection status were the risk factors of DNA heteroploid. Compared to the sHPV-16 infection, the odds ratio (OR) of mHPV-16 infection were 4.409 (CI: 1.398-13.910) and 3.279 (CI: 1.069-10.060) in Han and Uygur women. Compared the mild L1 gene methylation, the OR of moderate L1 gene methylation were 3.313 (CI: 1.002-10.952) and 5.075 (CI: 1.385-18.603) in Han and Uygur women, the OR of severe L1 gene methylation were 20.592 (CI: 3.691-114.880) and 63.634 (CI: 10.400-389.368) in Han and Uygur women.The study first reported that HPV L1 gene methylation and HPV infection status were the risk factors to the DNA heteroploid of cervical cell in different ethnics women, HPV L1 gene methylation and infection status should be recommended to the existing system of cervical lesion screening in order to provide better serves for the HPV infected women, especially for the ethnic women with high proportion of severe L1 gene methylation and multiple infection status.
28315691	miR-519 suppresses nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell proliferation by targeting oncogene URG4/URGCP.	Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is one of the most common malignant tumor in Southeast Asia, its regulatory mechanism is still to be understood. miR-519 inhibits the progression of several tumors, including cervical cancer, ovarian cancer and gastric cancer. But its role in NPC hasn't been studied. In present study, we found miR-519 was downregulated in NPC cells, its overexpression inhibited NPC cell proliferation and arrested cell cycle at G0/G1 phase, while its knockdown promoted NPC cell proliferation and cell cycle progression. An oncogene URG4/URGCP (upregulated gene-4/upregulator of cell proliferation) was the target of miR-519, URG4 was upregulated in NPC cells, miR-519 inhibited URG4 expression by directly binding to the 3'UTR of URG4. miR-519 inhibited Cyclin D1 expression and the phosphorylation level of Rb, and increased p21 and p27 expression, confirming miR-519 blocked G1/S transition. Moreover, miR-519 level was negative correlated with URG4 level in NPC tissues. In summary, we found miR-519 NPC cell proliferation by inhibiting URG4.
28314289	Dose-dense Paclitaxel- and Carboplatin-based Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy Followed by Surgery or Concurrent Chemo-radiotherapy in Cervical Cancer: a Preliminary Analysis.	AIM: To assess preliminary results with dose-dense neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) prior to surgery or concurrent chemo-radiotherapy (CCRT) in cervical cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty patients received weekly paclitaxel (80 mg/m2) plus carboplatin (AUC2) for 6 cycles followed by radical hysterectomy in 16 (stage Ib2-IIb), conisation in one (stage Ib1), and CCRT in 13 (stage Ib2-IIb). Median follow-up of survivors was 12 months (range=3-22). RESULTS: Among the surgically treated patients, clinical overall response rate (RR) was 82.3%, optimal pathological RR was 17.6%, and suboptimal pathological RR with intra-cervical residual disease was 41.2%. Only one patient relapsed. Among the CCRT treated patients, partial RR after NACT was 76.9% and complete RR after CCRT was 58.3%. However, 42.8% of complete responders recurred. Toxicity was acceptable. CONCLUSION: Dose-dense NACT seems to achieve promising RRs with manageable toxicity in cervical cancer. Investigation on larger series with longer follow-up is warranted.
28314288	Prevalence of Cervical Infection and Genotype Distribution of Human Papilloma Virus Among Females in Da Nang, Vietnam.	AIM: The goal of the present study was to determine the prevalence and distribution of high-risk human papilloma virus (HPV) genotypes in women from two districts in and around Da Nang city, Vietnam. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All participants were randomly selected, 200 from the Hai Chau district and 200 from the Son Tra district. The detection and genotyping of HPV were performed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique. RESULTS: Out of a total of 400 women, we found that 38 (9.5%) were infected with a high-risk HPV genotype, the most prevalent genotypes being 16, 18, 58 and 59. By assessment of the HPV findings in relation to sociodemographic characteristics, we found significant differences between the two study districts and between the age groups, as well as differences associated with occupation and the use of contraceptives. CONCLUSION: The proportion of high-risk genotypes other than 16 and 18 was relatively high, and since the HPV genotype distribution is known to vary greatly across populations, the information from this study can be used for planning of screening and vaccination programs in Da Nang.
28306621	Prognostic value of preoperative 18F-FDG PET/CT in papillary thyroid cancer patients with a high metastatic lymph node ratio: a multicenter retrospective cohort study.	OBJECTIVE: Metastatic lymph node ratio (MLNR) is a known significant predictor of disease-free survival in differentiated thyroid cancer. The authors investigated the ability of preoperative fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (F-FDG) PET/CT to predict recurrence after surgery with radioactive iodine therapy considering MLNR. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 274 patients who underwent preoperative PET/CT and surgery with radioactive iodine therapy were enrolled. The tumor-to-liver uptake ratio on PET/CT was calculated by dividing the maximum standardized uptake value of a primary lesion by the mean standardized uptake value of the normal liver. High F-FDG uptake was defined as tumor-to-liver uptake ratio more than the median cutoff value (2.1). MLNR was calculated by dividing the number of metastatic lymph nodes (LNs) by the number of cervical LNs removed. A high MLNR was also defined as one more than a threshold value (0.4), identified by plotting Kaplan-Meier survival curves and comparing them using the log-rank test. The prognostic significances of clinicopathologic variables were analyzed. RESULTS: Fifteen (5.5%) patients developed recurrence in the thyroid bed or in cervical LNs. Cox regression analysis showed that a high MLNR was significantly associated with a worse disease-free survival (odds ratio 6.95; 95% confidence interval: 2.36-20.47; P<0.001). A subgroup analysis of 70 patients with a high MLNR showed that only high F-FDG uptake was significantly associated with a worse disease-free survival (odds ratio 5.77; 95% confidence interval: 1.22-27.16; P=0.027). CONCLUSION: High F-FDG uptake of primary lesion on preoperative PET/CT has selective prognostic value according to the extent of metastatic LNs (MLNR>0.4).
28304416	Gynecologic Malignancies in Pregnancy: Balancing Fetal Risks With Oncologic Safety.	Importance: Cancer occurs in 0.05% to 0.1% of all pregnancies. Despite literature reporting good oncologic and fetal outcomes in women treated for cancer during pregnancy, as many as 44% of gynecologists would offer termination, and 37% would not administer chemotherapy or radiotherapy in pregnancy. Objectives: The aims of this study were to summarize current recommendations for the treatment of cervical and ovarian cancers in pregnancy and to review updates on existing knowledge regarding the safety of surgical and chemotherapeutic treatments in pregnancy, including both oncologic and fetal outcomes. Evidence Acquisition: A detailed literature review was performed on PubMed. Results: The treatment of gynecologic malignancies during pregnancy mirrors that outside pregnancy, with a balance between maternal versus fetal health. Fertility-sparing surgery can be offered to stage IA2 and low-risk IB1 cervical, stage I epithelial ovarian, germ cell ovarian, or sex-cord stromal ovarian tumors. Delayed treatment can be offered for stage IB1 cervical cancer. Neoadjuvant and/or adjuvant chemotherapy can be given for advanced gynecologic cancers with good disease-free survival without significant adverse neonatal outcomes. Conclusions: A multidisciplinary approach and improved education of providers regarding the surgical and chemotherapeutic treatments in pregnancy are needed in order to fully inform patients regarding treatment options. Further research in women who are pregnant is needed to determine the safety of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures used in the nonpregnant woman. Relevance: This article reviews and supports treatment of gynecologic cancer during pregnancy, calls for additional study and long-term follow-up, and justifies improved education of patients and providers regarding treatment options. Target Audience: Obstetricians and gynecologists, family physicians. Learning Objectives: After completing this activity, the learner should be better able to (1) review general principles in the management and treatment of gynecologic cancers in pregnancy, (2) review the diagnosis and treatment of cervical cancer in pregnancy, and (3) review the diagnosis and treatment of ovarian cancer in pregnancy.
28304186	miR-205 mediates the inhibition of cervical cancer cell proliferation using olmesartan.	OBJECTIVE: The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system has become known as a prerequisite for tumor angiogenesis that is now recognized as a crucial step in the development of tumors, including cervical cancer. The Ang II-AT1R pathway is known to play an important role in tumor angiogenesis. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small, regulating RNAs that participate in tumor genesis, differentiation and proliferation. The current study focused on the anti-tumor mechanism of olmesartan, a novel angiotensin II antagonist, on cervical cancer cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: qRT-PCR and Western blot were used to demonstrate the effect of olmesartan on miR-205 and VEGF-A expression. miR-205 mimics and VEGF-A shRNA plasmid were separately transfected into HeLa and Siha cells to further validate the function of miR-205 and VEGF-A in cervical cancer cell proliferation. RESULTS: It was found that olmesartan could upregulate miR-205 and inhibit VEGF-A expression in HeLa and Siha cells. In addition, VEGF-A was proven to be a target gene of miR-205. CONCLUSION: This result provides a new idea on the anti-tumor mechanism of olmesartan, which may be used as a novel therapeutic target of cervical cancer.
28303830	Multiplex polymerase chain reaction for the detection of high-risk-human papillomavirus types in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded cervical tissues.	Detecting high-risk-human papillomavirus (HPV) types has become an integral part of the cervical cancer screening programmes. This study aimed to develop a multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for identification of HPV types 16 and 18 along with the beta globin gene in formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded cervical biopsy specimens. A total of 59 samples from patients with cervical abnormalities were tested. HPV 16 positivity was 50% in cervical cancers and 52.9% in cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. Our multiplex PCR protocol can be used as a simple and cost-effective tool for high-risk-HPV detection in cervical cancer screening programmes.
28301252	Identification of Optimal Reference Genes for Normalization of RT-qPCR Data in Cancerous and Non-Cancerous Tissues of Human Uterine Cervix.	This study aimed to identify the most stably expressed reference genes from a panel of 32 candidate genes for normalization of reverse transcription-quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction data in cancerous and non-cancerous tissues of human uterine cervix. Overall, PUM1, YWHAZ, and RPLP0 were identified as the most stably expressed genes in paired cancerous and non-cancerous tissues. The results were further stratified by the state of malignancy of the tissues, histopathological type of the cancer, and the human papillomavirus-type.
28300047	Knowledge, attitude, and experience of cervical cancer and screening among Sub-saharan African female students in a UK University.	BACKGROUND: Cervical cancer is one of the major diseases that affect women of child bearing age. Its main cause is the human papilloma virus; although, other associated factors have been evidenced to increase its risk. Pap-smear screening and vaccination which has been shown to be successful in reducing the incidence and prevalence of the disease in developed countries, has been neglected in developing countries due to lack of knowledge, misconceptions, and cultural beliefs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study involving only female Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) students in a UK university setting. RESULTS: One hundred and eighty-six (42%) African female students were recruited from the 442 SSA students attending one of the major Universities in the UK. Seventy-one (38.2%) of the students were aware of cervical screening, but only 20 (10.8%) reported having knowledge of cervical cancer. A small percentage of about 26.9% (50 Students) were already part of this screening program; although, 81 (43.5%) showed willingness to participate in future screening programs. More so, it was evident that student's perception was dependent on their experience of the disease (P = 000) just as their participation in screening program was dependent on their awareness level (P </= 0.01). CONCLUSION: Female African students from the SSA region have poor knowledge of the disease which influenced their attitude toward screening. More needs to be carried out to increase awareness and uptake of screening within the school environment as university setting provides a viable platform to promote healthy behavior. Resume Contexte: Le cancer du col de l'uterus est l'une des principales maladies qui touchent les femmes en age de procreer. Sa principale cause est le virus du papillome humain; Bien que, d'autres facteurs associes ont ete mis en evidence pour augmenter son risque. Le depistage du Pap et la vaccination, qui s'est avere efficace pour reduire l'incidence et la prevalence de la maladie dans les pays developpes, a ete neglige dans les pays en developpement en raison du manque de connaissances, d'idees fausses et de croyances culturelles. Materiel et Methodes: Une etude transversale impliquant seulement des etudiantes d'Afrique subsaharienne (SSA) dans un universite britannique. Resultats: Cent quatre-vingt-six (42%) etudiantes africaines ont ete recrutees parmi les 442 etudiants SSA frequentant l'une des plus grandes universites du Royaume-Uni. Soixante et onze (38,2%) des etudiants etaient au courant du depistage du cancer du col, mais seulement 20 (10,8%) ont declare avoir une connaissance du cancer du col de l'uterus. Un faible pourcentage d'environ 26,9% (50 etudiants)Font deja partie de ce programme de depistage; 81 (43,5%) se sont montres disposes a participer a de futurs programmes de depistage. De plus, il etait evident que la perception des etudiants dependait de leur experience de la maladie (P = 000), tout comme leur participation au programme de depistage dependait de leur niveau de sensibilisation (P </= 0,01). CONCLUSION: Les etudiantes africaines de la region de l'Afrique subsaharienne connaissent mal la maladie et ont influence leur attitude envers le depistage. Davantage de mesures doivent etre prises pour accroitre la sensibilisation et l'adoption du depistage dans l'environnement scolaire, car le cadre universitaire constitue une plate-forme viable pour promouvoir un comportement sain.
28296787	Unintentional parathyroidectomy during total thyroidectomy surgery: A single surgeon's experience.	In this study, we investigated incidental parathyroidectomy during total thyroidectomy surgery that required central lymph node dissection and the potential risk factors. Patients requiring total thyroidectomy and tracheoesophageal groove node dissection were enrolled in the study from January 2013 to June 2015 and we obtained all medical information, including pathology reports. Furthermore, we recorded the parathyroid hormone level in all patients prior to operation and then 3 further times: 1 day, 1 week, and 3 months after surgery. A total of 341 patients (66 male and 275 female) were enrolled in the study. Microscopic examination of postoperative specimens revealed that incidental parathyroidectomy existed in 35 (10.3%) cases: 32 (91.4%) patients had 1 parathyroid gland excised, 3 (8.6%) patients had 2 parathyroid glands excised, and no patients had 3 or more parathyroid glands resected. The mean size of the resected glands was 4.6 mm. Parathyroid tissue from 16 (42.1%) cases was located in the intrathyroidal position, 6 glands were located in central lymphatic adipose tissue, and 16 glands were located within or along with thymus tissue. Lateral neck dissection significantly increased the risk of incidental parathyroidectomy (P < 0.001). No other factors including age, sex, and postoperative symptomatic hypocalcemia were significantly associated with incidental parathyroidectomy (all P > 0.05), though incidental parathyroidectomy tended to cause transient hypoparathyroidism (P = 0.051). Therefore, the risk of incidental parathyroidectomy in total thyroidectomy is relatively low; the majority of the resected parathyroid tissue is situated outside the thyroid, therefore we suggest future operations focus on preserving the parathyroid gland when the node dissection is close to the thymus. Incidental parathyroidectomy appears to have an effect on the expression of parathyroid hormone and it is significantly associated with lateral cervical lymph node dissection.
28296773	Enhanced efficacy of adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy in selected cases of surgically resected neuroendocrine carcinoma of the uterine cervix: A retrospective cohort study.	The aim of the present study is to identify the prognostic factors of overall survival and examine the effects of adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy on the overall survival in neuroendocrine carcinoma of the uterine cervix (NECUC) patients.Forty-eight surgically treated patients were retrospectively recruited and clinicopathologic characteristics and treatments were reviewed. Kaplan-Meier product-limit method and Cox proportional-hazards regression were utilized for univariate and multivariate analyses.The median follow-up time was 20.6 months and the median overall survival was 30.7 months. The estimated 2-year and 5-year overall survival rates were 57.5% and 31.3%, respectively. Forty patients had </= stage IIA disease and 8 had >IIA disease. Univariate analysis identified the clinical stage </= IIA (P = 0.042), tumor size </= 4 cm (P = 0.005), negative lymph nodes metastasis (P < 0.001), depth of stromal invasion </= 1/2 (P = 0.001), negative parametrial involvement (P = 0.004), and weak staining of synaptophysin (P = 0.037), and chromogranin (P = 0.011) as the prognostic factors for an improved overall survival, while chemotherapy and radiotherapy were not prognostic factors in the whole cohort. However, surgery combined with chemotherapy and radiotherapy produced a survival advantage over surgery alone in patients with large tumors (P = 0.006). The combination of surgery and chemotherapy (with or without radiotherapy) did not show any significant difference in overall survival for small tumors (P = 0.816), compared with no chemotherapy (with or without radiotherapy). In addition, radiotherapy for tumors with squamous cell carcinoma or adenocarcinoma components achieved a better survival (P = 0.01), and there was a tendency of an unfavorable survival for radiotherapy in homogeneous carcinoma (P = 0.099). Tumor size was an independent prognostic factor in the multivariate analysis (HR: 12.724, 95% CI: 1.697-95.423, P = 0.013).In conclusion, clinicopathologic features significantly influence a NECUC patient's outcome. Tumor size and tumor histology can influence the effect of adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy on overall survival. We recommend that platinum-based adjuvant chemotherapy should be used in all cases, while radiotherapy should be reserved for the selected NECUC patients whose tumors have mixed histology.
28296678	Endocervical Adenocarcinoma With Morphologic Features of Both Usual and Gastric Types: Clinicopathologic and Immunohistochemical Analyses and High-risk HPV Detection by In Situ Hybridization.	The fourth edition of the World Health Organization classification set up new entities of endocervical adenocarcinoma (ECA), namely the "usual type" and "gastric type." These 2 types are considered to be distinct histogenetically because of their differing immunophenotypes, human papillomavirus (HPV) status, and prognoses. Usual-type ECAs (U-ECAs) are virtually always associated with high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) infection. Gastric-type ECAs (G-ECAs) are believed not to be associated with HR-HPV infection. Morphologically, U-ECA cells are characterized by mucin-poor and eosinophilic cytoplasm, resembling endometrioid carcinoma (a pseudoendometrioid feature). G-ECA cells are characterized by abundant clear or pale, mucinous cytoplasm and distinct cell borders. However, in routine practice we noticed that some ECAs contain morphologically usual type-like components and gastric type-like components in a single tumor; we have named these "G+U" ECAs. The histogenesis of such tumors has not been investigated. We conducted the present study to clarify the clinicopathologic and immunohistochemical features and HPV status of G+U ECAs, and to determine whether G+U ECAs are genuine G-ECAs mimicking U-ECAs or genuine U-ECAs with gastric type-like morphology. We retrospectively analyzed a series of 70 consecutive cases of ECA diagnosed as mucinous ECA, endocervical type, and we reclassified them on the basis of the latest World Health Organization classification. We identified 48 (69%) pure U-ECAs, 9 pure G-ECAs, and 13 G+U ECAs. Ten of the 13 G+U ECAs (77%) showed no HR-HPV infection by in situ hybridization (HPV-unrelated G+U ECAs) and showed frequent HIK1083 expression and aberrant p53 expression in both usual type-like and gastric type-like components. The other 3 G+U ECAs showed HR-HPV infection (HPV-related G+U EACs) and frequent p16+/p53-/HIK1083- immunophenotype in both usual type-like and gastric type-like components. The U-ECAs were characterized by HR-HPV infection detected by in situ hybridization and frequent p16+/p53-/HIK1083- immunophenotype, similar to that of the HPV-related G+U ECAs. In contrast, the pure G-ECAs were characterized by the absence of HPV infection and frequent HIK1083 expression and aberrant p53 expression, similar to that of HPV-unrelated G+U ECAs. G+U ECAs thus represent a heterogenous group composed of genuine G-ECAs and genuine U-ECAs. Most of the G+U ECAs we examined were genuine HPV-unrelated G-ECAs with usual type-like components showing mucin-poor, eosinophilic cytoplasm (pseudoendometrioid morphology). A small population of G+U ECAs was genuine HPV-related U-ECAs with gastric type-like components showing mucin-rich, voluminous cytoplasm. Thus, both types of ECAs can occasionally display patterns of differentiation suggesting a component of the other type but true mixed tumors do not appear to exist. Ancillary techniques (immunohistochemical analysis of p16, p53, and HPV DNA detection assays) should be used to assure proper classification of tumors with mixed morphologic features.
28293348	Villoglandular papillary adenocarcinoma: case report.	Villoglandular papillary adenocarcinoma (VPA) is a very rare subtype of adenocarcinoma of the uterine cervix, but a well-recognized variant of cervical adenocarcinoma with a favorable prognosis and generally occurring in women of child-bearing age. Herein, we report a case of VPA diagnosed and managed successfully with conservative measure. This management is particularly desirable in young women to preserve reproductive capability.
28292128	[A rare cases of rhabdomyosarcoma of the uterine cervix: about a case and review of the literature].	Rhabdomyosarcoma of the uterine cervix is a rare histological type of cervical cancer, occurring commonly in young girls or sexually active women. Given the aggressiveness of the disease, therapeutic strategy is based on the combination of the three treatment modalities (chemotherapy - radiation therapy-surgery). We report the case of a 20-year old patient with rhabdomyosarcoma of the uterine cervix. The patient had a personal history of recurrent genital infections. Patient's first symptom was profuse metrorrhagias associated with the presence of a mass like "a bunch of grapes". Biopsy was in favor of a rhabdomyosarcoma of the uterine cervix. E Extension assessment showed locally advanced mass without metastasis. The patient underwent 5 administrations of VAC chemotherapy, exhibiting tumor regression of 90%. She underwent hysterectomy without adnexal conservation. Then she received postoperative pelvic radiation therapy. At 13-months' follow-up the patient was still in complete remission. Rhabdomyosarcoma of the uterine cervix is a rare tumor that develops most often in young girls. It mainly shows locoregional extension. Treatment is based on surgery including conservative treatment as well as radical treatment associated with perioperative chemotherapy. The role of radiation therapy remains poorly defined.
28287429	d-Amino Acid Position Influences the Anticancer Activity of Galaxamide Analogs: An Apoptotic Mechanism Study.	Galaxamide, an extract from Galaxaura filamentosa, is a cyclic pentapeptide containing five l-leucines. Due to the particular cyclic structure and the excellent anticancer activity, synthesis of Galaxamide and its analogs and their subsequent bio-applications have attracted great attention. In the present work, we synthesized six Galaxamide analogs by replacing one of the l-leucines with phenylalanine and varying the d-amino acid position. The anticancer effect of the synthesized Galaxamide analogs was tested against four in vitro human cancer cell lines, human hepatocellular cells (HepG(2)), human breast cancer cell (MCF-7), human breast adenocarcinoma cells (MDA-MB-435) and a human cervical carcinoma cell line (Hela). Results showed that Galaxamide analogs with different d-amino acid positions displayed distinct anticancer potential. The Galaxamide analog containing d-amino acid at position 5 (Analog-6) presented the strongest anticancer activity. The mechanism study revealed that Analog-6 could cause the early apoptosis of HepG(2) cells by inhibiting their growth in the sub-G1 stage of the cell cycle and induce the chromatin condensation and fragmentation, which can be seen as 68% of HepG(2) cells inhibited in the sub-G1 stage. Moreover, a mitochondria-mediated pathway was found to be involved in the apoptotic process of Analog-6 on HepG(2) cells.
28286604	A Review of mTOR Pathway Inhibitors in Gynecologic Cancer.	The treatment of advanced gynecologic cancers remains palliative in most of cases. Although systemic treatment has entered into the era of targeted drugs the antitumor efficacies of current therapies are still limited. In this context there is a great need for more active treatment and rationally designed targeted therapies. The PI3K/AKT/mTOR is a signaling pathway in mammal cells that coordinates important cell activities. It has a critical function in the survival, growth, and proliferation of malignant cells and was object of important research in the last two decades. The mTOR pathway emerges as an attractive therapeutic target in cancer because it serves as a convergence point for many growth stimuli and, through its downstream substrates, controls cellular processes that contribute to the initiation and maintenance of cancer. Aberrant PI3K-dependent signaling occurs frequently in a wide range of tumor types, including endometrial, cervical, and ovarian cancers. The present study reviewed the available evidence regarding the potential impact of some mTOR pathway inhibitors in the treatment of gynecological cancer. Few advances in medical management have occurred in recent years in the treatment of advanced or recurrent gynecological malignancies, and a poor prognosis remains. Rationally designed molecularly targeted therapy is an emerging and important option in this setting; then more investigation in PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway-targeted therapies is warranted.
28282021	Utilization of Clinical Preventive Services for Cancer and Heart Disease Among Insured Adults: United States, 2015.	KEY FINDINGS: Data from the National Health Interview Survey *Two-thirds of insured adults aged 50-75 were screened for colorectal cancer within the recommended intervals. *Insured women aged 30-39 (90.5%) were more likely than their older peers to be screened for cervical cancer within the recommended intervals. *Seventy-three percent of insured women aged 50-74 had a mammogram in the past 2 years. *The percentage of insured adults who had a cardiovascular risk screening (blood pressure, blood sugar) within the recommended intervals significantly increased with advancing age for both men and women. Recent improvements in health insurance coverage (1) have been associated with improved access to health care (2-4) and increased utilization of preventive services (5). Most insurance plans are now required to cover specific clinical preventive services without copayment from the insured adult (6). This report presents the proportion of insured adults who received selected services that are recommended for the prevention or early detection of cancer and heart disease. Sex- and age-specific differences are examined. The age groups included in each chart vary because the selected preventive services are recommended for different age groups.
28280748	Cervical Carcinogenesis and Immune Response Gene Polymorphisms: A Review.	The local immune response is considered a key determinant in cervical carcinogenesis after persistent infection with oncogenic, high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) infections. Genetic variation in various immune response genes has been shown to influence risk of developing cervical cancer, as well as progression and survival among cervical cancer patients. We reviewed the literature on associations of immunogenetic single nucleotide polymorphism, allele, genotype, and haplotype distributions with risk and progression of cervical cancer. Studies on HLA and KIR gene polymorphisms were excluded due to the abundance on literature on that subject. We show that multiple genes and loci are associated with variation in risk of cervical cancer. Rather than one single gene being responsible for cervical carcinogenesis, we postulate that variations in the different immune response genes lead to subtle differences in the effectiveness of the antiviral and antitumour immune responses, ultimately leading to differences in risk of developing cervical cancer and progressive disease after HPV infection.
28274154	Investigational drugs for the treatment of cervical cancer.	INTRODUCTION: Cervical cancer (CC) is currently the fourth most common malignant disease of women worldwide. Although the incidence and the mortality rates have been decreasing with screening detection and new treatment strategies, a significant number of metastatic or recurrent disease is still diagnosed. For those patients not amenable to curative treatments, such as surgery and radiation, palliative chemotherapy remains the standard of care. As chemotherapy regimens have limited activity, research is focalized on investigating novel pharmacologic strategies. Areas covered: This paper aims to give a complete and updated overview on investigated therapies for the treatment of CC. The authors review the results of clinical studies and highlight the ongoing trials. Expert opinion: Agents targeting various molecular pathways including epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP), epigenetics and other biological mechanisms represent interesting investigational opportunities. Amongst such drugs, bevacizumab, an anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody, was the first targeted drug recently approved by the FDA for the treatment of patients with metastatic, recurrent, or persistent CC. Another interesting experimental approach is represented by immunotherapy, which is leading to promising results with to the development of therapeutic vaccines and immune checkpoints inhibitors.
28273493	Influence of dynamic flow environment on nanoparticle-protein corona: From protein patterns to uptake in cancer cells.	The fast growing use of nanoparticles (NPs) in biotechnology and biomedicine raises concerns about human health and the environment. When introduced in physiological milieus, NPs adsorb biomolecules (especially proteins) forming the so-called protein corona (PC). As it is the PC that mostly interacts with biological systems, it represents a major element of the NPs' biological identity with impact on nanotoxicology, nanosafety and targeted delivery of nanomedicines. To date, NP-protein interactions have been largely investigated in vitro, but this condition is far from mimicking the dynamic nature of physiological environments. Here we investigate the effect of shear stress on PC by exposing lipid NPs with different surface chemistry (either unmodified and PEGylated) to circulating fetal bovine serum (FBS). PC formed upon in vitro incubation was used as a reference. We demonstrate that PC is significantly influenced by exposure to dynamic flow and that changes in PC composition are dependent on both exposure time and NP's surface chemistry. Notably, alterations induced by dynamic flow affected cellular uptake of lipid NPs in both human cervical cancer (HeLa) and human breast adenocarcinoma (MCF7) cell lines.
28272204	Safety and efficacy of semiextended field intensity-modulated radiation therapy and concurrent cisplatin in locally advanced cervical cancer patients: An observational study of 10-year experience.	Patients with locally advanced cervical cancer (LACC) are at risk of para-aortic lymph node (PALN) metastasis. Pelvic concurrent chemoradiotherapy, the current standard treatment for LACC, has a PALN failure rate of 9% according to the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group Trial 90-01, suggesting that it may not completely eliminate all microscopic tumors in the PALNs. To minimize the toxicities associated with conventional prophylactic extended-field radiotherapy, our institute use prophylactic semiextended field radiotherapy that includes only the PALNs below the level of the renal vessels. Use of intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) is another means of reducing the incidence of toxicity. This study evaluated the safety and efficacy of prophylactic semiextended field IMRT (SEF-IMRT) and concurrent cisplatin chemotherapy in patients with LACC.We retrospectively assessed survival and toxicity in 76 patients with stage IB2-IVA cervical cancer and negative PALNs who received prophylactic SEF-IMRT and concurrent weekly cisplatin (40 mg/m) between 2004 and 2013. The region targeted by SEF-IMRT included the PALNs below the level of the renal vessels, and the prescribed dose was 50.4 Gy in 28 fractions. Brachytherapy was administered at a dose of 30 Gy in 6 fractions. Survival outcomes were calculated by using the Kaplan-Meier method, and acute and late toxicities were scored according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 3.0.All patients completed the planned SEF-IMRT, as well as brachytherapy. Acute grade >/=3 gastrointestinal, genitourinary, and hematologic toxicities were observed in 2, 0, and 41 patients, respectively. The median follow-up time after SEF-IMRT was 55 (range, 11-124) months. Eight patients developed out-field distant recurrences without PALN failure, and 1 patient experienced out-field PALN failure with simultaneous distant metastasis. No patients had late genitourinary toxicities, and 3 patients had late grade 3 gastrointestinal toxicities. The 5-year overall survival, disease-free survival, local failure-free survival, regional failure-free survival, PALN failure-free survival, and distant metastasis-free survival rates were 85.0%, 84.4%, 96.0%, 97.3%, 98.6%, and 88.4%, respectively.For patients with LACC, prophylactic PALN irradiation up to the level of the renal vessels reduced PALN recurrence and resulted in favorable outcomes with few severe toxicities.
28270323	Toxicity and early clinical outcomes in cervical cancer following extended field helical tomotherapy to para-aortic lymph nodes.	PURPOSE: To evaluate toxicity and early disease outcome among patients treated for cervical cancer with extended-field helical tomotherapy to the para-aortic nodes. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-eight patients (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics [FIGO] stage IB2-IVA) from four institutions received extended-field helical tomotherapy and were retrospectively evaluated. All had nodal disease. Para-aortic lymph nodes were involved in 31 patients. Patients were assessed for toxicity using version 4 of the National Cancer Institute's common terminology criteria for adverse events. Survival curves were plotted using Kaplan-Meier estimates. RESULTS: All patients underwent radiation to the tumor region (median dose: 45Gy; range: 44-66Gy), pelvic lymph nodes and para-aortic lymph nodes (median dose: 45Gy; range: 44-60Gy). The median dose to positive lymph nodes was 55Gy (range: 45-65Gy). All received platinum-based chemotherapy (31 concurrently). The median follow-up was 15months. Acute toxicity events observed included one patient with grade 5 febrile neutropenia, 11 patients (29%) with grade 3 hematologic complications. Grades 3-4 gastrointestinal and genitourinary toxicities occurred in six (16%) and four (11%) patients, respectively. Three patients had grade 3 pelvic pain (8%). The 6- and 18-month overall survival rates were 94.7 and 63.9%, respectively. The 18-month locoregional control, disease-free survival, and late grade 3 toxicity rates were 60.2, 43.3 and 7.3%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Extended-field helical tomotherapy was associated with low rates of acute gastrointestinal and genitourinary toxicities with early survival and locoregional control similar to other published series.
28268260	Impact of genetic variations and transcriptional alterations of HLA class I genes on cervical cancer pathogenesis.	In a novel attempt to understand the variations in DNA sequences underlying HLA class I alleles associated with HPV16-related CaCx, we determined the alleles by reconstructing SNP-based haplotypes from resequencing of the most polymorphic exons 2 and 3 of HLA-A, HLA-B and HLA-C. We also determined the impact of SNPs and transcriptional alterations of the genes on CaCx. A high density of SNPs was identified from resequencing. HLA expression was determined by real-time PCR. We identified that even a single associated HLA allele had many underlying SNP-based haplotypes. Out of the most frequent (>/=5%) HLA class I alleles, HLA-B*40:06 and HLA-B*15:02 respectively imparted significant risk towards and protection from CaCx as well as HPV16 infection. Employing median-joining networks to detect clusters of sequence-variations for specific HLA alleles, we found the protective SNP-based signature, GAATTTA, in all SNP-based haplotypes of HLA-B*15:02 allele. The signature was derived from seven SNPs within HLA-B which were newly associated with the disease. Contrarily, similarly derived risk-signature, TTGCGCC, mapped only to 52% of SNP-based haplotypes of HLA-B*40:06 allele. This indicated that all SNP-based haplotypes underlying a particular associated HLA allele might or might not have a single signature of risk/protection. HLA-A, HLA-B and HLA-C expressions were downregulated among CaCx cases compared to asymptomatic infections and HPV-negative controls. HLA-A and HLA-B were repressed in both cases harbouring episomal and integrated HPV16, whereas HLA-C in only the latter. Novel genetic variations and differential downregulation-patterns of HLA class I have a significant bearing on HPV16-related CaCx pathogenesis.
28267862	Screening for Gynecologic Conditions With Pelvic Examination: US Preventive Services Task Force Recommendation Statement.	Importance: Many conditions that can affect women's health are often evaluated through pelvic examination. Although the pelvic examination is a common part of the physical examination, it is unclear whether performing screening pelvic examinations in asymptomatic women has a significant effect on disease morbidity and mortality. Objective: To issue a new US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation on screening for gynecologic conditions with pelvic examination for conditions other than cervical cancer, gonorrhea, and chlamydia, for which the USPSTF has already made specific recommendations. Evidence Review: The USPSTF reviewed the evidence on the accuracy, benefits, and potential harms of performing screening pelvic examinations in asymptomatic, nonpregnant adult women 18 years and older who are not at increased risk for any specific gynecologic condition. Findings: Overall, the USPSTF found inadequate evidence on screening pelvic examinations for the early detection and treatment of a range of gynecologic conditions in asymptomatic, nonpregnant adult women. Conclusions and Recommendation: The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of performing screening pelvic examinations in asymptomatic, nonpregnant adult women. (I statement) This statement does not apply to specific disorders for which the USPSTF already recommends screening (ie, screening for cervical cancer with a Papanicolaou smear, screening for gonorrhea and chlamydia).
28267861	Periodic Screening Pelvic Examination: Evidence Report and Systematic Review for the US Preventive Services Task Force.	Importance: Recent changes in the periodicity of cervical cancer screening have led to questions about the role of screening pelvic examinations among asymptomatic women. Objective: To systematically review literature on health benefits, accuracy, and harms of the screening pelvic examination for gynecologic conditions for the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF). Data Sources: MEDLINE, PubMed, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for relevant English-language studies published through January 13, 2016, with surveillance through August 3, 2016. Study Selection: Two reviewers independently screened abstracts and studies. The search yielded 8678 unique citations; 316 full-text articles were reviewed, and 9 studies including 27630 patients met inclusion criteria. Data Extraction and Synthesis: Two reviewers rated study quality using USPSTF criteria. Main Outcomes and Measures: Morbidity; mortality; diagnostic accuracy for any gynecologic cancer or condition except cervical cancer, gonorrhea, and chlamydia, which are covered by other USPSTF screening recommendations; harms (false-positive rates, false-negative rates, surgery rates). Results: No trials examined the effectiveness of the pelvic examination in reducing all-cause mortality, reducing cancer- and disease-specific morbidity and mortality, or improving quality of life. Eight studies reported accuracy for the screening pelvic examination: ovarian cancer (4 studies; n = 26432), bacterial vaginosis (2 studies; n = 930), trichomoniasis (1 study; n = 779), and genital herpes (1 study; n = 779). In the 4 ovarian cancer screening studies, low prevalence of ovarian cancer consistently resulted in low positive predictive values (PPVs) and false-positive rates, with a lack of precision in accuracy estimates (sensitivity range, 0%-100%; specificity range, 91%-99%; PPV range, 0%-3.6%; negative predictive value [NPV] range, >/=99%). Each diagnostic accuracy study for bacterial vaginosis, trichomoniasis, and genital herpes was performed in a high-prevalence population with substantial proportions of symptomatic patients and reported accuracy characteristics for individual physical examination findings (bacterial vaginosis, homogeneous discharge: sensitivity range, 69%-79%; specificity range, 54%-97%; PPV range, 52%-95%; NPV range, 79%-80%; herpes simplex virus, vulvar ulcerations: sensitivity, 20%; specificity, 98%; PPV, 88%; NPV, 57%; trichomoniasis, colpitis macularis: sensitivity, 2%; specificity, 100%; PPV, 100%; NPV, 85%). Surgery rates resulting from an abnormal screening pelvic examination for ovarian cancer ranged from 5% to 36% at 1 year, with the largest study reporting an 11% surgery rate and 1% complication rate within 1 year of a screening pelvic examination with abnormal findings. Conclusions and Relevance: No direct evidence was identified for overall benefits and harms of the pelvic examination as a 1-time or periodic screening test. Limited evidence was identified regarding the diagnostic accuracy and harms of routine screening pelvic examinations in asymptomatic primary care populations.
28263237	International Image Concordance Study to Compare a Point-of-Care Tampon Colposcope With a Standard-of-Care Colposcope.	OBJECTIVE: Barriers to cervical cancer screening in low-resource settings include lack of accessible, high-quality services, high cost, and the need for multiple visits. To address these challenges, we developed a low-cost, intravaginal, optical cervical imaging device, the point-of-care tampon (POCkeT) colposcope and evaluated whether its performance is comparable with a standard-of-care colposcope. MATERIALS AND METHODS: There were 2 protocols, which included 44 and 18 patients. For the first protocol, white-light cervical images were collected in vivo, blinded by device, and sent electronically to 8 physicians from high-, middle-, and low-income countries. For the second protocol, green-light images were also collected and sent electronically to the highest performing physician from the first protocol who has experience in both a high- and low-income country. For each image, physicians completed a survey assessing cervix characteristics and severity of precancerous lesions. Corresponding pathology was obtained for all image pairs. RESULTS: For the first protocol, average percent agreement between devices was 70% across all physicians. The POCkeT and standard-of-care colposcope images had 37% and 51% agreement with pathology for high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSILs), respectively. Investigation of HSIL POCkeT images revealed decreased visibility of vascularization and lack of contrast in lesion margins. After changes were made for the second protocol, the 2 devices achieved similar agreement to pathology for HSIL lesions (55%). CONCLUSIONS: Based on the exploratory study, physician interpretation of cervix images acquired using a portable, low-cost POCkeT colposcope was comparable to a standard-of-care colposcope.
28261610	Cervical Cancer Cell Line Secretome Highlights the Roles of Transforming Growth Factor-Beta-Induced Protein ig-h3, Peroxiredoxin-2, and NRF2 on Cervical Carcinogenesis.	Cancer cells acquire unique secretome compositions that contribute to tumor development and metastasis. The aim of our study was to elucidate the biological processes involved in cervical cancer, by performing a proteomic analysis of the secretome from the following informative cervical cell lines: SiHa (HPV16+), HeLa (HPV18+), C33A (HPV-), and HCK1T (normal). Proteins were analyzed by 2D gel electrophoresis coupled to MALDI-TOF-MS. Enrichment of secreted proteins with characteristic profiles for each cell line was followed by the identification of differentially expressed proteins. Particularly, transforming growth factor-beta-induced protein ig-h3 (Beta ig-h3) and peroxiredoxin-2 (PRDX2) overexpression in the secretome of cancer cell lines was detected and confirmed by Western blot. Bioinformatics analysis identified the transcription factor NRF2 as a regulator of differentially expressed proteins in the cervical cancer secretome. NRF2 levels were measured by both Western blot and Multiple Reaction Monitoring (MRM) in the total cell extract of the four cell lines. NRF2 was upregulated in SiHa and C33A compared to HCK1T. In conclusion, the secreted proteins identified in cervical cancer cell lines indicate that aberrant NRF2-mediated oxidative stress response (OSR) is a prominent feature of cervical carcinogenesis.
28260085	Roles of immune inhibitory molecule B7-H4 in cervical cancer.	Recent studies have reported that the immune-regulatory protein B7-H4 is highly expressed in various types of cancer, but little is known concerning its roles in cervical cancer. In the present study, we investigated the expression of B7-H4 in human tissues and serum samples, and explored the effects of B7-H4 on proliferation, apoptosis, migration and invasion of cervical cancer cell lines, including SiHa and HeLa. We found that B7-H4 was mainly located in the cytoplasm of cervical cancer cells as determined by immunofluorescence staining. Serum B7-H4 (sB7-H4) was overexpressed in patients with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and cervical cancer, and the area under the ROC curve (AUC) was 0.955. There was no statistical significance between B7-H4 expression and clinicopathological factors in cervical cancer tissue samples. B7-H4 promoted the proliferation of SiHa and HeLa cells, and protected them from apoptosis, which was related to the upregulation of E7, phosphorylated Rb (pRb), E2F, P16, P21, Bcl-2 and the downregulation of Rb, cleaved PARP and cleaved caspase-3 as determined by western blotting. In addition, B7-H4 increased the ability of cell migration and invasion by targeting angiogenic factors, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, MMP-9 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) as determined by RT-PCR. Our findings revealed that B7-H4 has the potential to be a useful prognostic marker. In addition, B7-H4 plays important roles in proliferation, apoptosis, migration and invasion, indicating that B7-H4 can serve as a new therapeutic target for cervical cancer.
28260054	Epigenetic activation of WHSC1 functions as an oncogene and is associated with poor prognosis in cervical cancer.	Overexpression of Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome candidate 1 (WHSC1) is commonly observed in various types of tumors. However, the potential mechanism responsible for this molecular event is poorly understood. In the present study, we found that the mRNA levels of WHSC1 were significantly increased in cervical cancer cells, and that CpG sites were almost fully methylated in HaCaT cells, but partially methylated in HeLa and C33A cells. Clinically, the results of quantitative methylation-specific PCR (QMSP) and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), showed that methylation levels of the WHSC1 gene were significantly decreased in cervical cancer tumors and inversely correlated with its mRNA expression levels. Both decreased methylation of WHSC1 and increased mRNA were associated with cancer progression and poor prognosis. In addition, overexpression of WHSC1 contributed to cell proliferation, migration and invasion, while cells with WHSC1 knockdown exhibited the opposite effects. AKT/metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) signaling was activated and inactivated upon overexpression and silencing of WHSC1, respectively. Silencing of WHSC1 also suppressed tumor growth in a xenograft model. In conclusion, WHSC1 is hypomethylated in cervical cancer, and consequent overexpression of WHSC1 mRNA may promote cervical carcinogenesis by activating the AKT/MMP-2 signaling pathway.
28260046	HPV16 oncogenes E6 or/and E7 may influence the methylation status of RASSFIA gene promoter region in cervical cancer cell line HT-3.	Both human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and the aberrant Ras associated domain family gene 1A (RASSF1A) promoter methylation status participate in the pathogenesis of cervical cancer. Some studies suggest that E6, and E7 are involved in the pathogenetic mechanisms of RASSF1A. We mainly explored a possible involvement of HPV16 oncogenes E6 or/and E7 in RASSF1A promoter methylation status and possible roles of RASSF1A gene methylation in cervical cancer. Bisulfite genomic sequencing (BGS) PCR combined with TA clone, methylation-specific PCR (MSP) were used to analyze methylation status of the RASSF1A gene promoter in HPV16/18-positive and HPV-negative cervical cancer cell lines; ectopically expressed HPV16 E6, E7 and E6/E7 cervical cancer cell lines; normal cervical and cervical cancer tissues. The mRNA and protein expression of RASSF1A was detected by RT-PCR and western blotting. Re-expression and downregulated promoter methylation status were detected in the ectopically expressed HPV16 E6 and E7 cervical cancer cell line HT-3. The methylation status and expression of RASSF1A could be downregulated or reactivated by 5-Aza-dc in HT-3 and C33A cells. Additionally, statistics showed significant hypermethylation of RASSF1A in cervical cancer samples compared to that in normal cervical samples (P<0.05). The false negative rate (FNR) was 6.25% by HC2 method, when reconfirmed by HPV detection combining the MY09/11, GP5+/6+ and SPF1/2 methods. The ectopic expression of HPV16 E6 and/or E7 may be involved in aberrant methylation and expression of the RASSF1A gene. RASSF1A gene expression could be regulated by its promoter methylation status. Additionally, the false negativity of the HPV detection may contribute to the uncertain relationship between HPV infection and aberrant RASSF1A promoter methylation.
28259989	Mefenamic acid enhances anticancer drug sensitivity via inhibition of aldo-keto reductase 1C enzyme activity.	Resistance to anticancer medications often leads to poor outcomes. The present study explored an effective approach for enhancing chemotherapy targeted against human cancer cells. Real-time quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis revealed overexpression of members of aldo-keto reductase (AKR) 1C family, AKR1C1, AKR1C2, AKR1C3, and AKR1C4, in cisplatin, cis-diamminedichloroplatinum (II) (CDDP)-resistant human cancer cell lines, HeLa (cervical cancer cells) and Sa3 (oral squamous cell carcinoma cells). The genes were downregulated using small-interfering RNA (siRNA) transfection, and the sensitivity to CDDP or 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) was investigated. When the genes were knocked down, sensitivity to CDDP and 5-FU was restored. Furthermore, we found that administration of mefenamic acid, a widely used non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) and a known inhibitor of AKR1Cs, enhanced sensitivity to CDDP and 5-FU. The present study suggests that AKR1C family is closely associated with drug resistance to CDDP and 5-FU, and mefenamic acid enhances their sensitivity through its inhibitory activity in drug-resistant human cancer cells. Thus, the use of mefenamic acid to control biological function of AKR1C may lead to effective clinical outcomes by overcoming anticancer drug resistance.
28257290	Human Papillomavirus Co-Testing Results Effectively Triage Normal Cervical Cytology in HIV-Positive Women Aged 30 Years and Older.	OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to assess whether HIV-positive (HIV+) women aged 30 years and older with concurrent normal cervical cytology and undetectable cervical HPV have a low 3-year risk of developing cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or higher (CIN 2+) in a clinical setting. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective chart review of HIV+ women aged 30 years and older at a single institution with normal cervical cytology and concurrent human papillomavirus (HPV) testing between November 2008 and December 2010. The participants were stratified by initial HPV testing results and followed to either the study end point (CIN 2+) or until the last cervical cytology or colposcopy before January 2015. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were used to analyze CIN 2+ diagnosis for follow-up with log-rank testing of the null hypothesis. Cox proportional hazard regression was performed to calculate crude and adjusted hazard ratios controlling for ethnicity and CD4 levels. RESULTS: We identified 325 HIV+ women with normal cytology and follow-up; 66 (20%) of these women had detectable HPV. The cumulative diagnosis of CIN 2+ at 4 years was significantly lower in the HPV-negative cohort compared with the HPV-positive cohort (1.4%, 95% CI = 0.3%-4.6% vs 14.5%, 95% CI = 5.8%-27.1%), respectively; the median duration to CIN 2+ diagnosis was longer in the HPV-negative cohort compared with the HPV-positive cohort (4.2 years vs 1.5 years, respectively, p < .02). CONCLUSIONS: HIV+ women aged 30 years and older with concurrent normal cervical cytology and undetectable cervical HPV have a low 3-year risk of subsequent diagnosis of CIN 2+. The study validates the recently updated US recommendations for the use of co-testing in screening HIV+ women.
28255386	Variation in uterus position prior to brachytherapy of the cervix: A case report.	Rationale: brachytherapy is administered in the treatment of patients with locally advanced cervical cancer following chemoradiotherapy. Lack of local anatomy evaluation prior to this procedure might lead to the selection of an inappropriate brachytherapy applicator, increasing the risk of side effects (e.g. uterus perforation, painful procedure ...). Objective: To assess the movement of the uterus and cervix prior to brachytherapy in patients with gynecological cancer, in order to select the proper type of brachytherapy applicator. Also we wanted to promote the replacement of the plain X-ray brachytherapy with the image-guided procedure. Methods and results: We presented the case of a 41-year-old female diagnosed with a biopsy that was proven cervical cancer stage IIIB. At diagnosis, the imaging studies identified an anteverted uterus. The patient underwent preoperative chemoradiotherapy. Prior to brachytherapy, the patient underwent a pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which identified a displacement of the uterus in the retroverted position. Discussion: A great variety of brachytherapy applicators is available nowadays. Major changes in uterus position and lack of evaluation prior to brachytherapy might lead to a higher rate of incidents during this procedure. Also, by using orthogonal simulation and bidimensional (2D) treatment planning, brachytherapy would undoubtedly fail to treat the remaining tumoral tissue. This is the reason why we proposed the implementation of a prior imaging of the uterus and computed tomography (CT)/ MRI-based simulation in the brachytherapy procedure.

28253225	Cancer Screening Test Use - United States, 2015.	Healthy People 2020 (HP2020) includes objectives to increase screening for breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer (1) as recommended by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF).* Progress toward meeting these objectives is monitored by measuring cancer screening test use against national targets using data from the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) (1). Analysis of 2015 NHIS data indicated that screening test use remains substantially below HP2020 targets for selected cancer screening tests. Although colorectal cancer screening test use increased from 2000 to 2015, no improvements in test use were observed for breast and cervical cancer screening. Disparities exist in screening test use by race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and health care access indicators. Increased measures to implement evidence-based interventions and conduct targeted outreach are needed if the HP2020 targets for cancer screening are to be achieved and the disparities in screening test use are to be reduced.
28252165	Effects of miRNA-143 and the non-coding RNA MALAT1 on the pathogenesis and metastasis of HeLa cells.	Cervical cancer is a common female malignancy of global dimensions. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play crucial roles in the development, differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis of tumors. The non-coding RNA MALAT1 participates in various physiological processes that are important for proper functioning of the body. Here, we analyzed the expression of miRNA-143 and MALAT1 in HeLa cells to evaluate their roles in the occurrence and metastasis of cervical cancer. HeLa cells were divided into five groups depending on the treatment conditions, namely, transfected with miRNA-143, MALAT1, miRNA-143 inhibitor and the MALAT1 inhibitor, and the untreated control. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction was used to analyze the expression of miRNA-143 and MALAT1, the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay to assess proliferation, the trans-well assay to study cell invasion and migration, and western blot to analyze the levels of E-cadherin and vimentin. The proliferation of HeLa cells increased upon treatment with the miRNA-143 inhibitor and decreased when treated with the MALAT1 inhibitor, compared to the proliferation of the groups that were transfected with miRNA-143 and MALAT1, respectively (P < 0.05). Thus, miRNA-143 decreased cell invasion and migration potency, downregulated vimentin and upregulated E-cadherin expression, while MALAT1 had the opposite effects. In conclusion, the low expression of miRNA-143 and high expression of MALAT1 in cervical cancer cells could possibly potentiate cell invasion/migration and alter the levels of vimentin and E-cadherin.
28250871	[Primitive oto-rhino-laryngology and cervico-maxillofacial tumors: epidemiological and histological aspects].	INTRODUCTION: Establish the panorama of primitive oto-rhino-laryngology and cervico-maxillofacial tumors diagnosed at a reference center in Togo. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective, descriptive study of cancers diagnosed at the ORL and cervico-maxillofacial surgery department of the CHU Sylvanus Olympio of Lome. It was conducted over a period of 10 years (1 January 2005 - 31 December 2014). RESULTS: ORL and cervico-maxillofacial tumors account for 0.48% of consultations and 15.3% of all ORL tumors. The average age of patients was 47 years, ranging from 3 months to 86 years. We noted a male predominance; the sex ratio was 1.45. Drinking alcohol and smoking tobacco prevailed in the cancer of the larynx. Upper aerodigestive tract (UAT) tumors accounted for 64,8%, with a prevalence of cancers of the oral cavity (36,2% of UAT), followed by cancers of the oropharynx (18,5% of UAT) and finally by cancers of the larynx (18,1% of UAT). Primary malignant cervical adenopathies accounted for 18%. The rarest lesions were cancers of the ear and of maxillomandibular bone tissue (2.24% each). Histology was dominated by squamous cell carcinoma (61.4%) followed by non-Hodgkin lymphoma (23.2%). CONCLUSION: ORL and cervico-maxillofacial tumors are frequent in Togo and can be diagnosed at any age. The predominant tumor types reported are those of the oral cavity, pharynx and primary malignant cervical adenopathies.
28245822	Cervical chylous leakage following esophagectomy that was successfully treated by intranodal lipiodol lymphangiography: a case report.	BACKGROUND: Chylous leakage is a well-known complication after esophagectomy, but cervical chylous leakage is relatively rare, and considerable controversy remains regarding the appropriate management strategies. We herein report a case of cervical chylous leakage treated successfully by lipiodol lymphangiography. CASE PRESENTATION: The patient, a 70-year-old man with middle thoracic esophageal cancer, underwent radical esophagectomy with 3-field lymph node dissection and subsequently developed cervical chylous leakage. From the second postoperative day (POD2), the amount of fluid in the cervical drainage tube increased by 200-300 ml/day. We started octreotide (300 mug/day) on POD5 and etilefrine (120 mg/day) on the POD6. However, the amount of cervical discharge did not decrease. We performed lipiodol lymphangiography on POD8. Thereafter, the amount of cervical discharge finally began to decrease. We removed the drainage tube on POD13, and the patient was discharged from the hospital on POD23. CONCLUSIONS: Our case suggests the clinical efficacy of lipiodol lymphangiography for cervical chylous leakage after esophagectomy.
28245730	Peripheral nervous system injury after high-dose single-fraction image-guided stereotactic radiosurgery for spine tumors.	OBJECTIVE The object of this study was to determine the percentage of high-dose (1800-2600 cGy) single-fraction stereotactic radiosurgery (SF-SRS) treatments to the spine that result in peripheral nervous system (PNS) injury. METHODS All patients treated with SF-SRS for primary or metastatic spine tumors between January 2004 and May 2013 and referred to the Rehabilitation Medicine Service for evaluation and treatment of neuromuscular, musculoskeletal, or functional impairments or pain were retrospectively identified. RESULTS Five hundred fifty-seven SF-SRS treatments in 447 patients resulted in 14 PNS injuries in 13 patients. All injures resulted from SF-SRS delivered to the cervical or lumbosacral spine at 2400 cGy. The overall percentage of SF-SRS treatments resulting in PNS injury was 2.5%, increasing to 4.5% when the thoracic spine was excluded from analysis. The median time to symptom onset following SF-SRS was 10 months (range 4-32 months). The plexus (cervical, brachial, and/or lumbosacral) was affected clinically and/or electrophysiologically in 12 (86%) of 14 cases, the nerve root in 2 (14%) of 14, and both in 6 (43%) of 14 cases. All patients experienced pain and most (93%) developed weakness. Peripheral nervous system injuries were CTCAE Grade 1 in 14% of cases, 2 in 64%, and 3 in 21%. No dose relationship between SF-SRS dose and PNS injury was detected. CONCLUSIONS Single-fraction SRS to the spine can result in PNS injury with major implications for function and quality of life.
28245440	Human Papillomavirus and the Development of Different Cancers.	Human papillomaviruses (HPV) are responsible for the development of almost all cervical cancers. HPV is also found in 85% of anal cancer and in 50% of penile, vulvar, and vaginal cancers, and they are increasingly found in a subset of head and neck cancers, i.e., oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas (OPSCC). The model for how HPV causes cancer is derived from several decades of study on cervical cancer, and it is just presumed that this model is not only completely valid for cervical cancer but for all other HPV-driven cancers as well. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has now provided the necessary tools to characterize genomic alterations in cancer cells and can precisely determine the physical status of HPV in those cells as well. We discuss recent discoveries from different applications of NGS in both cervical cancer and OPSCCs, including whole-genome sequencing and mate-pair NGS. We also discuss what NGS studies have revealed about the different ways that HPV can be involved in cancer formation, specifically comparing cervical cancer and OPSCC.
28244844	Incidental nodal metastasis of differentiated thyroid carcinoma in neck dissection specimens from head and neck cancer patients.	BACKGROUND: Occult differentiated thyroid carcinomas are not uncommon. The initial presentation of a thyroid carcinoma is often detection of a metastatic cervical lymph node. METHODS: A retrospective review was performed of the medical records of 304 patients who underwent neck dissection between 1996 and 2008 for squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. RESULTS: Ten patients (3.3 per cent) had nodal metastasis originating from papillary thyroid cancer. All of these patients underwent thyroidectomy and post-operative 131iodine radiometabolic therapy. No patient developed a thyroid tumour after surgery. CONCLUSION: Despite its metastatic spread, thyroid cancer does not affect the overall prognosis of patients who are already being treated for a more aggressive malignancy. However, in otherwise healthy patients, it is worth treating this second malignancy to avoid potential complications related to local disease or metastatic thyroid cancer.
28244473	Pattern of care in operable endometrial cancer treated at a rural-based tertiary care cancer center.	PURPOSE: An audit was planned to study the demographics, staging, treatment details, and outcomes of operable endometrial cancers. METHODOLOGY: All operable endometrial cancers treated between January 2009 and October 2014 were included in the study. The details regarding demographics, staging, surgical procedure, pathological staging, adjuvant treatment, and outcomes were extracted from the case records. Descriptive statistics was performed. The time-to-event analysis was done by Kaplan-Meier method. Univariate and multivariate analyses were done for disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). RESULTS: There were 55 patients with a median age of 59 years (35-73 years). The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status was 1 in 52 patients (94.5%) and 2 in 3 patients (5.5%). Forty-nine patients (89.1%) had disease restricted to endometrium while 6 patients (10.9%) had cervical involvement. The surgery done was Type I hysterectomy in 49 patients (89.1%), Type II in 5 patients (9.1%), and Type III in 1 patient (1.8%). Pelvic lymph node dissection was done in all patients while para-aortic (infrahilar) dissection was done in 48 patients (87.3%). The pathological stages were Stage IA in 19 patients, Stage IB in 15 patients, Stage II in 4 patients, Stage IIIA in 3 patients, Stage IIIB in 2 patients, Stage IIIC1 in 5 patients, Stage IIIC2 in 4 patients, and Stage IV in 3 patients. Grade 1 tumors were seen in 23 patients, Grade 2 in 13 patients, and Grade 3 in 19 patients. The histology was endometrioid in 44 patients, serous in 6 patients, clear cell in 3 patients, and others in 2 patients. Adjuvant treatment was received by 40 patients. With a median follow-up of 2.5 years, the 3-year DFS and OS were 78% and 82%, respectively. Age >59 years, Stage III or greater, and Grade 3 tumors were independent prognostic factors adversely affecting both DFS and OS. CONCLUSION: The outcomes in our study are comparable to that seen in Western literature. Elderly status, higher stage, and a poorly differentiated tumor are associated with poor outcomes.
28241481	Histone H3 Acetyl K9 and Histone H3 Tri Methyl K4 as Prognostic Markers for Patients with Cervical Cancer.	Chromatin remodeling alters gene expression in carcinoma tissue. Although cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer in women worldwide, a systematic study about the prognostic value of specific changes in the chromatin structure, such as histone acetylation or histone methylation, is missing. In this study, the expression of histone H3 acetyl K9, which is known to denote active regions at enhancers and promoters, and histone H3 tri methyl K4, which preferentially identifies active gene promoters, were examined as both show high metastatic potential. A panel of patients with cervical cancer was selected and the importance of the histone modifications concerning survival-time (overall survival and relapse-free survival) was analyzed in 250 cases. Histone H3 acetyl K9 staining was correlated with low grading, low FIGO (TNM classification and the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics) status, negative N-status and low T-status in cervical cancer, showing a higher expression in adenocarcinoma than in squamous cell carcinoma. Cytoplasmic expression of histone H3 tri methyl K4 in a cervical cancer specimen was correlated with advanced T-status and poor prognosis. While cytoplasmic H3K4me3 expression seemed to be a marker of relapse-free survival, nuclear expression showed a correlation to poor prognosis in overall survival. Within this study, we analyzed the chemical modification of two histone proteins that are connected to active gene expression. Histone H3 acetyl K9 was found to be an independent marker of overall survival. Histone H3 tri methyl K4 was correlated with poor prognosis and it was found to be an independent marker of relapse-free survival. Therefore, we could show that chromatin remodeling plays an important role in cervical cancer biology.
28238155	Safety of herbal medicine use during chemotherapy in patients with ovarian cancer: a "bedside-to-bench" approach.	In this study, we explored herbal supplements used by patients during chemotherapy and test for herb-drug interactions and response of cancer cells to treatment. Patients with gynecological cancer referred to a complementary and integrative medicine (CIM) service were asked about their use of herbal medicine during chemotherapy. The leading five clinically relevant herbs selected for cytotoxicity analysis included the following: wheatgrass (Triticum aestivum), European mistletoe (Viscum album), ginger (Zingiber officinale), Ephedra (Ephedra campylopoda), and Oriental mistletoe (Viscum cruciatum). Cytotoxicity was examined using XTT assays in cisplatin-sensitive and resistant ovarian cancer cell lines (A2780, A2780CisR), and non-cancer kidney cells (HEK-293). The effect of the selected herbs on carboplatin and paclitaxel cytotoxicity was tested as well. Pro-apoptotic effects were tested using Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage. Of 98 patients referred to the CIM service, 42 (42.9%) reported using/intending to use herbal products during chemotherapy. European mistletoe and ginger exhibited significant anti-cancer activity in cisplatin-sensitive and resistant ovarian cells. Wheatgrass and ephedra reduced cytotoxicity of carboplatin on cisplatin-sensitive ovarian cancer cells, while ginger, European and Oriental mistletoe increased chemosensitivity in both cancer cell lines. Wheatgrass, European mistletoe, and ginger increased sensitivity to cisplatin-resistant cells treated with carboplatin and paclitaxel. No effect was observed with the addition of any of the herbs on non-cancerous embryonic kidney cells (HEK-293). Herbal medicine use by patients with ovarian cancer may influence anti-cancer activity of chemotherapy. Integrative physicians can provide "bedside-to-bench" guidance on the safety of these products.
28231728	MicroRNA-543 acts as a prognostic marker and promotes the cell proliferation in cervical cancer by BRCA1-interacting protein 1.	Human cervical cancer is one of the most common malignancies worldwide. Recent studies have focused on microRNAs that play crucial roles in cancer development and progression of cervical cancer. In this study, we aimed to analyse the biological function of microRNA-543 in cervical cancer. Samples of human cervical cancer and matched adjacent normal cervical tissues were collected, and expression level of microRNA-543 and the clinical characteristics of cervical cancer were investigated. We found that microRNA-543 expression was significantly elevated in cervical cancer and its aberrant expression levels were positively correlated with tumour size ( p = 0.0315), differentiation ( p = 0.0134), clinical stage ( p = 0.0315) and overall ( p = 0.0426) and disease-free survival ( p = 0.0396) of cervical cancer. Overexpression of microRNA-543 in cancer-derived HeLa and SiHa facilitated cell growth and suppressed cell apoptosis, while down-regulation of microRNA-543 exerted a reverse effect on cell growth and apoptosis. In addition, we demonstrated that BRCA1-interacting protein 1 was directly regulated by microRNA-543 and the restoration of BRCA1-interacting protein 1 expression reversed the effects of microRNA-543 on cell proliferation. Taken together, these findings collectively demonstrate that microRNA-543 exerts its oncogene function by directly targeting BRCA1-interacting protein 1 in cervical cancer, indicating a potential novel potential prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target for cervical cancer.
28230778	Caffeic Acid Expands Anti-Tumor Effect of Metformin in Human Metastatic Cervical Carcinoma HTB-34 Cells: Implications of AMPK Activation and Impairment of Fatty Acids De Novo Biosynthesis.	The efficacy of cancer treatments is often limited and associated with substantial toxicity. Appropriate combination of drug targeting specific mechanisms may regulate metabolism of tumor cells to reduce cancer cell growth and to improve survival. Therefore, we investigated the effects of anti-diabetic drug Metformin (Met) and a natural compound caffeic acid (trans-3,4-dihydroxycinnamic acid, CA) alone and in combination to treat an aggressive metastatic human cervical HTB-34 (ATCC CRL-1550) cancer cell line. CA at concentration of 100 microM, unlike Met at 10 mM, activated 5'-adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK). What is more, CA contributed to the fueling of mitochondrial tricarboxylic acids (TCA) cycle with pyruvate by increasing Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Complex (PDH) activity, while Met promoted glucose catabolism to lactate. Met downregulated expression of enzymes of fatty acid de novo synthesis, such as ATP Citrate Lyase (ACLY), Fatty Acid Synthase (FAS), Fatty Acyl-CoA Elongase 6 (ELOVL6), and Stearoyl-CoA Desaturase-1 (SCD1) in cancer cells. In conclusion, CA mediated reprogramming of glucose processing through TCA cycle via oxidative decarboxylation. The increased oxidative stress, as a result of CA treatment, sensitized cancer cells and, acting on cell biosynthesis and bioenergetics, made HTB-34 cells more susceptible to Met and successfully inhibited neoplastic cells. The combination of Metformin and caffeic acid to suppress cervical carcinoma cells by two independent mechanisms may provide a promising approach to cancer treatment.
28230030	The predictive value of cervical lymph node metastasis through sentinel lymph node biopsy in patients with oral cancer: A meta-analysis.	OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this meta-analysis was to evaluate the predictive value of cervical lymph node metastasis through sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in patients with oral cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two authors independently searched the databases of PubMed, Cochrane central register of controlled trials, EMBASE, and CNKI to find the potential suitable diagnostic study related to SLNB. The diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, positive likely hood ratio (+LR), negative likely hood ratio (-LR), diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) were pooled by Meta-DiSc1.4 software. The publication bias was assessed by funnel plot and line regression test. RESULTS: After electronic searching the related databases, we finally included twenty diagnostic studies. The pooled sensitivity, specificity, +LR, and DOR were 0.91 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.88-0.94), 1.00 (95% CI: 0.99-1.00), 35.52 (95% CI: 19.19-65.75), and 323.50 (95% CI: 148.27-705.83), respectively, with fixed-effect model. Moreover, the pooled -LR was 0.13 (95% CI: 0.07-0.23) by random-effect model. The area under the summary receiver operating characteristic curve of SLNB for cervical lymph node metastasis was 0.99. CONCLUSION: SLNB had very high sensitivity and specificity for productizing cervical lymph node metastasis in oral cancer patients.
28230019	Application of colon interposition among the esophageal cancer patients with partial gastrectomy.	BACKGROUND: Esophageal reconstruction with colon interposition is an alternative solution for the esophageal cancer patients who have partial gastrectomy. The aim of this study was to investigate the therapeutic effects of colon interposition among the esophageal carcinoma patients with partial gastrectomy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Under institutional review board approval, 32 esophageal carcinoma patients with a history of partial gastrectomy were included in this study. All the patients had been diagnosed and confirmed squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, or adenosquamous carcinoma by histopathological examination. Surgical approaches, complications and therapeutic results were analyzed in the current study. RESULTS: Thirty-two esophageal carcinoma patients (29 men, 3 women, median age 63.2 years) were included in this study. Isoperistaltic colon interposition was carried out on 14 patients; their 1-year and 2-year survival rate was 92.9% and 78.6%, respectively. Antiperistaltic colon interposition was carried out on 18 patients; their 1-year and 2-year survival rate was 88.9% and 77.8%, respectively. In which, cervical anastomotic leakage was observed on six patients. CONCLUSION: Colon interposition is an ideal surgical approach for the esophageal carcinoma patients who had partial gastrectomy. Isoperistaltic colon interposition is preferred, but antiperistaltic colon interposition has the advantage that a longer colon can be used.
28230013	Iodine-125 radioactive seed tissue implantation as a remedy treatment for recurrent cervical cancer.	PURPOSE: This study was designed to discuss feasibility, short-term efficacy, and complications of iodine-125 radioactive seed tissue implantation for remedying recurrent cervical cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From June 2009 to December 2010, 17 patients with recurrent cervical cancer received radioactive seed implantation under computed tomography (CT) guidance. Matched peripheral dose was 145 Gy, while the number of implanted seeds was from 6 to 68 with a median of 20. Efficacy was determined based on the results of CT and 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/CT. RESULTS: Postoperative follow-ups were from 4 to 18 months with a median follow-up time of 9.5 months. Nine patients died during follow-up while remaining patients survived during the follow-up period. Evaluation of efficacy: six patients had a complete response, four patients had a partial response, and seven patients had progressive disease, clinical efficacy rate as 58% (10/17). No patients had complications of radiation injury. Rate of 6 months and 1-year survival period was 74.8% and 18.3%, respectively. Comparing to patients who responded ineffectively to radioactive seed implantation, patients who responded effectively to radioactive seed implantation had a longer survival period (median 7.2 vs. median 10.4), in which the difference was statistically significant (P = 0.038). CONCLUSION: Iodine-125 radioactive seed tissue implantation is a feasible, effective, and safe treatment method for remedying or palliative treatment of recurrent cervical cancer. Patients who have recurrent cervical cancer and responded effectively to radioactive seed implantation will have a longer survival period.
28222668	Hematological parameters during concurrent chemoradiotherapy as potential prognosticators in patients with stage IIB cervical cancer.	We hypothesized that hemoglobin levels, absolute neutrophil count, and absolute lymphocyte count were associated with radiotherapy response and cancer progression and that they might reflect tumor repopulation during concurrent chemoradiotherapy. This study aimed to investigate these hematological parameters as prognosticators of cervical cancer. We analyzed 105 stage IIB cervical cancer patients treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy, using log-rank tests and multivariate analyses. Hazard ratios were calculated weekly to evaluate changes in hemoglobin, absolute neutrophil count, and absolute lymphocyte count that were associated with disease-specific survival. Patients were categorized into the high hematological risk (patients with low hemoglobin plus high absolute neutrophil count and/or low absolute lymphocyte count) and the low hematological risk (others) groups according to the median cutoff values. During the second week of concurrent chemoradiotherapy, hematological factors were significantly associated with survival. In multivariate analysis, hematological risk was independently associated with disease-specific survival and progression-free survival. The 5-year disease-specific survival and progression-free survival rates in the high hematological risk group were significantly lower compared with those in the low hematological risk group (81.6% vs 92.6%, p = 0.0297; 73.7% vs 89.3%, p = 0.0163, respectively). During the second week of concurrent chemoradiotherapy, the hematological parameters could predict treatment outcome in stage IIB cervical cancer.
28216603	Use of Mature miRNA Strand Selection in miRNAs Families in Cervical Cancer Development.	Aberrant miRNA expression is well recognized as a cancer hallmark, nevertheless miRNA function and expression does not always correlate in patients tissues and cell lines studies. In addition to this issue, miRNA strand usage conduces to increased cell signaling pathways modulation diversifying cellular processes regulation. In cervical cancer, 20 miRNA families are involved in carcinogenesis induction and development to this moment. These families have 5p and 3p strands with different nucleotide (nt) chain sizes. In general, mature 5p strands are larger: two miRNAs of 24 nt, 24 miRNAs of 23 nt, 35 miRNAs of 22 nt and three miRNAs of 21 nt. On the other hand, the 3p strands lengths observed are: seven miRNAs of 23 nt, 50 miRNAs of 22 nt, six miRNAs of 21 nt and four miRNAs of 20 nt. Based on the analysis of the 20 miRNA families associated with cervical cancer, 67 3p strands and 65 5p strands are selected suggesting selectivity and specificity mechanisms regulating cell processes like proliferation, apoptosis, migration, invasion, metabolism and Warburg effect. The insight reviewed here could be used in the miRNA based therapy, diagnosis and prognosis approaches.
28215507	Significance of uterine corpus tumor invasion in early-stage cervical cancer.	OBJECTIVE: To examine characteristics and survival outcomes of women with surgically-treated cervical cancer exhibiting uterine corpus tumor invasion. METHODS: We utilized The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program to identify cervical cancer patients who underwent hysterectomy between 1973 and 2003. Logistic regression models were used to identify risk factors for uterine corpus tumor invasion on multivariable analysis. Association of uterine corpus tumor invasion and cause-specific survival (CSS) from cervical cancer was examined with Cox proportional hazard regression models on multivariable analysis. RESULTS: We identified 837 (4.9%) cases of uterine corpus invasion and 16,237 (95.1%) cases of non-invasion. Median follow-up time was 14.0 years. There were 1642 deaths due to cervical cancer. Uterine corpus invasion was independently associated with older age, non-squamous histology, high-grade tumors, large tumor size, and nodal metastasis on multivariable analysis (all, P < 0.001). On univariable analysis, uterine corpus tumor invasion was significantly associated with decreased CSS compared to the non-invasion (5-year rates, 79.0% versus 94.5%, P < 0.001). After controlling for other significant prognostic factors, uterine corpus tumor invasion remained an independent prognostic factor for decreased CSS (adjusted-hazard ratio 1.45, 95% confidence interval 1.21-1.74). Among stage T1b cases (n = 6730), uterine corpus tumor invasion remained an independent prognostic factor for decreased CSS (adjusted-hazard ratio 1.95, 95%CI 1.47-2.60). Uterine corpus tumor invasion was significantly associated with decreased CSS in stage T1b1 disease (74.5% versus 90.7%, P < 0.001) and in stage T1b2 disease (67.0% versus 79.5%, P = 0.01). CONCLUSION: Uterine corpus tumor invasion is an independent prognostic factor for decreased survival of women with early-stage cervical cancer.
28214368	Evaluation of deformable image registration between external beam radiotherapy and HDR brachytherapy for cervical cancer with a 3D-printed deformable pelvis phantom.	PURPOSE: In this study, we developed a 3D-printed deformable pelvis phantom for evaluating spatial DIR accuracy. We then evaluated the spatial DIR accuracies of various DIR settings for cervical cancer. METHODS: A deformable female pelvis phantom was created based on patient CT data using 3D printing. To create the deformable uterus phantom, we first 3D printed both a model of uterus and a model of the internal cavities of the vagina and uterus. We then made a mold using the 3D printed uterus phantom. Finally, urethane was poured into the mold with the model of the internal cavities in place, creating the deformable uterus phantom with a cavity into which an applicator could be inserted. To create the deformable bladder phantom, we first 3D printed models of the bladder and of the same bladder scaled down by 2 mm. We then made a mold using the larger bladder model. Finally, silicone was poured into the mold with the smaller bladder model in place to create the deformable bladder phantom with a wall thickness of 2 mm. To emulate the anatomical bladder, water was poured into the created bladder. We acquired phantom image without applicator for EBRT. Then, we inserted the applicator into the phantom to simulate BT. In this situation, we scanned the phantom again to obtain the phantom image for BT. We performed DIR using the two phantom images in two cases: Case A, with full bladder (170 ml) in both EBRT and BT images; and Case B with full bladder in the BT image and half-full bladder (100 ml) in the EBRT image. DIR was evaluated using Dice similarity coefficients (DSCs) and 31 landmarks for the uterus and 25 landmarks for the bladder. A hybrid intensity and structure DIR algorithm implemented in RayStation with four DIR settings was evaluated. RESULTS: On visual inspection, reasonable agreement in shape of the uterus between the phantom and patient CT images was observed for both EBRT and BT, although some regional disagreements in shape of the bladder and rectum were apparent. The created phantom could reproduce the actual patient's uterus deformation by the applicator. For both Case A and B, large variation was seen in landmark error among the four DIR parameters. In addition, although DSCs were comparable, moderate differences in landmark error existed between the two different DIR parameters selected from the four DIR parameters (i.e., DSC = 0.96, landmark error = 13.2 +/- 5.7 mm vs. DSC = 0.97, landmark error = 9.7 +/- 4.0 mm). This result suggests that landmark error evaluation might thus be more effective than DSC for evaluating DIR accuracy. CONCLUSIONS: Our developed phantom enabled the evaluation of spatial DIR accuracy for the female pelvic region for the first time. Although the DSCs are high, the spatial errors can still be significant and our developed phantom facilitates their quantification. Our results showed that optimization is needed to identify suitable DIR settings. For determining suitable DIR settings, our method of evaluating spatial DIR accuracy using the 3D-printed phantom may prove helpful.
28214213	The relationship between BRAFV600E, NF-kappaB and TgAb expression in papillary thyroid carcinoma.	PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to investigate the potential link between thyroglobulin antibody (TgAb) titers and papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) aggressiveness. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study included 122 patients who had undergone total thyroidectomy and neck central area lymph dissection followed by radioactive iodine (RAI) ablation for PTC between July 2012 and July 2014. The parameters included clinical characteristics of PTC, TgAb levels and tumor histopathological characteristics. Then, BRAFV600E and NF-kappaB expression in 113 PTC patients in our hospital were examined by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The group of TgAb-positive PTC patients more frequently presented with lymph node metastases (80.0% vs 61.2%, p=0.000), distant metastases (10.0% vs 1.9%, p=0.000), more RAI ablation treatments in their treatment history (344.4+/-88.2 vs 222.5+/-91.1, p=0.003) and imaging-documented disease (20.0% vs 7.8%, p=0.000) after two years' follow-up. We also found that protein expression levels of BRAFV600E and NF-kappaB were greater in TgAb-positive patients compared with TgAb-negative PTC patients (p=0.005, p=0.001). Immunoreactivity scores of BRAFV600E and NF-kappaB in TgAb-positive PTC patients with bilateral tumor foci, lymph node metastases, HT and imaging-documented disease was highest. Multivariate analysis revealed that lymph node metastases significantly correlated with NF-kappaB levels and TgAb levels (p=0.004, p=0.014). CONCLUSION: The expression levels of BRAFV600E and NF-kappaB were significantly greater in TgAb-positive than in TgAb-negative PTC patients. In PTC, overexpression of NF-kappaB, as well as positive TgAb, may be a risk factor for cervical lymph node metastasis.
28214204	Detection of occult endocervical glandular dysplasia in cervical conization specimens for squamous lesions.	The aim of this work was to evaluate the incidence of occult cervical glandular intraepithelial neoplasia (CGIN) and adenocarcinoma of the cervix (AC) in women treated with CO2-laser conization for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) or squamocellular cervical cancer (SCC). The medical records of all women with a histological diagnosis of squamous lesions of the uterine cervix (persistent CIN1, CIN2, CIN3 and SCC) who were subsequently treated with CO2-laser conization at our institution, during the period from January 1991 to December 2014, were analyzed in a retrospective case series. Among the 1004 women fulfilling the study inclusion/exclusion criteria, 77 cases (7.7%) of occult glandular lesions (CGIN and AC) were detected on the final cone specimen (48 cases of occult low-grade cervical glandular intraepithelial neoplasia (LCGIN), 25 cases of occult high-grade cervical glandular intraepithelial neoplasia (HCGIN), and four cases of occult "usual-type" AC). No difference in the mean age between women diagnosed with occult glandular lesions and women without occult glandular lesions on the final specimen emerged (39.1+/-9.3 vs 38.4+/-9.4, p=0.5). In women with occult LCGIN on cone specimen, mean follow-up of 48 months was reported (range 7-206 months) and no cases of progression to HCGIN or AC were observed. In conclusion, a relatively high rate of occult glandular lesions was found in women treated for squamous lesions. The natural history of CGIN is still uncertain and, in particular, there are some controversies as to whether LCGIN is a precursor lesion of HCGIN or AC. In this context the role of pathologists become very important since the appropriate diagnosis of these lesions could have potential implications in the clinical management of these patients.
28212672	Cytokeratin7 and cytokeratin19 expression in high grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasm and squamous cell carcinoma and their possible association in cervical carcinogenesis.	BACKGROUND: High risk human papillomavirus (HR HPV) infects cells at the squamocolumnar junction (SCJ) of the cervix, causing cancer. Cytokeratin (CK)7 is an SCJ marker, and stains cervical neoplasia. CK19 is a binding partner of CK7 and expressed in cervical cancer. Despite this possible association between CK7/CK19 and cervical cancer, not much is known about the mechanism of CK7/CK19 involvement in HR HPV-mediated cervical carcinogenesis. METHODS: We analyzed the expression pattern of CK7, CK19, and p16 by using immunohistochemistry and HPV infection by in situ hybridization in 25 cases of high grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN3) and in 30 cases of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). RESULTS: CK19, p16, and HPV expression was positive in all CIN3 and SCC cases. CK7 expression was positive in all CIN3 cases and in 20/30 (66%) SCCs. Each protein showed diffuse or patchy staining with topographic distinction. Patchy staining of CK7 and episomal HPV DNA overlapped in the upper layer of CIN3 and central portion of an invasive nest in the SCC, whereas patchy CK19 staining and integrated HPV DNA were usually noted in the lower layer of CIN3 and the periphery of the SCC nest. The p16 staining pattern coincided with that of CK19 in a subset of SCC. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that CK7 may be more related with viral episomal replication and CK19 with viral integration, contributing to viral replication and malignant transformation in HR HPV infected cells. In addition, coordinate CK7/CK19 staining may be used as a valuable marker for predicting physical status of HR HPV and E7 oncoprotein level in cervical tumor.
28211234	Lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma of cervix: Cytological Features on Conventional Cervical Smear.	Lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma (LELC) is a rare neoplasm of the cervix. The importance of distinguishing this undifferentiated carcinoma with a predominant lymphocytic infiltrate lies in the fact that despite being poorly differentiated they have a better prognosis. The diagnosis however becomes more challenging when the pathologist is provided with a small cervical biopsy or a Papanicolaou smear. While the reports describing histology and their relation to Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) are many, there are only few case reports describing the cytology of these tumors. We describe the cytological features of LELC of cervix on conventional smear and correlate it with the histopathological findings of the same. A 67-year-old multiparous Hindu woman presented to the gynecology outpatient department with the history of postmenopausal bleeding for the past six months. The cytological examination of the cervical smear (Papanicolaou stain) was done followed by cervical and endometrial biopsy. Based on Papanicolaou smear and biopsy suggestive of a poorly differentiated carcinoma a radical hysterectomy with pelvic lymphadenectomy was performed. Hysterectomy specimen showed the morphology of LELC and was then correlated with the cervical smears retrospectively. On review of cytological smears it was seen that the tumor cell clusters had an abundant lymphoid background, which was overlooked earlier. Immunohistochemistry for EBV was negative. We conclude that the presence of undifferentiated tumor cell clusters with ill-defined cell borders and large number of lymphoid cells in the background suggest the diagnosis of LELC on cervical cytology.

28208804	Hazelnut (Corylus avellana L.) Shells Extract: Phenolic Composition, Antioxidant Effect and Cytotoxic Activity on Human Cancer Cell Lines.	Hazelnut shells, a by-product of the kernel industry processing, are reported to contain high amount of polyphenols. However, studies on the chemical composition and potential effects on human health are lacking. A methanol hazelnut shells extract was prepared and dried. Our investigation allowed the isolation and characterization of different classes of phenolic compounds, including neolignans, and a diarylheptanoid, which contribute to a high total polyphenol content (193.8 +/- 3.6 mg of gallic acid equivalents (GAE)/g of extract). Neolignans, lawsonicin and cedrusin, a cyclic diarylheptanoid, carpinontriol B, and two phenol derivatives, C-veratroylglycol, and beta-hydroxypropiovanillone, were the main components of the extract (0.71%-2.93%, w/w). The biological assays suggested that the extract could be useful as a functional ingredient in food technology and pharmaceutical industry showing an in vitro scavenging activity against the radical 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radical (DPPH) (EC50 = 31.7 mug/mL with respect to alpha-tocopherol EC50 = 10.1 mug/mL), and an inhibitory effect on the growth of human cancer cell lines A375, SK-Mel-28 and HeLa (IC50 = 584, 459, and 526 mug/mL, respectively). The expression of cleaved forms of caspase-3 and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) suggested that the extract induced apoptosis through caspase-3 activation in both human malignant melanoma (SK-Mel-28) and human cervical cancer (HeLa) cell lines. The cytotoxic activity relies on the presence of the neolignans (balanophonin), and phenol derivatives (gallic acid), showing a pro-apoptotic effect on the tested cell lines, and the neolignan, cedrusin, with a cytotoxic effect on A375 and HeLa cells.
28203075	Co-delivery of paclitaxel and TOS-cisplatin via TAT-targeted solid lipid nanoparticles with synergistic antitumor activity against cervical cancer.	BACKGROUND: Cervical cancer is a major world health problem for women. Currently, cancer research focuses on improving therapy for cervical cancer using various treatment options such as co-delivery of chemotherapeutic agents by nanocarriers. PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to develop trans-activating transcriptional activator (TAT)-modified solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) for co-delivery of paclitaxel (PTX) and alpha-tocopherol succinate-cisplatin prodrug (TOS-CDDP) (TAT PTX/TOS-CDDP SLNs) in order to achieve synergistic antitumor activity against cervical cancer. METHODS: Lipid prodrug of CDDP (TOS-CDDP) and TAT-containing polyethylene glycol-distearoyl-phosphatidylethanolamine (TAT-PEG-DSPE) were synthesized. TAT PTX/TOS-CDDP SLNs were prepared by emulsification and solvent evaporation method. Physicochemical characteristics of SLNs such as size, morphology, and release profiles were explored. In vitro and in vivo studies were carried out to assess the efficacy of their antitumor activity in target cells. RESULTS: TAT PTX/TOS-CDDP SLNs could be successfully internalized by HeLa cells and showed a synergistic effect in the suppression of cervical tumor cell growth. They exhibited high tumor tissue accumulation, superior antitumor efficiency, and much lower toxicity in vivo. CONCLUSION: The present study indicates that the co-delivery system provides a promising platform as a combination therapy for the treatment of cervical cancer, and possibly other types of cancer as well.
28196844	Cervical cancer incidence after normal cytological sample in routine screening using SurePath, ThinPrep, and conventional cytology: population based study.	Objective To compare the cumulative incidence of cervical cancer diagnosed within 72 months after a normal screening sample between conventional cytology and liquid based cytology tests SurePath and ThinPrep.Design Retrospective population based cohort study.Setting Nationwide network and registry of histo- and cytopathology in the Netherlands (PALGA), January 2000 to March 2013.Population Women with 5 924 474 normal screening samples (23 833 123 person years).Exposure Use of SurePath or ThinPrep versus conventional cytology as screening test.Main outcome measure 72 month cumulative incidence of invasive cervical cancer after a normal screening sample for each screening test. Cox regression analyses assessed the hazard ratios, adjusted for calendar time, age, screening history, and socioeconomic status and including laboratories as random effects.Results The 72 month cumulative cancer incidence was 58.5 (95% confidence interval 54.6 to 62.7) per 100 000 normal conventional cytology samples, compared with 66.8 (56.7 to 78.7) for ThinPrep and 44.6 (37.8 to 52.6) for SurePath. Compared with conventional cytology, the hazard of invasive cancer was 19% lower (hazard ratio 0.81, 95% confidence interval 0.66 to 0.99) for SurePath, mainly caused by a 27% lower hazard (0.73, 0.57 to 0.93) of a clinically detected cancer. For ThinPrep, the hazard was on average 15% higher (hazard ratio 1.15, 0.95 to 1.38), mainly caused by a 56% higher hazard of a screen detected cancer (1.56, 1.17 to 2.08).Conclusions These findings should provoke reconsideration of the assumed similarity in sensitivity to detect progressive cervical intraepithelial neoplasia between different types of liquid based cytology and conventional cytology.
28195087	Perineural invasion is a valuable prognostic factor in advanced stage and/or Node (+) cervical cancer.	BACKGROUND: Perineural invasion (PNI) is correlated with adverse survival in several malignancies, but its significance cervical cancer remains to be clearly defined. The objective of this study was to determine the association between PNI status and clinical outcomes in clinically localized surgically treated cervical cancers. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed clinical records and pathology slides of 111 patients with cervical cancer treated with surgery at a single academic center. PNI was evaluated for presence, number of foci per slide, involved largest nerve size, and topographically (intratumoral vs. extratumoral). Association with these parameters, clinicopathologic characteristics and survival were analyzed. RESULTS: The analysis demonstrated that PNI in cervical cancer was significantly correlated with parametrial invasion, tumor size, resection margin involvement, lymphovascular invasion, lymph node (LN) metastasis, depth of stromal invasion, necrosis, and higher stage disease (P < 0.005). Similarly, PNI density and mean size of the nerve involved were also associated with advanced stage (P < 0.005). In the multivariate analysis, PNI was not an independent prognostic factor for disease-free and overall survival. However, in the advanced stage cases and LN (+) cases, PNI is significantly associated with lower overall survival (43 vs. 58 months and 36 vs. 60 months, respectively, P < 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: The presence of PNI is accompanied by high-risk factors for recurrence. Overall survival rate is significantly reduced in PNI (+) patients. Although PNI itself is not an independent prognostic factor, PNI has a significant prognostic impact on overall survival in patients with advanced stage and/or Node (+) cervical cancer.
28195086	Altered expressions of Notch-1 signaling proteins and beta-catenin in progression of carcinoma in situ into squamous carcinoma of uterine cervix.	BACKGROUND: Activation of Notch-1 signaling pathway and loss of membranous beta-catenin have been known to play key roles in the progression of uterine cervix cancer and thus this study focused any alteration in the expression patterns for Notch-1, p53, and cyclin D1 as well as beta-catenin in squamous carcinoma in situ (CIS) and invasive squamous carcinomas to investigate their roles in the progression of CIS to squamous carcinomas. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three Notch-1 signaling proteins, such as Notch-1, TP53, and cyclin D1, and a component of cell adhesion complex, beta-catenin, were immunohistochemically stained in 112 uterine cervical tumors including 74 CIS and 38 invasive squamous carcinomas (11 microinvasive and 27 invasive carcinomas). Each immunohistochemical result was compared between CIS and squamous carcinoma groups and the difference was statistically analyzed. RESULTS: Notch-1 protein expression was significantly higher in the microinvasive and invasive carcinomas than in CIS lesions (P = 0.001). Cyclin D1 and p53 immunoreactivities tended to be expressed higher in the invasive group than in CIS (P = 0.056 and 0.060). Membranous beta-catenin expression was significantly reduced in squamous carcinomas compared to CIS (P = 0.000). However, both CIS and squamous carcinoma groups revealed no interrelationship among Notch-1 signaling proteins and beta-catenin. CONCLUSION: Altered expressions of Notch-1 signaling proteins and beta-catenin in the progression of CIS into squamous carcinoma of uterine cervix suggests that Notch-1 signaling pathway and cell adhesiveness might play key roles in the stromal invasion of CIS cells.
28191273	Oxidative Stress Triggered by Apigenin Induces Apoptosis in a Comprehensive Panel of Human Cervical Cancer-Derived Cell Lines.	Recently, the cytotoxic effects of apigenin (4',5,7-trihydroxyflavone), particularly its marked inhibition of cancer cell viability both in vitro and in vivo, have attracted the attention of the anticancer drug discovery field. Despite this, there are few studies of apigenin in cervical cancer, and these studies have mostly been conducted using HeLa cells. To evaluate the possibility of apigenin as a new therapeutic candidate for cervical cancer, we evaluated its cytotoxic effects in a comprehensive panel of human cervical cancer-derived cell lines including HeLa (human papillomavirus/HPV 18-positive), SiHa (HPV 16-positive), CaSki (HPV 16 and HPV 18-positive), and C33A (HPV-negative) cells in comparison to a nontumorigenic spontaneously immortalized human epithelial cell line (HaCaT). Our results demonstrated that apigenin had a selective cytotoxic effect and could induce apoptosis in all cervical cancer cell lines which were positively marked with Annexin V, but not in HaCaT (control cells). Additionally, apigenin was able to induce mitochondrial redox impairment, once it increased ROS levels and H2O2, decreased the Deltapsim, and increased LPO. Still, apigenin was able to inhibit migration and invasion of cancer cells. Thus, apigenin appears to be a promising new candidate as an anticancer drug for cervical cancer induced by different HPV genotypes.
28189086	Pterocarpan scaffold: A natural lead molecule with diverse pharmacological properties.	Phytoalexins are substances produced by plants that act as potent inhibitors of pathogens. Pterocarpans are biologically active isoflavonoids most commonly found in the family Fabaceae that have the ability to act as phytoalexins. It is made up of a tetracyclic ring system possessing benzofuran-benzopyran. A very great number of pterocarpans have been isolated from natural sources and they are proved to have significant biological activities such as anti-microbial, anti-cancerous, anti-inflammatory and anti-malarial activities. Recently, pterocarpans gained lot of attention because of the broad range of anti-cancer activities in various cancer cell lines such as breast, leukemia, cervical, lung, colon and melanoma. Interestingly, pterocarpans exhibited inhibitory potency against many enzymes such as PTP1B, Neuraminidase, and alpha-glycosidase. In addition, they were shown to have anti-estrogenic and anti-diabetic activities. This review is a comprehensive inventory of the structures and sources of pterocarpans and it emphasizes on the biological evaluations of pterocarpans from various plant sources and their scope as a lead molecule.
28181670	Risk of persistent or recurrent neoplasia in conservatively treated women with cervical adenocarcinoma in situ with negative histological margins.	INTRODUCTION: Conservative treatments including cold knife cone biopsy (CKC) or loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP) are fertility-preserving alternatives to hysterectomy. The risks of persistent cervical neoplasia in women with negative surgical margins following conservative treatment of adenocarcinoma-in-situ (AIS) are uncertain. This study aims to investigate the risk of persistent or recurrent cervical neoplasia [AIS, adenocarcinoma and/or high-grade cervical squamous intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN)] and compliance with follow-up recommendations in conservatively treated women with AIS and negative histopathological margins. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective, population-based study of Western Australian women treated by CKC or LEEP for AIS between 2001 and 2012. Histopathology reports were reviewed for demographic information, treatment procedures and clinicopathological factors. Primary outcomes were the diagnosis of cervical neoplasia during follow-up (defined as <12 months) and surveillance (>/=12 months) periods. RESULTS: The cohort comprised 360 women, with 175 (48.6%) initially treated by CKC and 185 (51.4%) treated by LEEP. The median patient age at time of excisional treatment was 30.0 years (range 18-64 years) and the median follow-up time was 3.9 years (range six months to 12.2 years). During the follow-up and surveillance periods, seven (1.9%) women were diagnosed with CIN 2/3, 10 (2.8%) with AIS, and one (0.3%) with cervical adenocarcinoma, despite their initial excision specimens having negative histological margins. CONCLUSION: In this study, there was a low but significant risk of persistent or recurrent cervical neoplasia in women who had initial conservative management of AIS with negative histopathological margins.
28178952	Study of phytochemical, anti-microbial, anti-oxidant, and anti-cancer properties of Allium wallichii.	BACKGROUND: There is growing interest in the use of plants for the treatment and prevention of cancer. Medicinal plants are currently being evaluated as source of promising anticancer agents. In this paper, we have investigated the anticancer potential of plant Allium wallichii, a plant native to Nepal and growing at elevations of 2300-4800 m. This is the first study of its kind for the plant mentioned. METHODS: The dried plant was extracted in aqueous ethanol. Phytochemical screening, anti-microbial assay, anti-oxidant assay, cytotoxicity assay and the flow-cytometric analysis were done for analyzing different phytochemicals present, anti-microbial activity, anti-oxidant activity and anti-cancer properties of Allium wallichii. RESULTS: We observed the presence of steroids, terpenoids, flavonoids, reducing sugars and glycosides in the plant extract and the plant showed moderate anti-microbial and anti-oxidant activity. The IC50 values of Allium wallichii in different cancer cell lines are 69.69 mug/ml for Prostate cancer (PC3) cell line, 55.29 mug/ml for Breast Cancer (MCF-7) cell line and 46.51 mug/ml for cervical cancer (HeLa) cell line as compared to Doxorubicin (0.85 mug/ml). The cell viability assay using FACS showed that the IC50value of Allium wallichii for Burkitt's lymphoma (B-Lymphoma) cell line was 3.817 +/- 1.99 mg/ml. CONCLUSIONS: Allium wallichii can be an important candidate to be used as an anticancer agent. Separation of pure compounds with bioassay guided extraction, spectrometric analysis and subsequent cytotoxicity assay of the pure bioactive compounds from Allium wallichii is highly recommended as the crude extract itself showed promising cytotoxicity.
28178620	miR-944 acts as a prognostic marker and promotes the tumor progression in endometrial cancer.	microRNA-944 (miR-944) has been reported to be deregulation and play either tumor suppressive or oncogenic function in human malignancies. Previous studies have reported that miR-944 is overexpressed in gynecological malignancies including cervical cancer and breast cancer. While, the clinical significance of miR-944 and its function in human endometrial carcinoma (EC) keep unknown. The levels of miR-944 were analyzed in 68 EC tissues and 20 normal endometrial tissues. Results showed that miR-944 was significantly overexpressed in EC tissues compared to normal endometrial tissues. In addition, increased levels of miR-944 also observed in EC cell lines. Clinicopathological analysis verified that miR-944 expression was associated with international federation of gynecology and obstetrics (FIGO) stages and pathology classification of EC. Moreover, Kaplan-Meier analysis found that miR-944 highly expressing EC patients showed a notable shorter survival. Further experiments revealed that miR-944 knockdown significantly inhibited growth and cell cycle progression while facilitated apoptosis in Ishikawa cells. In turn, miR-944 overexpression prominently promoted proliferation and cell cycle progression, and suppressed apoptosis in KLE cells. In vivo experiments further confirmed that miR-944 silencing notably restrained the tumor growth of EC in nude mice. Mechanically, cell adhesion molecule 2 (CADM2) was recognized as a direct downstream target of miR-944 in EC cells. An inverse correlation between miR-944 and CADM2 expression was observed in EC tissues. Interestingly, CADM2 overexpression showed similar effects to miR-944 knockdown in Ishikawa cells with decreased growth, cell cycle arrest at G1 phase and increased apoptosis. Taken together, this work support the first evidence that miR-944 can be potentially used as a promising biomarker and novel therapeutic target for human EC.
28174375	[Characteristics of Adolescent and Young Adult Cancer].	In adolescent and young adult(AYA)population, cancer is the leading cause of death due to illness with the lowest mortality rate as well as children, and national measures for cancer was left behind. Leukemia, lymphomas, brain tumors, thyroid cancer, ovarian cancer, cervical cancer, breast cancer, testicular cancer and bone and soft tissue sarcomas account for majority of the cancers in this age group. There has been no significant improvement in AYA patients in contrast to other age groups. AYA patients with cancer are under growing independency, starting in life to the community, and reproductive age. As they have physical change to adults and unique psychosocial issues that are distinct from those of pediatric and older adult patients, it is important to establish appropriate disease treatment and psychosocial supportive care with due respect to established themselves. It is urgent issue to develop cancer treatments and the system of medical and supportive care for patients and survivors with cancer in this age group.
28174190	Unusual sites of metastases of carcinoma cervix.	We present a case of metastatic squamous cell carcinoma cervix with solitary bone metastases to the right tibia and multiple cutaneous metastases. A woman aged 52 years with cancer of the cervix and lung metastases, after 21 months of initial diagnosis and palliative chemotherapy presented with pain in the right knee and multiple nodular skin lesions. Bone scintigraphy revealed intense increased tracer activity in the proximal and mid shaft of the right tibia. Biopsy from the tibial lesion confirmed metastatic squamous cell carcinoma. The presentation, diagnosis and management of this rare case are discussed.
28174186	Avoiding misdiagnosis: cystic calcified brain metastases of uterine cervical cancer mimicking neurocysticercosis.	The radiological finding of multiple calcified brain lesions is atypical for brain metastases and in absence of a clear evidence of disseminated neoplastic disease the differential diagnosis may be difficult. Calcified brain metastases (CBM) are rarely encountered in clinical practice and they mostly arise from lung, breast and gastrointestinal primitive tumours. Only one case of uterine cervical carcinoma (UCC) with CBM has been reported so far. We describe the case of a 41-year-old Caucasian woman with a history of hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy for UCC 3 years prior to observation and no evidence of neoplastic recurrence that developed cystic CBM. Owing to their peculiar radiological appearance, lesions were initially misidentified as neurocysticercosis, the most common parasitic infection of the central nervous system. We offer the reader some important teaching points for the differential diagnosis and discuss the rarity of our case.
28166075	Clinico-histopathological Survey of Head and Neck Cancer at Tertiary Health Care Centre -Dhulikhel Hospital.	Background Head and neck is one of the most prevalent site for cancers along with lungs, cervix, breast and stomach. Hospital based cancer registries required for effective evaluation of diagnosis and management of cancer is inadequate in Nepal. Cancer registry system established by WHO is acquired by seven major hospitals in our country. However, data from tertiary health care centres like ours remain undocumented. Objective The objective of this study is to perform retrospective analysis of clinicohistopathological types of head and neck lesions which were eventually diagnosed as cancer in Dhulikel Hospital, a tertiary health care centre of Central East Nepal. Method Data regarding head and neck lesions diagnosed as cancer (January 2001- December 2014) were extracted from the archives of Department of General Pathology. These cases were categorised according to demographic profile, site of cancer and histological diagnosis. Result A total of 240 cases matched the inclusion criteria and were selected for this study. Male: Female ratio of 1.3:1 with a mean age of 52 years (52.82+/-1.8) was found. Two hundred and two (84.16%) patients were diagnosed with carcinoma, 31 (15%) with lymphoma, 3 (1.25%) with melanoma, 2(0.83%) with small round cell tumor and 2 (0.83%) with sarcoma. The most common histological types of carcinoma seen were Squamous cell carcinoma (138 cases; 57.5%) followed by papillary carcinoma (26 cases; 10.8%). Among the lymphomas Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (21 cases; 8.75%) was the most predominant type. The most common site of presentation was oral cavity (60 cases; 25%) followed by skin (36 cases; 15%), thyroid (32 cases; 13.33%) and oesophagus (27 cases; 11.25%). Metastasis to cervical lymph node was found in 39 cases (16.25%). Conclusion Based on these finding, it was observed that Squamous cell carcinoma was the most common type followed by different epithelial and mesenchymal malignancies in head and neck region. The results revealed by this study will provide useful information for planning the health care policies about cancer in Nepal and will be more effective and helpful to the patients of remote areas.
28160857	Eulophia macrobulbon - an orchid with significant anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effect and anticancerogenic potential exerted by its root extract.	BACKGROUND: The Orchidaceae family is one of the largest families of flowering plants. Orchids are widely used for the traditional herbal medicine, acting as aphrodisiac, antisepic, antimicrobial, anti-cancer agent, etc. PURPOSE: This study was designed to elucidate the anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and cytotoxic potential of a 50% ethanolic extract of Eulophia macrobulbon roots (EME) in vitro, an orchid growing in Southern Asia. Furthermore, the main active compounds were isolated, and the bioactivity of the single constituents was determined. METHODS: The anti-inflammatory activity of EME and its compounds was evaluated by the secretion of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines and by the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated macrophage model, as determined by an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and Western blot. Antioxidant activity was assessed using a DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picryl-hydrazyl-hydrate) photometric assay. Cytotoxic effects were determined using a colorimetric 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT)-assay. RESULTS: EME and its compounds significantly reduced the production of the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin 6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), the expression of iNOS and subsequently increased the production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin 10 (IL-10) in LPS-stimulated macrophages. Additionally it could be demonstrated that EME is rich in radical scavengers. Furthermore, EME and its components showed notable cytotoxic effects on the human cervical adenocarcinoma cell line HeLa, the human colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line CaCo-2 and the human breast adenocarcinoma cell line MCF-7. The most active constituents were identified as 4-methoxy-9,10-dihydro-2,7-phenanthrenediol (8), 4-methoxy-2,7-phenanthrenediol (9), 1,5-dimethoxy-2,7-phenanthrenediol (10), 1,5,7-trimethoxy-2,6-phenanthrenediol (11), 1-(4-hydroxybenzyl)-4,8-dimethoxy-2,7-phenanthrenediol (15). CONCLUSION: Based on this data, EME provides various beneficial anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and cytotoxic attributes and may be used as herbal remedy in the pharmaceutical or food industries.
28160449	The significance of parakeratosis alone in cervicovaginal cytology of turkish women.	BACKGROUND: We aimed to analyze the significance of parakeratosis on an otherwise negative Papanicalaou (Pap) smear, in the absence of any characteristic human papilloma virus (HPV) findings. METHODS: A total of 22,076 Papanicalaou smears that were diagnosed as negative for intraepithelial lesions or malignancy between 2013 and 2015 were included in this study. Samples were separated into two groups, according to the presence of parakeratosis. We investigated the association between parakeratosis in the cytology results and a high-risk HPV status and high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) in the colposcopic biopsy specimens. RESULTS: A positive HPV result was more frequently identified in cases with parakeratosis than in cases without parakeratosis (P < 0.001). A histological diagnosis of HSIL was more frequently observed in HPV-positive cases with a diagnosis of parakeratosis on cytology than in cases without parakeratosis (P = 0.8). CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate that a finding of parakeratosis on an otherwise negative Pap smear supports a follow-up HPV DNA test. Also we should consider whether the presence of parakeratosis should be included in standard cytology reports. Additionally parakeratosis trended toward increased frequency of HSIL in follow-up biopsy specimens. But it did not reach statistical significance. That is why larger studies are necessary to evaluate the association of parakeratosis and HSIL in colposcopic biopsy specimens. Diagn. Cytopathol. 2017;45:297-302. (c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
28157826	Impact of Age at Conization on Obstetrical Outcome: A Case-Control Study.	OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to assess whether an age younger than 25 years at conization affected future pregnancy outcome as an independent factor. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective study of 115 women who underwent both loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP) and subsequent pregnancy follow-up in a referral center was conducted. Two groups were considered: patients younger than 25 years at the time of LEEP (n = 42) and 25 years or older (n = 73). Analyzed data were occurrence of preterm adverse obstetrical event and, specifically, preterm labor (PL) and preterm rupture of membranes; stratification based on term of occurrence was performed: less than 37 weeks of amenorrhea (WA), less than 34 WA, and less than 26 WA. RESULTS: Patients characteristics were comparable in terms of excised specimen thickness and pathological analysis, as well as for tobacco intoxication during pregnancy. Although there was no difference of term at delivery or total number of preterm adverse obstetrical events, we found a significant increase of events (19% vs 4.1%) and PL (19% vs 0%) before 26 WA in the group of patients younger than 25 years. After adjusting for excised specimen thickness, the same results were found for thickness of 15 mm or less (respectively, 16.7% vs 3.3% and 16.7% vs 0%). For thickness of greater than 15 mm, only ratio of PL before 26 WA was higher in the group of patients younger than 25 years (33.3% vs 0%). CONCLUSIONS: Age younger than 25 years at the time of LEEP seems to be is associated with a more frequent occurrence of extremely early preterm adverse obstetrical events, particularly PL.
28157825	Pain Sensation During Colposcopy and Cervical Biopsy, With or Without Local Anesthesia: A Randomized Trial.	OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to determine whether an injection of a local anesthetic is more painful than a cervical punch biopsy without local anesthesia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was a randomized controlled trial, conducted at the Helsinki University Central Hospital. It consisted of 204 women referred for colposcopic assessments. Half of them were randomized to receive local anesthesia before their cervical punch biopsies. After the injection of the local anesthetic, the cervical punch biopsy, and the endocervical curettage, the women scored their actual pain using a 10-cm visual analog scale (VAS).To measure the difference in VAS scores between two groups, a linear regression model was used. Binomial regression model was applied for comparing the probability of experiencing unbearable pain between the groups. Applying modeling approach allowed also for proper adjustment for other potential risk factors. RESULTS: The mean VAS score for the injection of the local anesthetic was 2.7, the VAS score for the cervical punch biopsy without local anesthesia was 3.5, and the difference was 0.8 (p = .017; 95% CI = 0.1-1.5). The mean VAS for the biopsy with local anesthesia was 0.8, which was significantly lower than the mean VAS for the biopsy without local anesthesia (difference = 2.7; p < .001; 95% CI = 2.2-3.3). The relative risk for experiencing moderate or severe pain (VAS >/= 5) was 0.6 (p = .03; 95% CI = 0.3-0.9) for the injection of local anesthetic versus the biopsy without local anesthesia. CONCLUSIONS: Injection of a local anesthetic for colposcopy is less painful than biopsies without local anesthesia, and local anesthesia decreases the pain perceived.
28154674	Targeting women with free cervical cancer screening: challenges and lessons learnt from Osun state, southwest Nigeria.	INTRODUCTION: The study was conducted to determine the challenges and suggest solutions to conducting free cervical cancer screening among Nigerian women. METHODS: Awareness was created among women groups and mass media in Osun State for women to undergo free cervical cancer screening programme. Consenting women had their socio-demographic characteristics, awareness and uptake of HPV vaccine documented and papanicolaou smear procedure done with adequate referral for treatment given where necessary. RESULTS: A total of 287 women had cervical cancer screening. Mean (SD) age was 51.6 (14.3) years. Most participants were urban based (87.1%), married (63.1%), had secondary education (39%) and were traders (79.1%). None of the women were aware of the preventive HPV vaccine or had been vaccinated against HPV. About 6% were pre-invasive while 0.7% had invasive cervical cancer. The highest proportions of respondents affected were young, married and had lower education. Challenges identified included poor attendance, low risk perception and logistic issues. CONCLUSION: Most participants were urban based. There is need to decentralize cancer of cervix screening through mobile clinics and establishment of screening centres in the rural areas. Neighbour to neighbour sensitization is essential. Also, HPV vaccine should be available and affordable to all girls before sexual maturity.
28154623	Human Papillomavirus types distribution among women with cervical preneoplastic, lesions and cancer in Luanda, Angola.	INTRODUCTION: Cervical cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths among females in Angola and human papillomavirus (HPV) is the main risk factor for the development of pre-cancerous squamous intraepithelial lesions. The diversity and frequency of HPV types in Angola has yet to be reported. AIM: To determine the frequency of HPV among women with squamous intraepithelial lesions from women in Luanda, Angola. METHODS: Study participants included women diagnosed with cytological abnormalities that voluntarily provided Pap smears (n = 64). Genomic DNA was extracted from the samples for use as templates in the PCR amplification of HPV sequences. PCR products were sequenced to determine HPV type. RESULTS: HPV DNA was detected in 71.9% (46/64) in the samples. A higher diversity of HPV types was found in the cytological lesions, such as ASCUS and LSIL (HPV16, 6, 18, 31, 58, 66, 70 and 82, in order of frequency) than that detected for HSIL and SSC (HPV16, 18, 6 and 33). The most prevalent HPV type were: HPV16, HPV6 and HPV18. CONCLUSION: This is the first report on HPV type diversity and frequency in woman of Angola. The results suggest that large-scale studies across Africa would improve our understanding of interrelationship between HPV infections and cervical cancer. More directly, the identification of the HPV types most prevalent suggests that women in Angola would benefit from currently available HPV vaccines.
28147307	Isatin-beta-thiocarbohydrazones: Microwave-assisted synthesis, antitumor activity and structure-activity relationship.	A new series of isatin-beta-thiocarbohydrazones was synthesized based on the pharmacophoric features of triapine required for metal chelation. Our strategy involved the modifications of triapine basic skeleton by replacing pyridinyl moiety with isatin which retains the tridentate feature of triapine needed for metal chelation. The new compounds were esteemed for their antitumor efficacy against cervical cancer (Hela) and kidney fibroblast cancer (COS-7) cell lines. Compounds 4c, 4d, 5c and 5e exhibited remarkable efficacy against Hela cell line. In addition, compounds 4c, 4k, 4e, 5c and 5e displayed an outstanding efficacy against COS-7 cell line. Compounds 4c, 4k, 4e, 5c and 5e were examined for their in vivo antitumor efficacy against Ehrlich ascites carcinoma (EAC) in mice. Pharmacophore mapping was performed to study the structural features of the synthesized compounds compared to triapine and to identify the essential moieties required for potent and selective antitumor activity.
28146625	Human Papillomavirus (HPV) and cervical cancer.	Cervical cancer is one of the most common cancer in women in Poland and in the world. The main risk factor for this cancer is persistent infection with high - risk human papillomavirus (HPV-HR) types. The most important role in carcinogenesis is attributed to viral oncoproteins E6 and E7, that affect some cell cycle proteins. Diagnosis of HPV infection, in which the molecular test play an important role, allow for detection on precancerous lesions of the cervix, and effective treatment of these conditions. The application of modern diagnostic tests and vaccination against HPV may in the future lead to a reduction in the incidence of cervical cancer.
28144684	Combined p16 and p53 expression in cervical cancer of unknown primary and other prognostic parameters : A single-center analysis.	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Cervical cancer of unknown primary (CUP) represents an uncommon and heterogeneous subentity of head and neck cancer. However, both optimal diagnostics and therapy remain unclear. An improved understanding of the underlying pathology is essential to enable future tailored therapies and optimized outcomes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 53 patients with head and neck CUP and 48 available cervical lymph node specimens. All patients have received radiotherapy between 2007 and 2015. Preradiotherapy involved lymph node specimens were analyzed for p16 and p53 immunoreactivity. The prognostic relevance of the combined p16 and p53 status and other clinical parameters were examined by univariate and multivariate analyses. RESULTS: Median patient age was 61.5 years and median irradiation dose to the involved nodal levels was 66 Gy. Of the 48 evaluated specimens, 13 (27%) were p16-positive and 31 (64.6%) p53-positive. After a median follow up of 32.9 months, patients with p16-negative and simultaneously p53-positive tumors showed a significantly inferior tumor-specific survival (TSS) compared to those with either p16+/p53-, p16+/p53+, or p16-/p53- (univariate: p = 0.055, multivariate: p = 0.038). Other factors with an adverse impact on TSS in the univariate analysis were smoking history (p = 0.032) and nodal stage (p = 0.038). CONCLUSIONS: The combined p16- and p53-expression status in cervical metastases of CUP may represent a simple method for risk stratification. Further validation of these biomarkers in large prospective trials is essential to design rational trials for CUP treatment optimization.
28142148	Role of the Common Fragile Sites in Cancers with a Human Papillomavirus Etiology.	High-risk human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are known to be associated with different anogenital cancers including cervical, anal, penile, and vaginal cancers. They are also found to be responsible for the dramatic increases in oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) observed in the United States and Europe. The model for how high-risk HPVs induce cancer formation comes from studies of cervical cancer which usually involves integration of the HPV into the human genome and subsequent changes due to induced chromosomal instability. Recent work, discussed here, however suggests that this model may not be completely correct. In addition, we summarize studies now done in OPSCC which demonstrate that the role of HPV in these cancers may be different from that in cervical cancer. Finally, we propose new models for how HPV may be involved in the formation of these 2 cancers.
28142146	Incidence of Histologically Proven Pelvic and Para-Aortic Lymph Node Metastases and Rate of Upstaging in Patients with Locally Advanced Cervical Cancer: Results of a Prospective Randomized Trial.	BACKGROUND: Surgical staging is associated with a significant rate of upstaging compared to clinical/radiological staging in patients with locally advanced cervical cancer. OBJECTIVE: To analyze the stage-specific percentage of pelvic and para-aortic lymph node metastases and the upstaging ratio in a prospective randomized trial (Uterus-11). METHODS: FIGO stage IIB-IVA cervical cancer patients were randomized to surgical staging (arm A) or to clinical staging and primary chemoradiation (arm B). Arm B patients underwent CT-guided biopsy of suspicious para-aortic lymph nodes. Confirmed para-aortic metastasis patients received extended-field radiation therapy. RESULTS: A total of 234 patients were enrolled, including 120 (arm A) and 114 (arm B) treated per protocol. The groups were well balanced. Pelvic and para-aortic lymph node metastases were identified after surgical staging in 51 and 24% of patients, respectively (p < 0.001). Pelvic and para-aortic lymph node metastases were confirmed in 45 and 20% of IIB patients and in 71 and 37% of IIIB patients, respectively. Upstaging occurred in 39/120 (33%) in arm A and in 9/114 (8%) in arm B (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The histological results in both groups led to a considerable rate of upstaging. Oncological data from the Uterus-11 study may reveal whether modified therapy translates into a survival benefit.
28139512	Shikani Optical Stylet versus Macintosh Laryngoscope for Intubation in Patients Undergoing Surgery for Cervical Spondylosis: A Randomized Controlled Trial.	BACKGROUND: Airway management is critical in patients with cervical spondylosis, a population with a high incidence of difficult airway. Intubation with Shikani Optical Stylet (SOS) has become increasingly popular in difficult airway. We compared the effects of intubation with SOS versus Macintosh laryngoscope (MLS) in patients undergoing surgery for cervical spondylosis. METHODS: A total of 270 patients scheduled for elective surgery for cervical spondylosis of spinal cord and nerve root type from August 2012 to January 2016 were enrolled and randomly allocated to the MLS or SOS group by random numbers. Patients were evaluated for difficult airway preoperatively, and Cormack-Lehane laryngoscopy classification was determined during anesthesia induction. Difficult airway was defined as Cormack-Lehane Grades III-IV. Patients were intubated with the randomly assigned intubation device. The success rate, intubation time, required assistance, immediate complications, and postoperative complaints were recorded. Categorical variables were analyzed by Chi-square test, and continuous variables were analyzed by independent samples t-test or rank sum test. RESULTS: The success rate of intubation among normal airways was 100% in both groups. In patients with difficult airway, the success rates in the MLS and SOS groups were 84.2% and 94.1%, respectively (P = 0.605). Intubation with SOS took longer compared with MLS (normal airway: 25.1 +/- 5.8 s vs. 24.5 +/- 5.7 s, P = 0.426; difficult airway: 38.5 +/- 8.5 s vs. 36.1 +/- 8.2 s, P = 0.389). Intubation with SOS required less assistance in patients with difficult airway (5.9% vs. 100%, P< 0.001). The frequency of postoperative sore throat was lower in SOS group versus MLS group in patients with normal airway (22.0% vs. 34.5%, P = 0.034). CONCLUSIONS: SOS is a safe and effective airway management device in patients undergoing surgery for cervical spondylosis. Compared with MLS, SOS appears clinically beneficial for intubation, especially in patients with difficult airway.

28133712	Hysterectomy in the Urologist's Practice.	Hysterectomy is an important surgical procedure in the care of women with pelvic organ prolapse or lower urinary tract malignancy. Therefore, hysterectomy can be a commonly performed surgical procedure in the urologist's practice. Obtaining a thorough gynecologic history is necessary prior to performing a hysterectomy and prolapse repair. Specifically, reviewing prior cervical cancer screening, risk factors for uterine malignancy, and the role of prophylactic salpingo-oophorectomy are important steps of the reconstructive surgical planning process. In women with lower urinary tract malignancy, hysterectomy is included in the classic technique of radical cystectomy. However, preliminary research has begun to question whether or not the uterus can be spared in some cases. In the article, we review the literature on hysterectomy as it pertains to the field of urology.
28128400	miR-187 induces apoptosis of SiHa cervical carcinoma cells by downregulating Bcl-2.	Cervical carcinoma is a life-threatening illness posing considerable danger to women's health. microRNAs (miRNAs) have been shown to regulate multiple cellular events, including growth and proliferation, and miR-187 is thought to regulate the growth and apoptosis of certain cell types. Our study focused on the influence of miR-187 on the growth, proliferation, and apoptosis of SiHa cervical carcinoma cells, and explored the mechanism behind its pro-apoptotic effect. miR-187 and control (scrambled) miRNA were synthesized with a standard protocol and lipofected into SiHa cells. Thiazolyl blue tetrazolium bromide assays and tests of caspase-3 activity were then performed to examine growth, proliferation, and apoptosis by flow cytometry. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) and an expression plasmid were synthesized for inhibition and overexpression of Bcl-2, respectively, and following their transfection, western blotting was used to examine Bcl-2 protein levels. Compared to transfection with control miRNA, miR-187 significantly reduced SiHa cell growth and decreased Bcl-2 expression. Increased translocation of phosphatidylserine and activation of caspase-3 were observed in miR-187-transfected cells. Moreover, inhibition of Bcl-2 enhanced the pro-apoptotic effect of this miRNA, while Bcl-2 overexpression had the opposite effect. miR-187 inhibits the growth and proliferation of SiHa cells, and induces their apoptosis via downregulation of Bcl-2. Bcl-2 represents a potential therapeutic target for cervical carcinoma.
28128397	Meta-analysis of TP73 polymorphism and cervical cancer.	The aim of this study was to investigate the tumor protein p73 (TP73) G4C14-A4T14 polymorphism and to perform a meta-analysis to assess TP73 expression in cervical cancer and precancerous tissue. Articles containing data regarding TP73 status in cervical cancer patients and healthy controls were retrieved from PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane, Chinese Biomedical Literature, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure databases. Then, the quality of the studies was evaluated according to inclusion and exclusion criteria. Odds ratios between the case and control groups were used as an effect evaluation index and the RevMan 5.0 software was employed to carry out the meta-analysis. Three independent investigations including 8452 cases of cervical cancer and 8326 healthy controls were included in our study following the application of inclusion and exclusion criteria. PCR genotyping revealed that the TP73 GC/GC genotype produced a 193-bp product, while the AT/AT genotype produced a 270-bp fragment, and GC/AT genotype samples produced two fragments of 193 and 270 bp. Meta-analysis showed that TP73 expression in cervical cancer was significantly higher than that in normal cervical squamous epithelium (P < 0.05). This elevated expression may play an important role in the occurrence and development of cervical cancer. Therefore, TP73 testing might be useful in the screening and diagnosis of cervical cancer and precancerous lesions.
28125861	Immediate referral to colposcopy versus cytological surveillance for minor cervical cytological abnormalities in the absence of HPV test.	BACKGROUND: A significant number of women are diagnosed with minor cytological abnormalities on cervical screening. Many authorities recommend surveillance as spontaneous regression might occur. However, attendance for cytological follow-up decreases with time and might put some women at risk of developing invasive disease. OBJECTIVES: To assess the optimum management strategy for women with minor cervical cytological abnormalities (atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance - ASCUS or low-grade squamous intra-epithelial lesions - LSIL) at primary screening in the absence of HPV (human papillomavirus) DNA test. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the following electronic databases: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL Issue 4, 2016), MEDLINE (1946 to April week 2 2016) and Embase (1980 to 2016 week 16). SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing immediate colposcopy to cytological surveillance in women with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS/borderline) or low-grade squamous intra-epithelial lesions (LSIL/mild dyskaryosis). DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: The primary outcome measure studied was the occurrence of cervical intra-epithelial neoplasia (CIN). The secondary outcome measures studied included default rate, clinically significant anxiety and depression, and other self-reported adverse effects.We classified studies according to period of surveillance, at 6, 12, 24 or 36 months, as well as at 18 months, excluding a possible exit-examination. We calculated pooled risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) using a random-effects model with inverse variance weighting. Inter-study heterogeneity was assessed with I2 statistics. MAIN RESULTS: We identified five RCTs with 11,466 participants that fulfilled the inclusion criteria. There were 18 cases of invasive cervical cancer, seven in the immediate colposcopy and 11 in the cytological surveillance groups, respectively. Although immediate colposcopy detects CIN2+ and CIN3+ earlier than cytology, the differences were no longer observed at 24 months (CIN2+: 3 studies, 4331 women; 17.9% versus 18.3%, RR 1.14, CI 0.66 to 1.97; CIN3+: 3 studies, 4331 women; 10.3% versus 11.9%, RR 1.02, CI 0.53 to 1.97). The inter-study heterogeneity was considerable (I2 greater than 90%). Furthermore, the inclusion of the results of the exit examinations at 24 months, which could inflate the CIN detection rate of cytological surveillance, may have led to study design-derived bias; we therefore considered the evidence to be of low quality.When we excluded the exit examination, the detection rate of high-grade lesions at the 18-month follow-up was higher after immediate colposcopy (CIN2+: 2 studies, 4028 women; 14.3% versus 10.1%, RR 1.50, CI 1.12 to 2.01; CIN3+: 2 studies, 4028 women, 7.8% versus 6.9%, RR 1.24, CI 0.77 to 1.98) both had substantial inter-study heterogeneity (I2 greater than 60%) and we considered the evidence to be of moderate quality).The meta-analysis revealed that immediate referral to colposcopy significantly increased the detection of clinically insignificant cervical abnormalities, as opposed to repeat cytology after 24 months of surveillance (occurrence of koilocytosis: 2 studies, 656 women; 32% versus 21%, RR 1.49, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.90; moderate-quality evidence) incidence of any CIN: 2 studies, 656 women; 64% versus 32%, RR 2.02, 95% CI 1.33 to 3.08, low-quality evidence; incidence of CIN1: 2 studies, 656 women; 21% versus 8%, RR 2.58, 95% CI 1.69 to 3.94, moderate-quality evidence).Due to differences in trial designs and settings, there was large variation in default rates between the included studies. The risk for default was higher for the repeat cytology group, with a four-fold increase at 6 months, a six-fold at 12 and a 19-fold at 24 months (6 months: 3 studies, 5117 women; 6.3% versus 13.3%, RR 3.85, 95% CI 1.27 to 11.63, moderate-quality evidence; 12 months: 3 studies, 5115 women; 6.3% versus 14.8%, RR 6.39, 95% CI 1.49 to 29.29, moderate-quality evidence; 24 months: 3 studies, 4331 women; 0.9% versus 16.1%, RR 19.1, 95% CI 9.02 to 40.43, moderate-quality evidence). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Based on low- or moderate-quality evidence using the GRADE approach and generally low risk of bias, the detection rate of CIN2+ or CIN3+ after two years does not appear to differ between immediate colposcopy and cytological surveillance in the absence of HPV testing, although women may default from follow-up. Immediate colposcopy probably leads to earlier detection of high-grade lesions, but also detects more clinically insignificant low-grade lesions. Colposcopy may therefore be the first choice when good compliance is not assured. These results emphasize the need for an accurate reflex HPV triage test to distinguish women who need diagnostic follow-up from those who can return safely to routine recall.
28121939	Multiple preinvasive and invasive HPV-related lesions of the anogenital tract in a female patient with HIV infection: A case report.	RATIONALE: Patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection have been shown to be at increased risk for high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) infection of the anogenital tract. Furthermore, in the last decades, the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has increased the longevity of these patients who now live long enough to develop HPV-related cancers; hence, the impact of HPV infection on HIV-positive patients is of increasing concern. PATIENT CONCERNS: We reported the case of an HIV-positive female patient on HAART with a good virological and immunological response and with a long history of HPV-related intraepithelial and invasive lesions of the anogenital tract. DIAGNOSES: From 1996 to 2016, this patient was diagnosed with a high grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia; a HR-HPV positive inguinal lymph node metastasis from clinically undetectable primary squamous cell carcinoma; a HPV-related vulvar high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion and an invasive squamous cell carcinoma of the anus. INTERVENTIONS: All the intraepithelial and invasive lesions detected were properly treated, and subsequent follow up visits with gynecologic examination, anoscopy, pap smear and anal cytology were performed. OUTCOMES: After a recurrence of the anal cancer and a subsequent salvage surgery with abdominoperineal resection, at the last available follow up visit no sign of disease recurrence was found. LESSONS: This case stresses the importance of an accurate multidisciplinary follow-up in HIV-positive patients, including not only the routine medical, immunological, and virological evaluation, but also a periodical complete examination of the anogenital tract with cervicovaginal and anal cytology, colposcopy, high resolution anoscopy, and vulvar examination.
28118455	Trends and Patterns of Disparities in Cancer Mortality Among US Counties, 1980-2014.	Introduction: Cancer is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States and results in a high economic burden. Objective: To estimate age-standardized mortality rates by US county from 29 cancers. Design and Setting: Deidentified death records from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) and population counts from the Census Bureau, the NCHS, and the Human Mortality Database from 1980 to 2014 were used. Validated small area estimation models were used to estimate county-level mortality rates from 29 cancers: lip and oral cavity; nasopharynx; other pharynx; esophageal; stomach; colon and rectum; liver; gallbladder and biliary; pancreatic; larynx; tracheal, bronchus, and lung; malignant skin melanoma; nonmelanoma skin cancer; breast; cervical; uterine; ovarian; prostate; testicular; kidney; bladder; brain and nervous system; thyroid; mesothelioma; Hodgkin lymphoma; non-Hodgkin lymphoma; multiple myeloma; leukemia; and all other cancers combined. Exposure: County of residence. Main Outcomes and Measures: Age-standardized cancer mortality rates by county, year, sex, and cancer type. Results: A total of 19511910 cancer deaths were recorded in the United States between 1980 and 2014, including 5656423 due to tracheal, bronchus, and lung cancer; 2484476 due to colon and rectum cancer; 1573593 due to breast cancer; 1077030 due to prostate cancer; 1157878 due to pancreatic cancer; 209314 due to uterine cancer; 421628 due to kidney cancer; 487518 due to liver cancer; 13927 due to testicular cancer; and 829396 due to non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Cancer mortality decreased by 20.1% (95% uncertainty interval [UI], 18.2%-21.4%) between 1980 and 2014, from 240.2 (95% UI, 235.8-244.1) to 192.0 (95% UI, 188.6-197.7) deaths per 100000 population. There were large differences in the mortality rate among counties throughout the period: in 1980, cancer mortality ranged from 130.6 (95% UI, 114.7-146.0) per 100000 population in Summit County, Colorado, to 386.9 (95% UI, 330.5-450.7) in North Slope Borough, Alaska, and in 2014 from 70.7 (95% UI, 63.2-79.0) in Summit County, Colorado, to 503.1 (95% UI, 464.9-545.4) in Union County, Florida. For many cancers, there were distinct clusters of counties with especially high mortality. The location of these clusters varied by type of cancer and were spread in different regions of the United States. Clusters of breast cancer were present in the southern belt and along the Mississippi River, while liver cancer was high along the Texas-Mexico border, and clusters of kidney cancer were observed in North and South Dakota and counties in West Virginia, Ohio, Indiana, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Texas, Alaska, and Illinois. Conclusions and Relevance: Cancer mortality declined overall in the United States between 1980 and 2014. Over this same period, there were important changes in trends, patterns, and differences in cancer mortality among US counties. These patterns may inform further research into improving prevention and treatment.
28118260	Effect of different segmentation algorithms on metabolic tumor volume measured on 18F-FDG PET/CT of cervical primary squamous cell carcinoma.	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: It is known that fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose PET/computed tomography (CT) segmentation algorithms have an impact on the metabolic tumor volume (MTV). This leads to some uncertainties in PET/CT guidance of tumor radiotherapy. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of segmentation algorithms on the PET/CT-based MTV and their correlations with the gross tumor volumes (GTVs) of cervical primary squamous cell carcinoma. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty-five patients with International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage Ia approximately IIb and histologically proven cervical squamous cell carcinoma were enrolled. A fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose PET/CT scan was performed before definitive surgery. GTV was measured on surgical specimens. MTVs were estimated on PET/CT scans using different segmentation algorithms, including a fixed percentage of the maximum standardized uptake value (20 approximately 60% SUVmax) threshold and iterative adaptive algorithm. We divided all patients into four different groups according to the SUVmax within target volume. The comparisons of absolute values and percentage differences between MTVs by segmentation and GTV were performed in different SUVmax subgroups. The optimal threshold percentage was determined from MTV20% approximately MTV60%, and was correlated with SUVmax. The correlation of MTViterative adaptive with GTV was also investigated. RESULTS: MTV50% and MTV60% were similar to GTV in the SUVmax up to 5 (P>0.05). MTV30% approximately MTV60% were similar to GTV (P>0.05) in the 5<SUVmax</=10 group. MTV20% approximately MTV60% were similar to GTV (P>0.05) in the 10<SUVmax</=15 group. MTV20% and MTV30% were similar to GTV (P>0.05) in the SUVmax of at least 15 group. MTViterative adaptive was similar to GTV in both total and different SUVmax groups (P>0.05). Significant differences were observed among the fixed percentage method and the optimal threshold percentage was inversely correlated with SUVmax. The iterative adaptive segmentation algorithm led to the highest accuracy (6.66+/-50.83%). A significantly positive correlation was also observed between MTViterative adaptive and GTV (Pearson's correlation r=0.87, P<0.0001). CONCLUSION: MTViterative adaptive is independent of SUVmax, more accurate, and correlated with GTV. Iterative adaptive algorithm segmentation may be more suitable than the fixed percentage threshold method to estimate the tumor volume of cervical primary squamous cell carcinoma.
28118037	Downregulation of Extracellular Matrix Metalloproteinase Inducer by scFv-M6-1B9 Intrabody Suppresses Cervical Cancer Invasion Through Inhibition of Urokinase-Type Plasminogen Activator.	Overexpression of extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer (EMMPRIN) accelerates tumor invasion and metastasis via activation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) expression. The authors were interested in whether the scFv-M6-1B9 intrabody against EMMPRIN that retains EMMPRIN in endoplasmic reticulum could be a potential tool to suppress cervical cancer invasion through inhibition of uPA. The chimeric adenoviral vector Ad5/F35-scFv-M6-1B9 was transferred into human cervical carcinoma HeLa cells to produce the scFv-M6-1B9 intrabody against EMMPRIN. Cell surface expression of EMMPRIN, the membrane-bound uPA, the enzymatic activity of secreted uPA, and the invasion ability were analyzed. The scFv-M6-1B9 intrabody successfully diminished the cell surface expression of EMMPRIN and the membrane-bound uPA on HeLa cells. uPA activity from tissue culture media of EMMPRIN-downregulated HeLa cells was decreased. The invasion ability of HeLa cells harboring scFv-M6-1B9 intrabody was also suppressed. These results suggested that the scFv-M6-1B9 intrabody might represent a potential approach for invasive cervical cancer treatment. The application of scFv-M6-1B9 intrabody in animal experiments and preclinical studies would be investigated further.
28115787	Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha T-857C (rs1799724) Polymorphism and Risk of Cancers: A Meta-Analysis.	Objectives. To investigate the potential association of tumor necrosis factor-alpha T-857C polymorphism with susceptibility to the five common malignant tumors. Materials and Methods. A comprehensive search of PubMed/Medline, Embase, and Web of Science databases was performed up to November 2015. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated to assess the strength of the association. Subgroup analysis, heterogeneity analyses, and publication bias were also texted in the meta-analysis. Results. A total of twenty-two publications involving 5215 cases and 6755 controls were recruited. Overall, the meta-analysis revealed an increased risk between the TNF-alpha T-857C polymorphism and gastric cancer susceptibility in T versus C model, heterozygote genetic model, and dominant genetic model. An increased risk between the TNF-alpha T-857C polymorphism and hepatocellular cancer susceptibility in homozygote genetic model and recessive genetic model was also found. No significant association was found between the TNF-alpha T-857C polymorphism and colorectal cancer, cervical cancer, and prostate cancer. Conclusions. Our meta-analyses suggest that TNF-alpha T-857C polymorphism may be associated with increased risk of gastric cancer and hepatocellular cancer development. Therefore, the TNF-alpha T-857C polymorphism could be considered as one possible risk factor of gastric cancer and hepatocellular cancer according to our study.
28110188	p53 dependent apoptosis and cell cycle delay induced by heteroleptic complexes in human cervical cancer cells.	We previously reported synthesis of novel arene ruthenium (Ru) complexes and evaluated their antitumor activity in murine lymphoma (DL) cells. In this present study we further investigated the mechanism of action of two ruthenium complexes [complex 1 (eta6-arene)RuCl(2-pcdpm)] and complex 2 (eta6-arene)RuCl(4-mtdpm)] in cervical cancer cell line (HeLa). Our studies demonstrate that anticancer property of these two complexes was due to induction of apoptosis through p53 mediated pathway as well as arrest of cells in G2/M phase of cell cycle. It is worth to note that the complexes did not cause any substantial cytotoxic effect on normal cells. Further in comprehensive studies, apoptosis inducing property of both complexes were established in accordance with array of morphological changes ranging from membrane blebbing to formation of apoptotic bodies and followed by DNA fragmentation assay. Furthermore, Flow cytometry by Annexin V/PI staining delineate that complex 1 and 2 have strident impact to induce apoptosis in HeLa cells. The complex 1 and 2 treated cells show increased level of intracellular ROS generation which was preceded by p53 activation. Apoptosis induced by 1 and 2 was preceded by mitochondrial aggregations which were monitored by mitotracker. In addition flow cytometry analysis showed that both complexes also effectively arrest cells at G2/M phase of cell cycle. Western blot, RT-PCR as well as Real Time analysis were used to further confirm that the complexes induced apoptosis in p53 dependent pathway. Thus, our promising results can contribute to the rational design of novel potential anticancer agents.
28109322	ADAR1 overexpression is associated with cervical cancer progression and angiogenesis.	BACKGROUND: This study aimed to assess the role of RNA-dependent adenosine deaminase (ADAR1) in cervical squamous cell carcinoma occurrence and progression. METHODS: ADAR1 expression levels in stage IA and stage IIA cervical squamous cell carcinoma (group A), cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) specimens (group B), as well as normal and inflamed cervical tissue samples (group C) were assessed by immunohistochemistry. Clinical and pathological data of cervical squamous cell carcinoma patients undergoing surgery were retrospectively evaluated. Chi-square test, comparative analysis of survival curve, disease-free survival and COX risk assessment method were used to understand the association of ADAR1 with the occurrence and progression and prognostic significance of cervical squamous cell carcinoma. RESULTS: ADAR1 is expressed in the cytoplasm and nuclei. The expression level was high in squamous cell carcinoma tissues (81.18%), while relatively low in the CIN group (21.56%). And there was no expression in non-cancerous tissues. The differences between them were statistically significant using P < 0.05 as criterion. One-factor analysis revealed that ADAR1 was significantly correlated with tumor diameter, horizontal diffusion diameter, vascular invasion, parametrial invasion, vaginal involvement, and pathologically diagnostic criteria for perineural invasion (PNI). Meanwhile, the overall survival rate of ADAR1 positive patients was significantly lower compared with that of patients with no ADAR1 expression (P < 0.05). Analysis also showed that disease-free survival time of ADAR1 positive patients was shorter than that of ADAR1 negative patients, and the difference was significant (P < 0.01). Finally, COX risk assessment showed that parametrical invasion had independent prognostic factors for overall survival of squamous cell carcinoma. CONCLUSIONS: Results indicated that ADAR1 might play an important role in the occurrence, progression and prognosis of cervical squamous cancer.
28109160	Antibiotics for infection prevention after excision of the cervical transformation zone.	BACKGROUND: Excision of the transformation zone of the cervix is the most commonly used approach to treat cervical precancerous lesions (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN)) to reduce the risk of developing cervical cancer. As the excision of the transformation zone leaves a raw area on the cervix, there is a risk of infection following the procedure. The incidence of infection after cold knife conization (CKC) is 36%, whereas the incidence for large loop excision of the transformation zone (LLETZ, also known as loop electrical excision procedure (LEEP)) is much lower (0.8% to 14.4%). Prophalytic antibiotics may prevent an infection developing and are often prescribed for CKC. However, there are no formal recommendations regarding the use of prophylactic antibiotics for infection prevention in women undergoing surgical excisional treatment for cervical precancerous lesions. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of antibiotics for infection prevention following excision of the cervical transformation zone. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2016, Issue 4), MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS to May 2016. We also checked registers of clinical trials, citation lists of included studies, key textbooks and previous systematic reviews for potentially relevant studies SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the effectiveness and safety of prophylactic antibiotics versus a placebo or no treatment in women having excision of the cervical transformation zone, regardless of the type of surgical excisional method used. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Two review authors independently selected potentially relevant trials, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias, compared results and resolved disagreements by discussion. We contacted investigators for additional data, where possible. MAIN RESULTS: Of the 370 records that we identified as a result of the search (excluding duplicates), we regarded six abstracts and titles as potentially relevant studies. Of these six studies, three met the inclusion criteria involving 708 participants; most trials were at moderate or high risk of bias (risk mainly due to lack of blinding and high rate of incomplete data). We did not identify any ongoing trials. Although all included studies had been published in peer-reviewed journals at the time of the search and data extraction, numerical data regarding the outcome measured in one trial involving 77 participants were insufficient for inclusion in a meta-analyses.The difference in the rates of prolonged vaginal discharge or presumed cervicitis (one study; 348 participants; risk ratio (RR), 1.29; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.72 to 2.31; low-quality evidence) and severe vaginal bleeding (two studies; 638 participants; RR 1.21; 95% CI 0.52 to 2.82; very low-quality evidence) among the two comparison groups did not reach the level for clinically important effect. In addition, there was no difference in adverse events related to antibiotics i.e. nausea/vomiting, diarrhoea, and headache among the two comparison groups (two studies; 638 participants; RR 1.69; 95% CI 0.85 to 3.34; very low-quality evidence). There were no differences in the incidence of fever (RR, 2.23; 95% CI 0.20 to 24.36), lower abdominal pain (RR, 1.03; 95% CI 0.61 to 1.72), unscheduled medical consultation (RR 2.68, 95% CI 0.97 to 7.41), and additional self-medication (RR 1.22; 95% CI 0.56 to 2.67) between the two comparison groups (one study; 290 participants; low to very low-quality evidence). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: As only limited data are available from three trials with overall moderate to high risk of bias, there is insufficient evidence to support use of antibiotics to reduce infectious complications following excision of the cervical transformation zone. In addition, there were minimal data about antibiotic-related adverse events and no information on the risk of developing antibiotic resistance. Antibiotics given for infection prevention after excision of the cervical transformation zone should only be used in the context of clinical research, to avoid unnecessary prescription of antibiotics and to prevent further increases in antibiotic resistance.
28108012	[Cancer screening in France: 10 years of analysis of behaviours by the EDIFICE surveys].	Accessibility to cancer screening in France has been facilitated by the implementation of organised programs (breast cancer and colorectal cancer) and by national recommendations (cervical cancer). Personal motivation may also trigger participation in prostate cancer screening. This paper proposes an overview of attitudes toward cancer screening among the general population over a period of more than 10 years and the perception of this behaviour by general practitioners. It is noteworthy that although certain cancer screening programmes, such as for breast cancer, are widely established throughout the population, uptake of others, such as for colorectal or prostate cancer, is contingent on sociological factors and vulnerability. Monitoring of compliance is thus all the more important since participation may be more acutely affected by the impact of social conditions and vulnerability in the current critical economic climate.
28104720	When dizziness becomes sinister: oropharyngeal carcinoma presenting as a paraneoplastic neurological disorder.	Paraneoplastic neurological disorders are uncommon presentations of head and neck cancers. We present a case of a 68-year-old male patient who presented with dizziness, nausea and memory problems. MRI of his brain showed bilateral cerebellar leptomeningeal enhancing signal abnormality with cervical lymphadenopathy. CT imaging of his neck raised the suspicion of a tonsillar primary, which was later confirmed on biopsy. His poorly differentiated HPV positive squamous cell carcinoma was treated with chemoradiotherapy. Subsequent MRI imaging showed progressive cerebellar atrophy and his presenting symptoms persisted, but he remained disease free 6 months post-treatment for his primary malignancy.
28099264	Post-treatment 18F-FDG-PET/CT versus contrast-enhanced CT in patients with oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma: comparative effectiveness study.	OBJECTIVE: To compare the accuracy of same-day therapy-assessment PET/computed tomography (PET/CT) and conventional contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) in patients with oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC). METHODS: A total of 110 (95 men and 15 women; mean age 59 years) patients with biopsy-proven OPSCC were evaluated with same-day PET/CT and CECT pair scans as part of follow-up therapy assessment. Scans were performed within 6 months after the completion of primary treatment (median time: 3.1 months; range: 0.5-6 months). PET/CT and CECT scans were reviewed retrospectively for residual primary site disease, and right and left cervical lymph node involvement. Histopathology or 6 month clinical/imaging follow-up were used as the gold standard. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and accuracy were calculated for the primary site and cervical nodal disease. RESULTS: Of 110 OPSCC patients, 90.9% were human papilloma virus positive, 80.8% were stage 4, and 76.4% received chemoradiation as the primary treatment. The sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and accuracy of PET/CT and CECT were similar in the evaluation of the primary cancer site (PET/CT: 75.0, 91.5, 25.0, 99.0, and 90.9, respectively, versus CECT: 75.0, 90.6, 23.1, 99.0, and 90.0, respectively). In evaluating cervical lymph node involvement, PET/CT appeared to have higher accuracy (96.8 vs. 81.7%), specificity (97.7 vs. 81.7%), and PPV (45.8 vs. 16.5%), comparable NPV (99.4% for both), and lower sensitivity (65 vs. 75%) compared with same-day CECT. CONCLUSION: Same-day PET/CT and CECT scans had comparable accuracy in the evaluation of primary tumor sites after completion of therapy in patients with OPSCC. PET/CT showed higher accuracy in the evaluation of cervical lymph node involvement.
28098890	Characterization of the microRNA profile in early-stage cervical squamous cell carcinoma by next-generation sequencing.	Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is histologically the most prominent type of cervical cancer. There is accumulating evidence suggesting that microRNAs (miRNAs) play important regulatory roles in the biological processes of cervical squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC). Deciphering the miRNA regulatory network in CSCC could deepen our understanding at the molecular level of CSCC initiation and progression. In the present study, we performed nextgeneration sequencing (NGS) to profile miRNA expression in 3 pairs of early-stage CSCC samples. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to verify primary findings in another 20 pairs of CSCC samples. We identified 37 known miRNAs that exhibited significant alterations in expression (2-fold change or greater), among which 8 miRNAs were upregulated and 29 miRNAs were downregulated. Nine of these miRNAs were selected for further qRT-PCR validation. A novel miRNA candidate was also reported for the first time in the present study to be upregulated. The Gene Ontology (GO) analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis revealed that its target genes were involved in MAPK, calcium and adherent junction signaling pathways. The present study systematically characterized the miRNA expression variation in early-stage CSCC and provides novel biomarkers for diagnosis and treatment as well as an opportunity for further investigation of the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis and development of CSCC.
28097135	Significance of "Not Detected but Amplified" Results by Real-Time PCR Method for HPV DNA Detection.	Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is an important etiologic factor in cervical carcinogenesis. Various HPV DNA detection methods have been evaluated for clinicopathological level. For the specimens with normal cytological finding, discrepancies among the detection methods were frequently found and adequate interpretation can be difficult. 6,322 clinical specimens were submitted and evaluated for real-time PCR and Hybrid Capture 2 (HC2). 573 positive or "Not Detected but Amplified" (NDBA) specimens by real-time PCR were additionally tested using genetic analyzer. For the reliability of real-time PCR, 325 retests were performed. Optimal cut-off cycle threshold (CT ) value was evaluated also. 78.7% of submitted specimens showed normal or nonspecific cytological finding. The distributions of HPV types by real-time PCR were not different between positive and NDBA cases. For positive cases by fragment analysis, concordance rates with real-time PCR and HC2 were 94.2% and 84.2%. In NDBA cases, fragment analysis and real-time PCR showed identical results in 77.0% and HC2 revealed 27.6% of concordance with fragment analysis. Optimal cut-off CT value was different for HPV types. NDBA results in real-time PCR should be regarded as equivocal, not negative. The adjustment of cut-off CT value for HPV types will be helpful for the appropriate result interpretation.
28093881	A case of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive ciliated muconodular papillary tumor (CMPT) of the lung.	Ciliated muconodular papillary tumor (CMPT) is a rare papillary tumor that arises in the peripheral lung fields and is associated with the proliferation of ciliate d and goblet cells and increased mucin production. We report a case of CMPT involving the rearrangement of the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene. The patient was an 84-year-old Japanese female who had exhibited a small nodular shadow on chest computed tomography during a regular checkup 10 years ago. She underwent a partial resection of segment S10 of the right lung. The cut surface of the surgical specimen revealed a well-circumscribed, jelly-like mass measuring 8 x 8 x 10 mm. Histologically, the tumor was composed of a mixture of ciliated, goblet, and basal cells arranged in a papillary pattern together with pools of mucin. A diagnosis of CMPT was made. The lung tumor cells were subjected to fluorescent in situ hybridization and highly sensitive immunohistochemical staining for the ALK protein, both of which produced positive results. CMPT usually follows a favorable course, but the exact nature of this tumor; i.e., whether it is benign or malignant, has not been established. This is the first reported case of an ALK-positive CMPT.
28093329	Antioxidant, antitumor and immunostimulatory activities of the polypeptide from Pleurotus eryngii mycelium.	The objective of this study was to investigate the antioxidant, antitumor and immunological activities of the polypeptide from Pleurotus eryngii mycelium (PEMP). The ability of the polypeptide to stimulate Ana-1 macrophages to englobe neutral red, secrete NO, H2O2, TNF-alpha, and IL-6, increase TLR2 and TLR4 expression levels and Ana-1 cell survival rate were investigated to study its immunocompetence. Its antitumor activities were studied by examining the survival of cervical, breast, and stomach cancer cells. The antioxidant activities of the polypeptide were studied by examining its reducing power and its ability to scavenge DPPH, O2-, and OH radicals. The results showed that the PEMP was a good antioxidant with antitumor and immunostimulatory activities that was concentration dependent. At concentrations from 0.05 to 2mg/mL, it inhibited the proliferation of cancer cells, but promoted the proliferation of macrophages, TNF-alpha and IL-6 secretion, TLR2 and TLR4 expression and increased macrophage phagocytic ability through NO and H2O2 release. From 0.2 to 1mg/mL, the polypeptide had strong reducing power to clear free radical of DPPH, O2-, OH-, with a concentration-response relationship. Based on these results, PEMP has potential applications in functional foods as a natural anti-aging and anti-virus agent with antioxidant and immunostimulatory activities.
28091886	Levels of persistent organic pollutants in breast milk of Maya women in Yucatan, Mexico.	In this study, 24 breast milk samples, obtained from rural Maya women, from municipalities of Yucatan, Mexico, were analyzed for organochlorine pesticide (OCP) residues by gas chromatography. Recent studies have shown that Maya communities have a poor perception about the proper usage and handling of OCP. The karstic soil in this area has a high vulnerability to groundwater pollution by the use of OCP in agriculture and livestock activities. The impact of the ecosystem on human health is much more critical due to the prevailing poverty and a very low educational level of these communities. About 30% of the Maya population consumes water directly from contaminated wells and sinkholes, resulting in a chronic exposure to OCP. The samples served to identify and quantify high levels of OCP residues (18.43 mg/kg of heptachlor epoxide and 1.92 mg/kg of endrin in the metropolitan zone; 2.10 mg/kg of dieldrin, 0.117 mg/kg of endosulfan II, 0.103 mg/kg of heptachlor, 0.178 mg/kg of endrin, and 0.127 mg/kg of endrin aldehyde in the main agricultural zone and on the west coast). The detected levels of OCP residues are a major concern and represent a potential risk to women and children in the region. This could be associated with the high rates of cervical uterine and breast cancer mortality in Yucatan. Thus, regulations on the usage of OCP and their enforcement are necessary, and it is important to establish a yearly monitoring program for OCP residues in breast milk and groundwater, as well as to implement health promotion programs for women in particular and the general population in general.
28090067	Discovery and Synthesis of Amino Acids Modified Deoxycholic Acid Derivatives and in Vitro Antiproliferative Evaluation.	A series of deoxycholic acid (DCA) derivatives bearing amino acid moiety has been synthesized and investigated for their potential antiproliferative activities. DCA derivative compounds were synthesized by a two or three step synthetic approach. Their bioactivities were evaluated using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) method and Western blotting analysis on three tumor cell lines A549 (human lung cancer cell line), MCF-7 (human breast cancer cell line) and HeLa (human cervical carcinoma cell). The novel derivatives DCA3d, DCA5a, DCA5b, DCA5c, and DCA5d were found to be promising antiproliferative agents. Furthermore, DCA5b showed the greatest cytotoxic activity by induction of apoptosis. These compounds show potentiality for further optimization as antitumor drugs.
28089996	A comparison of lobectomy and total thyroidectomy in patients with papillary thyroid microcarcinoma: a retrospective individual risk factor-matched cohort study.	OBJECTIVE: Papillary thyroid microcarcinoma (PTMC) accounts for most of the increase in thyroid cancer in recent decades. We compared clinical outcomes and surgical complications of lobectomy and total thyroidectomy (TT) in PTMC patients. DESIGN AND METHODS: In this retrospective individual risk factor-matched cohort study, 2031 patients with PTMC were initially included. Patients who underwent lobectomy or TT were one-to-one matched according to individual risk factors, including age, sex, primary tumor size, extrathyroidal extension, multifocality and cervical lymph node (LN) metastasis. RESULTS: In total, 688 patients were assigned to each group. During the median 8.5 years of follow-up, 26 patients (3.8%) in the lobectomy group and 11 patients (1.6%) in the TT group had recurrences. The relative risk of recurrence was significantly less in the TT than that in the lobectomy group (hazard ratio (HR) 0.41; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.21-0.81; P = 0.01). Most recurrences (84.6%) in the lobectomy group occurred in the contralateral lobe, and all patients were disease-free after completion of thyroidectomy. There were no significant differences in recurrence-free survival between the two groups after exclusion of contralateral lobe recurrences (HR, 2.75; 95% CI, 0.08-8.79; P = 0.08). There were significantly more patients with transient and permanent hypoparathyroidism in the TT than that in the lobectomy group (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Lobectomy could be appropriate for most patients with PTMC when there is no evidence of extrathyroidal disease in the preoperative work-up. Preoperative and postoperative imaging studies are important for patients who undergo lobectomy for PTMC, because most recurrences are in the contralateral lobe.
28088590	Human papillomavirus genotypes 68 and 58 are the most prevalent genotypes in women from quilombo communities in the state of Maranhao, Brazil.	OBJECTIVES: To determine the frequency of human papillomavirus (HPV) types and behavioral characteristics related to cytological abnormalities in women descendants of slaves, who live in isolated communities known as quilombos in the state of Maranhao, Brazil. METHODS: Cervicovaginal specimens of 353 women were analyzed by conventional cytology and genotyping. HPV detection and genotyping was performed using a linear array HPV genotyping test kit. Behavioral factors and their association with cytological abnormalities were analyzed, as well as the association between cytological abnormalities and HPV infection. RESULTS: The frequency of HPV infection was 13%, and infection with high-risk HPV types was more frequent than with low-risk types (10.2% vs. 2.8%). The most prevalent genotypes were HPV 68 (3.1%) and HPV 58 (2.6%). HPV-positive women were 6.5 times more likely than HPV-negative women to be diagnosed with cytological abnormalities. There was a significant association between HPV infection and the presence of cytological abnormalities in women 31-40 years of age and in women 51-60 years of age. CONCLUSIONS: A distinct profile of high-risk HPV genotypes was detected, with predominance of types 68 and 58. It is possible that the results of the present study are due to specific characteristics of the population, which is geographically isolated and maintains conservative sexual habits.
28086855	Postoperative fluid overload is a risk factor for adverse surgical outcome in patients undergoing esophagectomy for esophageal cancer: a retrospective study in 335 patients.	BACKGROUND: Restrictive intraoperative fluid management is increasingly recommended for patients undergoing esophagectomy. Controversy still exists about the impact of postoperative fluid management on perioperative outcome. METHODS: We retrospectively examined 335 patients who had undergone esophagectomy for esophageal cancer at the University Hospital Freiburg between 1996 and 2014 to investigate the relation between intra- and postoperative fluid management and postoperative morbidity after esophagectomy. RESULTS: Perioperative morbidity was 75%, the in-hospital mortality 8%. A fluid balance above average on the operation day was strongly associated with a higher rate of postoperative mortality (21% vs 3%, p < 0.001) and morbidity (83% vs 66%, p = 0.001). Univariate analysis for risk factors for adverse surgical outcome (Clavien >/= III) identified ASA-score (p = 0.002), smoking (p = 0.036), reconstruction by colonic interposition (p = 0.036), cervical anastomosis (p = 0.017), blood transfusion (p = 0.038) and total fluid balance on the operation day and on POD 4 (p = 0.001) as risk factors. Multivariate analysis confirmed only ASA-score (p = 0.001) and total fluid balance (p = 0.001) as independent predictors of adverse surgical outcome. CONCLUSION: Intra- and postoperative fluid overload is strongly associated with increased postoperative morbidity. Our results suggest restrictive intra- and especially postoperative fluid management to optimize the outcome after esophagectomy.
28085111	NHERF1 Enhances Cisplatin Sensitivity in Human Cervical Cancer Cells.	Cervical cancer is one of the most common female malignancies, and cisplatin-based chemotherapy is routinely utilized in locally advanced cervical cancer patients. However, resistance has been the major limitation. In this study, we found that Na(+)/H(+) Exchanger Regulatory Factor 1 (NHERF1) was downregulated in cisplatin-resistant cells. Analysis based on a cervical cancer dataset from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) showed association of NHERF1 expression with disease-free survival of patients received cisplatin treatment. NHERF1 overexpression inhibited proliferation and enhanced apoptosis in cisplatin-resistant HeLa cells, whereas NHERF1 knockdown had inverse effects. While parental HeLa cells were more resistant to cisplatin after NHERF1 knockdown, NHERF1 overexpression in CaSki cells promoted cisplatin sensitivity. Overexpression and knockdown studies also showed that NHERF1 significantly inhibited AKT and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling pathways in cisplatin-resistant cells. Taken together, our results provide the first evidence that NHERF1 can sensitize cisplatin-refractory cervical cancer cells. This study may help to increase understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying cisplatin resistance in tumors.
28085013	Expressions of miRNAs in papillary thyroid carcinoma and their associations with the clinical characteristics of PTC.	BACKGROUND: The sensitivity and specificity of biomarkers which have been used in clinical practice for diagnosis of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) are low, it is essential to develop novel diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for PTC. OBJECTIVE: To explore the expressions of miR-940, miR-15a, miR-16 and IL-23 in PTC tissues and plasma and their associations with the clinical characteristics of PTC. METHODS: We investigated the expressions of miR-940, miR-15a, miR-16 and IL-23 in plasma and thyroid tissues of PTC, nodular goiter and healthy people with qRT-PCR, and further analyzed the associations between their levels and the clinical characteristics of PTC. RESULTS: Level of IL-23 expression was higher while levels of miR-940, miR-15a and miR-16 expression in the PTC tissues were lower compared with the nodular goiter tissues and perineoplastic thyroid tissues. And the levels of miR-940, miR-15a, miR-16 and IL-23 expression in the PTC tissues were associated with some clinical characteristics of PTC, including bilateral tumor, multicentricity, extrallyroidal invasion, cervical lymph node metastasis, distant metastasis and clinical advanced stages (III/IV). CONCLUSIONS: Expressions of miR-940, miR-15a, miR-16 and IL-23 in PTC tissues might be useful biomarkers and promising targets in the diagnosis of papillary thyroid carcinoma.
28082020	miR424-5p functions as an anti-oncogene in cervical cancer cell growth by targeting KDM5B via the Notch signaling pathway.	AIMS: Aberrant expression of miRNAs exert the critical roles in carcinogenesis, including cervical cancer. Recent study corroborated the down-regulation of miR424-5p in uterine cervix adenocarcinoma. This research aimed to investigate the function and underlying mechanisms of miR424-5p in cervical cancer cell growth. MAIN METHODS: Tissues samples were collected from patients with cervical cancer and healthy control. The expression levels of miR424-5p were determined by qRT-PCR. After transfection with miR424-5p mimics or inhibitor, cervical cancer cell proliferation and apoptosis were evaluated by WST-1 and flow cytometry assay, respectively. The underlying mechanism involved in aforementioned processes was also explored. KEY FINDINGS: Expression of miR424-5p was notably decreased in cervical cancer tissues and cells. Overexpression of miR424-5p restrained cell proliferation and promoted cell apoptosis, but with little function in miR424-5p inhibitor-treated groups. Furthermore, KDM5B was identified as a direct target of miR424-5p as the evidence that miR-424-5p inhibited KDM5B expression and luciferase activity of KDM5B 3'-UTR. Here, KDM5B elevation majorly reversed miR424-5p-triggered inhibition in cell proliferation and increase in cell apoptosis. Moreover, silencing KDM5B expression also restrained cell growth. Additionally, miR424-5p overexpression inhibited the expression of Notch1 and Notch2, which was obviously rescued after KDM5B up-regulation. Simultaneously, blocking KDM5B also attenuated the activation of Notch pathway. Importantly, treatment with Notch agonist Jagged1 antagonized miR424-5p-mediated suppression on cell growth. SIGNIFICANCE: This research suggests that miR424-5p may act as a novel anti-oncogene in cervical cancer by blocking cell growth through targeting KDM5B-Notch pathway. Accordingly, our study will support a promising therapeutic strategy against cervical carcinoma.
28081742	MicroRNA-92a Promotes Cell Proliferation in Cervical Cancer via Inhibiting p21 Expression and Promoting Cell Cycle Progression.	MicroRNA-92a (miR-92a) generally plays a promoting role in human cancers, but the underlying mechanism in cervical cancer remains unclear. Here we studied the expression and clinical significance of miR-92a in cervical cancer, as well as the regulatory mechanism in the proliferation of cervical cancer cells. Our data indicated that miR-92a was significantly upregulated in cervical cancer tissues compared to their matched adjacent nontumor tissues (ANTs), and the increased miR-92a levels were significantly associated with a higher grade, lymph node metastasis, and advanced clinical stage in cervical cancer. In vitro study revealed that inhibition of miR-92a led to a significant reduction in the proliferation of HeLa cells via induction of cell cycle arrest at the G1 stage. In contrast, overexpression of miR-92a markedly promoted the proliferation of HeLa cells by promoting cell cycle progression. Further investigation revealed that miR-92a has a negative effect on protein levels, but not the mRNA levels, of p21 in HeLa cells, suggesting that p21 is a direct target of miR-92a. Overexpression of p21 eliminated the promoting effects of miR-92a on the proliferation and cell cycle progression of HeLa cells. However, knockdown of p21 reversed the suppressive effects of miR-92a downregulation on HeLa cell proliferation and cell cycle progression. Moreover, p21 was significantly downregulated in cervical cancer tissues compared to ANTs, suggesting that the increased expression of miR-92a may contribute to the decreased expression of p21, which further promotes cervical cancer growth. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that miR-92a promotes the proliferation of cervical cancer cells via inhibiting p21 expression and promoting cell cycle progression, highlighting the clinical significance of miR-92a in cervical cancer.
28079819	Efficacy and toxicity of different concurrent chemoradiotherapy regimens in the treatment of advanced cervical cancer: A network meta-analysis.	OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy and toxicity of different concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) regimens in the treatment of advanced cervical cancer (CC) by adopting a network meta-analysis. METHODS: We searched PubMed and Cochrane Library from the inception of these databases to September 2016, and all cohort studies (CSs) related to different CCRT regimens in the treatment of CC were included. A network analysis was adopted to compare the combination of direct and indirect evidence, to analyze the odds ratio (OR), and to draw a surface under the cumulative ranking curve of the efficacy and toxicity of different CCRT regimens for CC. Cluster analyses were used to group each category based on similar treatment regimens. RESULTS: Nineteen CSs were enrolled in this network meta-analysis, including 12 CCRT regimens (radiotherapy [RT], CCRT [cisplatin], CCRT [vinorelbine], CCRT [paclitaxel], CCRT [hydroxyurea], CCRT [cisplatin + FU], CCRT [cisplatin + gemcitabine], CCRT [cisplatin + docetaxel], CCRT [cisplatin + paclitaxel], CCRT [cisplatin + amifostine], CCRT [cisplatin + FU + hydroxyurea], and CCRT [cisplatin + vincristine + bleomycin]). The results of the network meta-analysis showed that regarding efficacy, the overall response rate of CCRT (cisplatin + docetaxel) was higher than RT, and the 5-year overall survival (OS) rate of CCRT (cisplatin + FU + hydroxyurea) was relatively higher than CCRT (hydroxyurea). As for toxicity, CCRT (cisplatin) had a lower incidence of leukopenia than CCRT (hydroxyurea), CCRT (cisplatin + FU) and CCRT (cisplatin + paclitaxel), and the incidences of diarrhea and vomiting in CCRT (cisplatin) were lower than those in CCRT (cisplatin + gemcitabine). Additionally, the cluster analysis showed that CCRT (cisplatin) had relatively lower incidences of both hematotoxicity and gastrointestinal toxicity, and CCRT (paclitaxel) had lower gastrointestinal toxicity than other regimens. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated that CCRT (cisplatin + docetaxel) might be the best choice of CCRT regimens in the treatment of CC, and the 5-year OS rate of CCRT (cisplatin + FU + hydroxyurea) might be the highest among these different regimens. CCRT (cisplatin) might have the lowest toxicity among all the CCRT regimens.
28077809	Cytotoxic Steroids from the Vietnamese Soft Coral Sinularia conferta.	Twelve steroids, including five new compounds 1-5, were isolated and structurally elucidated from a methanol extract of the Vietnamese soft coral Sinularia conferta. Their cytotoxic effects against three human cancer cell lines, lung carcinoma (A-549), cervical adenocarcinoma (HeLa), and pancreatic epithelioid carcinoma (PANC-1), were evaluated using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazolyl-2)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assays. Among isolated compounds, 10 exhibited potent cytotoxic effects on all three tested cell lines with IC50 values of 3.64+/-0.18, 19.34+/-0.42, and 1.78+/-0.69 microM, respectively.
28076823	Guazuma ulmifolia bark-synthesized Ag, Au and Ag/Au alloy nanoparticles: Photocatalytic potential, DNA/protein interactions, anticancer activity and toxicity against 14 species of microbial pathogens.	In the present study, we focused on a quick and green method to fabricate Ag, Au and Ag/Au alloy nanoparticles (NPs) using the bark extract of Guazuma ulmifolia L. Green synthesized metal NPs were characterized using different techniques, including UV-Vis spectroscopy, FT-IR, XRD, AFM and HR-TEM analyses. The production of Ag, Au and Ag/Au alloy NPs was observed monitoring color change from colorless to brown, followed by pink and dark brown, as confirmed by UV-Vis spectroscopy characteristic peaks at 436, 522 and 510nm, respectively. TEM shed light on the spherical shapes of NPs with size ranges of 10-15, 20-25 and 10-20nm. Biosynthesized NPs showed good catalytic activity reducing two organic dyes, 4-nitrophenol (4-NP) and Congo red (CR). UV-vis spectroscopy, fluorescence, circular dichroism spectroscopy and viscosity analyses were used to investigate the NP binding with calf thymus DNA. The binding constant of NPs with DNA calculated in UV-Vis absorption studies were 1.18x104, 1.83x104 and 2.91x104M-1, respectively, indicating that NPs were able to bind DNA with variable binding affinity: Ag/Au alloy NPs>Ag NPs>Au NPs. Ag/Au alloy NPs also showed binding activity to bovine serum albumin (BSA) over the other NPs. Ag and Ag/Au alloy NPs exhibited good antimicrobial activity on 14 species of microbial pathogens. In addition, the cytotoxic effects of Ag/Au alloy NPs were studied on human cervical cancer cells (HeLa) using MTT assay. Overall, our work showed the promising potential of bark-synthesized Ag and Ag/Au alloy NPs as cheap sources to develop novel and safer photocatalytic, antimicrobial and anticancer agents.
28076472	EVALUATION OF LYMPHATIC SPREAD, VISCERAL METASTASIS AND TUMORAL LOCAL INVASION IN ESOPHAGEAL CARCINOMAS.	Background: : Knowing esophageal tumors behavior in relationship to lymph node involvement, distant metastases and local tumor invasion is of paramount importance for the best esophageal tumors management. Aim: : To describe lymph node involvement, distant metastases, and local tumor invasion in esophageal carcinoma, according to tumor topography and histology. Methods: : A total of 444 patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and 105 adenocarcinoma were retrospectively analyzed. They were divided into four groups: adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma in the three esophageal segments: cervical, middle, and distal. They were compared based on their CT scans at the time of the diagnosis. Results: : Nodal metastasis showed great relationship with of primary tumor site. Lymph nodes of hepatogastric, perigastric and peripancreatic ligaments were mainly affected in distal tumors. Periaortic, interaortocaval and portocaval nodes were more commonly found in distal squamous carcinoma; subcarinal, paratracheal and subaortic nodes in middle; neck chains were more affected in cervical squamous carcinoma. Adenocarcinoma had a higher frequency of peritoneal involvement (11.8%) and liver (24.5%) than squamous cell carcinoma. Considering the local tumor invasion, the more cranial neoplasia, more common squamous invasion of airways, reaching 64.7% in the incidence of cervical tumors. Middle esophageal tumors invade more often aorta (27.6%) and distal esophageal tumors, the pericardium and the right atrium (10.4%). Conclusion: : Esophageal adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma in different topographies present peculiarities in lymph node involvement, distant metastasis and local tumor invasion. These differences must be taken into account in esophageal cancer patients' care. Racional: : Conhecer o comportamento das neoplasias esofagicas em relacao a disseminacao linfonodal, distribuicao de metastases e invasao local do tumor, pode auxiliar o manejo dos pacientes.

Metodo: : Pacientes com diagnostico de carcinoma espinocelular de esofago (n=444) e adenocarcinoma de esofago (n=105) foram retrospectivamente analisados. Foram divididos em quatro grupos: adenocarcinoma e carcinoma espinocelular do segmento cervical, medio e distal. Tais grupos foram comparados baseando-se em tomografias computadorizadas realizadas no momento do diagnostico. Resultados: : Disseminacao linfonodal mostrou grande associacao com topografia do tumor. Linfonodos do ligamento hepatogastrico, perigastricos e peripancreaticos foram acometidos principalmente por tumores de esofago distal; linfonodos periaorticos, interaortocavais, portocavais no carcinoma espinocelular de esofago distal; e linfonodos subcarinais, paratraqueais, subaorticos nos tumores de esofago medio. Cadeias cervicais foram acometidas por espinocelulares cervicais. Adenocarcinoma teve maior frequencia de acometimento peritoneal (11,8%) e hepatico (24,5%) do que carcinoma espinocelular. Considerando invasao tumoral local, quanto mais cranial a neoplasia, mais comum a invasao do espinocelular em vias aereas, chegando a incidencia de 64,7% nos tumores cervicais. Tumores de esofago medio invadem mais frequentemente aorta (27,6%) e tumores de esofago distal, o pericardio e atrio direito (10,4%). Conclusoes: : Adenocarcinoma e carcinoma espinocelular de esofago em diferentes topografias apresentam peculiaridades na disseminacao linfatica, metastases a distancia e invasao local do tumor. Tais diferencas devem ser consideradas no manejo do paciente com carcinoma esofagico.
28072723	High VEGFR1/2 expression levels are predictors of poor survival in patients with cervical cancer.	The aim of the study to evaluate the prognostic significance of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1 and 2 (VEGFR1/2) expression levels and to correlate these levels with clinicopathological parameters in patients with cervical cancer.Forty-two patients with International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics Stage IIB-IVB cervical cancer were analyzed between January 2011 and December 2012. RNA expression levels of VEGFR1/2 were assessed by branched DNA-liquidchip technology and immunohistochemistry. Associations between RNA expression levels, important clinicopathological parameters, and patient survival were statistically evaluated.Higher VEGFR1/2 expression levels were predictive of poor overall survival (P = 0.009 and P = 0.024, respectively). Patients with higher VEGFR1 expression levels were associated with poorer progression-free survival than those with lower VEGFR1 expression levels (P = 0.043). In addition, patients with higher VEGFR1 expression levels were more likely to develop distant metastases than those with lower VEGFR1 expression levels (P = 0.049). Higher VEGFR2 expression levels were associated with larger tumor size (P = 0.037).VEGFR1/2 expression levels were prognostic factors for patients with cervical cancer. Higher VEGFR1/2 expression levels were also predictive of poor overall survival.
28072683	Knowledge of Greek adolescents on human papilloma virus (HPV) and vaccination: A national epidemiologic study.	The aim of the present study was to identify the sexual behavior, attitudes, beliefs, and knowledge on sexually transmitted infections (STIs) focused on human papilloma virus (HPV) in the Greek adolescent population. The participants were 4547 adolescents, a representative sample for Greek territory with a mean age of 17 years. After written permission from Greek ministry of education each student completed a questionnaire with 36 questions. The fields covered were demographic characteristics, sexual life data, and basic knowledge on HPV. In the present study, 43% and 75% of the participants knew about HPV or cervical cancer, while more than 6 out of 10 did not know the association between the 2. More than 60% of the participants could not answer correctly neither about HPV infection and cervical cancer frequency in sexually active women, nor about protection methods against HPV and cervical cancer. This study shows that the low vaccination coverage of the Greek population may be due to lack of information and awareness of the adolescents and their parents. It is our duty to increase our efforts in order to better educate the population and vaccinate the population as early as possible in their reproductive years.
28068602	Synthesis of 2,3,6,7-tetramethoxyphenanthren-9-amine: An efficient precursor to access new 4-aza-2,3-dihydropyridophenanthrenes as apoptosis inducing agents.	A new route for the synthesis of novel 2,3,6,7-tetramethoxy phenanthrene amine precursor has been successfully accomplished. Subsequently, this amine precursor has been directly utilized for the synthesis of a new series of 4-aza-2,3-dihydropyridophenanthrene derivatives via a three component reaction with tetronic acid and substituted aldehydes. These compounds were evaluated for their cytotoxic potential against human lung (A549), prostate (PC-3 and DU145), breast (MDA-MB-231 and 4T1), gastric (HGC-27), colon (Caco-2) and cervical (HeLa) cancer cell lines. Compound 10l showed significant anticancer profile against DU145 cell line with an IC50 value of 2.6 +/- 0.34 muM. Disruption of F-actin cytoskeleton structure and cell migration inhibition in DU145 cells clearly indicate that the tumor progression and metastasis are affected by this compound (10l). Cell cycle analysis revealed that it arrests the cells in G2/M phase. Acridine orange/ethidium bromide (AO/EB) staining, Hoechst staining and annexin-V binding assays showed that cell proliferation is inhibited through induction of apoptosis. Moreover, its treatment leads to collapse of the mitochondrial membrane potential (DPsim).
28065369	The stratification of severity of acute radiation proctopathy after radiotherapy for cervical carcinoma using diffusion-weighted MRI.	OBJECTIVE: To determine whether diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) can be used for quantitatively evaluating severity of acute radiation proctopathy after radiotherapy for cervical carcinoma. MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred and twenty-four patients with cervical carcinoma underwent MR examination including DWI before and after radiotherapy. Acute radiation proctopathy was classified into three groups (grade 0, grade I-II and grade III-IV) according to Toxicity Criteria of the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG). The pretreatment ADC (ADCpre), ADC after treatment (ADCpost) and ADC change (DeltaADC) were compared among three groups. In addition, acute radiation proctopathy was classified into good-prognosis group and poor-prognosis group. ADCpre, ADCpost and DeltaADC were compared between two groups. For DWI parameter that had significant difference, discriminatory capability of the parameter was determined using receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis. RESULTS: ADCpost and DeltaADC were higher in grade I-II group than in grade 0 group (p<0.05), yielding a sensitivity of 79.3% and specificity of 69.4% for ADCpost, and 85.1%, 72.3% for DeltaADC for discrimination between two groups. ADCpost and DeltaADC were higher in grade III-IV group than in grade I-II group (p<0.05), yielding a sensitivity of 80.3% and specificity of 72.5% for ADCpost, and 84.1%, 74.5% for DeltaADC for discrimination between two groups. ADCpost and DeltaADC were higher in poor-prognosis group than in good-prognosis group (p<0.05), yielding a sensitivity of 79.5% and specificity of 73.4% for ADCpost, and 87.2%, 78.3% for DeltaADC for discrimination between two groups. CONCLUSION: Diffusion-weighted MRI can be used for quantitative stratification of severity of acute radiation proctopathy, which serves as an important basis for appropriate timely adjustment of radiotherapy for cervical carcinoma in order to maximally reduce the radiation injury of rectum.
28063407	Synthesis and in vitro photodynamic therapy of chlorin derivative 131-ortho-trifluoromethyl-phenylhydrazone modified pyropheophorbide-a.	Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is entering the mainstream of the cancer treatments recently. Pyropheophorbide-a (Pa), as a degradation product of chlorophyll-a, has been shown to be a potent photosensitizer in photodynamic therapy. In this paper, we investigated the in vitro photodynamic therapy of 131-ortho-trifluoromethyl-phenylhydrazone modified pyropheophorbide-a (PHPa) against human HeLa cervical cancer cell line, together with ultraviolet-visible spectra, fluorescence emission spectra, stability in various solvents, and single oxygen quantum yield. The results indicated that PHPa not only showed a greater molar extinction coefficient reached 4.55x104 Lmol-1cm-1, the long absorption wavelength (681nm) as we expected that makes it potential in deep tumor treatment, but also showed better stability in near neutral phosphate buffers (pH 7.4) and culture medium, as well as higher single oxygen quantum yield (capital EF, CyrillicD=40.5%) in DMF solutions. Moreover, cell experiments suggested that PHPa could be uptaken by HeLa cells successfully, and has low dark toxicity without irradiation, but remarkable photo-cytotoxicity (IC50, 1.92+/-0.59muM) that the inhibition rate of HeLa cells could increase up 91.4% at 30muM of PHPa after irradiation. In addition, morphological changes of HeLa cells further demonstrated that PHPa can induce damage and apoptotic cell death. Furthermore, the mechanism of photochemical processes was investigated by using specific quenching agent sodium azide (SA) and D-mannitol (DM), respectively, which showed the formation of singlet oxygen (Type II reaction mechanism) may play a predominant role, Type I and Type II photodynamic reactions could occur simultaneously in this PHPa mediated PDT process.
28057913	Humoral Hypercalcemia in Uterine Cancers: A Case Report and Literature Review.	BACKGROUND Paraneoplastic hypercalcemia is a well-described complication associated with a variety of malignancies. However, its incidence in gynecological malignancies is low. CASE REPORT A 53-year-old woman presented with progressive abdominal distention and irregular vaginal bleeding of several weeks' duration. A contrast CT abdomen and pelvis was significant for a mass in the lower uterine/cervical region, multiple peritoneal and omental masses, enlarged pelvic and paraaortic lymph nodes, and large-volume ascites. A pelvic exam revealed a fungating vaginal mass, with biopsy showing a high-grade tumor with immunohistochemical staining positive for vimentin, CD10, and cyclin D1, consistent with endometrial stromal sarcoma. During her hospitalization, the patient became increasingly lethargic. Workup showed severe hypercalcemia and evidence of acute kidney injury. The patient did not have evidence of bony metastatic disease on imaging studies. Further laboratory evaluation revealed an elevated PTHrP of 301 pg/mL (nl 14-27), a depressed PTH level of 3 pg/mL (nl 15-65), and a depressed 25-OH vitamin D level of 16 ng/mL (nl 30-100), consistent with humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy. The patient was treated with pamidronate, calcitonin, and intravenous fluids. She eventually required temporary hemodialysis and denosumab for refractory hypercalcemia, which improved her electrolyte abnormalities and clinical status. CONCLUSIONS Uterine malignancies of various histologies are increasingly recognized as a cause of humoral hypercalcemia. They are an important differential diagnosis in a woman with hypercalcemia and abnormal vaginal bleeding or abdominal symptoms.
28054530	Does fall in serum glutathione predict the long-term outcome to concurrent chemoradiation for cervical cancer patients?	BACKGROUND: Wide variations are seen in clinical practice with respect to response to concurrent chemo radiation among cervical cancer patients. Fall in serum glutathione (GSH) level directly correlates with early response to treatment. Whether this early response translates to a better long term outcome is the subject of this prospective study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty eight women with cervical cancer were treated with concurrent chemo radiation followed by brachytherapy. Serum GSH was measured before and after two fractions of radiation and first chemotherapy. Patients were followed for a median follow up of four years. Fall in GSH was correlated with response at six weeks and disease status at four years. RESULTS: Median fall in serum GSH was 171.16 microg per ml. Fall in GSH was 170.42, 103.54 and 37.25 microg per ml (P value of <0.0001, 0.05 and 0.18) in patients showing complete response, partial response and no response respectively. Among 26 patients who had no disease at six weeks, 22 women remained disease free at four years (P < 0.0001), two recurred (P < 0.05) and two died of other causes respectively. Non bulky tumours and patients more than 50 years of age showed a fall of 190.69, 265.17 microg per ml respectively. CONCLUSION: Greater fall in serum GSH predicts better early response as well as long term disease control.
28053694	Synergic Effect of alpha-Mangostin on the Cytotoxicity of Cisplatin in a Cervical Cancer Model.	Cervical cancer is the second leading cause of death among Mexican women. The treatment with cis-diamminedichloroplatinum (II) (CDDP) has some serious side effects. Alpha-mangostin (alpha-M), has a protective effect against CDDP-induced nephrotoxicity, as well as antioxidant, antitumor, and anti-inflammatory properties. Hence, we explored the in vitro and in vivo effect of alpha-M on human cervical cancer cell proliferation when combined with CDDP. In vitro, The cytotoxic effect of alpha-M and/or CDDP was measured by the 3-(3,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)2,5-diphenyltetrazolium assay. Meanwhile, apoptosis, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and the cell cycle were determined with flow cytometry. For alpha-M+CDDP treatment, both a coincubation and preincubation scheme were employed. In vivo, xenotransplantation was performed in female athymic BALB/c (nu/nu) mice, and then tumor volume and body weight were measured weekly, whereas alpha-M interfered with the antiproliferative activity of CDDP in the coincubation scheme, with preincubation with alpha-M+CDDP showing significantly greater cytotoxicity than CDDP or alpha-M alone, significantly inhibiting average tumor volume and preventing nephrotoxicity. This effect was accompanied by increased apoptosis and ROS production by HeLa cervical cancer cells, as well as an arrest in the cell cycle. These results suggest that alpha-M may be useful as a neoadjuvant agent in cervical cancer therapy.
28052947	Primitive neuroectodermal tumour of the cervix: a rare diagnosis.	A 48-year-old woman presented with symptoms of lower abdominal pain and vaginal discharge for 6 months. Clinical examination and pelvic ultrasound scan suggested a diagnosis of infected Gartner's cyst, for which she underwent vaginal cystectomy. However, histopathology and immunohistochemistry revealed a diagnosis of primitive neuroectodermal tumour of the cervix. Further investigations revealed the stage to be FIGO IIIB, which was inoperable. She received neoadjuvant chemotherapy (vincristine, adriamycin, cyclophosphamide alternating with ifosfamide, cisplatin and etoposide, every 21 days), but the tumour did not respond to treatment and she was started on radiotherapy with definitive intent (55.8 Gray in 31 fractions over 6.2 weeks). A PET-CT performed 2 months after completion of radiotherapy showed complete response, and she is now receiving adjuvant chemotherapy.
28049488	Intracellular trafficking and cellular uptake mechanism of PHBV nanoparticles for targeted delivery in epithelial cell lines.	BACKGROUND: Nanotechnology is a science that involves imaging, measurement, modeling and a manipulation of matter at the nanometric scale. One application of this technology is drug delivery systems based on nanoparticles obtained from natural or synthetic sources. An example of these systems is synthetized from poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate), which is a biodegradable, biocompatible and a low production cost polymer. The aim of this work was to investigate the uptake mechanism of PHBV nanoparticles in two different epithelial cell lines (HeLa and SKOV-3). RESULTS: As a first step, we characterized size, shape and surface charge of nanoparticles using dynamic light scattering and transmission electron microscopy. Intracellular incorporation was evaluated through flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy using intracellular markers. We concluded that cellular uptake mechanism is carried out in a time, concentration and energy dependent way. Our results showed that nanoparticle uptake displays a cell-specific pattern, since we have observed different colocalization in two different cell lines. In HeLa (Cervical cancer cells) this process may occur via classical endocytosis pathway and some internalization via caveolin-dependent was also observed, whereas in SKOV-3 (Ovarian cancer cells) these patterns were not observed. Rearrangement of actin filaments showed differential nanoparticle internalization patterns for HeLa and SKOV-3. Additionally, final fate of nanoparticles was also determined, showing that in both cell lines, nanoparticles ended up in lysosomes but at different times, where they are finally degraded, thereby releasing their contents. CONCLUSIONS: Our results, provide novel insight about PHBV nanoparticles internalization suggesting that for develop a proper drug delivery system is critical understand the uptake mechanism.
28044307	Expression of p63, p53 and Ki-67 in Patients with Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia.	OBJECTIVE: Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) is a dysplastic process in cervical squamous epithelium and carries a risk of progression to cervical cancer. The aim of this study was to compare expression of three biomarkers named p53, p63 and Ki-67 in patients with various grades of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and in a control group. MATERIAL AND METHOD: 58 patients were enrolled in the study. Each patient underwent a colposcopy-guided biopsy of the cervix. Immunostaining for markers (p53, p63 and Ki-67) was performed on tissue samples of normal cases (n=10), CIN I (n=20), CIN II (n=14), and CIN III (n=14). RESULTS: Our study showed a significant increase of the expression of the analyzed biomarkers in most patients with CIN III compared to CIN II and CIN I. Furthermore, p53 and p63 were significantly increased in CIN I compared to the control group. CONCLUSION: The expression of Ki-67, p63 and p53 differed between CIN I, CIN II and CIN III. p63 and p53 were reliable biomarkers to distinguish reactive changes from CIN I, while all three biomarkers (Ki-67, p53 and p63) had a high degree of sensitivity and specificity to distinguish between CIN III, CIN II and CIN I.
28042706	Do CDK4/6 inhibitors have potential as targeted therapeutics for squamous cell cancers?	Introduction Dysregulation of cell cycle progression has an established link to neoplasia and cancer progression. Components of the cyclin D-CDK4/6-INK4-Rb pathway are frequently altered in squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) by diverse mechanisms, including viral oncogene-induced degradation, mutation, deletion, and amplification. Activation of the CDK4/6 pathway may predict response to CDK4/6 inhibitors and provide clinical biomarkers. Recently, the CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib showed clinical efficacy in combination with cetuximab in HNSCC patients. Areas covered This review focuses on the current research on the use of CDK4/6 inhibitors, comprising preclinical animal studies through phase II clinical trials across all SCCs. Expert opinion CDK4/6 inhibitors have a proven clinical benefit in breast cancer, but data on SCCs are sparse. Although frequent dysregulation of the cyclin D-CDK4/6-INK4-Rb pathway in SCCs suggests that targeting CDK4/6 may hold promise for improved clinical outcomes, single-agent activity has been modest in preclinical studies and absent in clinical studies. Combinations with immunotherapy or inhibitors of the PI3 K/mTOR or EGFR pathway may be effective. Given that SCCs caused by human papillomavirus have high levels of p16 and low levels of Rb, the CDK4/6 inhibitors are predicted to be ineffective in these cancers.
28041319	Rapid and complete radiological resolution of an intradural cervical cord lung cancer metastasis treated with spinal stereotactic radiosurgery: case report.	Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) has emerged as a treatment option for patients with spinal metastatic disease. Although SRS has been shown to be successful in a multitude of extradural metastatic tumors causing cord compression, very few cases of intradural treatment have been reported. The authors present a rare case of an intradural extramedullary metastatic small cell lung cancer lesion to the cervical spine resulting in cord compression in an area that had also been extensively pretreated with conventional external-beam radiation therapy. The patient underwent successful SRS to this metastatic site, with rapid and complete resolution of his lesion.
28041317	Stereotactic radiosurgery for intradural spine tumors using cone-beam CT image guidance.	OBJECTIVE Cone-beam CT (CBCT) image guidance technology has been widely adopted for spine radiosurgery delivery. There is relatively little experience with spine radiosurgery for intradural tumors using CBCT image guidance. This study prospectively evaluated a series of intradural spine tumors treated with radiosurgery. Patient setup accuracy for spine radiosurgery delivery using CBCT image guidance for intradural spine tumors was determined. METHODS Eighty-two patients with intradural tumors were treated and prospectively evaluated. The positioning deviations of the spine radiosurgery treatments in patients were recorded. Radiosurgery was delivered using a linear accelerator with a beam modulator and CBCT image guidance combined with a robotic couch that allows positioning correction in 3 translational and 3 rotational directions. To measure patient movement, 3 quality assurance CBCTs were performed and recorded in 30 patients: before, halfway, and after the radiosurgery treatment. The positioning data and fused images of planning CT and CBCT from the treatments were analyzed to determine intrafraction patient movements. From each of 3 CBCTs, 3 translational and 3 rotational coordinates were obtained. RESULTS The radiosurgery procedure was successfully completed for all patients. Lesion locations included cervical (22), thoracic (17), lumbar (38), and sacral (5). Tumor histologies included schwannoma (27), neurofibromas (18), meningioma (16), hemangioblastoma (8), and ependymoma (5). The mean prescription dose was 17 Gy (range 12-27 Gy) delivered in 1-3 fractions. At the halfway point of the radiation, the translational variations and standard deviations were 0.4 +/- 0.5, 0.5 +/- 0.8, and 0.4 +/- 0.5 mm in the lateral (x), longitudinal (y), and anteroposterior (z) directions, respectively. Similarly, the variations immediately after treatment were 0.5 +/- 0.4, 0.5 +/- 0.6, and 0.6 +/- 0.5 mm along x, y, and z directions, respectively. The mean rotational angles were 0.3 degrees +/- 0.4 degrees , 0.3 degrees +/- 0.4 degrees , and 0.3 degrees +/- 0.4 degrees along yaw, roll, and pitch, respectively, at the halfway point and 0.5 degrees +/- 0.5 degrees , 0.4 degrees +/- 0.5 degrees , and 0.2 degrees +/- 0.3 degrees immediately after treatment. CONCLUSIONS Radiosurgery offers an alternative treatment option for intradural spine tumors in patients who may not be optimal candidates for open surgery. CBCT image guidance for patient setup for spine radiosurgery is accurate and successful in patients with intradural tumors.
28039789	Substitutional impact on biological activity of new water soluble Ni(II) complexes: Preparation, spectral characterization, X-ray crystallography, DNA/protein binding, antibacterial activity and in vitro cytotoxicity.	A series of new water soluble nickel(II) complexes containing triphenylphosphine and 4-methoxysalicylaldehyde-4(N)-substituted thiosemicarbazones were synthesized and characterized. Crystallographic investigations confirmed the structure of the complexes (1-4) having the general structure [Ni(4-Msal-Rtsc)(PPh3)] (Where R=H (1); CH3 (2); C2H5 (3); C6H5 (4)) which showed that thiosemicarbazone ligands coordinated to nickel(II) ion as ONS tridentate bibasic donor. DNA/BSA protein binding ability of the ligands and their new complexes were studied by taking calf-thymus DNA (CT-DNA) and Bovine serum albumin (BSA) through absorption and emission titrations. Ethidium bromide (EB) displacement study showed the intercalative binding trend of the complexes to DNA. From the albumin binding studies, the mechanism of quenching was found as static and the alterations in the secondary structure of BSA by the compounds were confirmed with synchronous spectral studies. The binding affinity of the complexes to CT-DNA and BSA has the order of [Ni(4-Msal-etsc)(PPh3)] (3) >[Ni(4-Msal-mtsc)(PPh3)] (2) >[Ni(4-Msal-tsc)(PPh3)] (1) >[Ni(4-Msal-ptsc)(PPh3)] (4). In vitro cytotoxicity of the complexes was tested on human lung cancer cells (A549), human cervical cancer cells (HeLa), human liver carcinoma cells (Hep G2). All the complexes exhibited significant activity against three cancer cells. Among them, complex 4 exhibited almost 2.5 fold activity than cisplatin in A549 and HepG2 cell lines. In HeLa cell line, the complexes exhibited significant activity which is less than cisplatin. While comparing the activity of the complexes in A549 and HepG2 cell lines it falls in the order 4>1>2>3>cisplatin. The results obtained from DNA, protein binding and cytotoxicity studies, it is concluded that the cytotoxicity of the complexes as determined by MTT assay were not unduly influenced by the complexes having different binding efficiency with DNA and protein. The complexes exhibited good spectrum of antibacterial activity against four pathogenic bacteria such as E. faecalis (gram +ve), S. aureus (gram +ve), E. coli (gram -ve) and P. aeruginosa (gram -ve).
28039786	DNA interaction, antimicrobial, antioxidant and anticancer studies on Cu(II) complexes of Luotonin A.	Luotonin A (L), a novel natural cytotoxic and anti-inflammatory alkaloid, chelated with copper(II) to improve its cytotoxic effect against the cancer cells. The complexes [Cu(L)H2OCl]Cl (1) and [Cu(L)2]Cl2 (2) are prepared by using copper(II) chloride and L with ligand/metal molar ratio of 1:1 and 2:1 respectively. A solution of complexes 1 &2 are characterized by physical spectroscopic methods using Ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectrophotometer, Fourier Transform-Infra red (FT-IR) spectroscopy, Electron Para magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (EPR) and by electrochemical methods. The interaction of these complexes 1 &2 with calf thymus (CT-DNA) have been investigated by physical methods to propose the modes of DNA binding with the complexes 1 &2. Absorption spectral titration studies of complex 1 with CT-DNA shows a red-shift of 5nm with the DNA binding affinity of Kb, 8.65x103M-1, but complex 2does not show any red-shift with binding constant Kb, 7.32x103M-1 reveals that the complex 1 binding with DNA strongly than complex 2 and the binding occurs in between the base pairs of DNA as intercalation. Strong interactions of the two complexes 1 & 2 with CT-DNA have also been confirmed by fluorescence spectral titration studies. The evaluated values of KSV and Kass shows that, the complexes 1 &2 interact with DNA through the intercalation, coincide with other partial intercalators strongly than the free ligand L. Complex 1 exhibits potent antioxidant activity with SC50 value of 23.9+/-0.69muM is evaluated by DPPH radical scavenging assay and which has potent antimicrobial activity against pathogens than 2 and L. The anticancer activity of L, complexes 1 &2 against human breast cancer cell line (MCF-7) and cervical cancer cell line (HeLa) has also been studied by using fluorescence staining method. The IC50 values of L, complexes 1&2 against MCF-7 and HeLa cell lines with the incubation time intervals of 24hrs are 1 (5.0+/-0.25, 12.0+/-0.30muM)<2 (6.5+/-0.27, 15.0+/-0.30muM)<L (7.0+/-0.15, 25.0+/-0.35muM) respectively. Interestingly, complex 1 exhibits anticancer activity more potent than L against both MCF-7 and HeLa cell lines. The result of anticancer activity studies show that the cytotoxic activity of L against MCF-7 and HeLa cells is increased, when chelated with Cu(II).
28038323	Synthesis and biological evaluation of curcumin inspired indole analogues as tubulin polymerization inhibitors.	In our endeavour towards the development of potent cytotoxic agents, a series of some new curcumin inspired indole analogues, in which indole and phenyl moieties are linked on either sides of 1,5-diaryl-1,4-pentadien-3-one system have been synthesized and characterized by spectral data. All the newly synthesized analogues were tested for their cytotoxic potential against a panel of eight cancer cell lines namely, lung (A549), breast (MDA-MB-231, BT549 and 4T1), prostate (PC-3, DU145), gastric (HGC-27) and cervical (HeLa). Notably, among all the compounds tested, compounds 11c, 11d and 11f showed potent growth inhibition on PC-3 and BT549 with IC50 values in the range of 3.12-6.34 muM and 4.69-8.72 muM respectively. The most active compound (11c) was also tested on RWPE-1 (normal prostate) cells and was found to be safe compared to the PC-3 cells. In tubulin polymerization assay, compounds 11c and 11f effectively inhibited microtubule assembly with IC50 values of 10.21 +/- 0.10 and 8.83 +/- 0.06 muM respectively. The results from molecular modelling studies revealed that these compounds bind at the colchicine binding site of the tubulin. Moreover, DAPI and acridine orange/ethidium bromide staining studies indicated that compounds 11c and 11f can induce apoptosis in PC-3 cells. Further flow-cytometry analysis revealed that compound 11c arrests PC-3 cells in G2/M phase of the cell cycle while compound 11f treatment resulted in moderate increase in the G2/M population. Additionally, the treatment by these compounds led to the impairment of mitochondrial membrane potential (DPsim) in PC-3 cells.
28035725	Cyclophosphamide promotes breast cancer cell migration through CXCR4 and matrix metalloproteinases.	Cyclophosphamide is indicated for the treatment of cancerous diseases such as breast cancer and cervical cancer. Recent studies have shown that cyclophosphamide may induce cancer metastasis, but the cause of this unexpected adverse effect is not fully understood. In this study, we investigate the effect of cyclophosphamide on cancer cell migration and its correlation to chemokine (C-X-C motif) receptor 4 (CXCR4), a biomarker for cancer metastasis. Two human cancer cell lines with significant difference in endogenous CXCR4 expression, the breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB-231, and the melanoma cell line, MDA-MB-435S, were treated with various concentrations of cyclophosphamide, followed by the assessment of CXCR4 expression and cell migration. We found that the migration ability of MDA-MB-231 cells was enhanced with increasing concentrations of cyclophosphamide, which induced the cell-surface expression of CXCR4, but had no effect on the overall amount of CXCR4. In MDA-MB-435S cells, in which CXCR4 was barely detectable, cyclophosphamide was unable to activate cell-surface CXCR4, and did not promote cell migration. Studies on the mRNA expression profile of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in MDA-MB-231 cells further indicate that MMP9 and MMP13 may be involved in the action of cyclophosphamide. The protein expression of both MMP9 and MMP13 was increased in the presence of cyclophosphamide. Results from this study provide the molecular basis for the possible pathway of cyclophosphamide to induce cancer metastasis.
28035417	Gallic acid induces HeLa cell death via increasing GSH depletion rather than ROS levels.	Gallic acid (GA; 3,4,5-triphydroxyl-benzoic acid) is widely dispersed in various plants, fruits and foods and it shows various biological properties including anticancer effects. This study investigated the effects of GA on HeLa cervical cancer cells in relation to cell death, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and glutathione (GSH). GA dose-dependently inhibited the growth of HeLa cells and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) at 24 or 72 h. The susceptibility of HeLa cells to GA was higher than that of HUVEC. GA induced apoptosis in HeLa cells, which was accompanied by the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP; psim). GA increased ROS levels including O2*- in HeLa cells at 24 h and it also induced GSH depletion. N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) increased the growth inhibition of GA-treated HeLa cells and enhanced the death of these cells. NAC differently influenced ROS levels in GA-treated HeLa cells and significantly increased GSH depletion in these cells. L-buthionine sulfoximine (BSO) increased MMP (psim) loss, ROS levels and GSH depletion in GA-treated HeLa cells. In conclusion, GA significantly inhibited the growth of HeLa cells. GA-induced HeLa cell death was tightly related to GSH depletion rather than ROS level changes.
28035359	ISG15 inhibits cancer cell growth and promotes apoptosis.	Cervical cancer is one of the most common causes of cancer-related mortality in women in developing countries. Interferon (IFN)-alpha has been widely used in the treatment of various types of cancer, including cervical cancer, and IFN-stimulated gene 15 (ISG15), an ubiquitin-like protein, is upregulated by IFN-alpha treatment. The anti-virus and antitumor effects of ISG15 have been reported; however, its mechanism of action have not yet been fully elucidated. In this study, HeLa cells were used as a model system to investigate the roles of ISG15 in IFN-alpha-mediated cancer cell growth inhibition and induction of apoptosis. The results revealed that both p53 and p21 were upregulated in HeLa cells treated with IFN-alpha or in the HeLa cells overexpressing ISG15. In addition, the expression levels of ubiquitin-like modifier-activating enzyme 7 (UBA7, also known as UBE1L; ISG15 E1-activating enzyme), UBCH8 (ISG15 E2-conjugating enzyme) and HERC5 (ISG15 E3-ligase) were elevated in the HeLa cells treated with IFN-alpha. The levels of p53 in the HeLa cells were attenuated by transient transfection with small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting ISG15 (ISG15-siRNA). Cell viability was inhibited by both IFN-alpha treatment and ISG15 overexpression. However, these effects were significantly diminished when p53 was knocked down, suggesting that the effects of inhibitory effects of ISG15 on HeLa cell growth and the induction of apoptosis were p53-dependent. Taken together, these results suggest the existence of the IFN-alpha/ISG15/p53 axis in cervical cancer cells and any strategies manipulating the levels of ISG15 may thus prove to be effective in the treatment of cervical cancer.
28034371	Vaccines against human papillomavirus infections: protection against cancer, genital warts or both?	Since 2006, three vaccines against infections and disease caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) became available in Europe-in 2006 a quadrivalent HPV 6/11/16/18 vaccine, in 2007 a bivalent HPV 16/18 vaccine and in 2015 a nonavalent HPV 6/11/16/18/31/33/45/52/58 vaccine. HPV 16 and 18 are the most oncogenic HPV strains, causing about 70% of cervical and other HPV-related cancers, HPV 6 and 11 cause 85% of all genital warts. The additional types of the polyvalent vaccine account for about 20% of invasive cervical cancer and >35% of pre-cancer. The potential differences between these vaccines caused some debate. All three vaccines give a robust and long-lasting protection against the strains in the various vaccines. The promise of cross-protection against other types (i.e. HPV 31/33/45) and hence a broader cancer protection was not fulfilled because these observations were confounded by the vaccine efficacy against the vaccine types. Furthermore, cross-protection was not consistent over various studies, not durable and not consistently seen in the real world experience. The protection against disease caused by oncogenic HPV strains was not compromised by the protection against low-risk types causing genital warts. The most effective cancer protection to date can be expected by the nonavalent vaccine, data indicate a 97% efficacy against cervical and vulvovaginal pre-cancer caused by these nine HPV types.
28031235	HTP Nutraceutical Screening for Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors and Effects of HDACis on Tumor-suppressing miRNAs by Trichostatin A and Grapeseed (Vitis vinifera) in HeLa cells.	BACKGROUND/AIM: Aggressive tumor malignancies are a consequence of delayed diagnosis, epigenetic/phenotype changes and chemo-radiation resistance. Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are a major epigenetic regulator of transcriptional repression, which are highly overexpressed in advanced malignancy. While original chemotherapy drugs were modeled after phytochemicals elucidated by botanical screenings, HDAC inhibitors (HDACi) such as apicidin, trichostatin A (TSA) and butyrate were discovered as products of fungus and microbes, in particular, gut microbiota. Therefore, a persistent question remains as to the inherent existence of HDACis in raw undigested dietary plant material. In this study, we conduct a high-throughput (HTP) screening of ~1,600 non-fermented commonly used nutraceuticals (spices, herbs, teas, vegetables, fruits, seeds, rinds etc.) at (<600 mug/ml) and food-based polyphenolics (<240 mug/ml) for evidence of HDAC activity inhibition in nuclear HeLa cell lysates. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Human HDAC kinetic validation was performed using a standard fluorometric activity assay, followed by an enzymatic-linked immuno-captured ELISA. Both methods were verified using HDACi panel drugs: TSA, apicidin, suberohydroxamic acid, M344, CL-994, valproic acid and sodium phenylbutyrate. The HTP screening was then conducted, followed by a study comparing biological effects of HDACis in HeLa cells, including analysis of whole-transcriptome non-coding RNAs using Affymetrix miRNA 4.1-panel arrays. RESULTS: The HTP screening results confirmed 44/1600 as potential HDACis to which 31 were further eliminated as false-positives. Methodological challenges/concerns are addressed regarding plant product false-positives that arise from the signal reduction of commercial lysine development reagents. Only 13 HDACis were found having an IC50 under <200 mug/ml: Grapeseed extract (Vitis vinifera), Great burnet root (Sanguisorba Officinalis), Babul (Acacia arabica), Chinese gallnut (Melaphis chinensis), Konaberry extract (Coffea arabica), Uva Ursi (Arctostaphylos uva ursi), Green tea (Camellia sinensis), Meadowsweet (Filipendula ulmaria), Sassafras (Sassafras officinale), Turkey rhubarb (Rheum palmatum), epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), gossypol and gallic acid. Next, we investigate the biological consequence of HDACi panel drugs in HeLa cells, where the data suggest predominant effects are anti-mitotic rather than cytotoxic. Lastly, differential effects of TSA vs. GSE at sub-lethal concentrations tested on HeLa cells show 6,631 miRNAs expressed in resting cells, 35 significantly up-regulated (TSA) and 81 up-regulated (GSE), with several miRNAs overlapping in the upward direction by both GSE and TSA (e.g. hsa-miR-23b-5p, hsa-miR-27b-5p, hsa-miR-1180-3p, hsa-miR-6880-5p and hsa-mir-943). Using DIANA miRNA online tools, it was determined that GSE and TSA simultaneously cause overexpression of similar miRNAs predicted to destroy the following influential oncogenes: NFkB, NRAS, KRAS, HRAS, MYC, TGFBR1, E2F1, E2F2, BCL21, CDKN1A, CDK6, HIF1a, and VEGFA. CONCLUSION: The data from this study show that plant- based HDACis are relatively rare, and can elicit a similar pattern to TSA in up-regulating miRNAs involved with tumor suppression of HeLa cervical carcinoma.
28031050	Prognostic factors and failure patterns in non-metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma after intensity-modulated radiotherapy.	BACKGROUND: The prognostic values of staging parameters require continual re-assessment amid changes in diagnostic and therapeutic methods. This study aimed to identify the prognostic factors and failure patterns of non-metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) in the intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) era. METHODS: We reviewed the data from 749 patients with newly diagnosed, biopsy-proven, non-metastatic NPC in our cancer center (South China, an NPC endemic area) between January 2003 and December 2007. All patients underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) before receiving IMRT. The actuarial survival rates were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and survival curves were compared using the log-rank test. Multivariate analyses with the Cox proportional hazards model were used to test for the independent prognostic factors by backward eliminating insignificant explanatory variables. RESULTS: The 5-year occurrence rates of local failure, regional failure, locoregional failure, and distant failure were 5.4, 3.0, 7.4, and 17.4%, respectively. The 5-year survival rates were as follows: local relapse-free survival, 94.6%; nodal relapse-free survival, 97.0%; distant metastasis-free survival, 82.6%; disease-free survival, 75.1%; and overall survival, 82.0%. Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that orbit involvement was the only significant prognostic factor for local failure (P = 0.011). Parapharyngeal tumor extension, retropharyngeal lymph node involvement, and the laterality, longest diameter, and Ho's location of the cervical lymph nodes were significant prognostic factors for both distant failure and disease failure (all P < 0.05). Intracranial extension had significant prognostic value for distant failure (P = 0.040). CONCLUSIONS: The key failure pattern for NPC was distant metastasis in the IMRT era. With changes in diagnostic and therapeutic technologies as well as treatment modalities, the significant prognostic parameters for local control have also been altered substantially.
28029176	Robot-assisted surgery in gynecological oncology: current status and controversies on patient benefits, cost and surgeon conditions - a systematic review.	INTRODUCTION: Robot-assisted surgery has become more widespread in gynecological oncology. The purpose of this systematic review is to present current knowledge on robot-assisted surgery, and to clarify and discuss controversies that have arisen alongside the development and deployment. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A database search in PubMed and EMBASE was performed up until 4 March 2016. The search strategy was developed in collaboration with an information specialist, and by application of the PRISMA guidelines. Human participants and English language were the only restrictive filters applied. Selection was performed by screening of titles and abstracts, and by full text scrutiny. From 2001 to 2016, a total of 76 references were included. RESULTS: Robot-assisted surgery in gynecological oncology has increased, and current knowledge supports that the oncological safety is similar, compared with previous surgical methods. Controversies arise because current knowledge does not clearly document the benefit of robot-assisted surgery, on perioperative outcome compared with the increased costs of the acquisition and application. CONCLUSIONS: The rapid development in robot-assisted surgery calls for long-term detailed prospective cohorts or randomized controlled trials. The costs associated with acquisition, application, and maintenance have an unfavorable impact on cost-benefit evaluations, especially when compared with laparoscopy. Future developments in robot-assisted surgery will hopefully lead to competition in the market, which will decrease costs.
28027539	Construction and comparison of different nanocarriers for co-delivery of cisplatin and curcumin: A synergistic combination nanotherapy for cervical cancer.	PURPOSE: Co-delivery of two or more drugs into the same cancer cells or tissues in the same nanocarriers provides a new paradigm in cancer treatment. In this study, two kinds of nanocarriers: lipid-polymer hybrid nanoparticles (LPNs) and polymeric nanoparticles (PNPs) were constructed and compared for co-delivery of cisplatin (DDP) and curcumin (CUR). METHODS: DDP and CUR loaded LPNs (D/C/LPNs) and PNPs (D/C/PNPs) were prepared. Two kinds of nanocarriers were characterized in terms of particle size, zeta potential, drug encapsulation efficiency (EE), and drug release. Their in vitro cytotoxicity and in vivo anti-tumor efficacy was studied on human cervix adenocarcinoma cell line (HeLa cells) and mice bearing cervical cancer model. RESULTS: Compared with D/C/PNPs, D/C/LPNs showed significantly higher cytotoxicity in vitro. D/C/LPNs also displayed the best antitumor activity than other formulations tested in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrated that LPNs could improve the anticancer efficacy of drugs to higher levels than PNPs and free drugs, thus could serve as an effective drug system for targeted and synergistic co-delivery nanomedicine for cervical cancer chemotherapy.
28027535	Hyaluronic acid decorated pluronic P85 solid lipid nanoparticles as a potential carrier to overcome multidrug resistance in cervical and breast cancer.	This work aimed to develop hyaluronic acid (HA) decorated pluronic 85 (P85) coated solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN) loaded with paclitaxel (HA-PTX-P85-SLN) and to evaluate its potential to overcome drug resistance and to increase antitumor efficacy in mice bearing cervical and breast tumor. P85-Distearoyl Phosphoethanolamine (DSPE) was synthesized from P85 and DSPE by coupling in the presence of 1,10-carbonyldiimidazole (CDI) as a catalyst. The SLN were prepared by the hot homogenization technique and electrostatic interaction. PTX-loaded SLN was characterized for mean diameter, zeta potential, morphology, entrapment efficiency (EE), drug loading capacity (LC) and in vitro drug release. In vivo animal evaluation containing antitumor effect, pharmacokinetics and biodistribution were conducted in mice bearing cervical and breast tumor. The HA-PTX-P85-SLN showed a mean diameter of 160.3nm, negative zeta potential (-31.6mV), EE of 88.2%, and LC of 4.9%. PTX from HA-PTX-P85-SLN exhibited greater sustained drug release profiles compared free PTX. Pharmacokinetics results indicated that HA-PTX-P85-SLN exhibited a 5.5-fold increase in AUC in comparison to free PTX. Biodistribution results revealed that HA-PTX-P85-SLN exhibited higher tumor drug concentration compared with free PTX.
28027480	Neck lymph node metastases from unknown primary.	Metastatic cervical carcinoma from unknown primary is a metastatic disease in the lymph nodes of the neck without any evidence of a primary tumour after appropriate investigation. The condition is rare and definite evidence is lacking for both diagnosis and treatment. In this review of the literature, we tried to draw some clinical indications based on the few available studies. We ultimately came to the following conclusions: (1) a thorough and accurate diagnostic work-up should be systematically offered. It includes accurate inspection with fibroscopy, CT or MRI, fine needle aspiration, panendoscopy and positron emission tomography, (2) Patients with low-volume neck disease, N1 and N2a stage and without extracapsular extension on histopathological examination should receive single modality treatment. Radiotherapy and surgery may be similarly effective but, if possible, surgery (excisional biopsy, neck dissection and tonsillectomy) should be favoured because it consents a more precise staging, (3) patients with more advanced conditions require combined treatment in the form of either resection followed by adjuvant radiation (+/-chemotherapy) or primary chemoradiation (+/-post-therapy neck dissection).
28027120	Cervical Cancer Screening of Adolescents Should Not Be Encouraged.	OBJECTIVE: The study aims to assess the frequency of cytological abnormalities in adolescents and young women, to establish the optimum age to start screening. METHODS: A retrospective study of cervical cytology results were obtained from the data center at the Santa Casa Hospital of Sao Paulo between January 2006 and December 2014, adopting the Bethesda nomenclature system. The cytology exams were divided into 3 groups: group 1-adolescents (10-19 years old); group 2-young women (20-24 years old); and group 3-adults, comprising the remaining cytology exams. The frequency of cytological abnormalities in the 3 groups was compared using version 3.4.3 of the Epi Info software program and the chi-square statistical test (p < .05). RESULTS: A total of 177,075 satisfactory cytology exams were included in the study. The cytological abnormalities detected in the adolescent group were predominantly low-grade lesions (97.4%); in the young women group, low-grade lesions represented 89.12%, and in the adult group, 76.33%. A significantly greater proportion of high-grade lesions were noted in the adult group, accounting for approximately 24% of all abnormalities detected; in the young women group, it was approximately 11%, and in the adolescent group, it was 2.6%. CONCLUSIONS: The natural history of HPV infection shows it is transient in young women, with most cases regressing within 2 years of presentation. Our data confirm that screening of adolescents is not recommended because serious cytological abnormalities and cancer are rare in this group.
28025425	Virus and Host Events in Squamous Carcinogenesis.	Our group investigates early and late stages in the development of squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs), in order to identify new approaches to diagnosis and therapy. The principal themes are:1. Transcriptional deregulation of high-risk human papillomavirus (HRHPV)We study mechanisms of HRHPV transcriptional deregulation and competitive cell selection during SCC progression, focussing on the causes and effects of integration of HPV16 into the host genome. We showed that HPV16 integration does not necessarily lead to a competitive growth advantage or increased levels of virus oncogenes. Selection of individual cells is determined through multiple layers of epigenetic regulation of the integrated virus genome. We are currently studying whether the epigenetic landscape of integrated HPV16 reflects that of the host genome at the integration site and/or sites of long-range chromatin interactions of the virus DNA. This work may ultimately identify targets for epigenetic therapies in SCCs containing integrated HRHPV.2. The oncostatin-M receptor (OSMR) in metastasisThe cell-surface oncostatin-M receptor (OSMR) has emerged as an exciting therapeutic target in SCCs. Both copy number gain and over-expression of OSMR have a strong adverse prognostic effect in SCCs. Carcinoma cells that over-expressed OSMR were more sensitive to the major ligand OSM, which induced multiple pro-malignant effects, including epithelial-mesenchymal transition, increased metastasis and the ability to induce pro-malignant changes in cells from the tumour microenvironment (TME). We are now studying the effectiveness of OSM:OSMR blockade on the growth and metastasis of SCC cells in vivo, as well as effects on the TME in immunocompetent hosts.(Presented at the 1923th Meeting, August 10, 2016).
28024639	Soluble telmisartan bearing poly (ethylene glycol) conjugated chitosan nanoparticles augmented drug delivery, cytotoxicity, apoptosis and cellular uptake in human cervical cancer cells.	Soluble telmisartan and telmisartan were loaded in to poly (ethylene-glycol) grafted chitosan nanoparticles (S-TEL-PEG-CNPs and TEL-PEG-CNPs) for targeting cervical cancer through non-invasive, intravaginal route. The mean particle size of S-TEL-PEG-CNPs was measured to be 23.4+/-5.9-nm significantly (P<0.05) higher than 16.2+/-3.2-nm of TEL-PEG-CNPs. In contrast, the zeta-potential (-21.5+/-4.6-mV) of S-TEL-PEG-CNPs was insignificantly (P>0.05) different from -23.8+/-3.7-mV of TEL-PEG-CNPs. In addition, S-TEL-PEG-CNPs exhibited higher percent mucoadhesiveness (40.2%) in comparison (P<0.05) to 31.4% of TEL-PEG-CNPs, although it was lower than CNPs (100%). S-TEL-PEG-CNPs displayed significantly (P<0.01) higher dissolution of drug, 92.5% in comparison to 31.6% from TEL-PEG-CNPs up to 24h. Furthermore, S-TEL-PEG-CNPs exhibited superior cytotoxicity, apoptosis and cellular uptake, analyzed in human cervical cancer, HeLa cells. The IC50 of S-TEL-PEG-CNPs was measured to be 22.3-muM significantly (P<0.05) lower than 40.1-muM of TEL-PEG-CNPs. S-TEL-PEG-CNPs induced higher extent of apoptosis (P<0.05) in HeLa cells as compared to TEL-PEG-CNPs, owing to higher diffusion of drug across biological membrane. Finally, quantitative and qualitative cellular uptake assay confirmed the greater endocytosis of S-TEL-PEG-CNPs in HeLa cells due to diffusion, amorphization, hydrophilicity, and submicron size particularly, below 100nm. In conclusion, S-TEL-PEG-CNPs warrant further in vivo tumour regression study to scale up the technology for clinical translation.
28011511	Minimally Invasive Lymphadenectomy in Uterine Cervical Cancer: A Systematic Review.	BACKGROUND/AIM: The aim of this study was to review the current literature on the role of minimally invasive lymphadenectomy in the treatment of cervical cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Non-randomized control trials published between January 2007 to May 2016 were identified by searching the Pubmed, EMBASE and Cochrane Library databases. Primary endpoints included operative outcomes (operative time, intraoperative blood loss, number of transfused patients and conversion rates), postoperative outcomes (length of postoperative hospital stay, postoperative morbidity and postoperative in-hospital mortality), and oncological outcomes (number of harvested lymph nodes, tumor recurrence, disease-free rates and overall survival rates). RESULTS: A total of 17 studies with a total of 1,676 patients were included in the review. Compared to the open approach, minimally invasive lymphadenectomy demonstrated a significantly larger number of harvested lymph nodes, longer operative time, lower intraoperative blood loss and shorter postoperative hospital stay. No significant differences were observed between groups treated with an open, laparoscopic or robotic approach for the following criteria: lymph node metastasis, postoperative morbidity, tumor recurrence and postoperative mortality. CONCLUSION: Although a technically demanding and time-consuming procedure, minimally invasive lymphadenectomy appears to be safe and feasible and may offer an alternative approach in staging and treatment of cervical cancer. Multicentre randomized controlled trials investigating its long-term oncological outcomes and its cost-effectiveness are required to determine the advantages of this procedure over the open approach in cervical cancer.
28011510	Clinical Impact of Escalating Relative High-dose-rate Intracavitary Brachytherapy Dose in Stage IIB Cervical Cancer.	BACKGROUND/AIM: To investigate whether high-dose-rate (HDR) intracavitary brachytherapy (IBT) dose ratios can predict treatment outcomes in patients with stage IIB cervical cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Ninety-three patients treated with weekly cisplatin-based concurrent chemoradiotherapy and HDR IBT were analyzed. Potential prognostic factors and treatment outcomes were compared between low-HDR-IBT-ratio (</=0.43) and high-HDR-IBT-ratio (>0.43) groups, and univariate and multivariate analyses were performed. RESULTS: Five-year disease-specific survival (DSS) and progression-free survival (PFS) rates were significantly shorter in the low-compared to the high-HDR-IBT-ratio group. A high HDR IBT ratio was confirmed as an independent prognostic factor for DSS and PFS. CONCLUSION: A high HDR IBT dose ratio improves DSS and PFS in patients with stage IIB cervical cancer. Therefore, active administration of HDR IBT beyond previously accepted levels may be necessary for the treatment of locally advanced cervical cancer.
28011474	Cervical Cancer Patient-Derived Orthotopic Xenograft (PDOX) Is Sensitive to Cisplatinum and Resistant to Nab-paclitaxel.	BACKGROUND: Cervical cancer is a world-wide problem that requires transformative therapeutic strategies. We have previously developed patient-derived orthotopic xenograft (PDOX) nude-mouse models of this disease. In the present report, we demonstrate that the standard drug, cisplatinum (CDDP), is highly-effective while the new, highly-touted agent, nab-paclitaxel (NAB-PTX) is ineffective. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cervical PDOX tumors were grown on the cervix of nude mice for 4 weeks after surgical orthotopic implantation (SOI). Tumors were treated with CDDP or NAB-PTX. RESULTS: H&E staining demonstrated that the PDOX tumor recapitulated the original patient tumor. CDDP was highly-effective. One tumor that was treated with CDDP completely regressed. CDDP-treated tumors were smaller (tumor volume ratio: 0.42+/-0.36) than the control group (tumor volume ratio: 3.47+/-1.66) (p<0.01). In contrast, NAB-PTX did not show significant efficacy on the cervical cancer PDOX model (tumor volume ratio: 2.85+/-1.45) (p=0.47). CDDP-treated tumor weight (50+/-50 mg) was significantly less than control (238+/-114 mg) (p<0.01). NAB-PTX-treated tumors were not reduced in weight (246+/-136 mg) compared to control (p=0.91). There were no significant differences in mouse body weight between groups. Histological evaluation demonstrated that CDDP-treated tumors were fibrotic with scattered squamous cell nests compared to control or NAB-PTX-treated tumors. CONCLUSION: The results of the present study demonstrate the power of PDOX models of cervical cancer to distinguish efficacy of potential therapeutics for individual patients with this disease.
28011380	Propofol enhances the cisplatin-induced apoptosis on cervical cancer cells via EGFR/JAK2/STAT3 pathway.	OBJECTIVE: The main purpose of this study was to evaluate propofol and its combined effect with cisplatin on apoptosis of cervical cancer cells and molecular mechanisms of this phenomenon. METHODS: The effects of propofol and cisplatin on cell viability and apoptosis were detected by cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay, colony formation assay and flow cytometry assay. Besides, protein expression of EGFR/JAK2/STAT3 pathway was determined by western blot. STAT3 was over-expressed in cervical cancer cells by STAT3 cDNA. Expression of EGFR and STAT3 protein of human tissues was evaluated by immunohistochemistry (IHC) assay. RESULTS: In this study, we found that not only propofol alone could inhibit cervical cancer cells viability but also could increase the inhibitory effect of cisplatin on cervical cancer cells growth. Meanwhile, propofol sensitized cervical cancer cells to cisplatin-induced apoptosis but not affected normal cervical cells. In genetic level, propofol could enhance the anti-tumor effect of cisplatin through EGFR/JAK2/STAT3 pathway. Further studies indicated that overexpression of EGFR and STAT3 is related to poor prognoses in cervical cancer patients, which contributed to confirm the clinical role of combined application of propofol and cisplatin. CONCLUSION: Propofol enhances the cisplatin-induced cell apoptosis cervical cancer cells via EGFR/JAK2/STAT3 pathway and may be developed as a potential therapeutic agent to treat cervical cancer.
28009429	Association between Toll-like receptor and tumor necrosis factor immunological pathways in uterine cervical neoplasms.	INTRODUCTION: The immune system plays a critical role in the defense against human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and its persistence. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are membrane receptors responsible for activation of the innate immune response, and an association between TLR expression and uterine cervical cancer has been shown. Tumor necrosis factors (TNFs) are among the main mediators of skin and mucosa in fl ammation. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the association between TLR and TNF immune expression and cervical cancer and premalignant cervical lesions. METHODS: A total of 64 embedded tissues were obtained from gynecological procedures, including 35 specimens with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and 10 specimens with cervical squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC) as well as 19 normal cervical samples. The expression of TLR2, TLR3, TLR4, TNF-alpha and TNF-beta was measured by immunohistochemistry and graded into low and high levels of expression. RESULTS: There was an association between the expression levels of TLR2 and those of TNF-alpha and TNF-beta (p = 0.01 and p = 0.021, respectively) in the cervical cancer and CIN groups. TLR4 expression was associated with TNF-alpha and TNF-beta expression (p = 0.016 and p = 0.025, respectively) in these 2 groups. By contrast, TLR3 was not statistically associated with TNF-alpha or TNF-beta in any of the groups. CONCLUSIONS: There might be an association of the TLR2 and TLR4 pathways with the immunological response of TNF-alpha and TNF-beta in cervical cancer. These markers are also expressed at higher levels in cervical cancer and premalignant lesions compared to normal controls.
28005640	Early Detection of Bone Metastasis in Small Cell Neuroendocrine Carcinoma of the Cervix by 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT Imaging.	The neuroendocrine small cell carcinoma of the cervix is a rare malignancy that has a poor prognosis due to early lymphatic and hematogenous spread. We herein report a case of a 27- year-old woman who was referred for initial staging of a neuroendocrine small cell carcinoma with previous unremarkable structural imaging. Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT revealed focal uptake at the primary tumor and in a solitary pelvic bone lesion suggestive of metastases that was further confirmed by CT-guided biopsy. Somatostatin receptor PET/CT may be a useful image modality for early detection of metastases to guide treatment in these patients.
28002538	Clinical and morphological considerations in one case with cervical cancer and right ureterohydronephrosis.	We present the case of a 34-year-old female with cervical cancer and right ureterohydronephrosis. She was admitted to the Urology Clinic of the Emergency County Hospital of Arad, Romania, on November 11, 2015, after previously being diagnosed with stage IIIA cervical cancer in December 2014 and undergoing radio and chemotherapy and laparotomy for staging. At the moment of hospital admission, the patient suffered from fever and right lumbar pain, she was also diagnosed with grade IV right ureterohydronephrosis. The patient was operated at the Urology Clinic of Arad; the intervention involved a total hysterectomy with bilateral adnexectomy and a right obturatory necrectomy of the necrotic lymph nodes. However, the evolution was favorable. The purpose was to increase the patient's survival rate and increase the quality of her life by also applying one palliative method including a urethral stent. As a result, the patient's life was extended.
28000879	High-mobility group box 1 is overexpressed in cervical carcinoma and promotes cell invasion and migration in vitro.	The present study aimed to investigate the expression of high-mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1) in cervical carcinoma and explore whether or not HMGB1 promotes cervical carcinoma cell invasion and migration in vitro and the related mechanism. HMGB1, nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB), E-cadherin and N-cadherin protein expression was analyzed in tissues from 48 cervical carcinomas, 51 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and tissues from 24 healthy controls using immunohistochemistry. HeLa cells were treated with different concentrations of HMGB1 (0, 10, 100, and 1,000 ng/ml) at different time-points (0, 24, 48 and 72 h), and changes in cell morphology and biological behaviors were observed. Changes in the expression levels of E-cadherin, N-cadherin, NF-kappaB and the inhibitor kappaB (IkappaB) in the treated cells were detected by western blot analysis and real-time PCR. HMGB1 expression exhibited a gradually increasing trend in the normal cervical tissues, CIN and cervical cancer, and there was statistical significance between the three groups (P<0.05). HMGB1 expression level was associated with FIGO stage, lymph node metastasis and differentiation (P<0.05). HMGB1 expression was positively related to N-cadherin and NF-kappaB; and HMGB1 had a negative relationship with E-cadherin. HMGB1 stimulation caused HeLa cells to lose cell polarity and transition from epithelial cells into spindle-shaped cells with sparse cell-cell junctions. The expression levels of E-cadherin and IkappaB in the cytoplasm were reduced, while N-cadherin expression was increased. The level of NF-kappaB expression in the nucleus was also increased. Treatment with NF-kappaB inhibitor (BAY11-7082) and receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) antagonist (anti-RAGE) significantly suppressed HMGB1mediated epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in the HeLa cervical cancer cells. The results suggest that HMGB1 is associated with outcomes of cervical cancer and promotes subsequent invasion and metastasis of cervical cancer cells by activating the NF-kappaB signaling pathway. This potential mechanism could be an important determinant of cervical cancer metastasis.
27998803	A pilot study on Hla-G locus control region haplotypes and cervical intraepithelial neoplasias.	Human papillomavirus (HPV) can induce cervical intraepithelial neoplasias (CIN) grades 1, 2 and 3. Untreated, these lesions may progress to cervical cancer (CC) which is the third most common cancer in women worldwide. HLA-G plays an immunotolerant role in the immune response. The aim of this study was to characterize the configuration of SNPs located at the distal promoter of HLA-G in patients with CIN2 and CIN3 and control women. The study sample was composed of 207 women as follows: 73 diagnosed with CIN2 lesions, 56 with CIN3 and 78 healthy control women. Genotyping was performed by sequence base typing. Eleven haplotype configurations subdivided in two main haplogroups (H1dist and H2dist), were characterized and compared between patients and controls. The haplotypes H1.1Dist (GAGAACGC) and H2.1Dist (AGGTACAC) were more frequent in Euro-Descendants as well as in Brazilian Mixed. Nevertheless, the haplotype H2.1Dist standed out as a susceptibility haplotype in Brazilian Mixed patients while the H1.1Dist presented a protector effect in this same ethnic group. Whether such LCR haplotype configurations can impact on HLA-G gene expression levels in women who developed cervical intraepithelial neoplasia is still unknown and it is of utmost importance that more investigation on this field be pursued.
27996172	The protein interacting with carboxyl terminus-1 codon 389 polymorphism impairs protein interacting with carboxyl terminus-1 function and is a risk factor for uterine cervical cancer.	PICT-1 is a nucleolar protein with various tumor suppressor functions. Recently, PICT-1 expression was reported to be dramatically reduced in several cancers. To investigate the role of PICT-1 in uterine cervical carcinogenesis, we examined its gene mutations, protein expression, cellular localization, and effect on p53 stabilization. PCR-SSCP analysis of the entire coding region of PICT-1 showed that a polymorphism at codon 389 may increase the risk of uterine cervical cancers, and also identified a novel missense mutation. Expression of wild-type PICT-1 inhibited the degradation of p53 in the presence or absence of HPV 18 E6 viral protein in vitro, while the expression of codon 389 polymorphic PICT-1 had a diminished inhibitory effect on p53 degradation. Moreover, we observed that PICT-1 degradation was induced both independently and cooperatively by E6 and E7 proteins from high-risk HPVs, but only marginal degradation was observed with proteins from low-risk HPV. Immunohistochemical staining of tumor samples revealed that lower levels of PICT-1 were observed in samples from CIN III and cervical cancer tissues, compared to normal cervical epithelium and CIN I, II tissues (P < 0.05). The reduction of PICT-1 may therefore be an early event in uterine cervical tumorigenesis. Our results indicated that PICT-1 counteracts HPV-induced p53 degradation and that aberrant PICT-1 function may contribute towards inactivating p53. Therefore, PICT-1 may play a critical role during the pathogenesis of uterine cervical cancers.
27993884	Misdiagnosis Analysis of Cervical Minimal Deviation Adenocarcinoma: a Report of Three Rare Cases and Literature Review.	Cervical minimal deviation adenocarcinoma (MDA) is a rare variant of cervical adenocarcinoma that is difficult to diagnose due to the deep location, endogenous growth pattern, deceptively benign appearance of tumor cells, and lack of connection to human papillomavirus (HPV). Cytological evaluation and biopsies offer suboptimal detection and transvaginal sonography or Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) only reveal multiple lesions that mimic multiple benign nabothian cysts. Besides, standard screening, diagnostic tools, and treatments are not established. Thus, MDA tends to be misdiagnosed with other gynecological diseases. In this study, we examine three cases with extensive abdominal metastasis and adhesions, which are not initially associated clinically with HPV and cervical malignancies. All cases were misdiagnosed as nabothian cysts, endometrial adenocarcinoma or ovarian cancer, though finally diagnosed as MDA by postoperative pathology. Delay in diagnosis and treatment can result in irreversible outcomes. Misdiagnoses are analyzed and suggestions for improving early detection are discussed with a brief review of the literature.
27989102	Tazarotene-Induced Gene 1 Enhanced Cervical Cell Autophagy through Transmembrane Protein 192.	Tazarotene-induced gene 1 (TIG1) is a retinoic acid-inducible protein that is considered a putative tumor suppressor. The expression of TIG1 is decreased in malignant prostate carcinoma or poorly differentiated colorectal adenocarcinoma, but TIG1 is present in benign or well-differentiated tumors. Ectopic TIG1 expression led to suppression of growth in cancer cells. However, the function of TIG1 in cell differentiation is still unknown. Using a yeast two-hybrid system, we found that transmembrane protein 192 (TMEM192) interacted with TIG1. We also found that both TIG1A and TIG1B isoforms interacted and co-localized with TMEM192 in HtTA cervical cancer cells. The expression of TIG1 induced the expression of autophagy-related proteins, including Beclin-1 and LC-3B. The silencing of TMEM192 reduced the TIG1-mediated upregulation of autophagic activity. Furthermore, silencing of either TIG1 or TMEM192 led to alleviation of the upregulation of autophagy induced by all-trans retinoic acid. Our results demonstrate that the expression of TIG1 leads to cell autophagy through TMEM192. Our study also suggests that TIG1 and TMEM192 play an important role in the all-trans retinoic acid-mediated upregulation of autophagic activity.
27987679	Ursolic acid liposomes with chitosan modification: Promising antitumor drug delivery and efficacy.	There are tremendous challenges on antitumor and its therapeutic drugs, and preparation of highly efficient nano-vehicles represents one of the novel topics in antitumor pharmaceutical field. Herein, the novel chitosan-coated ursolic acid (UA) liposome (CS-UA-L) was efficiently prepared with highly tumor targeting, drug controlled release and low side-effect. The CS-UA-L was uniformly spherical particles with diameter of ~130nm, and the size was more easily trapped into the tumor tissues. Chitosan modification can make liposomes carrying positive charges, which were inclined to combine with the negative charges on the surface of tumor cells, and then the CS-UA-L could release UA rapidly at pH5.0 comparing with pH7.4. Meanwhile, the CS-UA-L exhibited obvious anti-proliferative effect (76.46%) on HeLa cells and significantly antitumor activity (61.26%) in mice bearing U14 cervical cancer. The tumor tissues of CS-UA-L treated mice had enhanced cell apoptosis, extensive necrosis and low cell proliferation activity. These results demonstrated that the multifunctional CS-UA-L allowed a precision treatment for localized tumor, and reducing the total drug dose and side-effect, which hold a great promise in new safe and effective tumor therapy.
27986539	Antihistamines as promising drugs in cancer therapy.	Histamine is a biogenic amine, synthetized and released by mast cells, which acts as a vasodilator in several pathologic processes, namely in allergies and conjunctivitis. Its role on cancer is not fully understood. High levels of histamine have been associated with a bivalent behavior in regulation of several tumors (i.e. cervical, ovarian, vaginal, uterine, vulvar, colorectal cancer, and melanoma), promoting or inhibiting their growth. Histamine receptors (H1, H2, H3 and H4) are present in a vast group of cells, including tumor cells, making them sensitive to histamine variations. In this work, we review the role of mast cells and histamine on cancer development and the possibility of use antihistamines in the clinical management of this disease.
27977639	Leading Causes of Cancer Mortality - Caribbean Region, 2003-2013.	Cancer is one of the leading causes of deaths worldwide (1); in 2012, an estimated 65% of all cancer deaths occurred in the less developed regions of the world (2). In the Caribbean region, cancer is the second leading cause of mortality, with an estimated 87,430 cancer-related deaths reported in 2012 (3). The Pan American Health Organization defines the Caribbean region as a group of 27 countries that vary in size, geography, resources, and surveillance systems.* CDC calculated site- and sex-specific proportions of cancer deaths and age-standardized mortality rates (ASMR) for 21 English- and Dutch-speaking Caribbean countries, the United States, and two U.S. territories (Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands [USVI]), using the most recent 5 years of mortality data available from each jurisdiction during 2003-2013. The selection of years varied by availability of the data from the countries and territories in 2015. ASMR for all cancers combined ranged from 46.1 to 139.3 per 100,000. Among males, prostate cancers were the leading cause of cancer deaths, followed by lung cancers; the percentage of cancer deaths attributable to prostate cancer ranged from 18.4% in Suriname to 47.4% in Dominica, and the percentage of cancer deaths attributable to lung cancer ranged from 5.6% in Barbados to 24.4% in Bermuda. Among females, breast cancer was the most common cause of cancer deaths, ranging from 14.0% of cancer deaths in Belize to 29.7% in the Cayman Islands, followed by cervical cancer. Several of the leading causes of cancer deaths in the Caribbean can be reduced through primary and secondary preventions, including prevention of exposure to risk factors, screening, early detection, and timely and effective treatment.
27977543	Preinvasive and Invasive Cervical Adenocarcinoma: Preceding Low-Risk or Negative Pap Result Increases Time to Diagnosis.	OBJECTIVES: The aims of the study were to investigate screening histories of women with adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS) and adenocarcinoma (AdCa) of the cervix and to further evaluate screening for glandular disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Screening histories were retrospectively collected for patients with AIS or AdCa at a single large-volume academic institution from 2005 to 2015. Fisher exact and Wilcoxon rank sum tests were used to compare AIS with AdCa patient characteristics, distribution of preceding Pap (i.e., trigger Pap) results, and high-risk human papillomavirus testing. The association between Pap result and time to diagnosis was evaluated. RESULTS: Eighty-seven cases, 50 AIS and 37 AdCa, met study criteria; median age was 31 and 43 years, respectively. Among the AIS cohort, 52.0% had a negative or low-risk trigger Pap result versus 24.3% of those with AdCa (p = .001). The time to diagnosis of AIS ranged from 8.4 to 18.8 weeks for those with high- versus low-risk or negative trigger Pap results, respectively (p = .002). The time to diagnosis of AdCa ranged from 14.6 to 44.7 weeks for those with high- versus low-risk or negative trigger Pap results, respectively (p = .003). Among those with high-risk human papillomavirus testing, 89.7% tested positive at the time of trigger Pap with 100% positivity among those with low-risk or negative trigger Pap results. CONCLUSIONS: Cervical AIS and AdCa affect many young nulliparous women and commonly preceded by low-risk or negative Pap testing. The interval to diagnosis increases with low-risk and negative Pap results, and therefore, further investigation into optimal screening for glandular lesions is needed.
27977541	Loop Electrosurgical Excision Procedure Instead of Cold-Knife Conization for Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia in Women With Unsatisfactory Colposcopic Examinations: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.	OBJECTIVES: This meta-analysis compared loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP) with cold-knife conization (CKC) for treating cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) in patients with unsatisfactory colposcopic examinations. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A literature search on MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Systematic Reviews, CENTRAL, Web of Science, and Scopus databases was conducted from inception until April 2015. We included clinical trials and cohort studies comparing CKC with LEEP for treating CIN. The primary outcome was a combined end point of persistent CIN (<6 months after conization) and recurrent CIN (>6 months). Secondary outcomes included procedural, pathologic, and long-term outcomes. Pooled relative risk (RR) and weighted mean difference (WMD) were used to report binary and continuous outcomes, respectively. RESULTS: Among 26 studies, the incidence of persistent and recurrent disease after LEEP was comparable with that after CKC (15.6% vs 7.38%; RR = 1.35; 95% CI = 1.00-1.81). Loop electrosurgical excision procedure was faster, caused less intraoperative bleeding, and resulted in shorter hospital stay (WMD, 9.5 minutes [95% CI = 6.4-12.6 minutes]; WMD, 42.4 mL [95% CI = 21.3-106 mL]; and WMD, 1.5 days [95% CI = 1.1-1.8 days], respectively). Loop electrosurgical excision procedure cones were shallower with overall less volume and weight than CKC (WMD, 5.1 mm [95% CI = 3.2-7.1 mm]; 2.6 mm [95% CI = 0.6-5.7 mm]; and 2.6 g [95% CI = 1.4-3.7 g], respectively). During follow-up, LEEP was associated with less cervical stenosis and fewer unsatisfactory examinations; however, this was not statistically significant (RR, 0.5 [95% CI = 0.1-1.5]; RR, 0.7 [95% CI = 0.4-1.2], respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Loop electrosurgical excision procedure is an acceptable alternative to CKC in women with CIN and unsatisfactory colposcopic examinations. Close follow-up is necessary for prompt detection and treatment of persistent or recurrent disease.
27977253	Reducing disparities and achieving equity in African American women's health.	The colloquial phrase "Black Don't Crack" refers to perceptions of African American women retaining youthful features over time and seemingly defying the aging process. This conjecture appears to only be skin deep, as across almost every health indicator, African American women fare worse than women in other racial/ethnic groups. African American women experience excess morbidity in obesity, diabetes, and adverse birth outcomes, and are more likely than women of other ethnic groups to die from breast and cervical cancer, cardiovascular disease, and HIV/AIDS. This article provides an overview of social, biological, psychological, and cultural factors that contribute to African American women's health. Attention is directed to cultural factors that are both protective and risky for African American women's health. There is a need to garner a better understanding of the complex nature of health disparities experienced by African American women in order to move the field forward in making progress toward achieving health equity for this population. This article addresses this need and offers recommendations for translating science in this area into meaningful population level impact. (PsycINFO Database Record
27974927	Development of new immunotherapy treatments in different cancer types.	Cancer immunotherapy involves the use of therapeutic modalities that determine a manipulation of the immune system by using immune agents such as cytokines, vaccines, cell therapies and humoral, transfection agents. Immunotherapy of cancer has to stimulate the host's anti-tumor response by increasing the effector cell number and the production of soluble mediators and decrease the host's suppressor mechanisms by inducing tumor killing environment and by modulating immune checkpoints. Immunotherapy seems to work better in more immunogenic tumors. Making a review of literature, the article presents the new immunologic treatments in cancers less presented in the latest conferences, cancers in which, immunotherapy is still under investigation. Bladder cancer was the first indication for which immunotherapy was used in 1970. A promising clinical research in bladder cancer is the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors. Although breast cancer is considered immunologically silent, several preclinical and clinical studies suggested that immunotherapy has the potential to improve the clinical outcomes for patients with breast cancer. Cervical cancer, brain cancer, head and neck cancer and colorectal and esophageal cancers are cancer types for which new immune-based cancer treatments are currently under development. Recent agents used in clinical trials will be described in before mentioned cancers.
27973724	Investigations on Antioxidant, Antiproliferative and COX-2 Inhibitory Potential of Alkaloids from Anthocephalus cadamba (Roxb.) Miq. Leaves.	In the present study, an ayurvedic medicinal plant, Anthocephalus cadamba (Roxb.) Miq. commonly known as 'Kadamb' was explored for its potential against oxidative stress and cancer. The fractions namely AC-4 and ACALK (alkaloid rich fraction) were isolated from A. cadamba leaves by employing two different isolation methods and evaluated for their in vitro antioxidant and antiproliferative activity. The structure of the isolated AC-4 was characterized tentatively as dihydrocadambine by using various spectroscopic techniques such as ESI-QTOF-MS, 1 H- and 13 C-NMR, DEPT, COSY, HMQC, and HMBC. Results of various antioxidant assays viz. 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), ABTS cation radical, superoxide anion radical scavenging, and plasmid nicking assay demonstrated that both the fractions viz. AC-4 and ACALK possess ability to scavenge DPPH, ABTS radicals and effectively protected plasmid pBR322 DNA from damage caused by hydroxyl radicals. Further, when both fractions were evaluated for their potential to suppress growth of HeLa and COLO 205 cells, only ACALK fraction showed antiproliferative effects. ACALK exhibited GI50 of 205.98 and 99.54 mug/ml in HeLa and COLO 205 cell lines, respectively. Results of Hoechst staining in cervical carcinoma (HeLa) cells confirmed that ACALK induced cell death in HeLa cells via apoptotic mode. Both the fractions also inhibited COX-2 enzyme activity.
27966750	Acidic and basic fibroblast growth factor expression levels in cervical cancer and their effects on tumor cell proliferation.	Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) play important roles in angiogenesis, wound healing, embryonic development, and endocrine signaling pathways. Increasingly, recent studies have reported aberrant FGF expression in various malignancies. However, the involvement of FGFs in cervical carcinoma pathogenesis remains unclear. We aimed to investigate expression of acidic (aFGF) and basic FGF (bFGF) in patients with this disease, and assess their effects on cervical cancer cell proliferation. Twenty cervical cancer patients and 10 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) patients were recruited, and 10 cancer-free individuals were included as controls. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and western blotting were employed to detect FGF mRNA and protein levels, respectively. Furthermore, HeLa cells were treated with FGFs and subjected to thiazolyl blue tetrazolium bromide assays to quantify proliferation. Compared with CIN and normal cervical tissues, aFGF and bFGF mRNA and protein levels were significantly elevated in cervical carcinomas (P < 0.05). CIN tissues exhibited higher expression of these FGFs than normal tissues (P < 0.05). Moreover, their mRNA levels were increased in advanced cancer stages (P < 0.05), although no significant difference was detected between tumors of different differentiation grades in this regard (P > 0.05). HeLa cell proliferation increased in an aFGF- and bFGF-dose-dependent manner (P < 0.05), the latter exerting a more potent proliferative influence, with its effect peaking at 75 ng/mL. aFGF and bFGF were highly expressed in cervical cancer tissues and their levels positively correlated with clinical stage. Both facilitate proliferation of cervical carcinoma cells and are implicated in cancer pathogenesis and progression.
27960229	Automated telephone communication systems for preventive healthcare and management of long-term conditions.	BACKGROUND: Automated telephone communication systems (ATCS) can deliver voice messages and collect health-related information from patients using either their telephone's touch-tone keypad or voice recognition software. ATCS can supplement or replace telephone contact between health professionals and patients. There are four different types of ATCS: unidirectional (one-way, non-interactive voice communication), interactive voice response (IVR) systems, ATCS with additional functions such as access to an expert to request advice (ATCS Plus) and multimodal ATCS, where the calls are delivered as part of a multicomponent intervention. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of ATCS for preventing disease and managing long-term conditions on behavioural change, clinical, process, cognitive, patient-centred and adverse outcomes. SEARCH METHODS: We searched 10 electronic databases (the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials; MEDLINE; Embase; PsycINFO; CINAHL; Global Health; WHOLIS; LILACS; Web of Science; and ASSIA); three grey literature sources (Dissertation Abstracts, Index to Theses, Australasian Digital Theses); and two trial registries (www.controlled-trials.com; www.clinicaltrials.gov) for papers published between 1980 and June 2015. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised, cluster- and quasi-randomised trials, interrupted time series and controlled before-and-after studies comparing ATCS interventions, with any control or another ATCS type were eligible for inclusion. Studies in all settings, for all consumers/carers, in any preventive healthcare or long term condition management role were eligible. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used standard Cochrane methods to select and extract data and to appraise eligible studies. MAIN RESULTS: We included 132 trials (N = 4,669,689). Studies spanned across several clinical areas, assessing many comparisons based on evaluation of different ATCS types and variable comparison groups. Forty-one studies evaluated ATCS for delivering preventive healthcare, 84 for managing long-term conditions, and seven studies for appointment reminders. We downgraded our certainty in the evidence primarily because of the risk of bias for many outcomes. We judged the risk of bias arising from allocation processes to be low for just over half the studies and unclear for the remainder. We considered most studies to be at unclear risk of performance or detection bias due to blinding, while only 16% of studies were at low risk. We generally judged the risk of bias due to missing data and selective outcome reporting to be unclear.For preventive healthcare, ATCS (ATCS Plus, IVR, unidirectional) probably increase immunisation uptake in children (risk ratio (RR) 1.25, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.18 to 1.32; 5 studies, N = 10,454; moderate certainty) and to a lesser extent in adolescents (RR 1.06, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.11; 2 studies, N = 5725; moderate certainty). The effects of ATCS in adults are unclear (RR 2.18, 95% CI 0.53 to 9.02; 2 studies, N = 1743; very low certainty).For screening, multimodal ATCS increase uptake of screening for breast cancer (RR 2.17, 95% CI 1.55 to 3.04; 2 studies, N = 462; high certainty) and colorectal cancer (CRC) (RR 2.19, 95% CI 1.88 to 2.55; 3 studies, N = 1013; high certainty) versus usual care. It may also increase osteoporosis screening. ATCS Plus interventions probably slightly increase cervical cancer screening (moderate certainty), but effects on osteoporosis screening are uncertain. IVR systems probably increase CRC screening at 6 months (RR 1.36, 95% CI 1.25 to 1.48; 2 studies, N = 16,915; moderate certainty) but not at 9 to 12 months, with probably little or no effect of IVR (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.99, 1.11; 2 studies, 2599 participants; moderate certainty) or unidirectional ATCS on breast cancer screening.Appointment reminders delivered through IVR or unidirectional ATCS may improve attendance rates compared with no calls (low certainty). For long-term management, medication or laboratory test adherence provided the most general evidence across conditions (25 studies, data not combined). Multimodal ATCS versus usual care showed conflicting effects (positive and uncertain) on medication adherence. ATCS Plus probably slightly (versus control; moderate certainty) or probably (versus usual care; moderate certainty) improves medication adherence but may have little effect on adherence to tests (versus control). IVR probably slightly improves medication adherence versus control (moderate certainty). Compared with usual care, IVR probably improves test adherence and slightly increases medication adherence up to six months but has little or no effect at longer time points (moderate certainty). Unidirectional ATCS, compared with control, may have little effect or slightly improve medication adherence (low certainty). The evidence suggested little or no consistent effect of any ATCS type on clinical outcomes (blood pressure control, blood lipids, asthma control, therapeutic coverage) related to adherence, but only a small number of studies contributed clinical outcome data.The above results focus on areas with the most general findings across conditions. In condition-specific areas, the effects of ATCS varied, including by the type of ATCS intervention in use.Multimodal ATCS probably decrease both cancer pain and chronic pain as well as depression (moderate certainty), but other ATCS types were less effective. Depending on the type of intervention, ATCS may have small effects on outcomes for physical activity, weight management, alcohol consumption, and diabetes mellitus. ATCS have little or no effect on outcomes related to heart failure, hypertension, mental health or smoking cessation, and there is insufficient evidence to determine their effects for preventing alcohol/substance misuse or managing illicit drug addiction, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, HIV/AIDS, hypercholesterolaemia, obstructive sleep apnoea, spinal cord dysfunction or psychological stress in carers.Only four trials (3%) reported adverse events, and it was unclear whether these were related to the interventions. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: ATCS interventions can change patients' health behaviours, improve clinical outcomes and increase healthcare uptake with positive effects in several important areas including immunisation, screening, appointment attendance, and adherence to medications or tests. The decision to integrate ATCS interventions in routine healthcare delivery should reflect variations in the certainty of the evidence available and the size of effects across different conditions, together with the varied nature of ATCS interventions assessed. Future research should investigate both the content of ATCS interventions and the mode of delivery; users' experiences, particularly with regard to acceptability; and clarify which ATCS types are most effective and cost-effective.
27959427	Inhibiting the cytoplasmic location of HMGB1 reverses cisplatin resistance in human cervical cancer cells.	Cervical cancer is the fourth most common malignancy in women worldwide, and resistance to chemotherapy drugs is the biggest obstacle in the treatment of cervical cancers. In the present study, the molecular mechanisms underlying cisplatin resistance in human cervical cancer cells were investigated. When human cervical cancer cells were treated with 10 microg/ml of cisplatin for 24 and 48 h, high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) protein expression levels significantly increased in a timedependent manner. Comparisons between cisplatinsensitive HeLa cells and cisplatinresistant HeLa/DDP cells revealed higher levels of HMGB1 in HeLa/DDP cells than in HeLa cells. Additionally, the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) value for cisplatin in HeLa/DDP cells was 5.3fold that in HeLa cells. Analysis of the distribution of cellular components revealed that HMGB1 translocation from the nucleus to cytoplasm contributed to cisplatin resistance. This was further confirmed by demonstration that ethyl pyruvate treatment suppressed the cytoplasmic translocation of HMGB1, resulting in inhibition of HeLa cell proliferation. Furthermore, endogenous HMGB1 was inhibited with HMGB1specific short hairpin (sh)RNA, and MTT assay results showed that interference with HMGB1 expression reduced cell viability and potentially reversed cisplatin resistance in HeLa cells. Transfection with HMGB1 shRNA was demonstrated to induce cell apoptosis in HeLa cells, as detected by FACS analysis. In addition, administration of recombinant HMGB1 protein in HeLa cells promoted cell autophagy, mediated by the phosphorylation of extracellular signalregulated kinase 1/2. Thus, cytoplasmic HMGB1 translocation and HMGB1induced cell autophagy are proposed to contribute to cisplatin resistance by inhibiting apoptosis of cervical cancer cells. HMGB1 could, therefore, represent a novel therapeutic target for, and a diagnostic marker of, chemotherapy resistant cervical cancers.
27941714	Inhibition of Cervical Cancer by Promoting IGFBP7 Expression Using Ellagic Acid from Pomegranate Peel.	BACKGROUND The aim of this study was to explore the mechanism by which cervical cancer is inhibited by promoting IGFBP7 expression using ellagic acid from pomegranate peel extract. MATERIAL AND METHODS HeLa cells were divided into 6 groups: control group (NC), blank control group (BL), and IGFBP7 overexpression group (IGFBP7), and 2.5 uM, 5. 0 uM, and 10.0 uM ellagic acid-treated groups. The cell proliferation ability was detected and the degree of invasion in the 6 groups was measured by Transwell assay. The expression levels of IGFBP7 and AKT/mTOR in the 6 groups of cells were detected by RT-PCR technique. RESULTS Compared with NC and BL groups, The IGFBP7 gene expressions of the IGFPB7 and ellagic acid-treated groups were significantly increased (P<0.05). There was a dose-effect dependence in the ellagic acid-treated groups. The invasion ability of the IGFBP7 group and ellagic acid-treated groups was significantly lower than that of NC and BL groups in HeLa cells (P<0.05). The apoptosis rate of the IGFBP7 group and ellagic acid-treated groups was significantly higher than that of the NC and BL groups in HeLa cells (P<0.05). AKT and mTOR mRNA and protein expressions of the IGFBP7 group and ellagic acid-treated groups were significantly lower than that of the NC and BL groups (P<0.05). There was a dose-effect dependence in the ellagic acid-treated groups. CONCLUSIONS The ellagic acid in pomegranate peel extract can inhibit the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway by enhancing the expression level of IGFBP7, which can inhibit the HeLa cells in cervical cancer.
27933466	microRNA-145 modulates epithelial-mesenchymal transition and suppresses proliferation, migration and invasion by targeting SIP1 in human cervical cancer cells.	PURPOSE: Previously, it has been reported that microRNA-145 (miR-145) is lowly expressed in human cervical cancers and that its putative tumour suppressive role may be attributed to epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) regulation. Here, we aimed to assess whether miR-145 may affect EMT-associated markers/genes and suppress cervical cancer growth and motility, and to provide a mechanistic basis for these phenomena. METHODS: The identification of the SMAD-interacting protein 1 (SIP1) mRNA as putative miR-145 target was investigated using a 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) luciferase assay and Western blotting, respectively. The functional effects of exogenous miR-145 expression, miR-145 suppression or siRNA-mediated SIP1 expression down-regulation in cervical cancer-derived C33A and SiHa cells were analysed using Western blotting, BrdU incorporation (proliferation), transwell migration and invasion assays. In addition, the expression levels of miR-145 and SIP1 were determined in primary human cervical cancer and non-cancer tissue samples using qRT-PCR. RESULTS: We found that miR-145 binds to the wild-type 3'UTR of SIP1, but not to its mutant counterpart, and that, through this binding, miR-145 can effectively down-regulate SIP1 expression. In addition, we found that exogenous miR-145 expression or siRNA-mediated down-regulation of SIP1 expression attenuates the proliferation, migration and invasion of C33A and SiHa cells and alters the expression of the EMT-associated markers CDH1, VIM and SNAI1, whereas inhibition of endogenous miR-145 expression elicited the opposite effects. The expression of miR-145 in cervical cancer tissue samples was found to be low, while that of SIP1 was found to be high compared to non-cancerous cervical tissues. An inverse expression correlation between the two was substantiated through the anlaysis of data deposited in the TCGA database. CONCLUSION: Our data indicate that low miR-145 expression levels in conjunction with elevated SIP1 expression levels may contribute to cervical cancer development. MiR-145-mediated regulation of SIP1 provides a novel mechanistic basis for its tumour suppressive mode of action in human cervical cancer cells.

27931835	Management of patients with recurrent/advanced cervical cancer beyond first line platinum regimens: Where do we stand? A literature review.	BACKGROUND: Cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer affecting women worldwide. Despite advances in screening and human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination, a significant number of women present with or develop advanced disease. Palliative platinum-based chemotherapy (CT) is the standard first-line treatment for metastatic/recurrent cervical cancer. The prognosis remains poor and effective second line options are urgently needed. METHODS: We searched the English-language medical literature as well as relevant guideline databases, published from January 1981 to December 2015 and identified publications related to cervical cancer and its therapies. Our effort was to highlight the available treatment options in the setting of recurrent/metastatic disease. RESULTS: Although there have been important advances in the management of women with cervical cancer, the optimal treatment for patients with locally recurrent and metastatic disease after platinum failure is still problematic. Overall, there is a trend in terms of longer overall survival (OS) and better quality of life for the combination of cisplatin/paclitaxel (PC) as compared to the doublets of cisplatin/topotecan (TC), cisplatin/vinorelbine (VC), and cisplatin/gemcitabine (GC). Currently available single agents beyond first-line platinum-based therapy have limited efficacy in this setting and include topoisomerase inhibitors, vinca alkaloids, taxanes, alkylating agents and antimetabolites. Several targeted therapies have demonstrated activity in advanced cervical cancer. Bevacizumab has been evaluated in a phase III trial using doublets of cisplatin with paclitaxel or topotecan and has been approved in the first-line setting by the U. S. Food and Drug Administration. Selective targeting of angiogenic kinases by tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) may represent a novel therapeutic tool in this setting, but its use alone or in combination with CT is still investigational. Early reports have implicated PI3KCA somatic mutations suggesting that mTOR-targeted agents should be explored in this disease. Development of the immune checkpoint programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) and T-lymphocyte-associated molecule-4 (CTLA-4) inhibitors have been of considerable interest, leading to ongoing phase II studies in patients with advanced cervical cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Progress in the management of recurrent and advanced cervical cancer patients has been slow and restricted to palliative intent. These patients should be considered for clinical trials of novel targeted agents and/or immunotherapy.
27931828	Targeting mTOR pathway in gynecological malignancies: Biological rationale and systematic review of published data.	BACKGROUND: mTOR inhibitors are widely used in different malignancies with several trials testing their efficacy and safety in gynecological malignancies. We aimed to review the current evidence that support the expansion of using such drugs in the treatment of advanced gynecological cancers. METHODS: A comprehensive systematic review of literature has been conducted to include prospective trials that used everolimus, temsirolimus or ridaforolimus in the management of gynecological cancers and have available efficacy and toxicity results. RESULTS: A total of 23 studies including 980 patients were considered eligible for our review. Our review included 16 phase II and 7 phase I studies with the majority of patients having uterine cancers. Regarding Endometrial cancer, the CBR ranged from 21% to 60% and median PFS from 2.8 months to 7.3 months. In Ovarian cancers, CBR ranged from 24% to 50% and median PFS from 3.2 months to 5.9 months. In the single phase II study in cervical cancer the CBR was 61% and median PFS was 3.5 months. The toxicity profile was consistent with what was observed previously in other malignancies with fatigue, mucositis, and hematological toxicities being the most common adverse events observed. CONCLUSION: mTOR inhibitors seem to be a promising option in the second line management of advanced gynecological cancers with best safety and efficacy outcomes when given as a single agent or in combination with hormonal treatment. More research is needed for better patient selection.
27930529	Effects of propofol and sevoflurane on perioperative immune response in patients undergoing laparoscopic radical hysterectomy for cervical cancer.	The aim of this study is to compare the effects of propofol and sevoflurane anesthesia on perioperative immune response in patients undergoing laparoscopic radical hysterectomy for cervical cancer.Sixty patients with cervical cancer scheduled for elective laparoscopic radical hysterectomy under general anesthesia were randomized into 2 groups. TIVA group received propofol induction and maintenance and SEVO group received sevoflurane induction and maintenance. Blood samples were collected at 30 min before induction (T0); the end of the operation (T1); and 24 h (T2), 48 h (T3), and 72 h (T4) after operation. The T lymphocyte subsets (including CD3+ cells, CD4+ cells, and CD8+ cells) and CD4+/CD8+ ratio, natural killer (NK) cells, and B lymphocytes were analyzed by flow cytometry.After surgery, all immunological indicators except CD8+ cells were significantly decreased in both groups compared to basal levels in T0, and the counts of CD3+ cells, CD4+ cells, NK cells, and the CD4+/CD8+ ratios were significantly lower in the SEVO groups than that in the TIVA group. However, the numbers of B cells were comparable at all the time points between 2 groups.Laparoscopic radical hysterectomy for cervical cancer is associated with postoperative lymphopenia. In terms of protecting circulating lymphocytes, propofol is superior to sevoflurane.
27929515	An innovative method to acquire the location of point A for cervical cancer treatment by HDR brachytherapy.	Brachytherapy of local cervical cancer is generally accomplished through film-based treatment planning with the prescription directed to point A, which is invisible on images and is located at a high-dose gradient area. Through a standard reconstruction method by digitizing film points, the location error for point A would be 3mm with a condition of 30 degrees curvature tandem, which is 10 degrees away from the gantry rotation axis of a simulator, and has an 8.7 cm interval between the flange and the isocenter. To reduce the location error of the reconstructed point A, this paper proposes a method and demonstrates its accuracy. The Cartesian coordinates of point A were derived by acquiring the locations of the cervical os (tandem flange) and a dummy seed located in the tandem above the flange. To verify this analytical method, ball marks in a commercial "Isocentric Beam Checker" were selected to simulate the two points A, the os, and the dummies. The Checker was placed on the simulator couch with its center ball coincident with the simulator isocenter and its rotation axis perpendicular to the gantry rotation axis. With different combinations of the Checker and couch rotation angles, the orthogonal films were shot and all coor-dinates of the selected points were reconstructed through the treatment planning system and compared with that calculated through the analytical method. The position uncertainty and the deviation prediction of point A were also evaluated. With a good choice of the reference dummy point, the position deviations of point A obtained through this analytical method were found to be generally within 1 mm, with the standard uncertainty less than 0.5 mm. In summary, this new method is a practical and accurate tool for clinical usage to acquire the accurate location of point A for the treatment of cervical cancer patient.
27929505	A comprehensive evaluation of adaptive daily planning for cervical cancer HDR brachytherapy.	The purpose of this study was to evaluate adaptive daily planning for cervi-cal cancer patients who underwent high-dose-rate intracavitary brachytherapy (HDR-BT) using comprehensive interfractional organ motion measurements. This study included 22 cervical cancer patients who underwent 5 fractions of HDR-BT. Regions of interest (ROIs) including high-risk clinical tumor volume (HR-CTV) and organs at risk (OARs) were manually contoured on daily CT images. All patients were clinically treated with adaptive daily plans (ADP), which involved ROI delineation and dose optimization at each treatment fraction. Single treatment plans (SP) were retrospectively generated by applying the first treatment fraction's dwell times adjusted for decay and dwell positions of the applicator to subsequent treatment fractions. Various existing similarity metrics were calculated for the ROIs to quantify interfractional organ variations. A novel similarity (JRARM) score was established, which combined both volumetric overlap metrics (DSC, JSC, and RVD) and distance metrics (ASD, MSD, and RMSD). Linear regression was performed to determine a relationship between interfractional organ varia-tions of various similarity metrics and D2cc variations from both plans. Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were used to assess ADP and SP by comparing EQD2 D2cc (alpha/beta = 3) for OARs. For interfractional organ variations, the sigmoid demonstrated the greatest variations based on the JRARM, DSC, and RMSD metrics. Comparisons between paired ROIs showed differences in metrics at each treatment fraction. RVD, MSD, and RMSD were found to be significantly correlated to D2cc varia-tions for bladder and sigmoid. The comparison between plans found ADP provided lower EQD2 D2cc of OARs than SP. Specifically, the sigmoid demonstrated sta-tistically significant dose variations (p = 0.015). Substantial interfractional organ motion occurs during HDR-BT based on comprehensive measurements and may significantly affect D2cc of OARs. Adaptive daily planning provides improved dose sparing for OARs compared to single planning with the extent of sparing being different among OARs.
27929482	Anatomy-based definition of point A utilizing three-dimensional volumetric imaging approach for high-dose-rate (HDR) intracavitary brachytherapy dose prescription when treating cervical cancer using limited resources.	This study was designed to determine whether volumetric imaging could identify consistent alternative prescription methods to Manchester/point A when prescribing radiation dose in the treatment of cervical cancer using HDR intracavitary brachy-therapy (ICBT). One hundred and twenty-five treatment plans of 25 patients treated for carcinoma of the cervix were reviewed retrospectively. Each patient received 5 fractions of HDR ICBT following initial cisplatin-based pelvic chemoradiation, and radiation dose was originally prescribed to point A (ICRU-38). The gross tumor volume (GTV) and high-risk clinical target volume (HR-CTV) were contoured in three dimensions on the CT datasets, and inferior-superior, anterior-posterior, and left-right dimensions HR-CTV were recorded along with multiple anatomic and skeletal dimensions for each patient. The least square-best fit regression lines were plotted between one half of the HR-CTV width and pelvic cavity dimension at femoral head level and at maximum cavity dimension. The points in both plots lie reasonably close to straight lines and are well defined by straight lines with slopes of 0.15 and 0.17; intercept on y-axes of -0.08 and -0.03, point A, at the same level as defined based on applicator coordinates, is defined using this correlation, which is a function of distance between femoral heads/dimensions of maximum pelvic cavity width. Both relations, defined by straight lines, provide an estimated location of point A, which provides adequate coverage to the HR-CTV compared to the point A defined based on applicator coordinates. The point A defined based on femoral head distance would, therefore, be a reasonable surrogate to use for dose prescription because of subjective variation of cavity width dimension. Simple surrogate anatomic/skeletal landmarks can be useful for prescribing radiation dose when treating cervical cancer using intracavitary brachytherapy in limited-resource settings. Our ongoing work will continue to refine these models.
27928856	Locally advanced carcinoma of the cervix associated with pelvic kidney treated with intensity-modulated radiotherapy: Overcoming a therapeutic challenge.	The simultaneous occurrence of carcinoma of the cervix and pelvic kidney is rare. As the pelvic kidney occupies the conventional radiation portal for carcinoma of the cervix, treatment of these patients with radiation presents a therapeutic challenge. A 48-year-old stage IIIB cervical carcinoma patient with an incidental diagnosis of pelvic kidney was treated with radical chemoradiotherapy using intensity-modulated radiotherapy with concurrent weekly cisplatin, followed by intracavitary radiotherapy. The bilateral kidney dose was restricted within a tolerance limit of 16.6 Gy. At the 18-month follow-up, the patient was disease free and had no deterioration in kidney function. Intensity-modulated radiotherapy provided the necessary means for delivering radical radiation doses in this case scenario with adequate sparing of the kidney.
27922905	Scale-Up of an Human Papillomavirus Testing Implementation Program in El Salvador.	OBJECTIVE: The Cervical Cancer Prevention in El Salvador is a demonstration project to introduce a lower-cost human papillomavirus (HPV)-DNA test into a public sector project. Started in October 2012, The Cervical Cancer Prevention in El Salvador consists of 3 phases and will ultimately screen 30,000 women. Results of phase 2 of the project are presented. The objective of this project was to compare colposcopy and noncolposcopy-based management for HPV-positive women. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In phase 2, a total of 8,050 women, aged 30 to 49 years, were screened; 6,761 provided both self- and provider-collected specimens and 1,289 provided only provider-testing specimens. HPV results from self-collected specimens were not used in clinical management decisions. Women with provider-collected HPV-positive results were treated based on the strategy assigned to their community; the strategy was colposcopy management (CM) or screen-and-treat (ST) management if they were cryotherapy eligible or colposcopy if not eligible. Outcomes were assessed 6 months after screening. RESULTS: Overall, 489 (12.3%) of 3,963 women receiving CM and 465 (11.4%) of 4,087 women receiving ST tested HPV positive. In the CM cohort, 216 (44.2%) of 489 completed their intervention (203 treated, 11 diagnosed negative, 2 pregnant). In the ST cohort, 411 (88.4%) of 465 completed their intervention (407 treated, 2 diagnosed negative, 1 pregnant). Overall agreement between HPV test results from self-collected and provider-collected specimens was 93.7%, with a kappa value of 0.70 (95% CI = 0.68-0.73). CONCLUSIONS: Human papillomavirus testing with ST management resulted in an approximately twice completion rate compared with CM management. Agreement between self- and provider-based sampling was good and might be used to extend screening to women in areas that are more difficult to reach.
27922769	See, Test & Treat: A 5-Year Experience of Pathologists Driving Cervical and Breast Cancer Screening to Underserved and Underinsured Populations.	CONTEXT: - See, Test & Treat is a pathologist-driven program to provide cervical and breast cancer screening to underserved and underinsured patient populations. This program is largely funded by the CAP Foundation (College of American Pathologists, Northfield, Illinois) and is a collaborative effort among several medical specialties united to address gaps in the current health care system. OBJECTIVE: - To provide an outline for administering a See, Test & Treat program, using an academic medical center as a model for providing care and collating the results of 5 years of data on the See, Test & Treat program's findings. DESIGN: - Sources include data from patients seen at Tufts Medical Center (Boston, Massachusetts) who presented to the See, Test & Treat program and institutional data between 2010 and 2014 detailing the outline of how to organize and operationalize a volunteer cancer-screening program. RESULTS: - During the 5-year course of the program, 203 women were provided free cervical and breast cancer screening. Of the 169 patients who obtained Papanicolaou screening, 36 (21.3%) had abnormal Papanicolaou tests. In addition, 16 of 130 patients (12.3%) who underwent mammography had abnormal findings. CONCLUSIONS: - In general, women from ethnic populations have barriers that prevent them from participating in cancer screening. However, the CAP Foundation's See, Test & Treat program is designed to reduce those barriers for these women by providing care that addresses cultural, financial, and practical issues. Although screening programs are helpful in identifying those who need further treatment, obtaining further treatment for these patients continues to be a challenge.
27921286	18F-FDG PET/CT to differentiate malignant necrotic lymph node from benign cystic lesions in the neck.	OBJECTIVE: Patients presenting with cystic lesions in the neck without obvious signs of malignancy constitute a diagnostic challenge since fine needle aspiration is often insufficient and a diagnosis may not be reached until surgical resection/biopsy is performed. The differential diagnosis of a cystic cervical mass comprises a variety of benign conditions, but malignancy must be ruled out. We examined the diagnostic performance of fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) PET/CT to identify malignancy. METHODS: We retrospectively included consecutive patients referred from the Department of ENT Head and Neck Surgery for 18F-FDG PET/CT-scans because of a solitary neck cyst. Scan results were compared to histopathology and follow-up. RESULTS: The study comprised 58 patients. Twenty patients (34%) were diagnosed with cancer during follow-up. PET/CT suggested malignancy in 34 patients (19 true positive, 15 false positive) and showed no malignancy in 24 (23 true negative, 1 false negative). The sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive and negative predictive values were 95% (76-99%), 61% (45-74%), 72% (60-82%), 56% (39-71%), and 96% (80-99%), respectively (95% confidence intervals in brackets). The primary tumor was identified in 14 out of the 20 patients with confirmed cancer. Increased metabolism, as evaluated by PET, was the only imaging characteristic among several others, which associated independently with malignancy in the cystic neck lesions, odds ratio 1.27 (1.07-1.50), p = 0.006. CONCLUSION: 18F-FDG PET/CT could reliably rule out malignancy (NPV 96%), albeit with a high frequency of false positive scans, requiring further diagnostic work-up. Increased metabolism was the best imaging parameter to differentiate between malignant and benign lesions.
27919962	Ascorbyl Stearate Promotes Apoptosis Through Intrinsic Mitochondrial Pathway in HeLa Cancer Cells.	BACKGROUND: Ascorbic acid is proposed to have antitumor potential against certain cancer types but has the limitation of requiring high doses for treating cancer. Ascorbyl stearate (ASC-S) is a fatty acid ester derivative of ascorbic acid with comparable potent apoptotic activity. The present study was aimed at understanding the pathway involved in apoptotic activity of ASC-S in cervical cancer cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The effect of ASC-S on reactive oxygen species (ROS), and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) was studied in HeLa cells. Furthermore, the dose-dependent effect of ASC-S on release of cytochrome c, pro-caspase-9, caspase-3, BH3 interacting-domain death agonist (BID), truncated BH3 interacting-domain death agonist (t-BID), FAS ligand (FASL) and transcription factors nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kB), nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT) and activator protein-1 (AP1) were studied in HeLa cells. RESULTS: Treatment of HeLa cells with ASC-S significantly increased the MMP. The modulation of MMP resulted in cleavage of BID, expression of FAS, cleavage of pro-caspase-9 and release of cytochrome c into cytosol. In addition, ASC-S treatment resulted in deregulation of transcription factors NF-kB, NFAT and AP1, which play an important role in the development of inflammation and cancer. CONCLUSION: Our data, for the first time, suggest that ASC-S has an apoptotic effect against HeLa cells by inducing change in mitochondrial membrane permeability, cytochrome c release and subsequent activation of caspase-3 and NF-kB.
27919959	Dynamin 2 Inhibitors as Novel Therapeutic Agents Against Cervical Cancer Cells.	AIM: We investigated the feasibility of dynamin 2 as a potential treatment target in cervical cancer cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed tissue microarray for dynamin 2 expression in 208 patients with early cervical cancer and in vitro in HeLa cells with dynamin 2 inhibitors MiTMAB, OcTMAB, Dynasore, and DD-6. RESULTS: Tumor size greater than 2 cm or tumor invasion of more than half of the entire cervix was associated with expression of dynamin 2 compared to no expression (p=0.013, and p=0.045, respectively). All dynamin 2 inhibitors significantly reduced proliferation, increased apoptotic activity, and reduced matrix metallopeptidase 9 expression in HeLa cells. Dynasore and DD-6 reduced migration of HeLa cells on laminin 1-coated plates and DD-6 most strongly reduced migration performance on fibronectin-coated plates. CONCLUSION: Targeting dynamin 2 may be a promising new approach for the treatment of cervical cancer.
27918650	Clinical value of fully automated p16/Ki-67 dual staining in the triage of HPV-positive women in the Norwegian Cervical Cancer Screening Program.	BACKGROUND: More accurate biomarkers in cervical cytology screening could reduce the number of women unnecessarily referred for biopsy. This study investigated the ability of p16/Ki-67 dual staining to predict high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) in human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive women from the Norwegian Cervical Cancer Screening Program. METHODS: Automated p16/Ki-67 dual staining was performed on liquid-based cytology samples from 266 women who were HPV-positive at their secondary screening. At a mean of 184 days after p16/Ki-67 staining, 201 women had a valid staining result and a conclusive follow-up diagnosis (histological diagnosis or HPV-negative diagnosis with normal cytology findings). The sensitivity and specificity for predicting the follow-up diagnosis were compared for cytology, p16/Ki-67 dual staining, and their combination. RESULTS: Sixty-seven percent of the study sample was p16/Ki-67-positive. The sensitivity of p16/Ki-67 staining for predicting CIN-2/3 was statistically significantly higher than the sensitivity of cytology (0.88 vs 0.79; P = .008), but this was not true for the prediction of CIN-3 (0.94 vs 0.88; P = .23). The specificity of cytology for predicting CIN-3 was significantly higher than the specificity of p16/Ki-67 staining (0.35 vs 0.28; P = .002), but this was not true for CIN-2/3 (0.35 vs 0.31; P = .063). For predicting CIN-2/3 and CIN-3, combination testing gave potentially better sensitivity (0.95 and 0.96, respectively) and better specificity (0.49 and 0.50, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: In a population of HPV-positive women, p16/Ki-67 dual staining was more sensitive but less specific than cytology for predicting high-grade CIN. The advantage of using both tests in different combinations is the potential for increasing the specificity or sensitivity in comparison with both methods performed individually.

27910798	A qualitative study of women who experience side effects from human papillomavirus vaccination.	INTRODUCTION: In Denmark, vaccination against human papillomavirus (HPV) is offered to girls and women to prevent cervical cancer. Unfortunately, reporting of possible side effects from vaccination has increased in recent years. Therefore, the present study examine women's experiences of side effects from the HPV vaccine. METHODS: In-depth qualitative interviews were conducted with eight HPV-vaccinated Danish women, aged 25-44 years, who experienced side effects from the vaccine. The data were analysed using a narrative methodology. RESULTS: The main reasons for being vaccinated against HPV are fear of cancer and trust in general practitioners (GPs). The women reported feeling stigmatised by GPs and doctors and they felt that these professionals did not acknowledge their symptoms, often assuming that they were due to psychological distress. The lack of acceptance from family and friends had led the women to distance themselves from others and lead a more socially isolated life. The women believed that a diagnosis could validate their symptoms and help others accept their condition. CONCLUSIONS: The women felt exceedingly physically and mentally confined in their everyday life, which led them to live a more restricted and solitary life. Since other people tended not to acknowledge their symptoms, the women's illness behaviour was poorly accepted. The women generally distrusted Danish healthcare as they had experienced stigmatisation from physicians and did not trust the evidence for the safety of the vaccine.

27909716	Aberrant TIMELESS expression is associated with poor clinical survival and lymph node metastasis in early-stage cervical carcinoma.	TIMELESS is a highly conserved protein required for the maintenance of normal mammalian circadian oscillations and for controlling cellular metabolism and proliferation. Recently, TIMELESS was implicated in the tumorigenesis of certain cancers. However, little is known on TIMELESS protein expression and its potential as a prognostic factor in cervical cancer. Here, we investigate TIMELESS expression pattern and its clinicopathological significance in early-stage cervical carcinoma. TIMELESS mRNA and protein expression was evaluated by real-time PCR and western blot analysis in cervical cancer cell lines, a normal cervical cell line, as well as in six pairs of surgically removed cervical cancer and adjacent normal cervical tissues. A total of 189 paraffin-embedded cervical carcinoma specimens were detected and diagnosed by immunohistochemistry (IHC), and the clinical significance of TIMELESS expression was further analyzed. Aberrant TIMELESS mRNA and protein expression were demonstrated in cervical cancer cell lines compared with the normal cervical cell line. TIMELESS mRNA and protein expression were significantly increased in cervical cancer specimens compared with adjacent non-cancerous cervical specimens. TIMELESS protein expression was significantly associated with the age (P=0.011), clinical stage (P<0.001), pelvic lymph node metastasis (P<0.001), squamous cell carcinoma antigen (P=0.003), tumor recurrence (P=0.015), vital status (P<0.001), tumor differentiation grade (P<0.001), property of the surgical margin (P=0.036) and lymphovascular space involvement (P=0.001). Patients with increased TIMELESS protein expression showed strong tendencies to receive postoperative radiotherapy (P=0.002). Upregulation of TIMELESS correlated with poorer overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS). Univariate and multivariate Cox-regression analyses showed that TIMELESS can be regarded as an independent predictive biomarker for poor clinical outcome for early-stage cervical carcinoma. Our results show that TIMELESS overexpression correlates with pelvic lymph node metastasis, lymphovascular space involvement, as well as unfavorable OS and DFS in human cervical cancer. Therefore, TIMELESS expression may be a potential prognostic biomarker for cervical cancer patients.
27906808	The Accuracy of Large Loop Excision of the Transformation Zone Specimen Dimensions in Determining Volume: A Multicentric Prospective Observational Study.	OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to determine which mathematical formula of specimen dimensions is the most accurate method of determining volume of the excised specimen at loop excision of the transformation zone. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A multicenter prospective observational study was conducted. A total of 258 patients who had a loop excision of the transformation zone performed as treatment of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2-3 were included. The dimensions and the volume of the specimen were measured at the time of the procedure, before formaldehyde fixation. The volume was measured by immersing the specimen in a graduated cylinder using Archimedes fluid displacement technique. The measured volume was compared with the calculated volume using different volume formulas, that is, a cone, a cylinder, a parallelepiped, and a hemiellipsoid. The main outcome measure was the relationship between calculated volume (using the dimensions of thickness, length, and circumference) and the measured volume of the specimen. RESULTS: The mean (SD) thickness, length, and circumference of specimens were 8.8 mm (3.8), 12.7 mm (5.9), and 45.7 mm (16.8), respectively. The mean (SD) measured volume was 2.53 (1.49) mL. Using the formula for the volume of a cone, a cylinder, a parallelepiped and a hemiellipsoid, estimated volumes were 1.03 mL (1.22), 3.10 mL (3.65), 6.20 mL (7.31), and 2.07 mL (2.44), respectively. The highest intraclass correlation coefficient between measured and calculated volume was observed when using the formula for the volume of a hemiellipsoid specimen (0.47, 95% CI = 0.36-0.56). CONCLUSIONS: The hemiellipsoid formula is the most accurate determinant of the excised volume. Other formulas do not allow for an accurate estimation of the excised volume.
27906806	Awareness of Cervical Cancer Causes and Predeterminants of Likelihood to Screen Among Women in Haiti.	OBJECTIVES: Cervical cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths among women in Haiti. Given this high disease burden, we sought to better understand women's knowledge of its causes and the sociodemographic and health correlates of cervical cancer screening. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Participants were 410 adult women presenting at clinics in Leogane and Port-au-Prince, Haiti. We used bivariate and multivariate logic regression to identify correlates of Pap smear receipt. RESULTS: Only 29% of respondents had heard of human papillomavirus (HPV), whereas 98% were aware of cervical cancer. Of those aware of cervical cancer, 12% believed that sexually transmitted infections (STIs) cause it, and only 4% identified HPV infection as the cause. Women with a previous sexually transmitted infection were more likely to have had Pap smear (34% vs 71%, odds ratio = 3.45; 95% CI = 1.57-7.59). Screening was also more likely among women who were older than the age of 39 years, better educated, and employed (all p < .05). Almost all women (97%) were willing to undergo cervical cancer screening. CONCLUSIONS: This sample of Haitian women had limited awareness of HPV and cervical cancer causes; but when provided with health information, they saw the benefits of cancer screening. Future initiatives should provide health education messages, with efforts targeting young and at-risk women.
27906805	Predictors of Positive Margins at Time of Loop Electrosurgical Excision Procedure.	OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to identify factors associated with the presence of high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) at surgical margins of loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP) pathology specimens. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All women evaluated for lower genital tract disease at a single academic institution were prospectively entered into a database. The database was queried for all women who had a LEEP performed for indications within contemporary American Society of Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology guidelines between April 1, 2013, and April 30, 2015. Factors extracted from the database included demographics, contraception, weight, tobacco use, provider volume, resident participation, history of cervical procedure, and pathology features including preceding Pap test category. A positive margin was defined as HSIL on either the endocervical or ectocervical margin of the LEEP specimen or in endocervical curettage specimen after LEEP. We performed univariable statistics to identify factors associated with positive margins and then logistic regression modeling on significant factors for the outcome of positive margins. RESULTS: Two hundred sixty-nine women were identified. Seventy five (27.8%) of these women had positive margins. Only tobacco use, gravity, parity, and preceding Pap category were significant on univariable analysis. After multivariable analysis, smokers remained more likely to have positive margins (odds ratio = 2.01; CI = 1.12-3.6; p < .01) as did those with preceding HSIL Pap tests (odds ratio = 1.96; CI = 1.13-3.41; p < .01). CONCLUSIONS: In our population, of all the factors assessed, only tobacco use and preceding high-grade Pap tests were associated with positive margins at time of LEEP. This information may be helpful in preprocedural planning to optimize treatment.
27904083	Novel Sulfonamide Derivatives Carrying a Biologically Active 3,4-Dimethoxyphenyl Moiety as VEGFR-2 Inhibitors.	Novel sulfonamides 3-19 with a biologically active 3,4-dimethoxyphenyl moiety were designed and synthesized. The structures of the synthesized compounds were established using elemental analyses, IR, 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR spectral data and mass spectroscopy. All the synthesized compounds were evaluated for their in vitro anticancer activity against four cancer cell lines, namely human hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2), human medulloblastoma (Daoy), human cervical cancer (HeLa), and human colon cancer (HT-29), by using a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay and dasatinib as the reference drug. Among the tested derivatives, compounds 4, 10, 16, and 19 showed good activity as cytotoxic agents. The most active derivatives were evaluated for their ability to inhibit vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR)-2. Compounds Z-4-(3-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-3-oxoprop-1-enylamino)-N-(5-methyl-1,3,4-thiadiazol- 2-yl)-benzenesulfonamide 10 and Z-4-(3-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-3-oxoprop-1-enylamino)-N-(1H-indazol-6-yl)-benzenesu lfonamide 19 were more active as VEGFR-2 inhibitors than dasatinib. Molecular docking of the most active derivatives on the active site of VEGFR-2 revealed that compound 19 exhibited favorable and promising results.
27902986	The Presence of HPV DNA in Neck Lymph Node Metastasis Correlates with Improved Overall Survival of Patients with Oropharyngeal Cancer Undergoing Surgical Treatment.	BACKGROUND: Few studies have addressed how human papilloma virus (HPV) infection in oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) affects the outcome of surgical therapy; furthermore, the relationship between the presence of HPV DNA and neck lymph node (LN) metastasis has not been well established. METHODS: A total of 65 patients who underwent surgery as a first-line therapy for OPSCC were enrolled in this study. In HPV-positive patients, the presence of HPV DNA in metastatic neck LN lesions was evaluated. RESULTS: The HPV-positive patients had significantly better overall survival than the HPV-negative patients (log-rank test, p = 0.04), whereas HPV infection status did not significantly affect disease-free survival (log-rank test, p = 0.65). In all of the HPV-positive OPSCC patients who developed cervical LN metastasis, the same HPV DNA type was found in both the primary tumour and the metastases. CONCLUSIONS: The present results suggest that HPV infection is a determining factor for good prognosis in patients undergoing first-line surgical therapy for OPSCC.
27900757	Unsuspected axillary lymph node metastasis of nasopharyngeal and cervical cancer on 18FDG PET/CT: a case report.	Axillary lymph node metastasis (ALNM) from cancer except breast cancer is rare. Whole body 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) that simultaneously offers anatomic and metabolic information is widely used and has become an effective modality in many clinical fields, especially oncology, and also may detect an unexpected metastasis. We report two cases of ALMN of nasopharyngeal and cervical cancer that was detected on whole body PET/CT.
27899255	Long non-coding RNA ANRIL indicates a poor prognosis of cervical cancer and promotes carcinogenesis via PI3K/Akt pathways.	Accumulating evidence suggests that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are playing critical roles in tumorgenesis. LncRNA ANRIL has been reported to promote tumor progression in types of cancers. However, the expression and function of ANRIL in cervical cancer are still largely unclear. We measured the expression of ANRIL in cervical cancer tissues and cell lines and analyzed its association with clinicopathological features and prognosis. Loss-of-function experiments were used to identify the biological function of ANRIL. Our results showed that the expression of lncRNA ANRIL was significantly increased both in cervical cancer tissues and cell lines. Patients with high ANRIL expression had advanced FIGO stage, lymph node metastasis and poor overall survival than those with low ANRIL expression. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression analysis suggested that high ANRIL expression was an independent prognostic factor of prognosis. Loss-of-function experiments showed that decreased expression of ANRIL inhibited cell proliferation, migration and invasion of cervical cancer. Finally, western blot indicated that the PI3K/Akt pathway was found to be inactivated in cervical cancer cells after ANRIL inhibition. These results indicated that lncRNA ANRIL might play an important role in cervical cancer progression and could serve as a novel prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target in cervical cancer.
27895479	Cationic PEGylated liposomes incorporating an antimicrobial peptide tilapia hepcidin 2-3: an adjuvant of epirubicin to overcome multidrug resistance in cervical cancer cells.	Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have been recently evaluated as a new generation of adjuvants in cancer chemotherapy. In this study, we designed PEGylated liposomes encapsulating epirubicin as an antineoplastic agent and tilapia hepcidin 2-3, an AMP, as a multidrug resistance (MDR) transporter suppressor and an apoptosis/autophagy modulator in human cervical cancer HeLa cells. Cotreatment of HeLa cells with PEGylated liposomal formulation of epirubicin and hepcidin 2-3 significantly increased the cytotoxicity of epirubicin. The liposomal formulations of epirubicin and/or hepcidin 2-3 were found to noticeably escalate the intracellular H2O2 and O2- levels of cancer cells. Furthermore, these treatments considerably reduced the mRNA expressions of MDR protein 1, MDR-associated protein (MRP) 1, and MRP2. The addition of hepcidin 2-3 in liposomes was shown to markedly enhance the intracellular epirubicin uptake and mainly localized into the nucleus. Moreover, this formulation was also found to trigger apoptosis and autophagy in HeLa cells, as validated by significant increases in the expressions of cleaved poly ADP ribose polymerase, caspase-3, caspase-9, and light chain 3 (LC3)-II, as well as a decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential. The apoptosis induction was also confirmed by the rise in sub-G1 phase of cell cycle assay and apoptosis percentage of annexin V/propidium iodide assay. We found that liposomal epirubicin and hepcidin 2-3 augmented the accumulation of GFP-LC3 puncta as amplified by chloroquine, implying the involvement of autophagy. Interestingly, the partial inhibition of necroptosis and the epithelial-mesenchymal transition by this combination was also verified. Altogether, our results provide evidence that coincubation with PEGylated liposomes of hepcidin 2-3 and epirubicin caused programmed cell death in cervical cancer cells through modulation of multiple signaling pathways, including MDR transporters, apoptosis, autophagy, and/or necroptosis. Thus, this formulation may provide a new platform for the combined treatment of traditional chemotherapy and hepcidin 2-3 as a new adjuvant for effective MDR reversal.
27895081	Malignant melanoma of cervix.	A 68-year-old woman presented with symptoms of bleeding per vaginum. On examination, a growth was seen in the cervix, clinically considered to be squamous cell carcinoma. The growth was confined to the cervix and did not involve the parametria. However, on biopsy it was diagnosed as malignant melanoma. She underwent surgery elsewhere and was advised chemotherapy as these tumours are aggressive; however, she refused chemotherapy. She has been on regular follow-up and has an ongoing survival and disease-free period of more than 5 years. Primary cervical malignant melanomas are very rare as compared with vulval and vaginal counterparts and should be considered in the histological differential diagnosis of poorly differentiated malignant neoplasms involving cervix. Moreover, it is important to rule out metastasis from common primary sites such as skin, oesophagus, uveal tract and anorectal region before considering diagnosis of primary cervical melanoma.
27894986	Application of molecular genotyping to determine prevalence of HPV strains in Pap smears of Kazakhstan women.	OBJECTIVES: Human papillomavirus is the main causative agent for cervical cancer. However, few data are available about HPV prevalence in Kazakhstan. The aims of this study were to genotype HPV DNA in Pap smear samples of women to determine prevalence of carcinogenic HPV types in Astana, Kazakhstan and to analyze the association between HPV positivity and the cytology results of patient samples. METHODS: Pap smear materials were obtained from 140 patients aged 18-59, who visited the outpatient gynecological clinic. Microscopic examination was done to detect dysplasia, and HPV genotyping was done using real-time multiplex PCR. RESULTS: HPV testing showed that among 61 HPV positive patients, the most prevalent types were 16 and 18. Microscopic examination showed that 79% of the samples had normal cytology, while 13% had CIN grade I, 5% had CIN grade II, and 3% had CIN grade III. The analysis revealed that 12% of the samples had CIN cytology and presence of HPV. Approximately 31% had HPV without cervical dysplasia, while 8% of samples were CIN positive without HPV infection. A statistically significant relationship between HPV 16 and HPV 33 positive samples and CIN grade II and III was found. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, this study will help to strengthen and guide health policy implementation of primary and secondary cervical cancer prevention strategies in Kazakhstan.
27894347	Estimation of utility weights for human papilloma virus-related health states according to disease severity.	BACKGROUND: A cost-utility study of a human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccine requires that the utility weights for HPV-related health states (i.e., cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), cervical cancer, and condyloma) be evaluated. The aim of the present study was to determine the utility weights for HPV-related health states. METHODS: Hypothetical standardised health states related to HPV were developed based on patient education material and previous publications. To fully reflect disease progression from diagnosis to prognosis, each health state comprised four parts (diagnosis, symptoms, treatment, and progression and prognosis). Nine-hundred members from the Korean general population evaluated the HPV-related health states using a visual analogue scale (VAS) and a standard gamble (SG) approach, which were administered face-to-face via computer-assisted interview. The mean utility values were calculated for each HPV-related health state. RESULTS: According to the VAS, the highest utility (0.73) was HPV-positive status, followed by condyloma (0.66), and CIN grade I (0.61). The lowest utility (0.18) was cervical cancer requiring chemotherapy without surgery, followed by cervical cancer requiring chemoradiation therapy (0.42). SG revealed that the highest utility (0.83) was HPV-positive status, followed by condyloma (0.78), and CIN grade I (0.77). The lowest utility (0.43) was cervical cancer requiring chemotherapy without surgery, followed by cervical cancer requiring chemoradiation therapy (0.60). CONCLUSIONS: This study was based on a large sample derived from the general Korean population; therefore, the calculated utility weights might be useful for evaluating the economic benefit of cancer screening and HPV vaccination programs.
27893679	Pelvic inflammatory disease increases the risk of a second primary malignancy in patients with cervical cancer treated by surgery alone.	As the number of long-term cervical cancer survivors continues to increase because of improvements in treatment, concerns about second primary malignancy have grown. The high-risk area of second primary cancers in cervical cancer survivors is the pelvis. Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) could be a useful marker for gynecological cancers. Thus, we designed a large-scale, nationwide, controlled cohort study to investigate whether PID or other risk factors increased the risk of second primary cancers in patients with cervical cancer treated by surgery alone.Between 2000 and 2010, a total of 24,444 cervical cancer patients were identified using the Registry Data for Catastrophic Illness and the National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) of Taiwan. Patients who received definite surgery were selected. To exclude the effect on second primary malignancy by treatment modalities, all cervical patients who ever having received adjuvant or definite radiotherapy or chemotherapy for primary cervical cancer were excluded. Finally, 3860 cervical cancer patients treated by surgery alone without adjuvant treatments were analyzed.Cox proportional hazards model was used for multivariate analysis and the Kaplan-Meier method was used to assess the cumulative risks. Regarding the incidence of second primary cancers, the standardized incidence ratio (SIR) was used.The median follow-up time was 56.6 months. The 6-year cumulative risk of second primary cancers is 0.16% and 0.12% for PID and without PID, respectively. After adjustment for confounders, age of less than 50 years, the presence of diabetes mellitus, and PID were significantly positivity associated with the risk of second primary cancers. The hazard ratios (HRs) of age less than 50 years, diabetes mellitus, and PID were 1.38 (95% CI = 1.11-2.04), 1.40 (95% CI = 1.06-1.85), and 1.35 (95% CI = 1.00-1.81), respectively. A higher incidence of second primary cancers was observed in the genitals, bladder, and colon.In conclusion, the incidence of second primary cancers was higher in the genitals, bladder, and colon in patients with cervical cancer treated with surgery alone. The patients with PID had a higher risk of second primary cancers.
27891686	Implementation of a real-time reference and calibration grid platform for improved screening - mapping in Pap test slides.	Cervical cancer screening based on the Papanicolaou (Pap) test is a widely applied but not always efficient practice for detecting Human Papillomavirus (HPV) mediated lesions, partially due to a non-systematic and inadequate screening process. Our aim was to introduce an inexpensive easy-to-use direct screening platform for improved detection of abnormal cells indicative of underlying cervical neoplasia as well as persisting HPV infection. By employing a novel, efficient technique of laser-based micromachining, we achieved the fabrication of spatial grids on commercially available coverslips allowing visual segmentation of the slide for efficient screening. Abnormal and formerly diagnosed as negative for intraepithelial lesion or malignancy (NILM) Pap test slides (n = 200) were analyzed by conventional and grid-based screening. Grid-based microscopy led to a more reliable diagnosis compared to the conventional by identifying an increased number of abnormal cells (P = 0.001). It decreased borderline ASCUS, AGC diagnosis, increasing LSIL, HSIL and in situ AdenoCa detection rates closely related with biopsy (P = 0.015; kappa = 0.978). Concerning the set of NILM diagnoses in rapid re-screening, the method upgraded six cases (n = 6) to LSIL (P = 0.001). The proposed technical solution offers a calibration and orientation visual aid during the on-site screening process providing significant advantages compared to expensive digital imaging techniques.
27891193	In epithelial cancers, aberrant COL17A1 promoter methylation predicts its misexpression and increased invasion.	BACKGROUND: Metastasis is a leading cause of death among cancer patients. In the tumor microenvironment, altered levels of extracellular matrix proteins, such as collagens, can facilitate the first steps of cancer cell metastasis, including invasion into surrounding tissue and intravasation into the blood stream. However, the degree of misexpression of collagen genes in tumors remains understudied, even though this knowledge could greatly facilitate the development of cancer treatment options aimed at preventing metastasis. METHODS: We systematically evaluate the expression of all 44 collagen genes in breast cancer and assess whether their misexpression provides clinical prognostic significance. We use immunohistochemistry on 150 ductal breast cancers and 361 cervical cancers and study DNA methylation in various epithelial cancers. RESULTS: In breast cancer, various tests show that COL4A1 and COL4A2 overexpression and COL17A1 (BP180, BPAG2) underexpression provide independent prognostic strength (HR = 1.25, 95% CI = 1.17-1.34, p = 3.03 x 10-10; HR = 1.18, 95% CI = 1.11-1.25, p = 8.11 x 10-10; HR = 0.86, 95% CI = 0.81-0.92, p = 4.57 x 10-6; respectively). Immunohistochemistry on ductal breast cancers confirmed that the COL17A1 protein product, collagen XVII, is underexpressed. This strongly correlates with advanced stage, increased invasion, and postmenopausal status. In contrast, immunohistochemistry on cervical tumors showed that collagen XVII is overexpressed in cervical cancer and this is associated with increased local dissemination. Interestingly, consistent with the opposed direction of misexpression in these cancers, the COL17A1 promoter is hypermethylated in breast cancer and hypomethylated in cervical cancer. We also find that the COL17A1 promoter is hypomethylated in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, lung squamous cell carcinoma, and lung adenocarcinoma, in all of which collagen XVII overexpression has previously been shown. CONCLUSIONS: Paradoxically, collagen XVII is underexpressed in breast cancer and overexpressed in cervical and other epithelial cancers. However, the COL17A1 promoter methylation status accurately predicts both the direction of misexpression and the increased invasive nature for five out of five epithelial cancers. This implies that aberrant epigenetic control is a key driver of COL17A1 gene misexpression and tumor cell invasion. These findings have significant clinical implications, suggesting that the COL17A1 promoter methylation status can be used to predict patient outcome. Moreover, epigenetic targeting of COL17A1 could represent a novel strategy to prevent metastasis in patients.
27890875	Induction of apoptosis by ethanol extract of Evodia rutaecarpa in HeLa human cervical cancer cells via activation of AMP-activated protein kinase.	The fruit of Evodia rutaecarpa (Juss.) Benth has been used widely in traditional medicine therapy. Although it has been shown to possess many pharmacological activities, the molecular mechanisms of its anti-cancer activity have not been clearly elucidated. In the present study, we investigated the pro-apoptotic effects of an ethanol extract isolated from immature fruits of E. rutaecarpa (EEER) in HeLa human cervical cancer cells. EEER treatment decreased the cell viability of HeLa cells in a concentration-dependent manner, which was related to apoptotic cell death resulting from apoptotic body formation, DNA fragmentation, and an increased population of annexin V+-positive cells. EEER treatment significantly suppressed anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 expression, leading to subsequent loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), while it did not change expression levels of death receptor (DR)-related proteins. EEER treatment increased activity of caspase-3 and -9 but not caspase-8, and pretreatment of a caspase-3 inhibitor markedly attenuated EEER-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, EEER activated the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling pathway; however, inhibition of AMPK markedly abrogated EEER-induced apoptosis. Overall, the results suggest that the apoptotic activity of EEER may be associated with a caspase-dependent cascade through activation of the intrinsic signaling pathway connected with AMPK activation. E. rutaecarpa could be a prospective clinical application to treat human cervical cancer.
27888705	Chemotherapy-related leukopenia as a biomarker predicting survival outcomes in locally advanced cervical cancer.	OBJECTIVE: To investigate the impact of hematologic toxicity and leukopenia in locally advanced cervical cancer patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT). STUDY DESIGN: Data of consecutive patients undergoing platinum-based NACT followed by surgery were retrospectively searched in order to evaluate the impact of chemotherapy-related toxicity on survival outcomes. Toxicity was graded per the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAEv.4.03). Survival outcomes were evaluated using Kaplan-Meir and Cox hazard models. RESULTS: Overall, 126 patients were included. Among those, 94 (74.6%) patients experienced grade2+ hematologic toxicity; while, grade2+ non-hematologic toxicity occurred in 11 (8.7%) patients. After a median follow-up of 37.1 (inter-quartile range, 12-57.5) months, 21 (16.6%) patients experienced recurrence. Via multivariate analysis, no factor was independently associated with disease-free survival; while a trend toward worse prognosis was observed for patients experiencing grade2+ leukopenia at cycle-3 (HR:3.13 (95%CI: 0.94, 10.3); p=0.06). Similarly, grade2+ leukopenia (HR:9.98 (95%CI: 1.14, 86.6); p=0.03), lymph-node positivity (HR:14.6 (95%CI:1.0, 214.4); p=0.05) and vaginal involvement (HR:5.81 (95%CI:1.43, 23.6); p=0.01) impacted on overall survival, at multivariate analysis. Magnitude of leukopenia correlated with survival (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Although, our data have to be confirmed by prospective investigations, the present study shows an association between the occurrence of leukopenia and survival outcomes. NACT-related immunosuppression might reduce the response against the tumor, thus promoting cancer progression.
27886713	Automated classification of Pap smear images to detect cervical dysplasia.	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The present study proposes an intelligent system for automatic categorization of Pap smear images to detect cervical dysplasia, which has been an open problem ongoing for last five decades. METHODS: The classification technique is based on shape, texture and color features. It classifies the cervical dysplasia into two-level (normal and abnormal) and three-level (Negative for Intraepithelial Lesion or Malignancy, Low-grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesion and High-grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesion) classes reflecting the established Bethesda system of classification used for diagnosis of cancerous or precancerous lesion of cervix. The system is evaluated on two generated databases obtained from two diagnostic centers, one containing 1610 single cervical cells and the other 1320 complete smear level images. The main objective of this database generation is to categorize the images according to the Bethesda system of classification both of which require lots of training and expertise. The system is also trained and tested on the benchmark Herlev University database which is publicly available. In this contribution a new segmentation technique has also been proposed for extracting shape features. Ripplet Type I transform, Histogram first order statistics and Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix have been used for color and texture features respectively. To improve classification results, ensemble method is used, which integrates the decision of three classifiers. Assessments are performed using 5 fold cross validation. RESULTS: Extended experiments reveal that the proposed system can successfully classify Pap smear images performing significantly better when compared with other existing methods. CONCLUSION: This type of automated cancer classifier will be of particular help in early detection of cancer.
27886335	microRNA 421 induces apoptosis of c-33a cervical cancer cells via down-regulation of Bcl-xL.	Cervical cancer is a life-threatening condition. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) can promote or inhibit cell death and proliferation. The present study investigated the effect of miRNA 421 on the growth and apoptosis of cervical cancer cells. miRNA 421 and control miRNA were synthesized and transfected into c-33a cervical cancer cells. A thiazolyl blue tetrazolium bromide assay, caspase-3 activity, and flow cytometry were used to study the effects of miRNA 421 on c-33a cell growth, and apoptosis. Small interfering RNA targeting Bcl-xL was synthesized and transfected into c-33a cells along with miRNA 421. Bcl-xL expression and cell apoptosis were then measured by western blot and flow cytometry, respectively. Transfection of miRNA 421 into c-33a cells reduced their growth, promoted their apoptosis (measured by increased phosphatidylserine eversion), activated caspase-3, and decreased Bcl-xL expression. Silencing and overexpression of Bcl-xL enhanced and inhibited miRNA 421-induced apoptosis of c-33a cells, respectively. miRNA 421 induces c-33a cell apoptosis via down-regulation of Bcl-xL, suggesting that this latter might be used as a potential clinical target.
27884207	Potential contribution of the uterine microbiome in the development of endometrial cancer.	BACKGROUND: Endometrial cancer studies have led to a number of well-defined but mechanistically unconnected genetic and environmental risk factors. One of the emerging modulators between environmental triggers and genetic expression is the microbiome. We set out to inquire about the composition of the uterine microbiome and its putative role in endometrial cancer. METHODS: We undertook a study of the microbiome in samples taken from different locations along the female reproductive tract in patients with endometrial cancer (n = 17), patients with endometrial hyperplasia (endometrial cancer precursor, n = 4), and patients afflicted with benign uterine conditions (n = 10). Vaginal, cervical, Fallopian, ovarian, peritoneal, and urine samples were collected aseptically both in the operating room and the pathology laboratory. DNA extraction was followed by amplification and high-throughput next generation sequencing (MiSeq) of the 16S rDNA V3-V5 region to identify the microbiota present. Microbiota data were summarized using both alpha-diversity to reflect species richness and evenness within bacterial populations and beta-diversity to reflect the shared diversity between bacterial populations. Statistical significance was determined through the use of multiple testing, including the generalized mixed-effects model. RESULTS: The microbiome sequencing (16S rDNA V3-V5 region) revealed that the microbiomes of all organs (vagina, cervix, Fallopian tubes, and ovaries) are significantly correlated (p < 0.001) and that there is a structural microbiome shift in the cancer and hyperplasia cases, distinguishable from the benign cases (p = 0.01). Several taxa were found to be significantly enriched in samples belonging to the endometrial cancer cohort: Firmicutes (Anaerostipes, ph2, Dialister, Peptoniphilus, 1-68, Ruminococcus, and Anaerotruncus), Spirochaetes (Treponema), Actinobacteria (Atopobium), Bacteroidetes (Bacteroides and Porphyromonas), and Proteobacteria (Arthrospira). Of particular relevance, the simultaneous presence of Atopobium vaginae and an uncultured representative of the Porphyromonas sp. (99 % match to P. somerae) were found to be associated with disease status, especially if combined with a high vaginal pH (>4.5). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the detection of A. vaginae and the identified Porphyromonas sp. in the gynecologic tract combined with a high vaginal pH is statistically associated with the presence of endometrial cancer. Given the documented association of the identified microorganisms with other pathologies, these findings raise the possibility of a microbiome role in the manifestation, etiology, or progression of endometrial cancer that should be further investigated.
27881109	Anti-tumor effects of Abnormal Savda Munziq on the transplanted cervical cancer (U27) mouse model.	BACKGROUND: Abnormal Savda Munziq (ASMq), a traditional uyghur medicine, has shown anti-tumour properties in vitro. it was showed that total flavonoids of ASMq could inhibit the proliferation and enhance the antioxidant ability of human cervix cancer HeLa cell. This study attempts to confirm these effects on the transplanted cervical cancer (U27) mouse model in vivo. METHODS: Forty eight Kunming mice were randomly divided in to six groups: normal control group (Control group), U27 tumor model group (Model group), cyclophosphamide administration group (CTX group),low-dose ASMq group (ASMq.L group), medium-dose ASMq group (ASMq.M group), and high-dose ASMq group (ASMq.H group). The five groups except normal control group transplanted with cervical cancer (U27) cells. We observed mice tumor inhibition rate and conducted the histopathological analysisUsing the western blot assay, the expression of TGF-beta1 and TNF-alpha protein in transplanted cervical cancer U27 tumor tissue were detected. RESULTS: The tumor inhibition rates of CTX group, ASMq.L group, ASMq.M group, and ASMq.H group were 72.21, 31.27, 60.53 and 51.94% respectively, has obvious antitumor effect. ASMq significantly promote the spleen tlymphocyte proliferation of transplanted cervical cancer U27 mice. Invasive growth and diffusion rate in tumor tissue were accelerate in the transplanted cervical cancer U27 model group. Tumor tissue necrosis of tumor cells are smaller in the medium, high dosage group. Compared with the U27 model group, the expression levels of TGF-beta1 protein and TNF-alpha protein expression exhibited statistically significant decreased in the mice tumor tissues in the CTX administration group and the ASMq administration group. CONCLUSIONS: ASMq has some antitumor effects on U27 model mice in vivo, The effects are achieved not only by improving the immune function of U27 model mice, but also by inhibiting the expression levels of TGF-beta1 protein while promoting the expression levels of TNF-alpha protein.
27878258	MicroRNA-362 is downregulated in cervical cancer and inhibits cell proliferation, migration and invasion by directly targeting SIX1.	Cervical cancer is the second most common type of cancer in women accounting for 12% of all human cancers in the world. Mounting evidence demonstrates that microRNAs play important roles in the carcinogenesis and progression of cervical cancer. The aim of this study was to investigate the expression, roles and molecular mechanism of microRNA-362 (miR-362) in cervical cancer. According to the results, we found that expression level of miR-362 was significantly reduced in cervical cancer tissues and cell lines. Low miR-362 expression was correlated with FIGO stage, lymph node metastasis and vascular invasion in cervical cancer. Functional assays showed that restoration of miR-362 repressed cell proliferation, migration and invasion in cervical cancer. We also provided direct evidence that sineoculis homeobox homolog 1 (SIX1) was a direct target of miR-362 in cervical cancer, which was confirmed by bioinformatics analysis, luciferase reporter assay, qRT-PCR and western blot analysis. SIX1 was upregulated in cervical cancer and inversely correlated with miR362 expression in cervical cancer. In addition, SIX1 knockdown could simulate the roles of miR-362 overexpression on cell proliferation, migration and invasion of cervical cancer. Moreover, rescue experiments indicated that restoration of SIX1 was sufficient to abolish proliferation, migration and invasion induced by miR-362 overexpression in cervical cancer cells. The newly identified miR-362/SIX1 pathway provides insight into cervical cancer progression, and may represent a novel therapeutic target.
27877037	Acute and subacute toxicity profiles of thymoquinone-loaded nanostructured lipid carrier in BALB/c mice.	BACKGROUND: Thymoquinone (TQ), the predominant active lipophilic component in Nigella sativa seed oil, has a variety of pharmacological properties such as anticancer activities. However, translation of TQ to clinical phase is still not possible due to its hydrophobic properties. This problem can be solved by encapsulating it in nanoformulations to enhance its pharmacological properties. In our previous study, TQ has been successfully encapsulated in a nanostructured lipid carrier (hereinafter referred to as TQNLC) with excellent physiochemical properties such as high encapsulation efficiency, high drug-loading capacity, particle diameter less than 100 nm, and stability up to 2 years. In vitro studies also proved that TQNLC exhibited antiproliferative activity toward breast and cervical cancer cell lines. However, no toxicity profile related to this formulation has been reported. In this study, we determine and compare the in vivo toxicity of both TQNLC and TQ. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The in vivo toxicity (acute and subacute toxicity) study was carried out by oral administration of TQNLC and TQ to BALB/c mice. Animal survival, body weight, organ weight-to-body weight ratio, hematological profile, biochemistry profile, and histopathological changes were analyzed. RESULTS: In acute toxicity, TQ that is loaded in nanostructured lipid carrier (NLC) was found to be less toxic than pure TQ. It can be concluded that encapsulation of TQ in lipid carrier minimizes the toxicity of the compound. In the subacute toxicity study, oral administration of 100 mg/kg of TQNLC and TQ did not cause mortality to either male or female but resulted in toxicity to the liver. It is postulated that long-term consumption of TQNLC and TQ may cause toxicity to the liver but not to the extent of altering the functions of the organ. For both treatments, the no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) was found to be 10 mg/kg/d for mice in both sexes. CONCLUSION: For long-term oral consumption, TQ and TQNLC at a dose of 10 mg/kg is safe in mice and does not exert any toxic effect. The results provide safety information of TQNLC, which would further help researchers in clinical use.
27876223	Monitoring of organochlorine pesticides in blood of women with uterine cervix cancer.	In Yucatan, Mexico, chronic exposure of Mayan population to pesticides is expected as about 30 per cent are drinking polluted water. Residues of organochlorine pesticides (OCP) were monitored in 18 municipalities of Yucatan with high mortality rates due to uterine cervix cancer. 70 blood samples collected from Mayan women living in livestock, agricultural and metropolitan area were analyzed for OCP. Solid Phase Extraction was performed on C18 cartridges and analyzed by Gas Chromatography with Electron Capture Detector. The results showed that the highest OCP levels were detected in blood of women living in the livestock area. OCP detected were endosulfan I (7.35 mug/mL), aldrin (3.69 mug/mL), 4,4' DDD (2.33 mug/mL), 1.39 and 1.46 mug/mL of delta-HCH. Women from the agricultural area had high concentrations of OCP in their blood, particularly dieldrin (1.19 mug/mL), and 1.26 mug/mL of 4,4' DDE. In the metropolitan area, 0.080 mug/mL of gamma-HCH and 0.064 mug/mL of heptachlore were detected. This monitoring study was also based on epidemiological data of uterine cervical cancer. It was found that environmental factors may have facilitated the infiltration of OCP to the aquifer used for potable water supply. These factors in addition to poverty can have impacts on public health. This first exploratory study suggests that monitoring of OCP in human is important for the establishment of health promotion programs. The integrative analysis of both, environmental and social factors would be helpful to characterize the bioaccumulation of pesticides in humans.
27875779	Novel pyrimidine-2,4-dione-1,2,3-triazole and furo[2,3-d]pyrimidine-2-one-1,2,3-triazole hybrids as potential anti-cancer agents: Synthesis, computational and X-ray analysis and biological evaluation.	Regioselective 1,4-disubstituted 1,2,3-triazole tethered pyrimidine-2,4-dione derivatives (5-23) were successfully prepared by the copper(I)-catalyzed click chemistry. While known palladium/copper-cocatalyzed method based on Sonogashira cross-coupling followed by the intramolecular 5-endo-dig ring closure generated novel 6-alkylfuro[2,3-d]pyrimidine-2-one-1,2,3-triazole hybrids (24b-37b), a small library of their 5-alkylethynyl analogs (24a-37a) was synthesized and described for the first time by tandem terminal alkyne dimerization and subsequent 5-endo-trig cyclization, which was additionally corroborated with computational and X-ray crystal structure analyses. The nature of substituents on alkynes and thereof homocoupled 1,3-diynes predominantly influenced the ratio of the formed products in both pathways. In vitro antiproliferative activity of prepared compounds evaluated on five human cancer cell lines revealed that N,N-1,3-bis-(1,2,3-triazole)-5-bromouracil (5-7) and 5,6-disubstituted furo[2,3-d]pyrimidine-2-one-1,2,3-triazole 34a hybrids exhibited the most pronounced cytostatic acitivities against hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) and cervical carcinoma (HeLa) cells with higher potencies than the reference drug 5-fluorouracil. Cytostatic effect of pyrimidine-2,4-dione-1,2,3-triazole hybrid 7 in HepG2 cells could be attributed to the Wee-1 kinase inhibition and abolishment of sphingolipid signaling mediated by acid ceramidase and sphingosine kinase 1. Importantly, this compound proved to be a non-mitochondrial toxicant, which makes it a promising candidate for further lead optimization and development of a new and more efficient agent for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma.
27873494	Identificaiton of Novel Immunogenic Human Papillomavirus Type 16 E7-Specific Epitopes Restricted to HLA-A*33;03 for Cervical Cancer Immunotherapy.	PURPOSE: To identify new immunogenic HLA-A*33;03-restricted epitopes from the human papillomavirus (HPV) 16 E7 protein for immunotherapy against cervical cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We synthesized fourteen overlapping 15-amino acid peptides and measured intracellular interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) production in PBMC and CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) after sensitization with these peptides using flow cytometry and ELISpot assay. The immunogenicity of epitopes was verified using a (5)(1)Cr release assay with SNU1299 cells. RESULTS: Among the fourteen 15-amino acid peptides, E7(4)(9)(-)(6)(3) (RAHYNIVTFCCKCDS) demonstrated the highest IFN-gamma production from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), and CD8+ CTLs sensitized with E7(4)(9)(-)(6)(3) showed higher cytotoxic effect against SNU1299 cells than did CD8+ CTLs sensitized with other peptides or a negative control group. Thirteen 9- or 10-amino acid overlapping peptides spanning E7(4)(9)(-)(6)(3), E7(5)(0)(-)(5)(9) (AHYNIVTFCC), and E7(5)(2)(-)(6)(1) (YNIVTFCCKC) induced significantly higher IFN-gamma production and cytotoxic effects against SNU1299 cells than the other peptides and negative controls, and the cytotoxicity of E7(5)(0)(-)(5)(9)- and E7(5)(2)(-)(6)(1)-sensitized PBMCs was induced via the cytolytic effect of CD8+ CTLs. CONCLUSION: We identified E7(5)(0)(-)(5)(9) and E7(5)(2)(-)(6)(1) as novel HPV 16 E7 epitopes for HLA-A*33;03. CD8+ CTL sensitized with these peptides result in an antitumor effect against cervical cancer cells. These epitopes could be useful for immune monitoring and immunotherapy for cervical cancer and HPV 16-related diseases including anal cancer and oropharyngeal cancer.
27873347	Infantile Hemangioma with Minimal or Arrested Growth: Further Observations on Clinical and Histopathologic Findings of this Unique but Underrecognized Entity.	BACKGROUND: Infantile hemangioma (IH) with minimal or arrested growth (IH-MAG) is becoming increasingly recognized in the literature. It is important to be aware of their existence, because the correct diagnosis is essential for prognostication and treatment and, in the case of facial segmental lesions, the direction of further investigations if PHACE (posterior fossa abnormalities and other structural brain abnormalities; hemangioma(s) of the cervical facial region; arterial cerebrovascular anomalies; cardiac defects, aortic coarctation, and other aortic abnormalities; eye anomalies) syndrome or Sturge-Weber syndrome is suspected. Although the clinical and histologic characteristics of IH-MAG resemble capillary malformations, positive GLUT-1 status is a delineating feature. METHODS: We reviewed nine cases of infants who presented after 2000 with birthmarks showing unique clinical features suggestive of a special variant of IHs. All patients had serial photographs taken demonstrating resolution of the birthmark over time. Five of these cases had skin biopsy performed, all of which confirmed GLUT-1 positivity. RESULTS: This photographic series of IH-MAG demonstrates their unique clinical, histologic, and immunochemistry features. They were nearly fully formed at birth, and their common clinical features included telangiectasia, venules, and matte erythema with light and dark areas. Spontaneous resolution over time without cosmetic disfigurement was the observed natural history in the majority of cases. CONCLUSION: IH-MAG is a unique clinical subset of hemangioma for which close observation is the preferred treatment. When in doubt, a biopsy for histology and GLUT-1 status may be needed to confirm the diagnosis before embarking on unnecessary laser treatment or medical interventions.
27873308	Adjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy for early stage cervical cancer.	BACKGROUND: This is the second updated version of the original Cochrane review published in the Cochrane Library 2009, Issue 3. Most women with early cervical cancer (stages I to IIA) are cured with surgery or radiotherapy, or both. We performed this review originally because it was unclear whether cisplatin-based chemotherapy after surgery, radiotherapy or both, in women with early stage disease with risk factors for recurrence, was associated with additional survival benefits or risks. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of adjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy after radical hysterectomy, radiotherapy, or both in the treatment of early stage cervical cancer. SEARCH METHODS: For the original 2009 review, we searched the Cochrane Gynaecological Cancer Group Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in the Cochrane Library 2009, Issue 1), MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, BIOLOGICAL ABSTRACTS and CancerLit, the National Research Register and Clinical Trials register, with no language restriction. We handsearched abstracts of scientific meetings and other relevant publications. We extended the database searches to November 2011 for the first update and to September 2016 for the second update. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing adjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy (after radical surgery, radiotherapy or both) with no adjuvant chemotherapy, in women with early stage cervical cancer (stage IA2-IIA) with at least one risk factor for recurrence. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors extracted data independently. Meta-analysis was performed using a random-effects model, with death and disease progression as outcomes. MAIN RESULTS: For this second updated version we identified only one small trial reporting grade 4 toxicity results, without disease-free or overall survival data with a median follow-up of 16 months.From the first updated version, we identified three trials that were ongoing, and remain so in 2016.Four trials including 401 women with evaluable results with early cervical cancer were included in the meta-analyses. The median follow-up period in these trials ranged from 29 to 42 months. All women had undergone surgery first. Three trials compared chemotherapy combined with radiotherapy versus radiotherapy alone; and one trial compared chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy versus radiotherapy alone. It was not possible to perform subgroup analyses by stage or tumour size.Compared with adjuvant radiotherapy, chemotherapy combined with radiotherapy significantly reduced the risk of death (two trials, 297 women; hazard ratio (HR) = 0.56, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.36 to 0.87) and disease progression (two trials, 297 women; HR = 0.47, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.74), with no heterogeneity between trials (I(2) = 0% for both meta-analyses). Acute grade 4 toxicity occurred significantly more frequently in the chemotherapy plus radiotherapy group than in the radiotherapy group (three trials, 321 women; risk ratio (RR) 6.26, 95% CI 2.50 to 15.67). We considered the evidence for all three outcomes to be of a moderate quality, using the GRADE approach due to small numbers and limited follow-up in the included studies. In addition, it was not possible to separate data for bulky early stage disease.In the one small trial that compared adjuvant chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy with adjuvant radiotherapy alone there was no difference in disease recurrence between the groups (one trial, 71 women; HR = 1.34; 95% CI 0.24 to 7.66) and overall survival was not reported. We considered this evidence to be of a low quality.No trials compared adjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy with no adjuvant chemotherapy after surgery for early cervical cancer with risk factors for recurrence. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The addition of platinum-based chemotherapy to adjuvant radiotherapy (chemoradiation) may improve survival in women with early stage cervical cancer (IA2-IIA) and risk factors for recurrence. Adjuvant chemoradiation is associated with an increased risk of severe acute toxicity, although it is not clear whether this toxicity is significant in the long term due to a lack of long-term data. This evidence is limited by the small numbers and low to moderate methodological quality of the included studies. We await the results of three ongoing trials, which are likely to have an important impact on our confidence in this evidence.
27869782	Semisynthetic and SAR Studies of Amide Derivatives of Neocrotocembraneic Acid as Potential Antitumor Agents.	A series of novel amide derivatives of cembranoid neocrotocembraneic acid were designed and synthesized. The antiproliferative activities of these derivatives were evaluated against three human tumor cell lines (the human cervical cancer cell line HeLa, chronic myeloid leukemia cell line K562 and leukemia multidrug-resistant cell line K562/A02). Some of the synthesized compounds exhibited moderate to good activity against all three cancer cell lines. Particularly, compound 8a exhibited more potent antiproliferative activity than the reference drug etoposide against drug-resistant cell line K562/A02, indicating that it possessed a great potential for further development as a multidrug resistance modulator by structural modification.
27866896	Performance of the irregular surface compensator compared with four-field box and intensity modulated radiation therapy for gynecologic cancer.	PURPOSE: A retrospective planning study was undertaken to evaluate the dosimetric advantages of the irregular surface compensator (ISC) technique, a forward planning technique with electronic compensation algorithm available on Varian Eclipse treatment planning system. This was extensively compared to the conventional four-field box (4FB) and intensity modulated radiation therapy using 5 fields (IMRT5F) on gynecologic cancer patients. METHODS: Twenty-two patients were enrolled. The prescribed dose was 50.4Gy in 28 fractions to the primary target including pelvic lymph nodes. 4FB treatment plans were generated, then fluence of anterior and posterior fields were modified to generate ISC plans. IMRT5F were inversely optimized with equally spaced five coplanar fields. Dose-volume parameters were evaluated for the comparison of three planning techniques. The MU and delivery time were also estimated. RESULTS: In terms of target coverage, the conformity and homogeneity index of ISC (1.67 and 1.03, respectively) were superior to those of 4FB (2.43 and 1.06, respectively) but slightly inferior to those of IMRT5F (1.10 and 1.02, respectively). ISC also illustrated an overall improvement in normal organ saving. Compared to 4FB, the mean dose of the rectum was reduced by about 4.0-5.0Gy with ISC and IMRT5F. The volume receiving large doses was reduced for bladder with statistical significance with ISC and more with IMRT5F relative to 4FB. The mean number of MU per fraction were 200.86 (4FB), 446.09 (ISC) and 895.59 (IMRT5F). CONCLUSION: The ISC technique has the superior target coverage and healthy tissue sparing in comparison with conventional 4FB and comparable normal organ saving compared to IMRT5F. The ISC can be an available option for gynecologic radiotherapy.
27866212	Expression of IL-1alpha and IL-6 is Associated with Progression and Prognosis of Human Cervical Cancer.	BACKGROUND IL-1alpha and IL-6 are associated with the prognosis of a wide range of cancers, but their value in cervical cancer remains controversial. The aim of this study was to investigate the expression of IL-1alpha and IL-6 in cervical cancer and their significance in clinical prognosis. MATERIAL AND METHODS The expression of IL-1alpha and IL-6 in 105 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded cervical cancer tissues and adjacent non-tumor tissues was examined by immunohistochemistry. The results were semi-quantitatively scored and analyzed by chi-square test. Patient overall survival (OS) data was collected by follow-up and analyzed by Kaplan-Meier analysis. RESULTS The expression level of both IL-1alpha and IL-6 in cervical cancer tissue was higher than in adjacent non-tumor tissues (p<0.05). IL-1alpha expression was shown to be correlated with tumor size, FIGO histology grade, lymph node metastasis, stromal invasion, and tumor differentiation (p<0.05). IL-6 expression was shown to be correlated with tumor size, FIGO histology grade, and tumor differentiation (p<0.05). Patients with positive expression of IL-1alpha or IL-6 tended to have much shorter survival times than patients with negative expression. In addition, a multivariate Cox regression analysis demonstrated that IL-1alpha expression and lymph node metastasis were independent predictors of OS in cervical cancer patients. CONCLUSIONS The expression of IL-1alpha was significantly associated with tumor size, FIGO histology grade, lymph node metastasis, stromal invasion, and tumor differentiation. The expression of IL-6 was significantly associated with tumor size, FIGO histology grade, and tumor differentiation. Positive IL-1alpha and IL-6 expression was significantly correlated with poor prognosis. They may be considered valuable biomarkers for prognosis and potential therapeutic targets for cervical cancer.
27863841	The role and impact of estrogens and xenoestrogen on the development of cervical cancer.	Throughout an individual's lifetime, the human body is exposed to many different chemical compounds, including xenoestrogens (XEs) that can be found in the environment, food, air, cosmetics and other substances, which have a positive or negative impact on their health and lifestyle. Whereas high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) is necessary but not sufficient for full malignant cervical cell transformation, other compounds such as estrogens and XEs may be risk factors for cervical cancer (CC) development. The causes and effects of some diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular, metabolic or immune system disorders are partly due to signaling pathways in response to estrogens. XEs are a vast group of natural and synthetic compounds, behaving like estrogens, that have been studied over the recent years and which may interact with estrogen receptors. The major problem with XEs is the difficulty in studying the mechanism of such complex substances as well as investigating the influences of some of the compounds (dose-dependent) over time. The impact of XEs on CC is variable, with no direct comparison between in vitro studies and in vivo XEs action.
27863272	Genome-wide analysis of aberrant gene expression and methylation profiles reveals susceptibility genes and underlying mechanism of cervical cancer.	BACKGROUND: This study aimed to explore the molecular mechanism of cervical cancer (CC) by integrated bioinformatic analyses of gene expression and methylation profiles. METHODS: The gene expression and methylation microarrays in CC samples and normal controls were respectively downloaded from the GEO database. After screening the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) with Limma package and the CC-related methylation sites with CpGassoc package in R language, DEGs with CC-related methylation sites were identified from the intersection of the above two groups of results with 50kb upstream and downstream of a gene as the gene region. Then GO enrichment was performed by GenCLIP2.0 software. Sequentially, analysis of metabolic sub-pathways with pathogenic risk was predicted by iSubpathwayMiner package in R language. RESULTS: A total of 1357 DEGs including 721 up-regulated and 636 down-regulated, as well as 666 CC-related methylation sites were screened out. After being analyzed, 26 DEGs with 35 CC-related methylation sites were identified. EDN3 and EDNRB were significantly involved in a function cluster in GO terms of vein smooth muscle contraction, vascular smooth muscle contraction and phasic smooth muscle contraction. LHX2 and PAX6 were significantly involved in a function cluster in GO terms of telencephalon regionalization and forebrain regionalization. ACOX3, CYP39A1 and DPYS were significantly enriched in 25 sub-pathways of 6 major pathways. CONCLUSIONS: EDN3 and EDNRB might play important roles in the molecular mechanism of CC, and LHX2, ACOX3, CYP39A1 and DPYS might be susceptibility genes and potential risk markers in CC.
27863160	Primary B-cell lymphoma of the uterine cervix: Presentation in Pap-test slide and cervical biopsy.	This case involved a 69-year-old female who presented with irritative urinary voiding. Imaging studies showed an 18-cm uterine mass centering on the cervix and extending into the bladder. The Pap test slide demonstrated necrotic background and degenerative changes in single and grouped atypical "small round blue cells" with high nuclear/cytoplasm ratio, scant cytoplasm, and hyperchromatic focally cleaved nuclei with occasional nuclear membrane "snout projections." Cervical biopsies showed similar findings. The tumor cells were positive for CD45, CD20, and PAX-5, and negative with epithelial, neuroendocrine, and muscle markers. A Ki-67 immunostain showed a markedly elevated proliferative index and the MUM1 stain was diffusely positive. Molecular study identified clonal immunoglobulin heavy chain gene rearrangement. Owing to its rarity, cervical lymphoma may sometimes be confused with other types of malignant neoplasms or inflammatory processes. Therefore, it is important to recognize the cytological features of cervical lymphomas and be aware of the potential diagnostic pitfalls for timely diagnosis and therapy. Diagn.

27862677	Effect of number of retrieved lymph nodes on prognosis in FIGO stage IB-IIA cervical cancer patients treated with primary radical surgery.	AIM: In the treatment of cervical cancer, the extent of lymphadenectomy is a matter of debate. The goal of the current study was to examine the question of whether the number of retrieved lymph nodes (RLN) can influence survival of patients with early stage cervical cancer. METHODS: The medical records of 180 FIGO stage IB-IIA cervical cancer patients treated with primary radical surgery were reviewed. Patients were divided into two groups: those with </= 40 RLN and those with > 40 RLN. Patients were also assigned to either the bulky (tumor size > 4 cm) cervical cancer group or the non-bulky (tumor size </= 4 cm) cervical cancer group. RESULTS: The number of RLN had a statistically significant effect on both disease-free survival (P = 0.04) and overall survival (P = 0.02) of all patients. Patients with > 40 RLN had better prognoses than those with </= 40 RLN. In the bulky cervical cancer group, the number of RLN was an independent prognostic factor. In multivariate analysis for the bulky cervical cancer group, > 40 RLN had a significant positive effect on disease-free survival (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.36; 95% confidence interval, 0.13-0.97) and overall survival (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.23; 95% confidence interval, 0.06-0.90). However, number of RLN was not an independent prognostic factor in the non-bulky cervical cancer group. CONCLUSIONS: A more extensive lymphadenectomy increased the survival of bulky cervical cancer patients. This finding may be helpful in determining surgical extent before surgery for cervical cancer.
27861705	The temporal and age-dependent patterns of hysterectomy-corrected cervical cancer incidence rates in Denmark: a population-based cohort study.	INTRODUCTION: Hysterectomy is a common gynecological procedure; however, the incidence of total and subtotal hysterectomy varies across countries, by age, and over time. As only women with an intact cervix are at risk of cervical cancer, failing to remove hysterectomized women from the denominator may underestimate the cervical cancer incidence. We aimed to describe the temporal and age-dependent patterns of cervical cancer incidence in Denmark before and after correction for hysterectomy. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Using data from national registries we calculated uncorrected and hysterectomy-corrected cervical cancer incidence rates among women >/=20 years during 2000-11. Hysterectomy-corrected rates were calculated by subtracting post-hysterectomy person-years from the denominator. RESULTS: The overall uncorrected cervical cancer incidence rate was 17.8/100 000 person-years (95% CI 17.3-18.3). After correction for hysterectomy, the rate increased by 8.4% to 19.3/100 000 person-years (95% CI 18.8-19.9). The highest uncorrected incidence was seen in women aged 35-39 years, peaking at 24.4/100 000 person-years, whereas the highest hysterectomy-corrected cervical cancer incidence rate was observed in women aged 75-79 years (29.4/100 000 person-years). Over time, women >/=60 years had the highest hysterectomy-corrected cervical cancer incidence. CONCLUSIONS: Correcting for hysterectomy incidence resulted in a higher cervical cancer incidence and a shift in the peak incidence from age 35-39 years to age 75-79 years. Over time, women >/=60 years were at the highest risk of cervical cancer. Given the high incidence in women >60-65 years, when women are eligible to exit screening, a revision of the screening guidelines may be warranted.
27859783	Practical usefulness of atypical endometrial cell categories within the new classification of endometrial cytology when applied to conventional smears.	OBJECTIVE: Endometrial cytology has been widely used as a screening tool in Japan. Traditionally, a three-tier reporting system, consisting of 'negative', 'suspicious' and 'positive' categories, has been used. However, a more descriptive system, the New Terminology in Endometrial Cytology (NTEMC), which is based on the Bethesda System for uterine cervical cytology, was introduced recently. The objective of this study was to validate the NTEMC criteria. METHODS: Endometrial cytology specimens that had been categorised as 'suspicious' were collected in our hospital between 2003 and 2013, and from these, 106 specimens with corresponding histological results, were re-evaluated according to the NTEMC criteria. Diagnostic categories were assigned based on that chosen by the majority of the examining members. RESULTS: Negative, atypical endometrial cells, of undetermined significance (ATEC-US), atypical endometrial cells for which atypical endometrial hyperplasia or worse cannot be excluded (ATEC-A), endometrial hyperplasia, atypical endometrial hyperplasia and malignancy were selected as the diagnostic categories for 9 (8.5%), 34 (32.1%), 17 (16%), 34 (32.1%), 5 (4.7%) and 7 (6.6%) specimens, respectively. Corresponding histological categories of benign, endometrial hyperplasia, atypical endometrial hyperplasia and malignancy were established in 28 (82.4%), 1 (2.9%), 2 (5.9%) and 3 (8.8%) ATEC-US specimens, respectively, and in 6 (35.3%), 3 (17.6%), 2 (11.8%) and 6 (35.3%) ATEC-A specimens, respectively. The histological category distribution differed significantly (P = 0.001), and there was a significant correlation between corresponding cytological and histological categories (P = 0.005). CONCLUSION: The ATEC category of NTEMC system works well in a practical setting and resembles the Bethesda reporting system ASC (atypical squamous cells) category for cervical cytology.
27858961	Performance of mRNA- and DNA-based high-risk human papillomavirus assays in detection of high-grade cervical lesions.	INTRODUCTION: The aim was to assess the performance of two commercial assays for the detection of high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV): Aptima HPV Assay (Hologic, Inc., Marlborough, MA, USA) which detects mRNA of 14 different hrHPV types, and Hybrid Capture 2 HPV DNA test (HC2; Qiagen, Gaithersburg, MD, USA), which detects the DNA of 13 different hrHPV types. Test performance was compared in the settings of a standard colposcopy clinic, among the regular patient flow. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Two separate cervical cell samples for Aptima and HC2 testing were collected from women referred to colposcopy or a cervical follow-up visit. Altogether, 481 paired samples were analyzed and all positive samples were also tested using the Aptima HPV 16 18/45 Genotype Assay. Results from the two assays were compared directly and with stratification by histology and cytology from the same sampling visit. RESULTS: The overall agreement between HC2 and Aptima assays was 92.9% (Kappa coefficient of 0.855). The sensitivity and specificity of the assays in detecting CIN2+ were 92.5 and 58.2% for HC2, and 94.0 and 59.3% for Aptima, respectively. No significant differences between the assays were found (p-values >0.5). Both assays detected all CIN3 (n = 30) and carcinoma (n = 2) cases. CONCLUSIONS: The mRNA-based Aptima assay and the extensively studied DNA-based HC2 test performed equally well in detecting high-grade cervical lesions. Our data contribute to the growing evidence base indicating that the mRNA-based Aptima assay could be used for the triage of patients with HPV-associated cervical disease.
27855383	Clinical Aspects and Prognostic Factors for Survival in Patients with Recurrent Cervical Cancer after Radical Hysterectomy.	BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical aspects and prognostic factors for survival in patients with recurrent cervical cancer after radical hysterectomy with node dissection (RHND) for stages IA2-IB1. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Clinicopathologic characteristics of the primary tumor, pattern of recurrence, method of detection, salvage treatment, and outcome were reviewed from the medical records of patients who underwent RHND between 1987 and 2015. Prognostic factors were identified using a Cox regression model. RESULTS: Of 702 patients enrolled in the study, 84 (11.9%) had recurrence. 58, 17, and 9 patients had locoregional, distant, and combined recurrence, respectively. No association between clinicopathologic features and recurrence patterns was observed. Most recurrence patients (63.1%) complained of symptoms prior to examination. The majority of asymptomatic recurrence patients (71.4%) were diagnosed by physical and/or pelvic examination. 5-year overall survival after recurrence (SAR) was 34.3%. On multivariate analysis, pattern of recurrence (p = 0.003), symptom status (p = 0.011), age (p = 0.035), and white blood cell (WBC) count (p = 0.017) were independent prognostic factors for overall SAR. CONCLUSION: Only pattern of recurrence, symptom status, age, and WBC count were found to be prognostic factors in recurrent cervical cancer after RHND. Follow-up programs after RHND should be directed toward early detection of recurrence.
27855373	Effects of Propofol on Several Membrane Characteristics of Cervical Cancer Cell Lines.	BACKGROUND: Although significant advances have been made toward understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the effect of propofol on tumor cell metastasis, less is known regarding how cell membrane and cytoskeletal ultrastructure are affected in this process. Here, we investigated the relationship between cell morphology and cell size, which are features mainly defined by the cytoskeleton. METHODS: To confirm the effects of propofol on the migratory ability of human cervical carcinoma cells, cell migration and invasion were examined through scratch wound healing and transwell membrane assays. Furthermore, HeLa cells cultivated with different concentrations of propofol were examined by confocal microscopy and atomic force microscopy (AFM), and the mean optical density and migration ability of these cells were also assessed. In addition, cell membrane morphology was inspected using AFM. RESULTS: The results of the wound healing and transwell membrane assays indicated that propofol decreases the migratory ability of cervical carcinoma cells compared to control cells. A comparative analysis of the test results revealed that short-term (3 h) exposure to propofol induced marked changes in cell membrane microstructure and in the cytoskeleton in a dose-dependent manner. These morphological changes in the cell membrane were accompanied by cytoskeleton (F-actin) derangement. The present findings demonstrate a close relationship between changes in cell membrane ultrastructure and cytoskeletal alterations (F-actin) in propofol-treated HeLa cells. AFM scanning analysis showed that cell membrane ultrastructure was significantly changed, including a clear reduction in membrane roughness. CONCLUSION: The influence of propofol on the HeLa cell cytoskeleton can be directly reflected by changes in cellular morphology, as assessed by AFM. Moreover, the use of AFM is a good method for investigating propofol-mediated changes within cytoskeletal ultrastructure.
27854258	Antiproliferative, Cytotoxic, and Apoptotic Activity of Steroidal Oximes in Cervicouterine Cell Lines.	Steroidal sapogenins have shown antiproliferative effects against several tumor cell lines; and their effects on human cancer cells are currently under study. Changes in the functionality on the steroidal structure make it possible to modify the biological activity of compounds. Herein, we report the synthesis and in vitro antitumor activity of two steroidal oxime compounds on cervical cancer cells. These derivatives were synthesized from the steroidal sapogenin diosgenin in good yields. The in vitro assays show that the steroidal oximes show significant antiproliferative activity compared to the one observed for diosgenin. Cell proliferation, cell death, and the cytotoxic effects were determined in both cervical cancer cells and human lymphocytes. The cancer cells showed apoptotic morphology and an increased presence of active caspase-3, providing the notion of a death pathway in the cell. Significantly, the steroidal oximes did not exert a cytotoxic effect on lymphocytes.
27852183	Trends in cancer incidence and survival for Indigenous and non-Indigenous people in the Northern Territory.	OBJECTIVE: To assess trends in cancer incidence and survival for Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians in the Northern Territory. DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of population-based cancer registration data. SETTING: New cancer diagnoses in the NT, 1991-2012. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Age-adjusted incidence rates; rate ratios comparing incidence in NT Indigenous and non-Indigenous populations with that for other Australians; 5-year survival; multivariable Poisson regression of excess mortality. RESULTS: The incidence of most cancers in the NT non-Indigenous population was similar to that for other Australians. For the NT Indigenous population, the incidence of cancer at several sites was much higher (v other Australians: lung, 84% higher; head and neck, 325% higher; liver, 366% higher; cervix, 120% higher). With the exception of cervical cancer (65% decrease), incidence rates in the Indigenous population did not fall between 1991-1996 and 2007-2012. The incidence of several other cancers (breast, bowel, prostate, melanoma) was much lower in 1991-1996 than for other Australians, but had increased markedly by 2007-2012 (breast, 274% increase; bowel, 120% increase; prostate, 116% increase). Five-year survival was lower for NT Indigenous than for NT non-Indigenous patients, but had increased for both populations between 1991-2000 and 2001-2010. CONCLUSION: The incidence of several cancers that were formerly less common in NT Indigenous people has increased, without a concomitant reduction in the incidence of higher incidence cancers (several of which are smoking-related). The excess burden of cancer in this population will persist until lifestyle risks are mitigated, particularly by reducing the extraordinarily high prevalence of smoking.
27851696	A Comparison of the Strength of Association of Reid Colposcopic Index and Swede Score With Cervical Histology.	OBJECTIVE: Colposcopic scoring systems provide an objective diagnosis and select patients who require treatment. A new scoring system, Swede score, has added lesion size as a parameter. This study aimed to compare the strength of association of Reid colposcopic index versus Swede score and assess their utility in low-resource settings. METHODS: In this prospective study, 150 women aged 30 to 59 years with abnormal screening result were enrolled. All women underwent colposcopy; the findings were scored by both Reid colposcopic index and Swede score, biopsy taken from all abnormal areas. Performances of both the scores were calculated. RESULTS: A total of 33 (22%) CIN 2+ lesions were detected. Reid colposcopic index at a cutoff of 5 had sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value for detecting CIN2+ lesions of 96.97%, 95.35%, 88.89%, and 98.8%, respectively. Using Swede score at a cutoff of 8, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were 42.42%, 100%, 100%, and 81.9%, and with a cutoff of 5, these were 100%, 88.37%, 76.74%, and 100%, respectively. The correlation coefficient (R) was 0.919. By Spearman rank correlation coefficient, the strength of correlation between Swede score and RCI was 0.937 (p < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Swede score can be used flexibly depending on the setting. The lower threshold (5) with high sensitivity can be used for screening, whereas the higher threshold (8) with high specificity can be used for screen-and-treat selection to decrease the overtreatment rate. Thus, it is a more attractive option for cancer prevention programs in low-resource settings.
27851695	Evaluation of Viral Load as a Triage Strategy With Primary High-Risk Human Papillomavirus Cervical Cancer Screening.	OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to evaluate the human papillomavirus (HPV) viral load combined with cytology as a secondary screening strategy after primary HPV screening. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The data referring to direct Hybrid Capture 2 (HC2), cytology, and histology from Shenzhen Cervical Cancer Screening Trial II were re-analyzed to determine the correlation between viral load and cervical lesions. In addition, algorithms using different viral loads as cut points for immediate colposcopy plus cytology triage were compared with several recommended or controversial primary screening methods. RESULTS: A total of 8,556 women with a mean age of 38.9 years were included in the analysis, of which 13.67% tested high-risk HPV positive with a prevalence of 2.72% for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2+ (CIN 2+) and 1.65% for CIN 3+. A significant correlation was observed between increasing relative light units/control (RLU/CO) values and worsening cervical lesions. The mean RLU/CO values for negative, CIN 1, CIN 2, CIN 3, and cancer were 6.86, 119.43, 410.90, 449.39, and 853.26, respectively. A larger proportion of HPV infections with relative high viral load (>/=10 RLU/CO) were found in higher-grade lesions. The algorithm using 10 or greater RLU/CO as cut point for immediate colposcopy followed by triage cytology for the other positive (>/=1 < 10 RLU/CO) had sensitivity of 93.13%/96.45% and specificity of 92.32%/91.44% for CIN 2+/3+, and the colposcopy referral rate was 10.00%. CONCLUSIONS: Human papillomavirus viral load level is positively associated with cervical lesion grade. Ten relative light units/control or greater is a viable threshold for immediate colposcopy whereas 1 or greater or less than 10 RLU/CO is advised to reflex cytology for optimizing sensitivity and specificity, as well as referral rates.
27843945	beta-Catenin Expression Negatively Correlates with WIF1 and Predicts Poor Clinical Outcomes in Patients with Cervical Cancer.	Aberrant activation of the canonical Wnt pathway plays a significant role in cervical cancer (CC). However, limited data show the correlation between the cancer clinicopathological characteristics and the key molecules such as beta-catenin and Wnt inhibitory factor 1 (WIF1). In this study, beta-catenin and WIF1 expression were analyzed by immunohistochemistry for 196 patients with CC, 39 with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), and 41 with normal cervical epithelium (NCE). Significant overexpression of beta-catenin was detected in CC (67.9%) when compared to CIN (43.6%) or NCE (34.1%), p < 0.01, while low WIF1 expression was detected in CC (24.0%) when compared to CIN (59.0%) or NCE (58.5%), p < 0.001. Negative correlation was shown between beta-catenin and WIF1 expression (r = -0.637, p < 0.001). In addition, multivariate analysis revealed that both lymph node metastasis and beta-catenin expression were the independent prognostic factors not only for disease-free survival (HR = 5.029, p < 0.001; HR = 2.588, p = 0.035, resp.), but also for overall survival (HR = 5.058, p < 0.001; HR = 2.873, p = 0.031, resp.). Our findings indicate that, besides lymph node metastasis, beta-catenin expression may also be a poor prognostic factor for CC while WIF1 could be a potential drug target for treatment of advanced CC.
27842663	Can Diffusion-weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging Predict Survival in Patients with Cervical Cancer? A Meta-Analysis.	OBJECTIVE: Although diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI) has been widely used in the diagnosis of cervical cancer, whether it can predict disease recurrence or survival remains inconclusive. This study aimed to systematically evaluate whether DWI can serve as a reliable prognostic predictor in patients with cervical cancer. METHODS: PubMed, the MEDLINE database and the Cochrane Library were searched for DWI studies with >12 months of prognostic data in patients with cervical cancer. Endpoints included tumor recurrence and death. Methodological quality was assessed using the Quality in Prognostic Studies (QUIPS) tool. Combined estimates of hazard ratios (HRs) were derived. RESULTS: Nine studies involving a total of 796 patients (mean/median age from 45.0 years to 62.9 years) met the inclusion criteria. Methodological quality was relatively high. Eight of the nine studies employed apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) as an indicator of DWI results. Using disease-free survival (DFS) as an outcome measure, nine studies yielded a combined HR of 1.55 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.23-1.95), and seven studies that employed pretreatment DWI yielded a combined HR of 1.50 (95% CI: 1.03-2.19), which indicated that unfavorable DWI results were associated with an approximately 1.50-1.55-fold higher risk of tumor recurrence. The two studies investigating the impact of DWI results on overall survival (OS) reported HRs of 7.20 and 2.17, respectively. CONCLUSION: DWI may serve as a predictor of tumor recurrence in patients with cervical cancer as showed by meta-analysis, and the quantified ADC as a suitable candidate indicator.
27842536	Antibacterial and cytotoxic cytochalasins from the endophytic fungus Phomopsis sp. harbored in Garcinia kola (Heckel) nut.	BACKGROUND: The continuous emergence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria drastically reduced the efficacy of our antibiotic armory and consequently, increased the frequency of therapeutic failure. The search for bioactive constituents from endophytic fungi against MDR bacteria became a necessity for alternative and promising strategies, and for the development of novel therapeutic solutions. We report here the isolation and structure elucidation of antibacterial and cytotoxic compounds from Phomopsis sp., an endophytic fungus associated with Garcinia kola nuts. METHODS: The fungus Phomopsis sp. was isolated from the nut of Garcinia kola. The crude extract was prepared from mycelium of Phomopsis sp. by maceration in ethyl acetate and sequentially fractionated by column chromatography. The structures of isolated compounds were elucidated on the basis of spectral studies and comparison with published data. The isolated compounds were evaluated for their antibacterial and anticancer properties by broth microdilution and 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide methods respectively. The samples were also tested spectrophotometrically for their hemolytic properties against human red blood cells. RESULTS: The fractionation of the crude extract afforded three known cytochalasins including 18-metoxycytochalasin J (1), cytochalasins H (2) and J (3) together with alternariol (4). The cytochalasin compounds showed different degrees of antibacterial activities against the tested bacterial pathogens. Shigella flexneri was the most sensitive microorganism while Vibrio cholerae SG24 and Vibrio cholerae PC2 were the most resistant. Ampicillin did not show any antibacterial activity against Vibrio cholerae NB2, Vibrio cholerae PC2 and Shigella flexneri at concentrations up to 512 mug/mL, but interestingly, these multi-drug resistant bacterial strains were sensitive to the cytochalasin metabolites. These compounds also showed significant cytotoxic properties against human cancer cells (LC50 = 3.66-35.69 mug/mL) with low toxicity to normal non-cancer cells. CONCLUSION: The three cytochalasin compounds isolated from the Phomopsis sp. crude extract could be a clinically useful alternative for the treatment of cervical cancer and severe infections caused by MDR Shigella and Vibrio cholerae.
27842324	Black Heterogeneity in Cancer Mortality: US-Blacks, Haitians, and Jamaicans.	INTRODUCTION: The quantitative intraracial burden of cancer incidence, survival and mortality within black populations in the United States is virtually unknown. METHODS: We computed cancer mortality rates of US- and Caribbean-born residents of Florida, specifically focusing on black populations (United States, Haiti, Jamaica) and compared them using age-adjusted mortality ratios obtained from Poisson regression models. We compared the mortality of Haitians and Jamaicans residing in Florida to populations in their countries of origin using Globocan. RESULTS: We analyzed 185,113 cancer deaths from 2008 to 2012, of which 20,312 occurred in black populations. The overall risk of death from cancer was 2.1 (95% CI: 1.97-2.17) and 1.6 (95% CI: 1.55-1.71) times higher for US-born blacks than black Caribbean men and women, respectively (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Race alone is not a determinant of cancer mortality. Among all analyzed races and ethnicities, including Whites and Hispanics, US-born blacks had the highest mortality rates while black Caribbeans had the lowest. The biggest intraracial difference was observed for lung cancer, for which US-blacks had nearly 4 times greater mortality risk than black Caribbeans. Migration from the islands of Haiti and Jamaica to Florida resulted in lower cancer mortality for most cancers including cervical, stomach, and prostate, but increased or stable mortality for 2 obesity-related cancers, colorectal and endometrial cancers. Mortality results in Florida suggest that US-born blacks have the highest incidence rate of "aggressive" prostate cancer in the world, rather than Caribbean men.

27841128	Management of thyroid cancer: United Kingdom National Multidisciplinary Guidelines.	This is the official guideline endorsed by the specialty associations involved in the care of head and neck cancer patients in the UK. This paper provides recommendations on the management of thyroid cancer in adults and is based on the 2014 British Thyroid Association guidelines. Recommendations * Ultrasound scanning (USS) of the nodule or goitre is a crucial investigation in guiding the need for fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC). (R) * FNAC should be considered for all nodules with suspicious ultrasound features (U3-U5). If a nodule is smaller than 10 mm in diameter, USS guided FNAC is not recommended unless clinically suspicious lymph nodes on USS are also present. (R) * Cytological analysis and categorisation should be reported according to the current British Thyroid Association Guidance. (R) * Ultrasound scanning assessment of cervical nodes should be done in FNAC-proven cancer. (R) * Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) should be done in suspected cases of retrosternal extension, fixed tumours (local invasion with or without vocal cord paralysis) or when haemoptysis is reported. When CT with contrast is used pre-operatively, there should be a two-month delay between the use of iodinated contrast media and subsequent radioactive iodine (I131) therapy. (R) * Fluoro-deoxy-glucose positron emission tomography imaging is not recommended for routine evaluation. (G) * In patients with thyroid cancer, assessment of extrathyroidal extension and lymph node disease in the central and lateral neck compartments should be undertaken pre-operatively by USS and cross-sectional imaging (CT or MRI) if indicated. (R) * For patients with Thy 3f or Thy 4 FNAC a diagnostic hemithyroidectomy is recommended. (R) * Total thyroidectomy is recommended for patients with tumours greater than 4 cm in diameter or tumours of any size in association with any of the following characteristics: multifocal disease, bilateral disease, extrathyroidal spread (pT3 and pT4a), familial disease and those with clinically or radiologically involved nodes and/or distant metastases. (R) * Subtotal thyroidectomy should not be used in the management of thyroid cancer. (G) * Central compartment neck dissection is not routinely recommended for patients with papillary thyroid cancer without clinical or radiological evidence of lymph node involvement, provided they meet all of the following criteria: classical type papillary thyroid cancer, patient less than 45 years old, unifocal tumour, less than 4 cm, no extrathyroidal extension on ultrasound. (R) * Patients with metastases in the lateral compartment should undergo therapeutic lateral and central compartment neck dissection. (R) * Patients with follicular cancer with greater than 4 cm tumours should be treated with total thyroidectomy. (R) * I131 ablation should be carried out only in centres with appropriate facilities. (R) * Serum thyroglobulin (Tg) should be checked in all post-operative patients with differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC), but not sooner than six weeks after surgery. (R) * Patients who have undergone total or near total thyroidectomy should be started on levothyroxine 2 microg per kg or liothyronine 20 mcg tds after surgery. (R) * The majority of patients with a tumour more than 1 cm in diameter, who have undergone total or near-total thyroidectomy, should have I131 ablation. (R) * A post-ablation scan should be performed 3-10 days after I131 ablation. (R) * Post-therapy dynamic risk stratification at 9-12 months is used to guide further management. (G) * Potentially resectable recurrent or persistent disease should be managed with surgery whenever possible. (R) * Distant metastases and sites not amenable to surgery which are iodine avid should be treated with I131 therapy. (R) * Long-term follow-up for patients with differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) is recommended. (G) * Follow-up should be based on clinical examination, serum Tg and thyroid-stimulating hormone assessments. (R) * Patients with suspected medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) should be investigated with calcitonin and carcino-embryonic antigen levels (CEA), 24 hour catecholamine and nor metanephrine urine estimation (or plasma free nor metanephrine estimation), serum calcium and parathyroid hormone. (R) * Relevant imaging studies are advisable to guide the extent of surgery. (R) * RET (Proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase receptor) proto-oncogene analysis should be performed after surgery. (R) * All patients with known or suspected MTC should have serum calcitonin and biochemical screening for phaeochromocytoma pre-operatively. (R) * All patients with proven MTC greater than 5 mm should undergo total thyroidectomy and central compartment neck dissection. (R) * Patients with MTC with lateral nodal involvement should undergo selective neck dissection (IIa-Vb). (R) * Patients with MTC with central node metastases should undergo ipsilateral prophylactic lateral node dissection. (R) * Prophylactic thyroidectomy should be offered to RET-positive family members. (R) * All patients with proven MTC should have genetic screening. (R) * Radiotherapy may be useful in controlling local symptoms in patients with inoperable disease. (R) * Chemotherapy with tyrosine kinase inhibitors may help in controlling local symptoms. (R) * For individuals with anaplastic thyroid carcinoma, initial assessment should focus on identifying the small proportion of patients with localised disease and good performance status, which may benefit from surgical resection and other adjuvant therapies. (G) * The surgical intent should be gross tumour resection and not merely an attempt at debulking. (G).
27840931	Combined antitumor activity of the nitroreductase/CB1954 suicide gene system and gamma-rays in HeLa cells in vitro.	Escherichia coli nitroreductase (NTR) may convert the prodrug CB1954 (5-(aziridin-1-yl)-2,4-dinitrobenzamide) into a bifunctional alkylating agent, which may lead to DNA crosslinks and the apoptosis of cancer cells. NTR/CB1954 has been demonstrated to be an effective gene therapy in cancer cells. The present study examined whether the NTR/CB1954 suicide gene system had cytotoxic effects on HeLa cells and may improve the radiosensitivity of HeLa cells to gammarays. It was observed that the NTR/CB1954 suicide gene system exerted marked cytotoxic effects on HeLa cells. The combined therapeutic effects of NTR/CB1954 and gammarays on HeLa cells demonstrated a synergistic effect. CB1954 at concentrations of 12.5 and 25 micromol/l increased the sensitization enhancement ratio of HeLa cells to 1.54 and 1.66, respectively. Therefore, when compared with monotherapy, the combined therapy of NTR/CB1954 and gammarays may increase the apoptotic rate and enhance the radiosensitivity of HeLa cells. The combined therapy of gammaray radiation and the NTR/CB1954 suicide gene system may be a novel and potent therapeutic method for the treatment of cervical carcinoma.
27837716	Probing mucin interaction behavior of magnetic nanoparticles.	In this study, we developed iron oxide based magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) by precipitation of iron salts in the presence of ammonia and created four different formulations: without functionality (plain MNPs, no coating), with beta-cyclodextrin (MNPs+beta-CD) or pluronic 127 polymer (MNPs+F-127), and both beta-cyclodextrin and pluronic 127 polymer (MNPs+beta-CD-F-127) functionality for its efficient use in mucosal delivery. We studied the interaction and/or binding behavior of these MNPs formulations with porcine stomach mucin using steady-state fluorescence spectroscopy, and then quantified the bound mucin from absorption studies. Toxicity of these MNPs against cervical cancer cells and red blood cells was evaluated. Ex-vivo studies were performed using freshly collected gastrointestinal, ovarian, pancreas and colon organ tissues of pig to evaluate binding and uptake phenomenon of MNPs. Transport studies of these MNPs in mucin was evaluated using Boyden's chamber assay. All these studies together suggest that the MNPs+beta-CD-F-127 formulation was strongly interacted with mucin and interestingly transported through mucin compared to other MNPs formulations. Hence, MNPs+beta-CD-F-127 formulation could be a good candidate for the mucoadhesive biopharmaceuticals and drug delivery system.
27836371	Predictors of nodal metastasis in pediatric differentiated thyroid cancer.	BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: There are limited data identifying risk factors for nodal metastasis in children with differentiated thyroid cancer. METHODS: The 1998-2011 Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program database was queried for patients </=18years of age diagnosed with differentiated thyroid cancer who underwent nodal examination. Patients were grouped by absence or presence of nodal metastasis. Multivariable logistic regression methods were used to identify independent risk factors for nodal metastasis. RESULTS: In total, 1075 children met study criteria: 734 (68%) had nodal metastases, while 341 (32%) did not. After adjustment, risk factors for nodal metastasis included larger tumor size (1.1-2cm: odds ratio [OR] 2.02, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.22-3.34, p=0.006; 2.1-4cm: OR 3.37, 95% CI 2.03-5.60, p<0.001; > 4cm: OR 3.39, 95% CI 1.69-6.81, p=0.001), extrathyroidal extension (OR 7.28, 95% CI 4.07-13.01, p<0.001), and multifocal disease (OR 1.94, 95% CI 1.33-2.84, p=0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Increasing tumor size, extrathyroidal extension, and multifocal disease are independent factors associated with nodal metastases in pediatric differentiated thyroid cancer. If these risk factors are present, children with differentiated thyroid cancer should undergo careful preoperative evaluation for evidence of lateral cervical lymph node metastases, and the central compartment should be evaluated intraoperatively, with consideration of central lymphadenectomy. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III.
27830840	Searching for anti-glioma activity. Ribonucleoside analogues with modifications in nucleobase and sugar moieties.	Several ribonucleoside analogues with modifications in the nucleobase and sugar moiety have been screened for anti-glioma activity in the T98G glioma cell line using cervical (HeLa) cell line as reference human malignant cells, and lung fibroblast (MCR-5) cell line as non-cancerous reference cells. Among the investigated compounds, ribonucleosides containing 6-chloropurine (3), 7-guanine (5) and a pyrrolopyrimidine (18) as nucleobases, show promising anti-glioma activity with good selectivity indices, and can be considered as lead structures for further anti-cancer studies.
27827850	Interferon alpha Induces the Apoptosis of Cervical Cancer HeLa Cells by Activating both the Intrinsic Mitochondrial Pathway and Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress-Induced Pathway.	The interferon alpha (IFN-alpha) has been often used as a sensitizing agent for the treatment of various malignancies such as hepatocellular carcinoma, malignant melanoma, and renal cell cancer by promoting the apoptosis of thesetumor cell types. However, the effect of IFN-alpha on cervical cancer remains unknown. In this study, HeLa cells were used as a testing model for the treatment of IFN-alpha on cervical cancer. The results indicate that IFN-alpha markedly inhibits the proliferation and induces the apoptosis of HeLa cells. The activation of caspase 3, the up-regulation of both Bim and cleaved poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) 1, the down-regulation of Bcl-xL, as well as the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria were significantly induced upon IFN-alpha treatment, indicating that the intrinsic apoptotic pathway could be activated by IFN-alpha treatment. In addition, caspase 4-which is involved in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-induced apoptosis-was activated in response to IFN-alpha treatment. Knocking down caspase 4 by small interfering RNA (siRNA) markedly reduced the IFN-alpha-mediated cell apoptosis. However, no significant changes in the expressions of caspases 8 and 10 were observed upon IFN-alpha treatment, indicating that the apoptosis caused by IFN-alpha might be independent of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway. These findings suggest that IFN-alpha may possess anti-cervical cancer capacity by activating cell apoptosis via the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway and caspase-4-related ER stress-induced pathway.
27826898	Collective cell migration of thyroid carcinoma cells: a beneficial ability to override unfavourable substrates.	PURPOSE: Tumor cell invasion and metastasis are life threatening events. Invasive tumor cells tend to migrate as collective sheets. In the present in vitro study we aimed to (i) assess whether collective tumor cells gain benefits in their migratory potential compared to single cells and (ii) to identify its putative underlying molecular mechanisms. METHODS: The migratory potential of single and collective carcinoma cells was assessed using video time lapse microscopy and cell migration assays in the absence and presence of seven potential gap junction inhibitors or the Rac1 inhibitor Z62954982. The perturbation of gap junctions was assessed using a dye diffusion assay. In addition, LDH-based cytotoxicity and RT-PCR-based expression analyses were performed. RESULTS: Whereas single breast, cervix and thyroid carcinoma cells were virtually immobile on unfavourable plastic surfaces, we found that they gained pronounced migratory capacities as collectives under comparable conditions. Thyroid carcinoma cells, that were studied in more detail, were found to express specific subsets of connexins and to form active gap junctions as revealed by dye diffusion analysis. Although all potential gap junction blockers suppressed intercellular dye diffusion in at least one of the cell lines tested, only two of them were found to inhibit collective cell migration and none of them to inhibit single cell migration. In the presence of the Rac1 inhibitor Z62954982 collective migration, but not single cell migration, was found to be reduced up to 20 %. CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that collective migration enables tumor cells to cross otherwise unfavourable substrate areas. This capacity seems to be independent of intercellular communication via gap junctions, whereas Rac1-dependent intracellular signalling seems to be essential.
27825171	Racial/Ethnic Disparities in Cervical Cancer Screening and Outcomes.	Invasive cervical cancer disproportionately affects women without sufficient access to care, with higher rates among minority groups in higher-income countries and women in low-resource regions of the world. Many elements contribute to racial/ethnic disparities in the cervical cancer continuum - from screening and diagnosis to treatment and outcome. Sociodemographic factors, access to healthcare, income and education level, and disease stage at diagnosis are closely linked to such inequities. Despite the identification of such elements, racial/ethnic disparities persist, and are widening in several minority subgroups, particularly in older women, who are ineligible for human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination and are underscreened. Recent studies suggest that racial/ethnic differences in HPV infection exist and may also have a role in observed differences in cervical cancer. In this review, we provide an overview of the current literature on racial disparities in cervical cancer screening, incidence, treatment and outcome to inform future strategies to reduce persistent inequities.
27824789	Predictors of Persistent or Recurrent Disease After Loop Electrosurgical Excision Procedure.	OBJECTIVE: Follow-up recommendations after an excisional procedure vary depending on whether or not there is a positive ectocervical or endocervical margin or endocervical curettage (ECC). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the importance of these findings in predicting recurrent/persistent (r/p) disease in a sample of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-seropositive and -negative patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Loop electrosurgical excision procedures with a concurrent ECC performed at the Cook County ambulatory clinic between September 29, 2008, and April 15, 2014 were included in this study. Chart review was performed to collect demographic data, pathology results, and all subsequent cytology or histology. We examined the association of these factors with r/p disease using chi and Fisher exact tests as well as log-binomial regression. RESULTS: There were 242 women included for analysis. Of these, 9 LEEP specimens showed invasive cancer or adenocarcinoma in situ, and 15.7% were HIV positive. Mean follow-up was 16.4 months. On bivariate analysis, HIV serostatus, LEEP histology, ectocervical margin, endocervical margin, and ECC were all associated with r/p disease. On multivariate regression, only HIV serostatus and ECC were associated with r/p disease. Among women with either a positive endocervical or ectocervical margin or ECC, the prevalence of r/p disease is 29% if they are HIV negative, and 75% if they are positive. CONCLUSIONS: In our study, ECC seems more predictive of r/p disease than margin status. Most HIV-positive women with positive margins or ECC have r/p disease, whereas most HIV-negative women do not. One should consider HIV serostatus when deciding whether or not to perform repeat excision.
27824788	Screening History in 313 Cases of Invasive Cancer: A Retrospective Review of Cervical Cancer Screening in Alberta, Canada.	OBJECTIVE: To examine the screening history of invasive cervical cancer (ICC) cases in Alberta, Canada to identify areas for improvement of the population-based cervical cancer screening program. METHODS: Retrospective review of ICC cases diagnosed in 2 cities in Alberta between 2007 and 2012. Cancer morphology and staging were elicited from the Alberta Cancer Registry; cancer screening history and Pap test results were extracted from the Provincial Cervical Cancer Screening database. Women were classified as adequately screened, underscreened, and unscreened depending on time from last screening Pap test to diagnosis. RESULTS: Of the 280 cases that occurred in women eligible for screening, 125 (44.6%) were adequately screened, 18 (6.4%) were underscreened, and 137 (49%) were unscreened. Among the adequately screened, 71 (56.8%) had normal Pap test results, but 48 (38%) had less than 3 previous Pap tests (p = .003). Cancer stages I to II were diagnosed in 48.8% and 44.1% of adequately screened and unscreened women and cancer stages III to IV in 30.6% and 66.1% in each group, respectively (p = .0058). Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) was diagnosed in 189 women (67.5%). The proportion of SCCs was similar in adequately screened and unscreened women. CONCLUSIONS: The proportion of SCCs and advanced stages of ICC seems to be decreased. The results of quality improvement initiatives such as enhanced surveillance of high-grade Pap test results and histology-cytology correlation will be monitored and are expected to result in better outcomes for adequately screened women.
27824003	IkappaB kinase b Mediating the Downregulation of p53 and p21 by Lipopolysaccharide in Human Papillomavirus 16+ Cervical Cancer Cells.	BACKGROUND: Cervical cancer is the second most common cancer of woman in the world, and human papillomavirus (HPV) infection plays an important role in the development of most of the cases. IkappaB kinase beta (IKKbeta) is a kinase-mediating nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) activation by phosphorylating the inhibitor of NF-kappaB (IkappaB) and is related by some diseases caused by virus infection. However, there is little known about the correlation between IKKbeta and HPV infection in cervical cancer. This study aimed to investigate the expression of IKKbeta protein in cervical cancer tissues and effects of inflammation on HPV positive or negative cervical cancer cells through detecting the expression of IKKbeta, IkappaBalpha, p53, and p21 proteins after treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to mimic bacterial infection. We also examined the effects of LPS on cervical cancer cells after blocking IKKbeta with pharmacological inhibitor. METHODS: Thirty-six matched specimens of cervical cancer and adjacent normal tissues were collected and analyzed in the study. The expression of IKKbeta in the tissue specimens was determined by immunohistochemical staining. In addition, Western blot was used to detect the expression level changes of IKKbeta, IkappaBalpha, p53, and p21 after LPS stimulated in the HPV16+ (SiHa) and HPV16- (C33A) cervical cancer cell lines. Furthermore, the effects of IKKbeta inhibitor SC-514 on LPS-induced expression change of these proteins were investigated. RESULTS: The expression of IKKbeta was higher in cervical cancer than adjacent normal tissues, and there was no significant difference between tumor differentiation, size, and invasive depth with IKKbeta expression. The LPS, which increased the expression level of IKKbeta protein but decreased in the IkappaBalpha, p53 and p21 proteins, was illustrated in HPV16+ (SiHa) but not in HPV16- (C33A) cells. Moreover, IKKbeta inhibitor SC-514 totally reversed the upregulation of IKKbeta and downregulation of p53 and p21 by LPS in SiHa cells. CONCLUSIONS: IKKbeta may mediate the downregulation of p53 and p21 by LPS in HPV16+ cervical cancer cells.
27823742	Nerve-sparing radical hysterectomy versus conventional radical hysterectomy in early-stage cervical cancer. A systematic review and meta-analysis of survival and quality of life.	BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Survival after radical hysterectomy (RH) for early-stage cervical cancer is good. Hence quality of life (QOL) after treatment is an important issue. Nerve-sparing radical hysterectomy (NSRH) improves QOL by selectively sparing innervation of bladder, bowel and vagina, reducing therapy-induced morbidity. However, the oncological outcome and the functional outcome after NSRH are subjects of debate. We aim to present the best possible evidence available regarding both QOL and survival after NSRH in early-stage cervical cancer. METHODS: Systematic review and meta-analysis on studies comparing NSRH and RH. RESULTS: Forty-one studies were included, and 27 were used for the meta-analysis. There was no difference in 2-, 3- and 5-year overall survival: the risk ratios (RRs) were respectively 1.02 (95% CI 0.99-1.05, n=879), 1.01 (95% CI 0.95-1.08, n=1324) and 1.03 (95% CI 0.99-1.08, n=638). No difference was found in 2-, 3- and 5-year disease-free survival: RR 1.01 (95% CI 0.95-1.05, n=1175), 0.99 (95% CI 0.94-1.03, n=1130) and 1.00 (95% CI 0.95-1.06, n=933) respectively. Post-operative time to micturition was significantly shorter in the NSRH group: standardized mean difference (SMD) -0.84 (CI 95% -1.07 to -0.60). CONCLUSIONS: NSRH can be considered safe and effective for early-stage cervical cancer since short- and long-term survival do not differ from those of conventional RH, while bladder function after NSRH is significantly less impaired.
27822040	Raspberry-like poly(gamma-glutamic acid) hydrogel particles for pH-dependent cell membrane passage and controlled cytosolic delivery of antitumor drugs.	In this research, we synthesized bioderived poly(amino acid) hydrogel particles that showed pH-dependent membrane-disrupting properties and controlled cytosolic delivery of antitumor drugs. Poly(gamma-glutamic acid) (gamma-PGA) that has been produced extensively using bacteria, especially those of Bacillus subtilis species, was modified with cholesterol (gamma-PGA/Chol), and the gamma-PGA/Chol conjugates were used to form polymeric nanoparticles the size of 21.0+/-1.1 nm in aqueous solution. When the polymeric nanoparticles were mixed with doxorubicin (Dox), raspberry-like hydrogel particles (RBHPs) were formed by the electrostatic interaction between the cationically charged Dox and the anionically charged nanoparticles. The average size and surface charge of the RBHPs in aqueous solution were 444.9+/-122.5 nm and -56.44 mV, respectively. The loaded amount of Dox was approximately 63.9 mug/mg of RBHPs. The RBHPs showed controlled drug release behavior in both in vitro and ex vivo cell-based experiments. Through fluorescence microscopy and fluorescence-activated cell sorting, the cellular uptake of RBHPs into human cervical cancer cells (HeLa) was analyzed. The cytotoxic effect, evaluated by the methyl tetrazolium salt assay, was dependent on both the concentration of RBHPs and the treatment time. The pH-dependent membrane-disrupting properties of the RBHPs and the subsequent cytosolic delivery of Dox were evaluated using a standard hemolysis assay. Upon an increase in hydrophobicity at the lysosomal acidic pH, RBHPs could easily interact, penetrate cell membranes, and destabilize them. Taken together, the data suggested that RBHPs could be used as drug delivery carriers after loading with other therapeutic drugs, such as proteins or small interfering RNA for cancer therapy.
27821538	Cardiac Mortality Among 200 000 Five-Year Survivors of Cancer Diagnosed at 15 to 39 Years of Age: The Teenage and Young Adult Cancer Survivor Study.	BACKGROUND: Survivors of teenage and young adult cancer are acknowledged as understudied. Little is known about their long-term adverse health risks, particularly of cardiac disease that is increased in other cancer populations where cardiotoxic treatments have been used. METHODS: The Teenage and Young Adult Cancer Survivor Study cohort comprises 200 945 5-year survivors of cancer diagnosed at 15 to 39 years of age in England and Wales from 1971 to 2006, and followed to 2014. Standardized mortality ratios, absolute excess risks, and cumulative risks were calculated. RESULTS: Two thousand sixteen survivors died of cardiac disease. For all cancers combined, the standardized mortality ratios for all cardiac diseases combined was greatest for individuals diagnosed at 15 to 19 years of age (4.2; 95% confidence interval, 3.4-5.2) decreasing to 1.2 (95% confidence interval, 1.1-1.3) for individuals aged 35 to 39 years (2P for trend <0.0001). Similar patterns were observed for both standardized mortality ratios and absolute excess risks for ischemic heart disease, valvular heart disease, and cardiomyopathy. Survivors of Hodgkin lymphoma, acute myeloid leukaemia, genitourinary cancers other than bladder cancer, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, lung cancer, leukaemia other than acute myeloid, central nervous system tumour, cervical cancer, and breast cancer experienced 3.8, 2.7, 2.0, 1.7, 1.7, 1.6, 1.4, 1.3 and 1.2 times the number of cardiac deaths expected from the general population, respectively. Among survivors of Hodgkin lymphoma aged over 60 years, almost 30% of the total excess number of deaths observed were due to heart disease. CONCLUSIONS: This study of over 200 000 cancer survivors shows that age at cancer diagnosis was critical in determining subsequent cardiac mortality risk. For the first time, risk estimates of cardiac death after each cancer diagnosed between the ages of 15 and 39 years have been derived from a large population-based cohort with prolonged follow-up. The evidence here provides an initial basis for developing evidence-based follow-up guidelines.
27821180	Utility of SUVmax on 18 F-FDG PET in detecting cervical nodal metastases.	BACKGROUND: The presence of cervical lymph node metastasis is an important prognostic factor for patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC). Accurate assessment of lymph node metastasis in these patients is essential for appropriate prognostic and management purposes. Here, we evaluated the effectiveness of the maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) on positron emission tomography (PET) in assessing lymph node metastasis in HNSCC prior to surgery. METHODS: A retrospective review of 74 patients with HNSCC who underwent PET/CT prior to neck dissection were examined. Pre-operative PET/CT scans were reviewed by two experienced nuclear medicine physicians and SUVmax of the largest node in each nodal basin documented. These were compared with the histology results of the neck dissection. RESULTS: A total of 359 nodal basins including 86 basins with metastatic nodes were evaluated. A nodal SUVmax >/=3.16 yielded a sensitivity of 74.4 % and specificity of 84.9 % in detecting metastatic nodes. The nodal SUVmax/Liver SUVmax ratio was found on receiver operating characteristic (ROC) to be effective in detecting metastatic nodes with an area under ROC curve of 0.90. A nodal SUVmax/Liver SUVmax ratio >/=0.90 yielded a sensitivity of 74.1 % and specificity of 93.4 %. By comparison, visual inspection yielded sensitivities of 66.3 and 61.6 % in observers 1 and 2 respectively. The corresponding specificities were 77.7 and 86.5 %. CONCLUSIONS: Nodal SUVmax and nodal SUVmax/liver SUVmax are both useful in the pre-operative detection of metastatic nodes with the latter being superior to visual inspection. The ratio is likely to be more useful as it corrects for inter-scanner variability.
27819855	18F-FDG Imaging of Chronic Inflammation Associated With Promontofixation of the Uterus.	A high F-FDG uptake was found in a mesh of promontofixation in a 74-year-old woman who underwent a PET/CT scan for initial staging of cervical cancer. The patient underwent a laparoscopic treatment for a prolapsed uterus 7 years before. Promontofixation can be associated with complications due to chronic inflammation. F-FDG-PET may diagnose chronic inflammation of the mesh.
27819679	ZNF750 is a lineage-specific tumour suppressor in squamous cell carcinoma.	ZNF750 controls epithelial homeostasis by regulating epidermal-differentiation genes, a role underscored by its pathogenic mutations in esophageal squamous cell cancers (SCCs). However, the precise role of ZNF750 in SCC cell biology remains unclear. In this study, we report that ZNF750 is exclusively deleted, mutated and underexpressed in human SCCs, and low ZNF750 expression is associated with poor survival. Restoration of wildtype, but not mutant ZNF750 protein uniquely inhibited the malignant phenotypes of SCC cells both in vitro and in vivo. Notably, ZNF750 promoted the expression of a long non-coding RNA (TINCR), which mediated both cancer-inhibition and differentiation-induction effects of ZNF750. In addition, ZNF750 potently suppressed cell migration by directly inhibiting the transactivation of LAMC2. Together, our findings characterize ZNF750 as a crucial SCC-specific suppressor and uncover its novel anticancer-associated functions.

27816982	Cytology at the Time of HPV: Some Things to Think about when Discussing HPV.	'In the current 28 Member States of the European Union (EU), approximately 34,000 new cases of cervical cancer and 13,000 deaths occur' [Ferlay et al.: Eur J Cancer 2014;49:1374-1403]. 'The current 10-fold gradient in the mortality rates of cervical cancer among the EU Member States largely reflects the persistent absence, or inadequate implementation of cervical cancer screening programmes more than 10 years after organized, population-based screening programmes following European quality assurance guidelines were unanimously recommended by the Health Ministers of the EU' [Council of the European Union: Off J Eur Union 2003;327:34-38]. This article will compare the strengths, weaknesses and risks of the following 4 cervical health screening strategies: HPV as a triage of cytology, cytology as a triage of HPV, cotesting (parallel) or cytology at the time of HPV (HPV-informed guided screening). 'The optimal screening strategy should identify those cervical cancer precursors likely to progress to invasive cancers (maximizing the benefits of screening) and avoid the detection and unnecessary treatment of transient HPV infection and its associated benign lesions that are not destined to become cancerous (minimizing the potential harms of screening)' [Saslow et al.: Am J Clin Pathol 2012;137:516-542].
27816641	Development and evaluation of topotecan loaded solid lipid nanoparticles: A study in cervical cancer cell lines.	The study aims at statistical development of solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) loaded with topotecan hydrochloride for avoiding the drawbacks of conventional drug therapies used in cervical cancer. Twenty SLN batches were prepared using organic solvent evaporation method to provide response surface curves. Thereafter, optimized SLNs were obtained using numeric method based on desirability functions providing maximum drug loading and appropriate particle size. Physical characterization of optimized TPH loaded SLNs was performed in terms of particle size, zeta potential, transmission and scanning electron microscopic evaluation. Cytotoxicity studies were performed against cervical cancer cell lines, including cervical squamous cell carcinoma cell line (HeLa) and human squamous cell carcinoma cell line (SiHa). Also, Swiss mouse embryo fibroblast cells (3T3-L1) and African green monkey kidney epithelial (Vero) cells were used to evaluate biocompatibility in normal cells. As pronounced from the results, optimized SLNs may provide an attractive alternative to conventional cervical cancer drug products.
27815812	Sentinel-node mapping in endometrial cancer patients: comparing SPECT/CT, gamma-probe and dye.	OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to compare preoperative SPECT/CT with gamma-probe and methylene blue-dye (MBD) in the identification of sentinel lymph node (SLN) in early stage endometrial cancer. METHODS: 40 stage-I EC patients (66.7 +/- 9.7 years) underwent preoperative lymphoscintigraphy. After about 3 h from Tc-99m-albumin nanocolloid cervical injection, all patients underwent SPECT/CT study. MBD was injected into the cervix just before surgery under general anesthesia. All patients underwent SLN biopsy, hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, and radical regional lymphadenectomy. SPECT/CT findings were compared to those of gamma-probe and MBD techniques. RESULTS: In 2 patients no nodal migration was observed, neither with MBD nor radiotracer. Detection rate of at least one SLN was 90% (36/40 patients) with SPECT/CT, 88% (35/40) intra-operatively with gamma-probe and 80% (32/40) with MBD. Only in 7/40 patients a bilateral migration was obtained with all considered modalities. In particular, bilateral detection was achieved in 26 patients with SPECT/CT, in 24 with gamma-probe and in 10 patients with MBD. The concordance site between SPECT/CT and intraoperative gamma-probe was 73% (29/40 patients: 2 without migration, 21 bilateral and 6 monolateral SLNs); while concordance site with MBD was found in 40% (16/40: 8 bilateral, 6 monolateral SLNs, 2 without SLNs). Overall, 628 LNs were dissected (mean 18 LNs per patient). The median number of SLNs removed was 2 (mean 2.5 per patient). Out of 91 SLNs: 43 were "hot and blue (HB)", 10 were blue only and 38 were hot only. LN metastases rate was 16%: 9/90 SLNs (7 HB, 2 hot only) were positive for metastases in 6 patients. Four non-SLNs were found positive in 3 patients, and all presented concomitant positive SLNs. False negative rate was 0%. CONCLUSIONS: SPECT/CT had the highest detection rate and achieved the highest rate of bilateral mapping, compared to gamma-probe and MDB. SPECT/CT had moderate concordance with gamma-probe, and it can help the intraoperative detection of SLNs providing important information about their anatomic location.
27814768	Impact of 3T multiparametric MRI and FDG-PET-CT in the evaluation of occult primary cancer with cervical node metastasis.	BACKGROUND: This study aimed to determine the ability of multimodal evaluation with multiparametric 3T-MRI (MPMRI) and positron emission tomography - computed tomography (PET/CT) to detect cancer of unknown primary origin (CUP) with neck lymph node (LN) metastasis. METHODS: The study group comprised 38 retrospectively analysed consecutive patients with LN metastasis in the head and neck (HN) region without known primary tumours (PTs). Statistical values of 3T-MRI and of FDG-PET/CT scans were evaluated. RESULTS: Of the 38 CUPs, conventional native T1-, T2-weighted and STIR sequences detected 6 PTs. Native sequences plus diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) found 14-, and with fat suppression contrast-enhanced T1-weighted measurement as well as with the complex MPMRI found 15 primaries and with PET/CT 17 CUPs could be evaluated, respectively. The detection rates were 15.8, 36.8, 39.5, 39.5 and 44.7 % for conventional native MRI, native plus DWI, native with contrast-enhanced MRI (CE-MRI), for MPMRI, and for PET/CT, respectively. The overall detection rate proved by histology was 47.4 %. PET/CT provided the highest sensitivity (Sv: 94.4 %) but a lower specificity (Sp: 65.0 %), using MPMRI (Sv: 88.2 %) the specificity increased to 71.4 %. DWIincreased specificity of the native sequences (Sp: 76.2 %). Conventional native sequences plus DWI as well as 3T-MPMRI and PET/CT were same accurate (Acc: 79.0 %) and had similar likelihood ratio (LR: 3.42, 3.03 and 2.62) in detecting unknown PT sites. CONCLUSIONS: The accuracy of FDG-PET/CT and MPMRI in case of CUP in finding the primary cancer in the neck regions is identical. While using PET/CT whole body information can be obtained in one examination. MPMRI shows the local soft tissue status more accurately. In cases of CUP PET/CT should be the first method of choice if it is available. MPMRI can clarify the exact primary tumor stage, and it can be advantageous in clarifying the prognostic factors, which is necessary in case of advanced tumor stage and when surgery is under consideration. In case low N stage is likely after the clinical examination and wait and see policy can be considered, MPMRI is recommended, and in this case the significance the of radiation free MPMRI is increasing.
27812688	Prescription of Prophylactic Antiemetic Drugs for Patients Receiving Chemotherapy With Minimal and Low Emetic Risk.	Importance: The use of antiemetic drugs for patients receiving chemotherapy with low or minimal emetic risk has been recognized as a growing concern for health care costs and patients' welfare. Relatively few studies have examined antiemetic prophylaxis or treatment of emesis associated with chemotherapy with lower emetic risk. Objective: To describe the pattern in Japan of overprescribing prophylactic antiemetic drugs to patients who have received intravenous chemotherapy with minimal or low emetic risk. Design, Setting, and Participants: This secondary analysis of a health insurance claims database linked with the hospital-based cancer registry of 122 designated cancer care hospitals covered the period from September 1, 2010, to December 31, 2012. Data were included from patients who (1) were diagnosed with breast, lung, colorectal, stomach, cervical, or prostate cancer; (2) were 20 years or older at the time of the diagnosis; and (3) received intravenous chemotherapy with minimal or low emetic risk. The data from patients with advanced stage cancer (stage IV) were excluded. Data were analyzed from March 20, 2014, to June 30, 2016. Main Outcomes and Measures: The percentage of chemotherapy administration involving patients prescribed prophylactic antiemetic drugs, namely, a neurokinin 1 receptor antagonist, serotonin receptor antagonist, and/or dexamethasone, was calculated. The costs of potentially unnecessary antiemetic drugs were estimated using the National Health Insurance drug price list for 2011. Results: A total of 8545 patients (5886 women [68.9%] and 2659 men [31.1%]; mean [SD] age, 61.9 [12.8] years) undergoing 73577 administrations of chemotherapy with minimal emetic risk (2464 patients; 22619 administrations) or low emetic risk (6081 patients; 50958 administrations) were identified. Of these, patients who received 24373 administrations of chemotherapy with a low emetic risk (47.8%) and 633 administrations of chemotherapy with a minimal emetic risk (2.8%) were prescribed serotonin receptor antagonists and dexamethasone. Outpatients in the low emetic risk group underwent more frequent administration of chemotherapy that included prescription of both drugs (53.1% of the chemotherapy; 95% CI, 51.6%-54.7%) compared with inpatients (33.7% of the chemotherapy; 95% CI, 31.7%-35.9%). Consequently, approximately yen170 million (US $1.6 million) was unnecessarily spent on prophylactic antiemetic drugs for these patients. Conclusions and Relevance: A substantial number of patients receiving chemotherapy with minimal and low emetic risk were prescribed potentially unnecessary prophylactic antiemetic drugs. The judicious use of these drugs could spare the burden of extra costs and the potential risk for adverse effects for patients.
27812483	VEGF +936 C/T Genetic Polymorphism in Patients with Cervical Dysplasia.	Aim. The present study aims to analyze the potential role of VEGF +936 C/T polymorphism in cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. Material and Method. One hundred and eighty-six patients were included in the study: 75 cases (patients diagnosed with CIN) and 111 controls (negative for both HPV testing and cytology). For each patient a single visit was scheduled when colposcopy was performed. From cervical specimen, cytology and HPV testing were performed and from peripheral blood VEGF +936 genotyping was determined. For statistical analysis purposes OR and chi-square were used at a level of significance of <0.05. Results. No link has been found in the detection of CT genotype in cases versus controls, OR = 0.8295, [0.42, 1.62]. An inverse correlation has been found between T allele and HSIL, OR = 0.2121, [0.0473, 0.9517], p = 0.0866. Conclusion. No link has been found between VEGF +936 C/T and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia.
27809842	Perspectives for therapeutic HPV vaccine development.	BACKGROUND: Human papillomavirus (HPV) infections and associated diseases remain a serious burden worldwide. It is now clear that HPV serves as the etiological factor and biologic carcinogen for HPV-associated lesions and cancers. Although preventative HPV vaccines are available, these vaccines do not induce strong therapeutic effects against established HPV infections and lesions. These concerns create a critical need for the development of therapeutic strategies, such as vaccines, to treat these existing infections and diseases. MAIN BODY: Unlike preventative vaccines, therapeutic vaccines aim to generate cell-mediated immunity. HPV oncoproteins E6 and E7 are responsible for the malignant progression of HPV-associated diseases and are consistently expressed in HPV-associated diseases and cancer lesions; therefore, they serve as ideal targets for the development of therapeutic HPV vaccines. In this review we revisit therapeutic HPV vaccines that utilize this knowledge to treat HPV-associated lesions and cancers, with a focus on the findings of recent therapeutic HPV vaccine clinical trials. CONCLUSION: Great progress has been made to develop and improve novel therapeutic HPV vaccines to treat existing HPV infections and diseases; however, there is still much work to be done. We believe that therapeutic HPV vaccines have the potential to become a widely available and successful therapy to treat HPV and HPV-associated diseases in the near future.
27637450	Structure and cytotoxic activity of ulvan extracted from green seaweed Ulva lactuca.	The structure of an ulvan obtained by water extraction from green seaweed Ulva lactuca was elucidated by using IR, NMR, SEC-MALL and ESIMS methods. The ulvan was also evaluated for its cytotoxic effects on three human cancer cell lines. The results showed that the ulvan was composed of rhamnose, galactose, xylose, manose, glucose (with a mole ratio of Rha: Gal: Xyl: Man: Glu equal to 1: 0.03: 0.07: 0.01: 0.06), uronic acid (21.5%) and sulfate content (18.9%) with a molecular weight of 347000. This ulvan mainly consists of disaccharide [-->4)-beta-d-GlcA-(1-->4)-alpha-l-Rha3S-(1-->] and other minor disaccharide beta-GlcA-(1-->2)-alpha-Xyl and beta-GlcA-(-->2)-alpha-Rha. The ulvan showed a significant cytotoxic activity against hepatocellular carcinoma (IC50 29.67+/-2.87mug/ml), human breast cancer (IC50 25.09+/-1.36mug/ml), and cervical cancer (IC50 36.33+/-3.84mug/ml).
27613187	Vitamin C in synergism with cisplatin induces cell death in cervical cancer cells through altered redox cycling and p53 upregulation.	PURPOSE: Cervical cancer is the second most prevalent cancer in women worldwide. Survival of patients has been improved by cisplatin-based chemotherapy, but its effectiveness is limited due to its adverse effects on many tissues, especially nephrotoxicity. To optimize the efficacy of CDDP, we propose a combination therapy using natural products with minimal side effects. Vitamin C being a natural antioxidant is capable of selectively targeting cancer cells at pharmacological concentrations. Vitamin C synergistically enhances the activity of chemotherapeutic agents without increasing toxicity to normal cells. Therefore, we exploited co-therapy with cisplatin and vitamin C to kill cervical cancer cells. METHODS: We elucidated the role of CDDP and VC on cervical cancer cell line (SiHa) by using cell growth assays, DNA fragmentation analysis, comet assay, in vitro morphological assessment of apoptosis (AO/EB and DAPI staining), ROS analysis by DCFDA, flow cytometry, biochemical assays (GST, GSH, NO, catalase, TPA) and Western blotting. RESULTS: Our results clearly demonstrated that CDDP and VC treatment exhibited ameliorative effect on induction of cell death by p53 overexpression and generation of hydrogen peroxide in SiHa cells, thereby reducing the dosage of CDDP required to induce cell death in cancer cells. CONCLUSIONS: These studies provide novel approaches to combat cisplatin resistance in cervical cancer.
27613186	Detection of human papillomavirus-16 DNA in archived clinical samples of breast and lung cancer patients from North Pakistan.	PURPOSE: Over the past few decades, human papillomavirus (HPV) has been recorded as a key player in the development of various genital cancers, most notably cervical cancer. It has also been associated with some non-genital cancers. A subset of oropharyngeal cancers are known to be caused by HPV. Its aetiological involvement has been suggested for breast and lung cancer as well. However, reports regarding the HPV DNA detection vary widely from different parts of the world. Due to scarcity of local data in this regard, the current study aimed at retrospective detection of HPV presence in the archival samples of breast and lung cancer patients from north part of the country. METHODS: A total of 55 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue sections of invasive ductal carcinoma of breast (n = 46) and lung (n = 9) were collected for this study. Genotyping for HPV16 and 18 was carried out through PCR. RESULTS: HPV16 DNA was found in both breast and lung carcinoma samples with the prevalence rate of 17 and 11 %, respectively. An interesting association was found between ER/PR (Oestrogen/Progesterone receptor) and HER2/Neu (Human epidermal growth factor receptor-2) positivity with HPV occurrence in breast tumours. CONCLUSION: Current study shows the presence of HPV16 DNA in archived clinical biopsy sections from breast and lung cancers (17, 11 %), respectively. A positive correlation of HPV16 presence was found with ER/PR and HER2-positive breast cancers. These initial findings warrant further investigation in order to determine HPV prevalence and aetiological role in local cancers, especially in ER/PR/HER2-positive breast cancers on a larger scale.
27565296	Characterization and anti-proliferative activity of curcumin loaded chitosan nanoparticles in cervical cancer.	In the present study the chitosan nanoparticles (CsNPs) and curcumin loaded chitosan nanoparticles (CLCsNPs) were synthesized by tripolyphosphate (TPP) cross-linking method. The nanoparticles were prepared within a zone of appropriate chitosan and TPP concentrations. The average size of CsNPs and CLCsNPs were approximately 189+/-11.8nm and 197+/-16.8nm, exhibited a zeta potential of +76+/-5.6mV and +71+/-6.4mV respectively and drug entrapment efficiency was approximately 85%. The CLCsNPs and CsNPs were further characterized by different physicochemical methods like transmission electron microscopy (TEM), dynamic light scattering (DLS), HPLC, MALDI-TOF, FT-IR, XRD and UV-vis Spectroscopy. In vitro studies revealed a fast release of approximately 35% at pH 5 and approximately 25% at pH 7.4 of the drug during the first 3h, followed by controlled release of curcumin over a period of 120h and sustained anti-proliferative activity of the drug in a dose and time dependent manner of CLCsNPs and combination with methyl jasmonate. The higher cytotoxicity effect of CLCsNPs may be due to their higher cellular uptake as compared to curcumin. Chitosan nanoparticles were not only stable but also a nontoxic. Our data suggested that curcumin loaded nanoformulations, therefore, might be promising candidates in cancer therapy.
27515060	Endometrial sampling devices for early diagnosis of endometrial lesions.	PURPOSE: Endometrial carcinoma is the most common gynecologic malignancy in both developed and some developing countries. Unlike cervical cancer, for which there is routine screening, only patients symptomatic for endometrial carcinoma typically seek medical help for its diagnosis and treatment. Dilatation and curettage (D&C) has been the standard procedure for evaluating suspicious endometrial lesions. The discomfort and injury caused by the D&C procedure, however, restrict its use as a screening method for early diagnosis of endometrial lesions. High-risk endometrial cancer patients would benefit from an effective and low-cost screening test. In recent years, several endometrial devices have been developed and proposed as screening tools. METHODS: We have reviewed and evaluated the literature relating to the endometrial sampling devices in clinical use or clinical trials, with the goal of comparing devices and identifying the most appropriate ones for screening for endometrial lesions. Eligible literature was identified from systematic PubMed searches, and the relevant data were extracted. Comments, letters, unpublished data, conference proceedings, and case reports were excluded from our search. Seventy-four articles on endometrial sampling devices were obtained for this review. RESULTS: The main screening devices for endometrial carcinoma are aspiration devices (such as the Vabra aspirator), Pipelle, Tao Brush, and SAP-1 device. Among these devices, the Tao Brush is the most promising endometrial sampler for screening for endometrial lesions. However, its sampling insufficiency, cost, and unsuccessful insertion rate (20 % in nulliparous and 8 % in parous women) are problematic. CONCLUSIONS: A more accurate and low-cost endometrial sampler, with improved specimen sufficiency and higher sensitivity for endometrial lesions, needs tobe developed and clinically verified.
27807071	Association Between Type-specific HPV Infections and hTERT DNA Methylation in Patients with Invasive Cervical Cancer.	BACKGROUND: There exists limited information on the role of hTERT methylation, and its association with type-specific HPV infections in cervical cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighty-seven frozen samples were analyzed for type-specific HPV infection using a GP5+/GP6+ PCR-RLB assay (RLB). hTERT DNA methylation analysis was performed using a newly developed PCR-RLB-hTERT. RESULTS: Ninety-three percent of samples were HPV-positive and fifteen different types were detected. hTERT methylation analysis of region 1 revealed no methylation in 78.8% of the samples and partial methylation in 21.2%. In region two, 68.2% showed no methylation and 31.8% showed a pattern of partial methylation. An association between the alpha 9 and alpha 7 species with a pattern of no methylation of hTERT in the region 1 was established (p=0.02 and p=0.03, respectively). CONCLUSION: Differences in patterns of methylation of the hTERT core promoter [region 1 (nt -208 to -1) and region 2 (nt +1 to +104) relative to first ATG] are related to the HPV species present.
27806731	In vitro assessment of a computer-designed potential anticancer agent in cervical cancer cells.	BACKGROUND: Computer-based technology is becoming increasingly essential in biological research where drug discovery programs start with the identification of suitable drug targets. 2-Methoxyestradiol (2ME2) is a 17beta-estradiol metabolite that induces apoptosis in various cancer cell lines including cervical cancer, breast cancer and multiple myeloma. Owing to 2ME2's poor in vivo bioavailability, our laboratory in silico-designed and subsequently synthesized a novel 2ME2 analogue, 2-ethyl-3-O-sulphamoyl-estra-1,3,5(10),15-tetraen-17-ol (ESE-15-ol), using receptor- and ligand molecular modeling. In this study, the biological effects of ESE-15-ol (180 nM) and its parent molecule, 2ME2 (1 microM), were assessed on morphology and apoptosis induction in cervical cancer cells. RESULTS: Transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy and polarization-optical transmitted light differential interference contrast (PlasDIC) images demonstrated morphological hallmarks of apoptosis including apoptotic bodies, shrunken cells, vacuoles, reduced cell density and cell debris. Flow cytometry analysis showed apoptosis induction by means of annexin V-FITC staining. Cell cycle analysis showed that ESE-15-ol exposure resulted in a statistically significant increase in the G2M phase (72%) compared to 2ME2 (19%). Apoptosis induction was more pronounced when cells were exposed to ESE-15-ol compared to 2ME2. Spectrophotometric analysis of caspase 8 activity demonstrated that 2ME2 and ESE-15-ol both induced caspase 8 activation by 2- and 1.7-fold respectively indicating the induction of the apoptosis. However, ESE-15-ol exerted all of the above-mentioned effects at a much lower pharmacological concentration (180 nM) compared to 2ME2 (1 microM physiological concentration). CONCLUSION: Computer-based technology is essential in drug discovery and together with in vitro studies for the evaluation of these in silico-designed compounds, drug development can be improved to be cost effective and time consuming. This study evaluated the anticancer potential of ESE-15-ol, an in silico-designed compound in vitro. Research demonstrated that ESE-15-ol exerts antiproliferative activity accompanied with apoptosis induction at a nanomolar concentration compared to the micromolar range required by 2ME2. This study is the first study to demonstrate the influence of ESE-15-ol on morphology, cell cycle progression and apoptosis induction in HeLa cells. In silico-design by means of receptor- and ligand molecular modeling is thus effective in improving compound bioavailability while preserving apoptotic activity in vitro.
27806630	Deregulated miRNAs in human cervical cancer: functional importance and potential clinical use.	Cervical cancer (CC) is one of the most common malignancies affecting women worldwide. While the morbidity and mortality associated with CC are decreasing in western countries, they both remain high in developing countries. Unfortunately, many issues about molecular mechanisms of CC are not clear yet. miRNAs are a group of small noncoding RNAs that could post-transcriptionally modulate the expression of specific genes and participate in the initiation and progression of multiple diseases including CC. In the last decade, mounting evidences suggest an association between miRNAs and human papillomavirus infection, as well as variations in biologic behavior, treatment response and prognosis in CC. Herein, we highlight the latest findings in this area and the potential applications.
27539577	Prevalence of human papillomavirus infection among women presenting for cervical cancer screening in Chile, 2014-2015.	Cervical cancer is the fourth most common malignancy in women worldwide. In Chile, cervical cancer is the second leading cause of death among women of reproductive age, causing more than 600 deaths annually. This study was carried out to determine the burden and confirm the predominant human papillomavirus (HPV) genotypes among women presenting for cervical cancer screening in public health services in Chile. Women aged 18-64 years residing in the north and central areas covered by six primary care centers of Santiago, Chile, were invited to participate from March 2014 to August 2015. Cervical swabs were examined both HPV genotyping by PCR and Reverse Line Blot, and cervical cytology by Pap testing. A total of 1738 women were included in this study: 11.1 % were HPV positive, 9.7 % were high-risk types positive, 3.2 % were low-risk types positive, 1.4 % were Pap positive and 0.9 % were positive by both tests. The four most predominant genotypes were 16, 66, 51 and 59, with prevalence of 2.8, 1.4, 1.2 and 1.2 %, respectively. Multiple HPV infections were detected among 3.8 % participants. Age-specific prevalence of HPV showed a peak in HPV infection at younger ages (</=30 years), declining to a plateau in middle age. Among women with normal cytology, the 9.4 % were HPV positive, while 58.3 % of women with abnormal cytology were HPV positive. These findings show new epidemiological data confirming HPV 16 and 66 as the most predominant genotypes in Chile. These data are important for design successful strategies for prevention of cervical cancer in Chile.
27806357	Virtues and Weaknesses of DNA Methylation as a Test for Cervical Cancer Prevention.	Epigenetics is the study of heritable and non-heritable genetic coding that is additive to information contained within classical DNA base pair sequences. Differential methylation has a fundamental role in the development and outcome of malignancies, chronic and degenerative diseases and aging. DNA methylation can be measured accurately and easily via various molecular methods and has become a key technology for research and healthcare delivery, with immediate roles in the elucidation of disease natural history, diagnostics and drug discovery. This review focuses on cancers of the lower genital tract, for which the most epigenetic information exists. DNA methylation has been proposed as a triage for women infected with human papillomavirus (HPV) and may eventually directly complement or replace HPV screening as a one-step molecular diagnostic and prognostic test. Methylation of human genes is strongly associated with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and cancer. Of the more than 100 human methylation biomarker genes tested so far in cervical tissue, close to 20 have been reported in different studies, and approximately 10 have been repeatedly shown to have elevated methylation in cervical cancers and high-grade CIN (CIN2 and CIN3), most prominently CADM1, EPB41L3, FAM19A4, MAL, miR-124, PAX1 and SOX1. Obtaining consistent performance data from the literature is quite difficult because most methylation studies used a variety of different assay methodologies and had incomplete and/or biased clinical specimen sets, varying assay thresholds and disparate target gene regions. There have been relatively few validation studies of DNA methylation biomarkers in large population-based screening studies, but an encouraging development more recently is the execution of well-designed studies to test the true performance of the markers in real-world settings. Methylation of HPV genes, especially HPV16, HPV18, HPV31, HPV33 and HPV45, in disease progression has been a major focus of research. Elevated methylation of the HPV16 L1 and L2 open reading frames, in particular, is associated with CIN2, CIN3 and invasive cancer. Essentially all cancers have high levels of methylation for human genes and for driver HPV types, which suggests that quantitative methylation tests may have utility in predicting CIN2 and CIN3 that are likely to progress. It is still early in the process of development of methylation biomarkers, but already they are showing strong promise as a universal and systematic approach to molecular triage, applicable to all cancers, not just cancer of the cervix. DNA methylation testing is better than HPV genotyping triage and is competitive with or complementary to other approaches such as cytology and p16 staining. Genome-wide studies are underway to systematically expand methylation classifier panels and find the best combinations of biomarkers. Methylation testing is likely to show big improvements in performance in the next 5 years.
27803033	A single-arm study evaluating bevacizumab, cisplatin, and paclitaxel followed by single-agent bevacizumab in Japanese patients with advanced cervical cancer.	BACKGROUND: Adding bevacizumab to chemotherapy for recurrent, persistent or metastatic cervical cancer significantly improved overall survival (primary endpoint), progression-free survival and overall response rate in the randomized Phase III GOG-0240 trial. However, data for bevacizumab-containing therapy are scarce in Japanese patients with advanced cervical cancer. METHODS: The primary objective of the single-arm multicenter Phase II JO29569 study was to evaluate the tolerability of paclitaxel (135 mg/m2 over 24 h or 175 mg/m2 over 3 h), cisplatin (50 mg/m2) and bevacizumab (15 mg/kg), administered every 3 weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity in Japanese patients with stage IVB, persistent or recurrent cervical cancer. RESULTS: The seven treated patients received a median of nine (range 7-12) bevacizumab cycles and six (range 4-12) chemotherapy cycles. None of the predefined adverse events occurred during the tolerability evaluation period. The most common all-grade adverse events were alopecia, hypertension, decreased appetite, nausea and peripheral sensory neuropathy. There were no cases of fistula. The most common grade >/=3 adverse events were hypertension, neutrophil count decreased and neutropenia. Only one patient experienced febrile neutropenia. The overall response rate was 86% (95% confidence interval, 42-100%), including a complete response in one patient. At data cutoff, disease had progressed in one patient; bevacizumab therapy was ongoing in the remaining six. CONCLUSIONS: According to the specified primary objective, a regimen of cisplatin, paclitaxel and bevacizumab was tolerable in Japanese patients and demonstrated encouraging activity in this small single-arm study. Further study is warranted to confirm the safety and effectiveness of bevacizumab in Japanese patients with cervical cancer.
27802904	Panobinostat induces apoptosis via production of reactive oxygen species and synergizes with topoisomerase inhibitors in cervical cancer cells.	Cervical cancer is the fourth major cause of cancer-related deaths in women worldwide and is the most common cancer in developing countries. Therefore, a search for novel treatment modalities is warranted. The present study is designed to investigate the effect of pan histone deacetylase inhibitor, 'panobinostat', on cervical cancer cells alone and in combination with topoisomerase inhibitors. We assessed the effect of panobinostat on two cervical cancer cell lines, HeLa and SiHa, for cell viability, apoptosis, oxidative stress and mitochondrial function using various assays. The results indicate that panobinostat reduces the viability of cervical cancer cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner; it arrests HeLa cells in G0/G1 and SiHa cells in G2/M phase of the cell cycle. Panobinostat induced apoptosis through an increase in the ROS production and the disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential. Concomitantly the expression of anti-apoptotic gene Bcl-xL was reduced, while levels of CDK inhibitor p21 and caspase-9 were increased. Panobinostat increased the acetylation of histone H3 indicating HDAC inhibition. In addition, panobinostat also showed synergistic effect with topoisomerase inhibitors mediated by increased activation of caspase-3/7 activity compared to that in cells treated with panobinostat alone. These results suggest a combination therapy using inhibitors of histone deacetylase and topoisomerase together could hold the promise for an effective targeted therapeutic strategy.
27568484	Synthesis, Molecular Modeling and Biological Evaluation of 4-Alkoxyquinazoline Derivatives as Novel Inhibitors of VEGFR2.	A series of novel quinazoline derivatives have been designed and synthesized, and their inhibitory activities have also been tested against A549 (carcinomic human alveolar basal epithelial cell), MCF-7 (breast cancer) and HeLa (cervical cancer cell). Of these compounds, compound 4t showed the most potent inhibitory activity (IC50=0.22 microg/mL for HeLa, IC50=0.15 microg/mL for A549 and IC50=0.24 microg/mL for MCF-7). Docking simulation had been performed to position compound 4t into the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) active site to determine the probable binding model. These results suggested that compound 4t with potent inhibitory activity in tumor growth inhibition may be a potential anticancer agent.
25620524	Tonsillar metastasis of small cell lung carcinoma.	Metastasis to palatine tonsils are rare, accounting from only 0.8% of all tonsillar tumors, so far only 100 cases reported in the English literature. Only a few cases have been reported for small cell and non-small cell lung cancer as a primary site. With a diagnosis of small cell lung cancer, a 68-year-old male patient relapsed after six cycles of chemotherapy in tonsilla palatina and cervical lymph nodes. Patients died 26 months after being diagnosed with lung cancer and 2 months after detection of tonsil metastasis. We present the current case report because of the rarity of metastasis to tonsil in lung cancer.
27801430	HPV16 E6 polymorphism and physical state of viral genome in relation to the risk of cervical cancer in women from the south of Poland.	The aim of this study was to analyse the correlation between HPV16 E6 variants and the physical status of viral genome (integrated, mixed, episomal) among patients with cervical cancer (n=40) and low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions - LSIL (n=40). The study was performed on 80 HPV16 positive samples. HPV16 E6 variants were identified using PCR and DNA sequencing. Nucleotide sequences of E6 were compared with the prototype sequence (EUR-350T). The physical state of HPV DNA was determined as the ratio of E2/E6 copy number per cell. Twelve different intratypic variants were identified as belonging to European (in 77 samples) and North-American 1 (in 3 samples) sublineages. The most prevalent non-synonymous variant was EUR-350G, which occurred with similar frequency in cervical cancer and LSIL. The frequencies of additional mutations in variants with EUR-350T or EUR-350G sequences differed significantly. For the first time, missense mutations G122A, C153T and G188A were discovered in EUR-350G variant. The integrated viral genome was predominant in women with cervical cancer. The EUR-350T prototype and EUR-350G without additional mutations variants were prevalent in cervical cancer samples with the HPV16 characterized by integrated DNA. In summary, European variants of HPV16 E6 dominated in both cancer and LSIL group. The presence of EUR-350G favoured the occurrence of additional nucleotide changes. We showed that nucleotide changes occur significantly more often in the mixed form of viral DNA and in LSIL group and that the variants without additional mutations may promote integration of HPV16 genome.
27800076	[The contribution of MRI in the management of slowly progressive nontraumatic spinal cord compression].	Slow spinal cord compressions are due to the development of an expansive lesion within the medullary canal. This is a very common condition whose diagnosis is primarily clinical. The magnetic resonance imaging occupies a central and currently irreplaceable position in diagnosis and localization as well as in etiological research. Etiology of cancer is predominant in Europe. This study aims to describe the MRI features of slow spinal cord compressions and to determine its etiologic profile. This is a retrospective study of 97 cases whose data were collected at the Department of Radiology, National University Hospital Centre (CHUN) of Fann, over a period of 30 months (from March 8, 2010 to September 29 2012). All patients referred for slow spinal compression occurred in a non traumatic context were included in the study. The average age of patients was 42.6 years, ranging between 04 months and 85 years. We studied the topography of lesions (spinal floor, ductal compartments), their enhancement and their etiological criteria. The review protocol allowed the realization of T1-weighted sequences with no injection of gado, T2-weighted sequences, STIR sequences and T2-weighted DRIVE sequences centered on lesions levels or suspicious areas. MRI allowed to determine the exact location and the extent of lesions. The involvement of the thoracic spine occurred in 42% of cases, followed by the cervical spine in 32% of cases. The lumbosacral damages and multi-stage damages were found in 18% and 8% of cases respectively. Extradural lesions were found in 87% of cases, followed by intradural extramedullary lesions in 08% of cases and intramedullary lesions in 05% of cases. The peculiarity of etiologic profile of our study is the prevalence of infectious epiduritis and the relative frequency of metastatic epiduritis compared to the Western series. The vertebral-medullary MRI occupies a crucial place in the positive, topographic and etiological diagnosis of spinal cord compressions.
27799225	Metastatic prostate adenocarcinoma presenting as a large right supraclavicular and anterior chest wall mass.	Left-sided cervical lymphadenopathy as first presentation of metastatic prostate carcinoma is not a novel observation. Here, we discuss a case of metastatic prostate primary carcinoma with an initial presentation of a right supraclavicular mass with extension into the anterior chest wall, which on radiological investigation was suggestive of a sarcomatous tumour; however, was confirmed to be pervasive metastatic prostatic adenocarcinoma. This is the second case in literature, which reports a prostatic primary cancer presenting as a right-sided supraclavicular and anterior chest wall mass.
27706947	Simultaneous integrated boost (SIB) of the parametrium and cervix in radiotherapy for uterine cervical carcinoma: a dosimetric study using a new alternative approach.	OBJECTIVE: To compare the dose distributions of intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) and volumetric-modulated arc therapy (VMAT) using the simultaneous integrated boost (SIB) technique with that of the traditional midline block (MB) technique for boosting the parametrium in patients with cervical cancer. METHODS: Treatment plans using VMAT or IMRT with the SIB technique (VMAT-SIB and IMRT-SIB) and IMRT followed by the MB technique (IMRT-MB) were generated for each of the 10 patients with cervical cancer. For the SIB plans, 45-Gy and 50-Gy dose levels in 25 equal fractions were set for the pelvis planning target volume 45 (PTV45) and the parametrial boost volume (PTV50), respectively. For the IMRT-MB plans, the parametrium was sequentially boosted with the MB technique (5.4 Gy in three fractions) after pelvic IMRT (PTV45). RESULTS: Volume receiving 100% of the prescribed dose or more coverage of the PTV50 was significantly better for VMAT-SIB and IMRT-SIB than that for IMRT-MB (99.08 and 99.31% compared with 91.79%, respectively; p < 0.05). VMAT-SIB and IMRT-SIB both generated significantly greater doses to the organs at risk (OARs) except for the volume receiving 50 Gy or more doses, which were significantly lower for the bladder and bowel. Comparable results were achieved with VMAT-SIB and IMRT-SIB. CONCLUSION: The VMAT-SIB and IMRT-SIB techniques are promising in terms of dose distributions and tumour coverage, although these approaches might result in slightly higher doses of radiation to the OARs. Advances in knowledge: This is the first study to examine the feasibility of the SIB technique using IMRT or VMAT to boost the parametrium. The techniques dosimetrically produced better target coverage but resulted in slightly higher doses to the OARs.
27509451	The Impact of the Stage and Tumor Size on Rare Brain Metastasis of Cervical Cancer.	AIM: To investigate the clinical features, prognostic factors and survival times of cervical cancer patients with brain metastasis. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 820 patients with cervical cancer. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 12.0 statistical software (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA). Overall survival, time interval from diagnosis of cervical cancer to identification of brain metastasis, and median survival time after diagnosis of brain metastasis were calculated using Kaplan-Meier curve analysis. The log-rank test was used to compare differences in survival. Differences were assumed statistically significant when p-values were < 0.05. RESULTS: The incidence of brain metastases from cervical cancer in our institution was 1.82% (15/820) over a ten-year period. The median time interval from diagnosis of cervical cancer to detection of brain metastasis was 12.5 months (range: 2.9-91.9 months). Stage and tumor diameter were found to be significant relating to the interval from diagnosis of cervical cancer to detection of brain metastasis (p=0.001 for both). CONCLUSION: This study provides much information about the prognosis of patients with brain metastases from cervical cancer and highlights the importance of initial stage and tumor diameter when determining the time interval until development of brain metastasis.
27258476	Four-year results of a prospective single-arm study on 200 semi-constrained total cervical disc prostheses: clinical and radiographic outcome.	OBJECTIVE Recent studies have described encouraging outcomes after cervical total disc replacement (cTDR), but there are also critical debates regarding the long-term effects of heterotopic ossification (HO) and the prevalence of adjacent-level degeneration. The aim in this paper was to provide 4-year clinical and radiographic outcome results on the activ C disc prosthesis. METHODS A total of 200 subjects underwent single-level activ C (Aesculap AG) implantation between C-3 and C-7 for the treatment of symptomatic degenerative disc disease. Clinical and radiographic assessments were performed preoperatively, intraoperatively, at discharge, and again at 6 weeks, 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, and 4 years. Radiographic evaluations were done by an independent core laboratory using a specific software for quantitative motion analysis. RESULTS Neck Disability Index (NDI) and visual analog scale (VAS) score for neck and arm pain decreased significantly from baseline to the 4-year follow-up. The mean improvement for NDI was 20, for VAS severity and frequency of neck pain 26.4 and 28, and for VAS severity and frequency of arm pain 30.7 and 35.1, respectively. The neurological situation improved for the majority of patients (86.4%); 76.1% of cases were asymptomatic. Subsequent surgical interventions were reported in 7% of the cases, including device removals in 3%. In 2.5% a subsidence greater than 3 mm was recorded; 1 of these cases also had a migration greater than 3 mm. No device displacement, expulsion, disassembly, loose or fractured device, osteolysis, or facet joint degeneration at the index level was observed. Segmental lordotic alignment changed from -2.4 degrees preoperatively to -6.2 degrees at 4 years, and postoperative height was maintained during the follow-up. Advanced HO (Grade III and IV) was present in 27.1% of the cases; 82.4% showed segmental mobility. A progression of radiographic adjacent-segment degeneration occurred in 28.2%, but only 4.5% required surgical treatment. CONCLUSIONS The activ C is a safe and effective device for cervical disc replacement confirming the encouraging results after cTDR. Clinical trial registration no.: NCT02492724 ( clinicaltrials.gov ).
27231814	Fulminant spinal cord compression caused by postradiation inflammatory pseudotumor with rapid response to steroids: case report.	Radiation therapy continues to play an extremely valuable role in the treatment of malignancy. The effects of radiation therapy on normal tissue can present in a delayed fashion, resulting in localized damage with pseudomalignant transformation, producing a compressive effect on the spinal cord or exiting nerve roots. Infiltration of inflammatory cells and the subsequent fibrotic response can result in the development of an inflammatory pseudotumor (benign tumor-like lesion) with subsequent mass effect. Herein, the authors present a rare case of inflammatory pseudotumor with fulminant cervicothoracic cord compression, developing 7 years after radiation therapy for breast cancer. The lesion recurred following resection but subsequently displayed complete and rapid resolution following steroid therapy. To the best of the authors' knowledge, no previous studies have reported such an incident.
27798880	The Tumor-promoting Effects of FAM92A1-289 in Cervical Carcinoma Cells.	BACKGROUND/AIM: FAM92A1-289 is recognized as one of the newly-discovered putative oncogenes. This study was performed to reveal its oncogenic functions in human cervical carcinoma cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The FAM92A1-289+ cell line was established with knock-in technique and selected by puromycin-resistance screening. Scratch assay, methylthiazol tetrazolium assay, colony forming assay and xenograft test were used to examine cell migration, cell proliferation, cell viability and tumor formation, respectively. RESULTS: FAM92A1-289+ cells showed higher migration rate (p<0.05), higher cell viability (p<0.01), higher colony formation and tumor growth. The FAM92A1-289 protein was pulled-down by antibodies against proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) in the co-immunoprecipitation assay. CONCLUSION: The up-regulated expression of FAM92A1-289 could facilitate cell migration, boost cell proliferation and promote colony formation in vitro and tumor growth in vivo. The interaction between FAM92A1-289 and PCNA was verified by co-immunoprecipitation. This study provided functional evidence for FAM92A1-289 to be developed as a therapeutic target for cancer treatment.
27797261	Benefits of Cervical Cancer Screening by Liquid-Based Cytology as Part of Routine Antenatal Assessment.	PURPOSE: To determine the prevalence of abnormal cervical cytology, as diagnosed using a liquid-based cytology technique, in pregnant women attending the Antenatal Care (ANC) clinic at Siriraj Hospital. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 655 first-visit pregnant women who attended ANC clinic at Siriraj Hospital during June to November 2015 study period. After receiving routine antenatal care, cervical cytology screening was performed with the Siriraj liquid-based cytology technique. All specimens were reviewed by a certi ed cytopathologist using Bethesda System 2001 criteria. Patients with abnormal PAP results characterized as epithelial cell abnormalities were referred to a gynecologic oncologist for further management according to ASCCP Guidelines 2012. RESULTS: Mean age of participants was 28.9+/-6.2 years. Prevalence of abnormal cervical cytology was 3.4% (95% CI: 2.0-4.7). Among this group, there were ASC-US, ASC-H, LSIL, HSIL for 12(1.8%), 2(0.3%), 7(1.1%) and 1(0.2%), respectively. In 633 specimens of the normal group, infection was identified in 158 specimens (24.1%) which were caused by Candida spp. and Trichomonas vaginalis. Regarding patient perception about the importance of cervical cancer screening, although most women perceived screening to be important, 54% of participants had never been screened for cervical cancer. Rate of loss to follow-up in the postpartum period was as high as 41.8%. CONCLUSIONS: Prevalence of abnormal cervical cytology in pregnant women attending the ANC clinic at Siriraj Hospital was 3.4%. Inclusion of cervical cancer screening as part of antenatal assessment can help to identify precancerous lesions or cervical cancers in patients who might otherwise not be screened, thereby facilitating early treatment and improved patient outcomes.
27797253	Experience of Combined Liquid Based Cervical Cytology and High-Risk HPV mRNA for Cervical Cancer Screening in Thammasat University Hospital.	BACKGROUND: Cervical cancer is the second most common of malignancy found in Thai women. Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is a major cause. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the prevalence of HPV infection and association with abnormal cervical cytology in Thai women. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was conducted at the Gynecologic Clinic, Thammasat University, Pathum Thani, Thailand. A total of 2,144 cases who underwent annual cervical cancer screening by co-testing (liquid based cytology and HPV testing, DNA versus mRNA) during the priod from July 2013 to June 2016 were recruited in this study. RESULTS: Prevalence of positive high risk (HR) HPV DNA and mRNA test were 19.7 and 8.4%, respectively with a statistically significant difference. Majority of cases of abnormal cytology in this study were atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US). In patients with ASC-US, positive HR HPV DNA was greater than in the mRNA group (10.1 and 4.5%, p<0.001). Nonetheless, there was no significant difference in participants with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). HPV mRNA test had slightly lower sensitivity but higher negative predictive value (NPV) than the DNA test to detect abnormal cytology during cervical cancer screening (p<0.001). Both HPV test (DNA and mRNA) had equally efficacy to detect high grade precancerous lesion or higher (CIN 2+). CONCLUSIONS: Prevalence of HR HPV DNA and mRNA were 19.7 and 8.4 percent, respectively. NPV of HPV mRNA was higher than DNA test. Both tests had equal efficacy to detect CIN 2+ with sensitivity and specificity of 63% vs 55.7% and 83% vs 92%, respectively.
27797251	Utilization of a Scored Patient-Generated Subjective Global Assessment in Detecting a Malnourished Status in Gynecologic Cancer Patients.	PURPOSE: To assess the prevalence of malnutrition in gynecologic cancer patients using the Scored Patient- Generated Subjective Global Assessment (PG-SGA) questionnaire. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 97 gynecologic cancer patients who never had any treatment but were planned for surgery were enrolled. The patients were asked to complete the scored PG-SGA form before the treatment was started. Attending physicians were also asked to complete other information in the PG-SGA form. Total scores were calculated and the patients were classified into 3 nutritional status levels. RESULTS: Mean age was 54 years. Postoperative diagnoses were endometrial cancer in 42 cases (43.2%), ovarian cancer in 29 cases (29.9%), and cervical cancer in 26 cases (26.8%). Mean PG-SGA score was 5.2+4.7. Malnutrition (PG-SGA B and C) was found in 52 patients (53.6%, 95% CI 43.7% - 63.2%). Preoperative BMI, hemoglobin, serum albumin, and cancer stage were not significantly associated with nutritional status. Malnutrition was significantly more common among patients diagnosed with ovarian cancer, compared to other types of cancer (79.3% vs. 42.6%, p 0.004). CONCLUSIONS: Prevalence of malnutrition among gynecologic cancer patients was 53.5%, according to the scored PG-SGA. Malnutrition was significantly more common among patients with ovarian cancer.
27797243	Silent High Grade Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia in Atypical Smears from Liquid Based Cervical Cytology - Three Years Experience in Thammasat University Hospital.	PURPOSE: To study the prevalence of CIN2+ diagnosis in women with atypical Papaniculoau (Pap) smears to suggest appropriate management option for Thai health care. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data from all patients with liquid based cytology with human papillomavirus (HPV) testing between May 2013 - May 2016 were collected from medical records. Women with atypical cervical Pap smears were recruited. Results for age, HPV testing, HPV 16, 18, 45 and other genotypes tested, colposcopic examination and histopathological assessment were all collected. Atypical smears were defined as atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US) and atypical squamous cells cannot be exclude high grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (ASC-H). RESULTS: A total of 2,144 cases were recruited. Twenty six women with ASC-US on cytology had high risk (HR) HPV detection while eight cases with ASC-H had HR-HPV (40.0% VS 72.7%, p=0.005). Among the 26 women with ASC-US cytology and positive HR-HPV, HPV type 16 (n=8, 30.8%), type 18 (n=1, 3.8%), type 45 (n=1, 3.8%) and other HPV types (n=17, 65.4%) were found. Eight women with ASC-H and positive HR-HPV demonstrated type 16 (n=6, 75%) and other HPV types (n=2, 25%). Fifty seven women with ASC-US had normal colposcopy, CIN1 and CIN2+ at percentages of 80.7 (46/57), 14.0 (8/57) and 5.3 (3/57), respectively. In the ASC-H group, 7 out of 10 women had normal colposcopy and three (30%) had CIN2+ results. CONCLUSIONS: In women with ASC-US cytology, immediate colposcopy is highly recommended. HPV testing can be performed if colposcopy is not an available option because there was high prevalence (5.3%) of CIN2+ in our findings. ASCCP recommendations for ASC-H that colposcopy should be performed on all ASC-H cases regardless of HPV result are thereby supported by the findings of this investigation.
27797236	Evaluation of Provider Skills in Performing Visual Inspection with Acetic Acid in the Cervical Cancer Screening Program in the Meknes-Tafilalet Region of Morocco.	BACKGROUND: This study documented the performance of providers of visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA) at primary health centers, assessing their compliance with the VIA skills checklist and determinants of non-compliance, and exploring their perceptions of VIA training sessions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross- sectional study was conducted among VIA providers in the Meknes-Tafilalet region of Morocco. Structured observation of their performance was conducted through supervisory visits and multiple focus group discussions (FGDs). RESULTS: Performance of all the recommended steps for effective communication was observed in a low proportion of procedures (36.4%). Midwives/nurses had higher compliance than general practitioners (GPs) (p<0.001). All recommended steps for VIA examination were performed for a high proportion of procedures (82.5%). Compliance was higher among midwives/nurses than among GPs (p<0.001) and among providers in rural areas than those in urban areas (p<0.001). For pre-VIA counselling, all recommended steps were performed for only 36.8% of procedures. For post-VIA counseling, all recommended steps were performed in a high proportion (85.5% for VIA-negative and 85.1% for VIA-positive women). Midwives/nurses had higher compliance than GPs when advising VIA-positive women (p=0.009). All infection prevention practices were followed for only 14.2% of procedures, and compliance was higher among providers in rural areas than those in urban areas (p<0.001). Most FGD participants were satisfied with the content of VIA training sessions. However, they suggested periodic refresher training and supportive supervision. CONCLUSIONS: Quality assurance of a cervical cancer screening program is a key element to ensure that the providers perform VIA correctly and confidently.
27797234	Life-Style Habits in a High-Risk Area for Upper Gastrointestinal Cancers: a Population-Based Study from Shanxi, China.	BACKGROUND: Cancer is a burden on humanity and ranks as a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in China. Shanxi province has its unique cancer patterns and the burden is increasing. In this study, we aimed to assess the pattern of dietary habits and life-style in Shanxi, a high-risk area for upper gastrointestinal cancers in China and further evaluate the trends in cancer incidence and mortality based on registered data. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data on lifestyle, diet, physical activity were obtained from the household health survey at Zhongyang from 2013 to 2015. Cancer diagnoses were reported to Shanxi Center for Disease Control and Prevention (SCDCP). Population-based cancer incidence data and mortality data of 2012 were collected from the SCDCP. All incidence and death rates were expressed per 100,000 populations. Univariate analysis was performed using the Chi-squared test or Fisherandapos;s exact test. RESULTS: Overall, deficiencies in fresh fruits and vegetable food, and intake of hot food, salted food, or pickled food are serious problems in Shanxi, especially in rural areas. Upper gastrointestinal cancers were the most commonly diagnosed cancers, and the incidence in rural areas is higher than those in urban areas. Cervical cancer is the most common cancer for females. Moreover, the agespecific incidence exhibited an increased trend before 40 years old. Consistent with the previous literature, our epidemiological investigation results suggest that lifestyle, nutrition deficient, and infections were major risk factors for upper gastrointestinal cancers or cervical cancer in Shanxi. Facing a serious situation, we further explored defensible recommendations for the general public in order to promote changes in environments that support healthful eating and physical activity habits, to reduce cancer risk. CONCLUSIONS: Our results present the current cancer trends in Shanxi and its related etiologic risk factors and provide a theoretical basis to guide public health efforts to prevent and control cancers in the province.
27797219	Clinical Factors Associated with Specimen Adequacy for Conventional Cervical Cytology in Thammasat University Hospital, Thailand.	PURPOSE: To study clinical factors related to adequacy of transformation zone (TZ) components in cervical smears. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medical and Papanicolaou (Pap) smear reports from Thammasat University Hospital, Thailand during January to December 2015 were collected. Demographic data was reviewed by attending physicians and impact of clinical factors onTZ adequacy was primary outcome. A total of 3,251 smears were reviewed. Finally, 2,098 smears met The inclusion criteria and enrolled into this study. RESULTS: Average age and bodyweight of participants in this study were 43.0 years and 60.0 kg, respectively. Ninety seven percent of smears were classified as satisfactory for evaluation according to the Bethesda system 2001. Adequacy (group A) and inadequacy (group B) of TZ were equal in percentage (50.9/46.0). Prevalence of abnormal cervical cytology was 4.4%. Percentages of abnormal Pap smears in group A and B were 7.3 and 1.4, respectively (p<0.001). Factors associated with increased adequacy of TZ were old-age (>/= 50 yr), nulliparity, within 3-months postpartum, history of TZ inadequacy and abnormal smears. Sexually transmitted disease (STD), hormonal usage, previous cryotherapy and smears collected by staff were associated with inadequacy of TZ. CONCLUSIONS: Collection of cervical specimens should be carefully performed. STD history, hormonal usage and previous cryotherapy are risk factors for TZ inadequate specimens.
27796874	In Vitro and in Vivo Anticancer Activity of Sophorolipids to Human Cervical Cancer.	Six characteristic di-acetylated lactonic sophorolipids with C16:1, C16:0, C18:0, C18:1, C18:2, and C18:3 fatty acid were obtained from Starmerella bombicola CGMCC 1576. In order to confirm their anticancer activity against human cervical cancer cells and reveal the structure-activity relationships, their anti-proliferation effects on HeLa and CaSki cells were estimated. The cytotoxicity of sophorolipid molecules with different degrees of unsaturation was proved to be influenced by carbon chain length of sophorolipids. The longer the carbon chain length, the stronger the cytotoxicity of sophorolipids. The inhibitory mechanism of a di-acetylated lactonic C18:1 sophorolipid on HeLa cells was investigated. The cells developed many features of apoptosis and cell cycle was blocked at G0 phase and partly at G2 phase. The expression of CHOP and Bip/GRP78 was induced. Caspase-12 and caspase-3 were both activated. However, mitochondrial membrane potential and concentration of cytosolic cytochrome C did not change. The induced apoptosis of HeLa cells was probably triggered through endoplasmic reticulum signaling pathway without involvement of mitochondria. In vivo, 5, 50, and 500 mg/kg lactonic sophorolipids showed 29.90, 41.24, and 52.06 % of inhibition without significant toxicity to tumor-bearing mice, respectively. Our findings may suggest a potential use of sophorolipids in human cervical cancer treatment.
27727464	Evaluation of multiple primary and combination screening strategies in postmenopausal women for detection of cervical cancer in China.	As China's population ages, the importance of determining prevalence of cervical disease and accurate cervical cancer screening strategies for postmenopausal women is increasing. Seventeen population-based studies were analyzed to determine prevalence of cervical neoplasia in postmenopausal women. All women underwent HPV DNA testing, visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA) and cytology testing. Diagnostic values for primary and combinations screening methods included sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), referral rate and area under curve (AUC) were calculated using directed biopsy or four quadrants biopsy as reference standard. Premenopausal and postmenopausal women had equal HPV infection and cervical neoplasia rates (p > 0.05). HPV DNA testing CIN3+ sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, referral rate and AUC were 97.9% (95% CI: 90.2-99.9%), 84.2% (95% CI: 82.8-85.5%), 9.9% (95% CI: 7.4-12.8%), 100% (95% CI: 99.8-100%), 17.2% (95% CI: 15.9-18.7%), 0.911, respectively. VIA values were 41.7% (95% CI: 28.4-55.9%), 94.5% (95% CI: 93.6-95.3%), 11.8% (95% CI: 7.5-17.3%), 98.9% (95% CI: 98.5-99.3%), 6.2% (95% CI: 5.3-7.1%) and 0.681, respectively. Values for VIA with HPV triage were 39.6% (95% CI: 26.6-53.8%), 99.2% (95% CI: 98.8-99.5%), 45.2% (95% CI: 30.8-60.4%), 98.9% (95% CI: 98.5-99.3%), 1.5% (95% CI: 1.1-2.0%) and 0.694, respectively. VIA and HPV DNA co-test values were 100% (95% CI: 94.0-100%), 79.5% (95% CI: 78.0-81.0%), 8.0% (95% CI: 6.0-10.3%), 100% (95% CI: 99.9-100%), 21.9% (95% CI: 20.4-23.4%) and 0.898, respectively. VIA sensitivity decreases significantly in postmenopausal women compared to premenopausal performance. HPV DNA testing maintains performance between pre- and postmenopausal women and is the most accurate primary modality for screening postmenopausal populations in low resource areas of China.
27793757	Preparation and in vitro evaluation of vaginal formulations including siRNA and paclitaxel-loaded SLNs for cervical cancer.	Cervical cancer is one of the most life threatening types of cancer among women and is generally resistant to chemotherapy. The objective of this study was to prepare a vaginal suppository containing a chemotherapeutic agent and a genetic material that can be applied locally for cervical cancer. Paclitaxel was selected as the chemotherapeutic agent and siRNA which inhibits BCL-2 oncogene was selected as the genetic material. Bcl-2 siRNA, paclitaxel and paclitaxel/Bcl-2 siRNA combination were incorporated into solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) and were dispersed separately in vaginal suppositories prepared with PEG 6000. Physicochemical properties of SLNs, their cytotoxicities on HeLa cell lines and also the effect of SLNs on the total protein amount of the cells were examined followed by the investigation of release rates of the active materials from the SLNs prepared. Average diameters of all SLNs prepared were below 180nm with a positive zeta potential value between +22.20 and +48.16mV at the pH range of 4.2 and 7.4. The release of Bcl-2 siRNA from SLNs incorporated Bcl-2 siRNA and the release of paclitaxel (PTX) from PTX incorporated SLNs were completed within 12h and 36h. SLNs incorporating Bcl-2 siRNA and paclitaxel/Bcl-2 siRNA were found to be more toxic when compared to paclitaxel incorporated SLN and placebo SLN. The disintegration of the vaginal suppositories as well as the release of the SLNs was completed within 2 h. This study indicates that vaginal suppository containing SLNs can bring the advantages of the simultaneous delivery of paclitaxel and siRNA via vaginal route with no help from professionals.
27792826	Cervical metastasis in squamous cell carcinoma of the hard palate and maxillary alveolus.	We conducted a retrospective study to determine the incidence and treatment outcomes of neck metastases in patients with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the hard palate and/or maxillary alveolus after surgical excision of the primary tumor. We also sought to identify any risk factors for recurrence. Our study population was made up of 20 patients-9 men and 11 women, aged 46 to 88 years (mean: 72.6)-who had undergone excision of an SCC of the hard palate and/or maxillary alveolus at a tertiary care cancer center over a 7-year period. Half of all patients were former tobacco users. Of the 20 tumors, 10 involved the maxillary alveolus, 4 involved the hard palate, and 6 involved both sites. Three patients were clinically categorized as T1, 9 as T2, 6 as T3, and 2 as T4; pathologically, 8 tumors were categorized as T4a. In addition to maxillectomy, a neck dissection was performed in 7 patients-4 therapeutically and 3 electively. Eight of 20 patients experienced a recurrence: 4 local, 6 regional, and 2 distant (several patients had a recurrence at more than one site). Univariate analysis identified perineural invasion (p = 0.04) as a statistically significant risk factor for recurrence. Of 14 patients with a clinicopathologically negative neck, 5 (36%) developed a cervical recurrence, and 4 of them died of their disease. An advanced stage (T4 vs. <T4) was not significantly correlated with the risk of regional metastasis (p = 0.58). The rate of occult nodal metastasis in clinically and radiologically N0 necks was high. Clinical and radiologic understaging was common, and regional recurrences frequently resulted in death. We conclude that elective nodal evaluation and treatment of the neck warrants strong consideration for most patients with cancer of the hard palate and/or maxillary alveolus.
27789946	Real-time colorimetric detection of DNA methylation of the PAX1 gene in cervical scrapings for cervical cancer screening with thiol-labeled PCR primers and gold nanoparticles.	BACKGROUND: DNA methylation can induce carcinogenesis by silencing key tumor suppressor genes. Analysis of aberrant methylation of tumor suppressor genes can be used as a prognostic and predictive biomarker for cancer. In this study, we propose a colorimetric method for the detection of DNA methylation of the paired box gene 1 (PAX1) gene in cervical scrapings obtained from 42 patients who underwent cervical colposcopic biopsy. METHODS: A thiolated methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (MSP) primer was used to generate MSP products labeled with the thiol group at one end. After bisulfite conversion and MSP amplification, the unmodified gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) were placed in a reaction tube and NaCl was added to induce aggregation of bare AuNPs without generating polymerase chain reaction products. After salt addition, the color of AuNPs remained red in the methylated PAX1 gene samples because of binding to the MSP-amplified products. By contrast, the color of the AuNP colloid solution changed from red to blue in the non-methylated PAX1 gene samples because of aggregation of AuNPs in the absence of the MSP-amplified products. Furthermore, PAX1 methylation was quantitatively detected in cervical scrapings of patients with varied pathological degrees of cervical cancer. Conventional quantitative MSP (qMSP) was also performed for comparison. RESULTS: The two methods showed a significant correlation of the methylation frequency of the PAX1 gene in cervical scrapings with severity of cervical cancer (n=42, P<0.05). The results of the proposed method showed that the areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUCs) of PAX1 were 0.833, 0.742, and 0.739 for the detection of cervical intraepithelial neoplasms grade 2 and worse lesions (CIN2+), cervical intraepithelial neoplasms grade 3 and worse lesions (CIN3+), and squamous cell carcinoma, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity for detecting CIN2+ lesions were 0.941 and 0.600, respectively, with a cutoff value of 31.27%. The proposed method also showed superior sensitivity over qMSP methods for the detection of CIN2+ and CIN3+ (0.941 vs 0.824 and 1.000 vs 0.800, respectively). Furthermore, the novel method exhibited higher AUC (0.833) for the detection of CIN2+ than qMSP (0.807). CONCLUSION: The results of thiol-labeled AuNP method were clearly observed by the naked eyes without requiring any expensive equipment. Therefore, the thiol-labeled AuNP method could be a simple but efficient strategy for cervical cancer screening.
27716879	3D vision improves outcomes in early cervical cancer treated with laparoscopic type B radical hysterectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy.	PURPOSE: To evaluate the alterations on surgical outcomes after of the implementation of 3D laparoscopic technology for the surgical treatment of early-stage cervical carcinoma. METHODS: Data of patients undergoing type B radical hysterectomy (with or without bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy) and pelvic lymphadenectomy via 3D laparoscopy were compared with a historical cohort of patients undergoing type B radical hysterectomy via conventional laparoscopy. Complications (within 60 days) were graded per the Accordion severity system. RESULTS: Data of 75 patients were studied: 15 (20%) and 60 (80%) patients undergoing surgery via 3D laparoscopy and conventional laparoscopy, respectively. Baseline patient characteristics as well as pathologic findings were similar between groups (p&gt;0.1). Patients undergoing 3D laparoscopy experienced a trend toward shorter operative time than patients undergoing conventional laparoscopy (176.7 +/- 74.6 vs 215.9 +/- 61.6 minutes; p = 0.09). Similarly, patients undergoing 3D laparoscopic radical hysterectomy experienced shorter length of hospital stay (2 days, range 2-6, vs 4 days, range 3-11; p&lt;0.001) in comparison to patients in the control group, while no difference in estimated blood loss was observed (p = 0.88). No between-group difference in complication rate was observed. CONCLUSIONS: 3D technology is a safe and effective way to perform type B radical hysterectomy and pelvic node dissection in early-stage cervical cancer. Further large prospective studies are warranted in order to assess the cost-effectiveness of the introduction of 3D technology in comparison to robotic assisted surgery.
27640346	Ptaquiloside from bracken (Pteridium spp.) inhibits tumour-infiltrating CD8+ T cells in HPV-16 transgenic mice.	Bracken is a fern with worldwide distribution. Exposure to bracken toxins such as ptaquiloside is hypothesized to increase the risk of papillomavirus-related cancers of the upper digestive tract. Ptaquiloside is thought to be an immunosupressor, thus allowing for the development of viral lesions. We have used a human papillomavirus type 16-transgenic (K14-HPV16) mouse model to study the effects of ptaquiloside on tumour-infiltrating CD8+ T lymphocytes, which are critical players in anti-tumour immunity. HPV16+/- mice received ptaquiloside (0.5 mg/mouse/week) for 10 weeks. These were then euthanized at 30 weeks of age, along with age-matched untreated controls. Skin samples were enzymatically digested and CD8+ T cells analysed for CD107a and CD44 surface expression. Ptaquiloside-exposed HPV16+/- mice showed a significantly decreased percentage (P < 0.05) of CD8+CD107a+ and CD8+CD44 + T cells when compared with untreated HPV16+/- animals. Histologically, 100% of ptaquilosidetreated mice showed diffuse epidermal dysplasia, compared with 50% of the untreated mice. These findings suggest that ptaquiloside exerts an immunosuppressive role by decreasing CD8+ T cell activation and degranulation in HPV-induced lesions. Given the key role of CD8+ T lymphocytes against HPV-induced lesions, this effect is likely to contribute for viral persistence, tumour progression and increased aggressiveness in patients with HPV-related malignancies.
27612630	Theanine from tea and its semi-synthetic derivative TBrC suppress human cervical cancer growth and migration by inhibiting EGFR/Met-Akt/NF-kappaB signaling.	Cervical cancer is the third most prevalent cancer among women worldwide. Theanine from tea and its derivatives show some anticancer activities. However, the role of theanine and its derivatives against human cervical cancer and the molecular mechanisms of action remain unclear. Thus, in this study, we aim to investigate the anticancer activities and underlying mechanisms of theanine and a theanine derivative, ethyl 6-bromocoumarin-3- carboxylyl L-theanine (TBrC), against human cervical cancer. In vitro and in vivo assays for cancer cell growth and migration have confirmed the inhibition of the cell growth and migration by TBrC and theanine in highly-metastatic human cervical cancer. TBrC displays much stronger activity than theanine on inhibition of the cell growth and migration as well as induction of apoptosis and regulation of related protein expressions in the human cervical cancer cells. TBrC and theanine greatly reduced endogenous and exogenous factors-stimulated cell migration and completely repressed HGF- and EGF+HGF-activated EGFR/Met-Akt/NF-kappaB signaling by reducing the phosphorylation and expressions of EGFR, Met, Akt, and NF-kappaB in cervical cancer cells. The enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) knockdown decreased the cancer cell migration and NF-kappaB expression. The NF-kappaB knockdown reduced the cancer cell migration. TBrC and theanine reduced the EZH2 expression by more than 80%. In addition, TBrC and theanine significantly suppressed human cervical tumor growth in tumor-bearing nude mice without toxicity to the mice. Our results suggest that TBrC and theanine may have the potentials of the therapeutic and/or adjuvant therapeutic application in the treatment of human cervical cancer.
27501394	Comparison of methods using paraffin-embedded tissues and exfoliated cervical cells to evaluate human papillomavirus genotype attribution.	Monitoring the attribution of human papillomavirus (HPV) genotypes to cervical precancerous lesions is essential in assessing the efficacy of HPV vaccines. To resolve the lack of studies comparing the HPV genotyping procedures used to estimate HPV genotype attribution, we undertook a retrospective cross-sectional study to determine the appropriate genotyping procedures for evaluating the potential efficacy of HPV vaccines. Three procedures, including two different genotyping methods, Clinichip HPV test (C-Chip) and modified GP5+/6+ PCR coupled to fluorescent bead sorter detection (MGP), using exfoliated cervical cells (C-Chip and C-MGP, respectively) or formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues (F-MGP), were compared. The overall agreement in detecting high-risk HPV was 88.5-92.1% among the three procedures, and genotype-specific agreement was 83.9-100% for all pairwise comparisons. In cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2/3 specimens, HPV16/18 attribution estimated with the hierarchical attribution method was consistent among the procedures: 52.3% (45/86) for C-Chip, 54.7% (47/86) for C-MGP, and 52.3% (45/86) for F-MGP (P = 0.81). HPV16/18/31/33/45/52/58 hierarchical attribution was 88.4% (76/86) with C-Chip, 86.0% (74/86) with C-MGP, and 83.7% (72/86) with F-MGP (P = 0.49). In cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 specimens, the corresponding hierarchical attribution was 96.4% (53/55) with C-Chip, 89.1% (49/55) with C-MGP, and 94.5% (52/55) with F-MGP (P = 0.27). Although F-MGP is theoretically a reliable method for determining HPV genotype attribution, it is acceptable to use C-Chip or C-MGP, coupled to the hierarchical attribution formula to correct the bias of multiple infections. These approaches using exfoliated cervical cells are practical for monitoring the efficacy of HPV vaccines.
27455193	Human papillomavirus vaccine and Pap tests on college campuses: How do historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) measure up?	OBJECTIVE: The availability of cervical cancer prevention services at college health centers was compared between historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) and non-HBCUs. METHODS: Four-year, non-primarily distant learning colleges, matching HBCUs with randomly selected non-HBCUs within the same states (N = 136) were examined. Data were collected (2014-2015 academic year) on the availability of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine and Pap tests at college health centers. HBCUs were compared with non-HBCUs using conditional logistic regression, and correlates of offering these services were identified. RESULTS: Many institutions did not offer HPV vaccine or Pap tests. Fewer HBCUs offered HPV vaccine (18% vs 53%) and Pap tests (50% vs 76%) compared with non-HBCUs. In multivariable analyses, HBCUs remained less likely than non-HBCUs to offer HPV vaccine (odds ratio [OR] = 0.07, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.02-0.26) and Pap tests (OR = 0.19, 95% CI: 0.06-0.61). CONCLUSIONS: Greater effort is needed to make cervical cancer prevention services available at colleges, especially at HBCUs.
27443893	Feasibility and benefit of concurrent chemoradiotherapy for elderly patients with uterine cervical cancer.	BACKGROUND: Elderly patients with uterine cervical cancer reportedly have a poorer prognosis than younger patients. Until now, the benefit of concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) for elderly patients has been considered limited. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 49 women with cervical cancer aged &gt;70 years primarily treated with radiotherapy (RT) or CCRT in our institute between 2003 and 2014. Treatment compliance, toxicity, and survival benefit were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 49 patients were identified in this retrospective analysis. Twenty patients with a median age of 75.4 years (range 70-77) were treated with CCRT and 29 patients with a median age of 77.9 years (range 70-89) underwent RT. In the CCRT group, 14 patients (70%) completed CCRT consisting of radiotherapy and 5 courses of cisplatin plus 5-fluorouracil including patients requiring a dose reduction of chemotherapy. The median overall survival (OS) in the CCRT and RT groups was 66.9 and 60.1 months, respectively (p = 0.156). The most common grade 3/4 acute toxicity was hyponatremia (35.0%), followed by neutropenia (15.0%) and diarrhea (10.0%) in the CCRT group, while this was anemia (17.2%) followed by radiation enteritis (10.3%) in the RT group. CONCLUSIONS: CCRT was well tolerated in elderly patients with cervical cancer. Careful attention should be paid to the different characteristics of treatment-related toxicities in this group compared with younger patients.
27292107	Augmented Activity of Cyclooxygenase-2 in Tissue and Serum of Patients With Cervical Cancer.	BACKGROUND: Cyclooxygenase-2 (Cox-2) is frequently overexpressed in cervical carcinoma, but little is known about its altered serum concentration. Hence, this study evaluates clinical utility of cellular and serum level of Cox-2 enzyme in cervical cancer. METHODS: The expression of Cox-2 was evaluated in cervical tissues and serum samples collected from normal controls (n = 100; n = 68), cervical intraepithelial neoplasia patients (CIN, n = 67; n = 12), and invasive squamous cell carcinoma patients (SCCs; n = 153; n = 127) by immunohistochemical and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) analyses. RESULTS: The significant cytoplasmic overexpression of Cox-2 was noted in 50.7% of CIN and 69.9% of SCCs as compared with normal (P = 0.0001). Serum level of Cox-2 was also found to be elevated both in CIN (median 4.35 ng/ml) and in SCCs (median 19.39 ng/ml) with respect to normal (median 0.44 ng/ml; P = 0.0001), respectively. The ROC analysis revealed the potential of serum Cox-2 over its cellular expression to distinguish CIN and SCCs from normal. CONCLUSION: Augmented Cox-2 activity is implicated in the pathogenesis of cervical cancer, and its serum level could serve a potential to distinguish this malignancy. Therefore, it is suggested that serum Cox-2 may be useful in monitoring the diagnosis and treatment outcome of patients.
27265845	The Association of CYP1A1 Gene With Cervical Cancer and Additional SNP-SNP Interaction in Chinese Women.	AIMS: The aim of this study was to investigate the association between CYP1A1 gene polymorphism and cervical cancer risk, and the impact of SNP-SNP interaction on cervical cancer risk in Chinese women. METHODS: A total of 728 females with a mean age of 60.1 +/- 14.5 years old were selected, including 360 cervical cancer patients and 368 normal controls. Logistic regression was performed to investigate association between single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) and cervical cancer risk. Generalized multifactor dimensionality reduction (GMDR) was used to analyze the SNP-SNP interaction. RESULTS: Logistic analysis showed a significant association between rs4646903 and increased cervical cancer risk. The carriers of homozygous mutant of rs4646903 polymorphism revealed increased cervical cancer risk than those with wild-type homozygotes, OR (95%CI) were 1.45 (1.20-1.95). There was a significant two-locus model (P = 0.0107) involving rs4646903 and rs1048943, indicating a potential SNP-SNP interaction between rs4646903 and rs1048943. Overall, the two-locus models had a cross-validation consistency of 10 of 10, and had the testing accuracy of 60.72%. Subjects with TC or CC of rs4646903 and AG or GG of rs1048943 genotype have the highest cervical cancer risk, compared to subjects with TT of rs4646903 and AA of rs1048943 genotype, OR (95%CI) was 2.03 (1.42-2.89). CONCLUSIONS: rs4646903 minor alleles and interaction between rs4646903 and rs1048943 were associated with increased cervical cancer risk.
27197583	Involvement of myeloperoxidase gene polymorphism 463G>A in development of cervical squamous cell carcinoma.	BACKGROUND: The myeloperoxidase (MPO) -463G&gt;A (rs2333227) polymorphism has been linked with increased susceptibility to the development of various malignancies. However, the data on the association of the MPO -463G&gt;A transition with cervical cancer remain inconsistent. METHODS: Using high resolution melting analysis we genotyped this polymorphism in women with cervical squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) (n = 476) and controls (n = 493) from a Polish Caucasian population. Logistic regression analysis was used to adjust for the effect of confounders such as age, parity, oral contraceptive use, tobacco smoking, and menopausal status, and revealed that the MPO -463G&gt;A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) was associated with an increased risk of SCC. RESULTS: The adjusted odds ratio (OR) for patients with the A/A genotype versus G/G genotype was 0.718 (95% CI 0.531-0.972, p = 0.0316). Stratified analyses between the MPO -463G&gt;A polymorphism and SCC risks demonstrated a protective role of the MPO -463G&gt;A SNP in patients with a positive history of parity and negative history of tobacco smoking. In patients with a positive history of parity, the age-adjusted OR for the A/A versus G/G genotype was 0.667 (95% CI 0.479-0.929, p = 0.0164). The age-adjusted OR for patients with a negative history of tobacco smoking for the A/A versus G/G genotype was 0.491 (95% CI 0.313-0.770, p = 0.0019). CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated that the MPO -463G&gt;A SNP may protect from SCC in women from Polish Caucasian populations.
27184657	Exosomal Long Noncoding RNAs are Differentially Expressed in the Cervicovaginal Lavage Samples of Cervical Cancer Patients.	BACKGROUND: As the second leading cause of cancer morbidity and death in women, cervical cancer remains an important public health problem worldwide. Novel biomarkers with high sensitivity and specificity for the early detection and diagnosis of cervical cancer are urgently needed. Increasing evidence shows that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are differentially expressed in cancer tissues and may serve as diagnostic markers. In multiple tumor types, exosomes harboring lncRNAs are actively released from tumor cells. In this study, we investigate the potential association of exosomal lncRNA expression with cervical cancer. METHODS: Cervicovaginal lavage specimens were collected from patients with cervical cancer and cancer-free volunteers who are HPV-positive or HPV-negative. Exosomes in these specimens were isolated by ultracentrifugation and confirmed by transmission electron microscopy. The exosomal lncRNAs HOTAIR, MALAT1, and MEG3 were quantified by qRT-PCR. RESULTS: Expression of HOTAIR, MALAT1 and MEG3 was predominantly observed in cervical cancer-derived exosomes in cervicovaginal lavage samples. The expression levels of lncRNAs were significantly different in exosomes isolated from cervical cancer patients compared to normal controls. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that lncRNAs in exosomes isolated from cervicovaginal lavage are differentially expressed in cervical cancer patients and cancer-free volunteers. Exosomal lncRNAs may have great potential to be used for the early detection and diagnosis of cervical cancer, and serve as convenient and noninvasive biomarkers.
27133229	Three radiation-induced metachronous pelvic tumors in a patient who underwent radiotherapy for cervical cancer: a case report.	INTRODUCTION: Patients treated with radiotherapy are under increased long-term risk of developing radiation-induced tumors. In this report we present an exceptionally rare case of a patient who, following radiotherapy for cervical cancer, developed 3 radiation-induced metachronous pelvic tumors. CASE PRESENTATION: In 1997, a 37-year-old patient with cervical adenocarcinoma (FIGO stage IB2) was subjected to adjuvant conventionally fractionated external-beam radiation therapy and brachytherapy following surgical treatment. Eleven, 14 and 15 years later, 3 radiation-induced malignant tumors developed: a leiomyosarcoma of the gluteus and 2 separate carcinomas of the rectum. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Radiotherapy for cervical carcinoma increases the standardized incidence ratios for rectal cancer and soft tissue sarcoma. Unfortunately, the current guidelines on contraindications to radiotherapy appear insufficient as they take into account a very limited number of clinical states and associated conditions, which is in disproportion to the rather high risk of radiation-induced malignancies of 0.45%. Information on the molecular characteristics of human radiation-induced tumors is still of no relevance for everyday clinical practice. Although radiotherapy is one of the most important modalities of oncological treatment, it should be judiciously used in cases where the benefits clearly outweigh the risk of serious untoward effects. In the case of patients undergoing pelvic irradiation, careful follow-up is needed for years.
27121347	Comparison of Three Different Commercial Kits for the Human Papilloma Virus Genotyping.	BACKGROUND: High-risk type human papilloma virus (HPV) is the most important cause of cervical cancer. Recently, real-time polymerase chain reaction and reverse blot hybridization assay-based HPV DNA genotyping kits are developed. So, we compared the performances of different three HPV genotyping kits using different analytical principles and methods. METHODS: Two hundred positive and 100 negative cervical swab specimens were used. DNA was extracted and all samples were tested by the MolecuTech REBA HPV-ID, Anyplex II HPV28 Detection, and HPVDNAChip. Direct sequencing was performed as a reference method for confirming high-risk HPV genotypes 16, 18, 45, 52, and 58. RESULTS: Although high-level agreement results were observed in negative samples, three kits showed decreased interassay agreement as screening setting in positive samples. Comparing the genotyping results, three assays showed acceptable sensitivity and specificity for the detection of HPV 16 and 18. Otherwise, various sensitivities showed in the detection of HPV 45, 52, and 58. CONCLUSIONS: The three assays had dissimilar performance of HPV screening capacity and exhibited moderate level of concordance in HPV genotyping. These discrepant results were unavoidable due to difference in type-specific analytical sensitivity and lack of standardization; therefore, we suggested that the efforts to standardization of HPV genotyping kits and adjusting analytical sensitivity would be important for the best clinical performance.
27788516	The Role of Cytology in the 21st Century: The Integration of Cells and Molecules.	OBJECTIVES: Cervical cancer screening test performance has been hampered by either a lack of sensitivity in Pap cytology or a lack of specificity of human papillomavirus (HPV) testing. This is disturbing for patients and a cause of high costs for health care providers. STUDY DESIGN: The identification of p16INK4a as a specific marker for the neoplastic transformation of cervical squamous epithelial cells by HPVs allows the identification of HPV-transformed cells in cytopathology specimens. RESULTS: When compared to molecular HPV tests for triaging minor cytologic atypia, such as atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance or low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions, the immunochemical detection of dual p16INK4a/Ki-67-stained cells demonstrates a significantly improved specificity with good relative sensitivity. CONCLUSIONS: HPV testing has shown earlier detection of persistent high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL) compared to cytology and is more effective in preventing invasive cervical cancer. The next challenge for the HPV primary screening program is to find the best method(s) for selecting, among HPV-positive women, those patients in need of immediate colposcopy because they are at a higher risk of developing a precancerous lesion. An HSIL cytology result and/or dual p16/Ki-67 staining could be the best candidates, but further randomized studies are required before these approaches can be used in routine practice.
27718288	Usefulness of a management protocol for patients with cervical multicystic lesions: A retrospective analysis of 94 cases and the significance of GNAS mutation.	AIM: The proper preoperative diagnosis and management of cervical proliferative disorders presenting with multiple cysts, including minimal deviation adenocarcinoma (MDA), lobular endocervical glandular hyperplasia (LEGH), and nabothian cyst (NC), have not been fully established. We previously proposed a management protocol comprising a diagnostic approach using cytology, magnetic resonance imaging, and gastric-type mucin and subsequent treatment. We herein evaluate the usefulness of this protocol and implications of GNAS mutations in LEGH. METHODS: The clinical courses of 94 patients with cervical multicystic lesions who visited our hospital between June 1995 and September 2014 were retrospectively analyzed. GNAS mutations were investigated in 10 LEGH, five LEGH with atypia, and two MDA cases. RESULTS: Of the 94 patients, the conditions of 10, 59, and 25 were clinically diagnosed as suspicious of MDA or carcinoma (S/O MDA-Ca), suspicious of LEGH (S/O LEGH), and NC, respectively. Ten patients each with S/O MDA-Ca and S/O LEGH underwent hysterectomy, and the correct ratio for diagnosis was 90% (18/20). Of the 42 S/O LEGH cases followed-up for more than 12 months, three showed an increase in tumor size. After hysterectomy, two were LEGH with atypia while one was NC. The GNAS mutation was detected in two cases of LEGH with atypia, one of which showed an increase in tumor size during follow-up. CONCLUSION: The management protocol we propose herein will be useful. An increase in tumor size is important to detect potentially malignant LEGH. GNAS mutations may be involved in the tumorigenesis of potentially malignant LEGH.
27780751	Medicinal plants used in Lesotho for treatment of reproductive and post reproductive problems.	ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Reproductive healthcare has been highlighted as a major challenge in Lesotho mainly due to the high prevalence of HIV/AIDS and sexually transmitted infections. As a result other reproductive ailments have not received much attention, particularly because healthcare facilities are already limited and many of them are inaccessible. For these reasons, medicinal plants play a major role in primary healthcare system in the country, in addition the plants are easily accessible, more affordable, and their use forms part of the cultural heritage. However, documentation of medicinal plants used for reproductive ailments is scattered, more importantly the biological and pharmacological properties, as well as toxicity of many of these plants are not yet known. AIM OF THE STUDY: To document the plants used by both male and female Basotho (residing in Lesotho) for the treatment of reproductive ailments, to explore their recorded biological and pharmacological effects as well as their toxicity, and to establish if these plants are used for similar purposes in other southern African cultures. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The results stem from published findings of recent interviews of traditional medicinal practitioners in the Maseru District of Lesotho, first author's own experiences and observations from the Qacha's Nek District as well as comprehensive literature survey including numerous books and unpublished data. Electronic databases such as Google, Google Scholar, PubMed, and ScienceDirect were also used to search for the chemical compounds, pharmacological activity, and toxicity of the plants. RESULTS: A total of 87 plant species are reported to be used for the treatment of several reproductive problems such as infertility, complications associated with pregnancy (twelve plants are used to treat conditions such as colic, heartburn, nausea, and constipation), cleansing and/ or toning of the uterus (with a purpose either to induce pregnancy or to get rid of the placenta, for example Withania somnifera and Zantedeschia albomaculata), difficult childbirth, as well treatment of breast and cervical cancer, cysts, fibroids, and testicular tumours (e.g. Hypoxis hemerocallidea). For the toning of the uterus, it is common to use a combination of plants, e.g. Gunnera perpensa, Scabiosa columbaria, and Eriospermum ornithogaloides. CONCLUSIONS: Of the 87 plants used for reproductive healthcare, the highest number (31) is used for the treatment of infertility (in both men and women). The pharmacological effects, active compounds, and toxicology of many of these plants are not yet known.
27220494	MiR-21 modulates radiosensitivity of cervical cancer through inhibiting autophagy via the PTEN/Akt/HIF-1alpha feedback loop and the Akt-mTOR signaling pathway.	MiR-21 is an important microRNA (miRNA) modulating radiosensitivity of cervical cancer cells. However, the underlying mechanism of miR-21 upregulation in radioresistant cervical cancer has not been fully understood. In addition, autophagy may either promote or alleviate radioresistance, depending on the types of cancer and tumor microenvironment. How autophagy affects radiosensitivity in cervical cancer and how miR-21 is involved in this process has not been reported. This study showed that miR-21 upregulation in radioresistant cervical cancer is related to HIF-1alpha overexpression. MiR-21 overexpression decreases PTEN, increases p-Akt, and subsequently increases HIF-1alpha expression, while miR-21 inhibition results in increased PTEN, decreased p-Akt, and then decreased HIF-1alpha. Therefore, we inferred that there is a HIF-1alpha-miR-21 positive feedback loop through the PTEN/Akt/HIF-1alpha pathway in cervical cancer cells. In addition, we also demonstrated that miR-21 confers decreased autophagy in cervical cancer cells after IR via the Akt-mTOR signaling pathway. Decreased autophagy is one of the potential mechanisms of increased radioresistance in cervical cancer cells. These findings expand our understanding of radioresistance development in cervical cancer.
27155849	Analysis of APOBEC3A/3B germline deletion polymorphism in breast, cervical and oral cancers from South India and its impact on miRNA regulation.	Breast cancer and cervical cancer are the leading causes of death in women worldwide as well as in India, whilst oral cancer is the top most common cancer among Asian especially in Indian men in terms of both incidence and mortality rate. Genetic factors determining the predisposition to cancer are being explored to identify the signature genetic variations associated with these cancers. Recently, a germline deletion polymorphism in APOBEC3 gene cluster which completely deletes APOBEC3B coding region has been studied for its association with cancer risk. We screened the germline deletion polymorphism in 409 cancer patients (224 breast cancer, 88 cervical cancer and 97 oral cancer samples), 478 controls and 239 cervical cancer tissue DNAs of South Indian origin. The results suggest that the APOBEC3A/3B deletion polymorphism is not significantly associated with cancer risk in our study population (OR 0.739, 95 % CI, p value 0.91457). Considering the viral restriction property of APOBEC3s, we also screened cervical cancer tissue DNAs for the human papilloma virus infection. We observed a gradual increase in the frequency of HPV16 infection from AA/BB cases (66.86 %) to AA/-- cases (71.43) which signifies the impact of this deletion polymorphism in HPV infection. In addition, we performed in silico analysis to understand the effect of this polymorphism on miRNA regulation of the APOBEC3A/3B fusion transcript. Only 8 APOBEC3B targeting miRNAs were observed to regulate the fusion transcript of which miR-34b-3p and miR-138-5p were found to be frequently downregulated in cancers suggesting miRNA-mediated deregulation of APOBEC3A expression in cancer patients harbouring this particular deletion polymorphism.
27034261	Wnt-11 overexpression promoting the invasion of cervical cancer cells.	Wnt-11 is a positive regulator of the Wnt signaling pathway, which plays a crucial role in carcinogenesis. However, Wnt-11 expression in cervical cancer has not been well investigated. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of Wnt-11 in cervical tumor proliferation and invasion. This study examined 24 normal cervical squamous epithelia, 29 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), and 78 cervical cancer samples. The expression of Wnt-11 was investigated by immunohistochemistry and quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis. The expression of the high-risk human papilloma virus (HR-HPV) E6 oncoprotein was also investigated by immunohistochemistry. In addition, the expression of Wnt-11, HR-HPV E6, JNK-1, phosphorylated JNK-1(P-JNK1), and beta-catenin was examined by western blot analysis following Wnt-11 knockdown or overexpression in HeLa or SiHa cells, respectively. The promotion of cervical cancer cell proliferation and invasion was investigated using the cell counting kit-8 and Matrigel invasion assay, respectively. Wnt-11 and HR-HPV E6 expression increased in a manner that corresponded with the progression of cervical cancer and was significantly correlated with the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics cancer stage, lymph node metastasis, tumor size, and HPV infection. Wnt-11 protein expression was positively associated with HR-HPV E6 protein expression in all 78 cervical cancer samples (P < 0.001). Furthermore, Wnt-11 was positively associated with P-JNK1 expression and promoted cervical cancer cell proliferation and invasion. These observations suggest that the increased Wnt-11 expression observed in cervical cancer cells may lead to the phosphorylation and activation of JNK-1 and significantly promote tumor cell proliferation and cell migration/invasion through activation of the Wnt/JNK pathway. Consequently, Wnt-11 may serve as a novel target for cervical cancer therapy.
27776666	Can quantitative contrast-enhanced ultrasonography predict cervical tumor response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy?	OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the feasibility of quantitative contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (CEUS) for predicting and assessing cervical tumor response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT). METHODS: Thirty-eight cases with stage IB2 or IIA cervical cancer were studied using CEUS before and after one cycle of NACT. The quantitative CEUS parameters maximum intensity (IMAX), rise time (RT), time to peak (TTP), and mean transit time (MTT) were compared between cervical tumors and myometrium (reference zone) using Sonoliver software. Absolute and relative changes in quantitative CEUS parameters were also compared among complete response, partial response, and non-responsive groups. Correlations between pre-treatment IMAX and changes in quantitative parameters were assessed after one cycle of NACT. RESULTS: There were significant changes in cervical tumor IMAX (P<0.001), RT (P<0.05), and TTP (P<0.05) after one cycle of NACT. According to the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors guidelines, the enrollments were divided into complete response, partial response, stable disease and progressive disease groups. There were no significant differences in quantitative CEUS parameters among complete response, partial response, and non-responsive groups (P>0.05). In the stable disease group (n=17), cervical tumor IMAX, RT, and TTP decreased significantly after NACT (P<0.001). The absolute and percentage changes in IMAX were positively correlated with pre-treatment IMAX in all 38 patients (r=0.576, P<0.001 and r=0.429, P<0.001). CONCLUSION: Quantitative CEUS analysis can reveal changes in tumor perfusion following NACT. Tumor perfusion values changes likely precede size changes during the NACT course, and pre-treatment IMAX may be a valuable predictor of cervical tumor perfusion response to NACT with a great decrease in IMAX correlated with better perfusion response.
27776644	Hybrid imaging for detection of carcinoma of unknown primary: A preliminary comparison trial of whole-body PET/MRI versus PET/CT.	PURPOSE: The aim of this study is to evaluate and compare the diagnostic potential of integrated whole-body [18F]FDG-PET/MRI to [18F]FDG-PET/CT for detection of a potential primary cancer and metastases in patients suspected for cancer of unknown primary (CUP). METHODS: A total of 20 patients (15 male, 5 female, age 53+/-13 years) suspect for CUP underwent a dedicated head and neck & whole-body [18F]FDG-PET/CT (Biograph mCT 128, Siemens Healthcare) and a subsequent simultaneous [18F]FDG-PET/MRI examination (Biograph mMR, Siemens Healthcare). Two readers rated the datasets (PET/CT; PET/MRI) regarding the detection of the primary cancer and metastases, lesion conspicuity (4-point ordinal scale) and diagnostic confidence (3-point ordinal scale). PET analysis comprised the assessment of maximum standardized uptake values (SUVmax) of all PET-positive lesions using volume of interest (VOI) analysis derived from the PET/CT and PET/MR datasets. All available data considering histology and imaging including prior and clinical follow-up examinations served as reference standard. Statistical analysis included comparison of mean values using Mann-Whitney U test and correlation of SUVmax using Pearson's correlation. RESULTS: In 14 out of 20 patients 49 malignant lesions were present. The primary cancer could be correctly identified in 11/20 patients with both PET/CT and PET/MRI. PET/CT enabled the detection of a total 38 metastases, PET/MR respectively of 37 metastases (one lung metastasis <5mm was missed). PET/CT and PET/MRI showed comparably high lesion conspicuity (2.6+/-0.6 each), with superior assessment of cervical lesions in PET/MRI and an indicated superior assessment of pulmonary lesions in PET/CT. Diagnostic confidence was rated comparably high in PET/CT and PET/MRI (2.7+/-0.5 each). The mean values of SUVmax of all PET-positive lesions (PET/MRT 7.9+/-4.2 vs. PET/CT 7.2+/-3.5) showed a strong positive correlation between the SUVs derived from both hybrid imaging systems (Pearson's correlation r=0.927). CONCLUSIONS: Both hybrid imaging techniques provide a comparable diagnostic ability for detection of primary cancer and metastases in patients with CUP, with comparably high lesion conspicuity and diagnostic confidence, offering superior assessment of cervical lesions in PET/MRI and potentially of pulmonary lesions in PET/CT. Furthermore, due to the significantly lower dose of ionizing radiation, PET/MRI may serve as a powerful alternative to PET/CT, particularly for therapy monitoring and/or surveillance considering the long-term cumulative dose.
27714942	Management of atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance or low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions of the uterine cervix with human papilloma virus infection among young women aged less than 25 years.	Current ASCCP guidelines recommend repeat cytology 12 months after HPV-positive results in women aged 21-24 years with either atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS) or a low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL). The purpose of this study was to validate an algorithm in such women with ASCUS or LSIL. A multicenter cross-sectional study was carried out at three academic hospitals involving 40,847 Korean women who underwent cervical cancer screening with cytology and HPV testing with or without subsequent colposcopic biopsies between January 2007 and December 2013. Among a total of 3,193 women with available histopathology data, 762 women with ASCUS and 758 with LSIL were HPV-positive. Among HPV-positive women with ASCUS, 38.5% of women aged 21-24 years had >/=CIN2, compared to 20.8% of women aged 30-65 years and 21.1% of the total women. Among HPV-positive women with LSIL, 25.8% aged 21-24 years had >/=CIN2, compared to 21.2% of women aged 30-65 years and 21.9% of the total women. In HPV-positive women with ASCUS/LSIL aged less than 25 years, the prevalence of >/=CIN2 lesions was 34.5%, which was significantly higher than that (21.0%) in women aged >/=25 years. The risk of >/=CIN2 lesions in HPV-positive Korean women aged 21-24 years with ASCUS or LSIL was not lower than that in older women. Colposcopic examination should be considered for management of HPV-positive young women with ASCUS or LSIL. Diagn. Cytopathol. 2016;44:959-963. (c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
27530406	Hierarchy of Knowledge Translation: From Health Problems to Ad-Hoc Drug Design.	An innovative approach to analyze the complexity of translating novel molecular entities and nanomaterials into pharmaceutical alternatives (i.e., knowledge translation, KT) is discussed. First, some key concepts on the organization and translation of the biomedical knowledge (paradigms, homophily, power law distributions, hierarchy, modularity, and research fronts) are reviewed. Then, we propose a model for the knowledge translation (KT) in Drug Discovery that considers the complexity of interdisciplinary communication. Specifically, we address two highly relevant aspects: 1) A successful KT requires the emergence of organized bodies of inter-and transdisciplinary research, and 2) The hierarchical and modular topological organization of these bodies of knowledge. We focused on a set of previously-published studies on KT which rely on a combination of network analysis and computer-assisted analysis of the contents of scientific literature and patents. The selected studies provide a duo of complementary perspectives: the demand of knowledge (cervical cancer and Ebola hemorrhagic fever) and the supply of knowledge (liposomes and nanoparticles to treat cancer and the paradigmatic Doxil, the first nano- drug to be approved).
27775933	Clitoral Metastasis From Advanced Cervical Carcinoma on 18F-FDG-PET/CT.	Metastatic tumors of the clitoris from cervical carcinoma are extremely rare. Here, we described a 54-year-old woman with clitoral metastasis from cervical carcinoma demonstrated on F-FDG PET/CT images.
27775588	NR2F6 Expression Correlates with Pelvic Lymph Node Metastasis and Poor Prognosis in Early-Stage Cervical Cancer.	BACKGROUND: There is an abnormal expression of nuclear receptor subfamily 2 group F member 6 (NR2F6) in human cancers such as breast cancer, colon cancer, and acute myelogenous leukemia. However, its clinical significance in cervical cancer has not been established. We explored NR2F6 expression and its clinicopathological significance in early-stage cervical cancer. METHODS: NR2F6 expression in cervical cancer cell lines and cervical cancer tissues was determined by Western blotting, real-time PCR, and immunochemistry (IHC). NR2F6 expression in 189 human early-stage cervical cancer tissue samples was evaluated using IHC. The relevance between NR2F6 expression and early-stage cervical cancer prognosis and clinicopathological features was determined. RESULTS: There was marked NR2F6 mRNA and protein overexpression in the cervical cancer cells and clinical tissues compared with an immortalized squamous cell line and adjacent noncancerous cervical tissues, respectively. In the 189 cervical cancer samples, NR2F6 expression was positively related to International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage (p = 0.006), squamous cell carcinoma antigen (p = 0.006), vital status (p < 0.001), tumor recurrence (p = 0.001), chemotherapy (p = 0.039), and lymph node metastasis (p < 0.001). Overall and disease-free survival was shorter in patients with early-stage cervical cancer and higher NR2F6 levels than in patients with lower levels of NR2F6. Univariate and multivariate analysis determined that NR2F6 was an independent prognostic factor of survival in early-stage cervical cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our findings suggest that high NR2F6 expression predicts pelvic lymph node metastasis, tumor recurrence and poor prognosis in early-stage cervical cancer. NR2F6 might be a novel prognostic biomarker and potential therapeutic target of cervical cancer.
27775261	The epidemiologic status of gynecologic cancer in Thailand.	Between the years of 2010-2012, it was estimated there were a total of 112,392 new cases of cancers in Thailand, thus, the total age-standardized rate (ASR) per 100,000 is 137.6. In regards to the most prevalent types of cancer in female, breast cancer has the highest ASR, followed by cervical cancer (ASR=14.4); liver and bile duct cancer; colon and rectum cancer; trachea, bronchus and lung cancer; ovarian cancer (ASR=6.0); thyroid cancer; non-Hodgkin lymphoma and uterine cancer (ASR=4.3). The trend of cervical cancer in Thailand is decreasing, one key factor in making this possible was the employment of dual tract strategy (Pap smear and visual inspection with acetic acid [VIA]) by the government in 2005. In the future, the government is also considering integrating human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination into the national immunization program, which may assist in the prevention of cervical cancer. By studying the statistical data of gynecologic cancer, it will be possible to formulate measures for the prevention, control and treatment of gynecologic cancer. Eventually, it will potentially improve the quality of life (QoL) of patients as well as decrease the mortality rate caused by gynecologic cancer.
27775259	Major clinical research advances in gynecologic cancer in 2015.	In 2015, fourteen topics were selected as major research advances in gynecologic oncology. For ovarian cancer, high-level evidence for annual screening with multimodal strategy which could reduce ovarian cancer deaths was reported. The best preventive strategies with current status of evidence level were also summarized. Final report of chemotherapy or upfront surgery (CHORUS) trial of neoadjuvant chemotherapy in advanced stage ovarian cancer and individualized therapy based on gene characteristics followed. There was no sign of abating in great interest in immunotherapy as well as targeted therapies in various gynecologic cancers. The fifth Ovarian Cancer Consensus Conference which was held in November 7-9 in Tokyo was briefly introduced. For cervical cancer, update of human papillomavirus vaccines regarding two-dose regimen, 9-valent vaccine, and therapeutic vaccine was reviewed. For corpus cancer, the safety concern of power morcellation in presumed fibroids was explored again with regard to age and prevalence of corpus malignancy. Hormone therapy and endometrial cancer risk, trabectedin as an option for leiomyosarcoma, endometrial cancer and Lynch syndrome, and the radiation therapy guidelines were also discussed. In addition, adjuvant therapy in vulvar cancer and the updated of targeted therapy in gynecologic cancer were addressed. For breast cancer, palbociclib in hormone-receptor-positive advanced disease, oncotype DX Recurrence Score in low-risk patients, regional nodal irradiation to internal mammary, supraclavicular, and axillary lymph nodes, and cavity shave margins were summarized as the last topics covered in this review.
27771695	The Biological Impact of Genomic Diversity in Cervical Cancer Development.	Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are the etiologic agents of cervical cancer, the unique human neoplasia that has one single necessary cause. The diversity of HPVs is well described, with 200 HPV types existing as distinct taxonomic units and each receiving an Arabic number. On a clinical basis, they are usually grouped by their site of occurrence and disease associations. Those types inhabiting the anogenital mucosa are more intensively studied and further divided into cancer-associated HPVs, which are termed 'high risk', while those linked to benign proliferative lesions are assigned as 'low risk'. HPV16 is responsible for approximately 50% of all ICC cases, and paradoxically is one of the most prevalent types among healthy women. Longitudinal studies have shown that when an incidental HPV16 infection becomes persistent it will result in an enhanced risk for the development of high-grade lesions. However, it is unknown why some persistent, HPV16 infections (or infections by other HR-HPV types) progress to CIN3+ while most clear spontaneously. Several epidemiological investigations have focused on cofactors, from the most obvious such as cigarette and other carcinogenic exposures, to coinfections by other STDs such as chlamydia, with no significant findings. Thus, the current focus is on genomic variation from both virus and host. Such studies have been potentialized by the enormous technical advances in nucleic acid sequencing, allowing this relationship to be broadly interrogated. Corroborating subgenomic data from decades ago, an association between HPV16 lineages and carcinogenesis is being revealed. However, this effect does not seem to apply across female populations from different continents/ethnicities, again highlighting a role played by HPV16 adaptation and evasion from the host over time.
27771111	Ziconotide intrathecal delivery as treatment for secondary therapeutic failure of motor cortex stimulation after 6 years.	INTRODUCTION: Motor cortex stimulation is a well-known treatment modality for refractory neuropathic pain. Nevertheless, some cases of therapeutic failure have been described but alternative therapies for these cases are rarely reported. CASE REPORT: The patient presented with neuropathic pain in his right arm due to a cervical syrinx which was surgically treated by a shunt in 2003 with no clinical improvement. As alternative therapy, after an evaluation by repetitive magnetic transcranial stimulation with significant benefit, motor cortex stimulation was successfully implanted in 2004. In 2010, a similar pain occurred in the same territory. Local mean pain visual analogical scale (VAS) increased to 82/100. A newer generation stimulation device was then implanted and, within a period of 8months, different stimulation parameter settings were tested, without any pain relief. An intrathecal drug delivery pump was then implanted in 2011, and the upper extremity catheter was located at the cervicothoracic junction. There was no postoperative complication. A bitherapy was initiated at a daily dosage of 0.2mg morphine and 1.3mug ziconotide, not modified since August 2013. At 43months follow-up, mean VAS was 21/100 with improvement of daily life and spare-time activities, anxiety and depression, quality of life (as measured by the SF-36 survey and EQ5D-3L questionnaire). DISCUSSION: Refractory neuropathic pain treated by motor cortex stimulation may be considered in palliative situations, and secondary therapeutic failure offers only a few perspectives. Intrathecal ziconotide, indicated as a first-line drug in non-cancer pain, could be proposed in such cases. CONCLUSION: Intrathecal drug delivery including ziconotide in refractory neuropathic pain represents a reasonable option with a good clinical tolerance.
27770816	Apparent diffusion coefficient histogram shape analysis for monitoring early response in patients with advanced cervical cancers undergoing concurrent chemo-radiotherapy.	BACKGROUND: To explore the role of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) histogram shape related parameters in early assessment of treatment response during the concurrent chemo-radiotherapy (CCRT) course of advanced cervical cancers. METHODS: This prospective study was approved by the local ethics committee and informed consent was obtained from all patients. Thirty-two patients with advanced cervical squamous cell carcinomas underwent diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging (b values, 0 and 800 s/mm2) before CCRT, at the end of 2nd and 4th week during CCRT and immediately after CCRT completion. Whole lesion ADC histogram analysis generated several histogram shape related parameters including skewness, kurtosis, s-sDav, width, standard deviation, as well as first-order entropy and second-order entropies. The averaged ADC histograms of 32 patients were generated to visually observe dynamic changes of the histogram shape following CCRT. RESULTS: All parameters except width and standard deviation showed significant changes during CCRT (all P < 0.05), and their variation trends fell into four different patterns. Skewness and kurtosis both showed high early decline rate (43.10 %, 48.29 %) at the end of 2nd week of CCRT. All entropies kept decreasing significantly since 2 weeks after CCRT initiated. The shape of averaged ADC histogram also changed obviously following CCRT. CONCLUSIONS: ADC histogram shape analysis held the potential in monitoring early tumor response in patients with advanced cervical cancers undergoing CCRT.
27565844	Effects of RECQ1 helicase silencing on non-small cell lung cancer cells.	RECQ1, the most abundant one of the human RecQ helicases family, has been identified as a prometastasis gene in breast and cervical cancers. However, the effects of RECQ1 on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and the underlying molecular mechanisms are still unclear. In the present study, RECQ1 expression (in three NSCLC cell lines and one bronchial epithelial cell line) was detected by real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). Expression of RECQ1 in A549 cells was knocked down by lentivirus-mediated RNA interference technique (RNAi). The effects of RECQ1 knockdown on cell proliferation, migration and invasion were assessed by Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay and transwell assays. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-associated proteins (E-cadherin, N-cadherin as well as vimentin) were detected by RT-qPCR and western blotting analyses. We found that RECQ1 expression was significantly higher in three NSCLC cell lines than that in a normal human bronchial epithelial cell line. Knocking down RECQ1 significantly suppressed A549 cell proliferation, migration and invasion. The expressions of the epithelial marker, E-cadherin were elevated in both mRNA and protein levels, whereas the expressions of the mesenchymal markers, N-cadherin and vimentin were decreased. Taken together, our findings suggest that RECQ1 may act as an important mediator in promoting lung cancer progression via modulation of the EMT. RECQ1 might represent a potential therapeutic target in NSCLC.
27550405	Carcinoma of the cervix in elderly patients treated with radiotherapy: patterns of care and treatment outcomes.	OBJECTIVE: The aim of this analysis was to examine the management of cervix cancer in elderly patients referred for radiotherapy and the results of treatment in terms of overall survival (OS), relapse-free survival (RFS), and treatment-related toxicities. METHODS: Patients were eligible if they were aged >/=75 years, newly diagnosed with cervix cancer and referred for radiotherapy as part of their treatment. Patient details were retrieved from the gynaecology service database where clinical, histopathological treatment and follow-up data were prospectively collected. RESULTS: From 1998 to 2010, 126 patients aged >/=75 years, met selection criteria. Median age was 81.5 years. Eighty-one patients had definitive radiotherapy, 10 received adjuvant radiotherapy and 35 had palliative radiotherapy. Seventy-one percent of patients had the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage 1b-2b disease. Median follow-up was 37 months. OS and RFS at 3 years among those treated with curative intent were 66.6% and 75.9% respectively with majority of patients dying without any evidence of cervix cancer. Grade 2 or more late toxicities were: bladder 5%, bowel 11%, and vagina 27%. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) status was a significant predictor of OS and RFS with each unit increment in ECOG score increased the risk of death by 1.69 times (p<0.001). CONCLUSION: Following appropriate patient selection, elderly patients treated curatively with radiotherapy for cervix cancer have good disease control. Palliative hypofractionated regimens are well tolerated in patients unsuitable for radical treatment.
27550402	Can human papillomavirus (HPV) genotyping classify non-16/18 high-risk HPV infection by risk stratification?	OBJECTIVE: Infection with high-risk genotypes of human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) is the major cause of invasive cervical cancers. HPV-16 and HPV-18 are known to be responsible for two-thirds of all invasive cervical carcinomas, followed by HPV-45, -31, and -33. Current guidelines only differentiate HPV-16/18 (+) by recommending direct colposcopy for treatment. We tried to evaluate whether there are differences in risk among 12 non-16/18 HR-HPV genotypes in this study. METHODS: The pathology archive database records of 1,102 consecutive gynecologic patients, who had results for cervical cytology and histology and for HPV testing, as determined by HPV 9G DNA chip, were reviewed. RESULTS: Among the 1,102 patients, 346 were non-16/18 HR-HPV (+) and 231 were HPV-16/18 (+). We calculated the odds ratios for >/=cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2 (CIN 2) of 14 groups of each HR-HPV genotype compared with a group of HR-HPV (-) patients. Based on the odds ratio of each genotype, we divided patients with non-16/18 HR-HPV genotypes (+) into two groups: HPV-31/33/35/45/52/58 (+) and HPV-39/51/56/59/66/68 (+). The age-adjusted odds ratios for >/=CIN 2 of the HPV-31/33/35/45/52/58 (+) and HPV-39/51/56/59/66/68 (+) groups compared with a HR-HPV (-) group were 11.9 (95% CI, 7.6 to 18.8; p<0.001) and 2.4 (95% CI, 1.4 to 4.3; p<0.001), respectively, while that of the HPV-16/18 (+) group was 18.1 (95% CI, 11.6 to 28.3; p=0.003). CONCLUSION: The 12 non-16/18 HR-HPV genotypes can be further categorized (HPV-31/33/35/45/52/58 vs. HPV-39/51/56/59/66/68) by risk stratification. The HPV-31/33/35/45/52/58 genotypes might need more aggressive action. Large scale clinical trials or cohort studies are necessary to confirm our suggestion.
27550401	A prediction model of survival for patients with bone metastasis from uterine cervical cancer.	OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to establish a predictive model of survival period after bone metastasis from cervical cancer. METHODS: A total of 54 patients with bone metastasis from cervical cancer were included in the study. Data at the time of bone metastasis diagnosis, which included presence of extraskeletal metastasis, performance status, history of any previous radiation or chemotherapy, the number of bone metastases, onset period, and treatment were collected. Survival data were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazards model. RESULTS: The median survival period after diagnosis of bone metastasis was 22 weeks (5 months). The 26- and 52-week survival rates after bone metastasis were 36.5% and 15.4%, respectively. Cox regression analysis showed that extraskeletal metastasis (hazard ratio [HR], 6.1; 95% CI, 2.2 to 16.6), performance status of 3 to 4 (HR, 7.8; 95% CI, 3.3 to 18.2), previous radiation or chemotherapy (HR, 3.3; 95% CI, 1.4 to 7.8), multiple bone metastases (HR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.0 to 3.5), and a bone metastasis-free interval of <12 months (HR, 2.5; 95% CI, 1.2 to 5.3) were significantly and independently related to poor survival. A prognostic score was calculated by adding the number of each significant factor. The 26-week survival rates after diagnosis of bone metastasis were 70.1% in the group with a score </=2, 46.7% in the group with a score of 3, and 12.5% in the group with a score >/=4 (p<0.001). CONCLUSION: This scoring system provided useful prognostic information on survival of patients with bone metastasis of cervical cancer.
27505862	MiR-139-3p induces cell apoptosis and inhibits metastasis of cervical cancer by targeting NOB1.	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play an important role in the development of various cancers, including cervical cancer (CC). The dysregulation of miRNA expression is associated with oncogenic transformation and miRNA often act as tumor suppressors. In this study, we aimed to analyze the effect on and mechanism of miR-139-3p in the progression of CC. The result of real-time PCR showed that miR-139-3p was down-regulated in CC tissues and cell lines. Overexpression of miR-139-3p significantly suppressed HeLa cell proliferation, migration and invasion and induced cell apoptosis. Bioinformatics analysis and luciferase reporter gene assay confirmed that NOB1 was targeted by miR-139-3p at the 3'-untranslated region (3'UTR) of its mRNA sequence. Furthermore, overexpression of NOB1 counteracted the effects of miR-139-3p suppression. Our results suggest that miR-139-3p may act as a tumor suppressor that can inhibit CC cell proliferation, migration and invasion and induce cell apoptosis through down-regulation of NOB1 expression. Taken together, this study provides a novel potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of CC.
27470551	Up-regulated microRNA-155 expression is associated with poor prognosis in cervical cancer patients.	BACKGROUND: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play important roles in tumor development and progression. The purposes of the study was to investigate the role of miR-155 in cervical cancer. METHODS: Quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed to examine miR-155 expression in cervical cancer tissues and adjacent non-cancerous tissues. The association with overall survival of patients was analyzed by Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) was used to suppress miR-155 expression in cervical cancer cells. In vitro assays were performed to further explore the biological functions of miR-155 in cervical cancer. RESULTS: We found that miR-155 expression was markedly up-regulated in cervical cancer tissues and correlated with FIGO stage, lymph nodes metastasis, vascular invasion and HPV. Patients with high miR-155 expression level had poorer overall survival than those with low miR-155 expression. Furthermore, multivariate Cox regression analysis suggested that increased miR-155 was an independent prognostic indicator for cervical cancer (P=0.007; HR=2.320; 95%CI: 1.259-4.276). Moreover, knockdown of miR-155 was demonstrated to inhibit cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in vitro. CONCLUSION: Our study presents that miR-155 is a novel molecule involved in cervical cancer progression, which provide a potential prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target.
27424321	Up-regulation of glutathione-related genes, enzyme activities and transport proteins in human cervical cancer cells treated with doxorubicin.	Doxorubicin (DOX), one of the most effective anticancer drugs, acts in a variety of ways including DNA damage, enzyme inhibition and generation of reactive oxygen species. Glutathione (GSH) and glutathione-related enzymes including: glutathione peroxidase (GPX), glutathione reductase (GSR) and glutathione S-transferases (GST) may play a role in adaptive detoxification processes in response to the oxidative stress, thus contributing to drug resistance phenotype. In this study, we investigated effects of DOX treatment on expression and activity of GSH-related enzymes and multidrug resistance-associated proteins in cultured human cervical cancer cells displaying different resistance against this drug (HeLa and KB-V1). Determination of expression level of genes encoding GST isoforms and MRP proteins (GCS, GPX, GSR, GSTA1-3, GSTM1, GSTP1, ABCC1-3, MGST1-3) was performed using StellARray Technology. Enzymatic activities of GPX and GSR were measured using biochemical methods. Expression of MRP1 was examined by immunofluorescence microscopy. This study showed that native expression levels of GSTM1 and GSTA3 were markedly higher in KB-V1 cells (2000-fold and 200-fold) compared to HeLa cells. Resistant cells have also shown significantly elevated expression of GSTA1 and GSTA2 genes (200-fold and 50-fold) as a result of DOX treatment. In HeLa cells, exposure to DOX increased expression of all genes: GSTM1 (7-fold) and GSTA1-3 (550-fold, 150-fold and 300-fold). Exposure to DOX led to the slight increase of GCS expression as well as GPX activity in KB-V1 cells, while in HeLa cells it did not. Expression of ABCC1 (MRP1) was not increased in any of the tested cell lines. Our results indicate that expression of GSTM1 and GSTA1-3 genes is up-regulated by DOX treatment and suggest that activity of these genes may be associated with drug resistance of the tested cells. At the same time, involvement of MRP1 in DOX resistance in the given experimental conditions is unlikely.
27770526	GENOTYPIC DISTRIBUTION OF HPV AMONG WOMEN OF REPRODUCTIVE AGE IN GEORGIA.	Of the 100 types of human papillomaviruses (HPV), approximately 35 infect the genital tract. The viruses are categorized as "high risk" and "low risk" depending on whether they are known to cause cancer or not. Cervical cancer is an important cause of cancer mortality in Georgia, and worldwide. Only limited and incomplete data are available about the epidemiology of HPV infection and related molecular and cellular changes in Georgia. Objectives of our study included the estimation of the prevalence and the distribution of HPV genotypes among women in Georgia. The study participants were women (~2000) aged 18-49 years randomly selected during a clinic appointment with a gynecologist for a regular check-up at one of the women's consultation centers (WCC) participating in the study. Venous blood (5 ml) was drawn and the prevalence of HPV evaluated by the detection of the HPV DNA. For genotyping, HPV DNA were extracted from the cervical samples, amplified first by consensus and then by primer-specific PCR, followed by a detection step on agarose gel. Of the total samples, 250 were positive for HPV DNA; these were further tested to identify the specific HPV genotype. The genotype distribution was as follows: type 6, 98 women (39.2 %); type 16, 64 (25.6%); type 18, 47 (18.8%); type 33, 23 (9.2%); type 11, 27 (10.8%); type 45, 19 (7.6%); and type 66, 9 (3.6%). In 37 women (14.8%), we found coexistence of several different HPV genotypes. The HPV genotypic profile among Georgian women is similar to data generated from studies conducted among the populations in other European countries. Presence of the subset of HPV genotypes not covered by quadrivalent anti-HPV vaccine (types 33, 45 and 66) was demonstrated among Georgian women.
27765168	Radiation to the Gastric Fundus Increases the Risk of Anastomotic Leakage After Esophagectomy.	BACKGROUND: Concerns have been raised regarding the toxicity of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT) for esophageal cancer that could contribute to an increased risk of postoperative complications. The aim of this study was to determine the influence of the radiation dose to the gastric fundus on the risk of postoperative anastomotic leakage in patients undergoing nCRT followed by transthoracic esophagectomy. METHODS: Between January 2012 and July 2015, 97 consecutive patients who underwent nCRT followed by transthoracic esophagectomy were included in this single-center cohort study. The gastric fundus was contoured on the pretreatment planning computed tomography. Within this contour, dose-volume histogram variables were calculated, and logistic regression analysis was used to determine their influence on the risk of anastomotic leakage. RESULTS: In 25 of 97 patients (26%) anastomotic leakage occurred. The mean radiation dose to the gastric fundus was significantly higher in patients with than without leakage (median 35.6 Gy versus 24.9 Gy, respectively, p = 0.047). A mean dose more than versus less than 31.4 Gy was associated with leakage rates of 43% versus 15%, respectively. Adjusted for tumor location, clinical T stage, and radiation method, the mean radiation dose to the gastric fundus remained significantly and independently associated with an increased risk of anastomotic leakage (adjusted odds ratio 1.05 per 1-Gy increase, 95% confidence interval: 1.002 to 1.10, p = 0.043). CONCLUSIONS: Efforts should be made to minimize the radiation dose to the gastric fundus when planning nCRT for esophageal cancer, because higher dose levels to the gastric fundus are associated with an increased risk of anastomotic leakage after subsequent transthoracic esophagectomy and cervical anastomosis.
27685757	HPV for cervical cancer screening (HPV FOCAL): Complete Round 1 results of a randomized trial comparing HPV-based primary screening to liquid-based cytology for cervical cancer.	Complete Round 1 data (baseline and 12-month follow-up) for HPV FOCAL, a randomized trial establishing the efficacy of HPV DNA testing with cytology triage as a primary screen for cervical cancer are presented. Women were randomized to one of three arms: Control arm - Baseline liquid-based cytology (LBC) with ASCUS results triaged with HPV testing; Intervention and Safety arms - Baseline HPV with LBC triage for HPV positives. Results are presented for 15,744 women allocated to the HPV (intervention and safety combined) and 9,408 to the control arms. For all age cohorts, the CIN3+ detection rate was higher in the HPV (7.5/1,000; 95%CI: 6.2, 8.9) compared to the control arm (4.6/1,000; 95%CI: 3.4, 6.2). The CIN2+ detection rates were also significantly higher in the HPV (16.5/1,000; 95%CI: 14.6, 18.6) vs. the control arm (10.1/1,000; 95%CI: 8.3, 12.4). In women >/=35 years, the overall detection rates for CIN2+ and CIN3+ were higher in the HPV vs. the control arm (CIN2+:10.0/1,000 vs. 5.2/1,000; CIN3+: 4.2/1,000 vs. 2.2/1,000 respectively, with a statistically significant difference for CIN2+). HPV testing detected significantly more CIN2+ in women 25-29 compared to LBC (63.7/1,000; 95%CI: 51.9, 78.0 vs. 32.4/1,000; 95%CI: 22.3, 46.8). HPV testing resulted in significantly higher colposcopy referral rates for all age cohorts (HPV: 58.9/1,000; 95%CI: 55.4, 62.7 vs. CONTROL: 30.9/1,000; 95%CI: 27.6, 34.6). At completion of Round 1 HPV-based cervical cancer screening in a population-based program resulted in greater CIN2+ detection of across all age cohorts compared to LBC screening.
27615005	Research on radiotherapy at different times of the day for inoperable cervical cancer.	PURPOSE: To investigate the radiation effects and acute damage in inoperable cervical cancer patients irradiated at different times as well as the underlying mechanisms. METHODS: 67 patients were randomized to a morning group (MG, 9:00 - 11:00 AM) and an evening group (EG, 9:00 - 11:00 PM) and both received external beam radiotherapy (RT) (50 Gy in 25 fractions) at different times. Brachytherapy (36 - 42 Gy in 6 - 7 fractions) was also performed to enhance the radiation response twice every week in all patients at the same time. Clinical therapeutic effects and acute toxicities were evaluated after RT. Flow cytometry was analyzed before and after RT. RESULTS: Patients' response to radiation was similar in the two groups. Incidences of overall and high-grade (III - IV) diarrhea in the MG vs. the EG were 75.0% vs. 57.6% and 12.5% vs. 6.1%, respectively. The incidence of severe hematological toxicity in the EG was significantly increased compared to the MG group. Cell apoptosis in the EG was significantly higher at 9:00 - 11:00 PM than that at 9:00 - 11:00 AM after RT. No significant differences were found in Gap Phase 0/Gap Phase 1 (G0/G1), Gap Phase 2/Metaphase Phase (G2/M), and Synthesis Phase (S) phase between different times and groups, nor were expressions of Per1, Per2, and Clock. But expressions of Per1, Per2, and Clock were significantly negative with G2/M phase and positively correlated with cell apoptosis. CONCLUSION: RT at different time intervals results in similar efficacy. However, RT in the morning reduces severe hematological toxicity. Radiation responses may be associated with circadian genes by influence of cell cycles and apoptosis..
27764719	Leptomeningeal metastasis from gynecologic cancers diagnosed by brain MRI.	Leptomeningeal metastasis (LM) is rarely observed in gynecologic cancers. As gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (Gd-MRI) is highly effective for diagnosing LM, the aim of this study is to describe the clinical behaviors and outcomes of LM patients who were diagnosed by Gd-MRI. After securing institutional review board approvals, we retrospectively reviewed patient records. Eight patients were found to have LM from gynecological malignancies. Primary tumors included three ovarian cancers, one tubal cancer, one peritoneal cancer, two endometrial cancers, and one cervical cancer. Gd-MRI of the brain and the spine is indicated as the high-priority inspection for the diagnosis of this devastating complication.
27762471	Impact of human papilloma virus vaccination on adolescent knowledge, perception of sexual risk and need for safer sexual behaviors in Bali, Indonesia.	AIM: To determine the impact of human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccination on knowledge, perception of sexual risk and need for continued safe sexual behavior among Indonesian girls. METHODS: A comparative cross-sectional study was carried on in Denpasar, the capital city of Bali, Indonesia, during September 2015-February 2016. A total of 828 adolescent girls (12-16 years) were recruited to assess their knowledge on HPV/HPV vaccine, perception of sexual risks and need for continued safe sexual behavior. RESULTS: A total of 419 girls (50.7%) had received HPV vaccination prior to the study, 76.4% of whom (320/419) had sufficient knowledge about HPV. HPV vaccination was a strong and independent predictor of higher HPV/HPV vaccine knowledge (adjusted OR [AOR], 9.358; 95%CI: 6.816-12.849, P < 0.001). HPV vaccination (AOR, 0.107; 95%CI: 0.074-0.155, P < 0.001) and higher knowledge level (AOR, 0.667; 95%CI: 0.464-0.958, P = 0.028) were associated with lower perceived HPV risk. Despite the low risk perception, most of the vaccinated girls (408/419, 97.4%) continued to perceive higher need for safe sexual behaviors. On multivariate analysis, higher knowledge was the independent predictor for higher perceived need for safe sexual behaviors (AOR, 4.260; 95%CI: 2.016-9.001, P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The HPV vaccination was associated with higher knowledge and appropriately lower perception of HPV risk. Despite the vaccination, most of the adolescents continued to perceive a need for safer sexual behavior. All adolescent girls should receive HPV vaccination in order to reduce cervical cancer burden in the future.
27762468	Thrombelastography coagulation index may be a predictor of venous thromboembolism in gynecological oncology patients.	AIM: Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a well-recognized complication in gynecological oncology patients, and has an impact on the overall outcome. The purpose of this study was to identify whether thrombelastography (TEG) predicts VTE in gynecological oncology patients. METHODS: This retrospective study included patients with gynecological oncology who were hospitalized at the Fujian Provincial Cancer Hospital from May 2014 to April 2016. Univariate and logistic regression multivariate analyses were performed to determine the clinical and laboratorial factors for VTE in gynecological oncology patients. The sensitivity and specificity of predictors was calculated using receiver operating characteristic curve. RESULTS: The study included 376 patients; 39 (10.37%) developed VTE. Logistic regression multivariate analysis revealed that TEG coagulation index (CI) value, D-dimer, arrhythmia, coronary heart disease, surgery within four weeks and chemotherapy within four weeks were independent risk factors for VTE. The area under the curve values were 0.71 (95% confidence interval 0.63-0.79, P = 0.000) for TEG CI and 0.67 (95% confidence interval 0.58-0.76, P = 0.000) for D-Dimer. The TEG CI cut-off value was 2.55, which had 53.8% sensitivity and 75.4% specificity for VTE. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicated that the TEG CI value may be predictive of VTE in gynecological oncology patients.
27761872	Correlation between indoleamine 2,3 dioxygenase mRNA and CDKN2A/p16 mRNA: a combined strategy to cervical cancer diagnosis.	Cervical cancer (CC) is one of the most common cancers among women worldwide. The relation of the human papillomavirus (HPV) with CC and its precursor lesions was first suspected for over 40 years. The indoleamine 2,3 dioxygenase (IDO) is an immune modulator enzyme responsible for the immune system tissue protection mechanism, which may be the key to the tumoural persistence. HPV oncoprotein E7 promotes the increase in cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p16 (CDKN2A/p16). The isolated and combined analysis of CDKN2A/p16 mRNA to CC diagnosis was done with promising results. The aim of this study is to evaluate the correlation between IDO mRNA and CDKN2A/p16 mRNA. We will explore the potential of both as diagnostic tools. RNA was extracted from tissue samples. cDNA was generated with High Capacity RNA-to-cDNA kit. The real-time PCR results were analysed using nonlinear curve estimation, ROC curve, Chi-squared test, the proportion of variance explained and Galen and Gambino formulas. From 270 patients attended, colposcopy examination was performed in 110 and the biopsy in 75 patients. We found a positive correlation in patients older than 28 years old with low-risk lesions, but the correlation is lost in high-risk lesions. Although cytology, IDO mRNA and CDKN2A/p16 mRNA could not differentiate the risk groups, IDO combined with CDKN2A/p16 mRNA results could (p = 0.028). The best diagnostic result was achieved by IDO coupled with CDKN2A/p16 mRNA, which may considerably increase the sensitivity of screening for CC.
27756320	A case of peritoneal metastasis during treatment for hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma.	BACKGROUND: Advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinomas frequently develop distant metastases to limited organs, including the lungs, bone, mediastinal lymph nodes, brain, and liver. Peritoneal carcinomatosis as an initial distant metastasis from hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma is quite rare. CASE PRESENTATION: A 75-year-old man diagnosed with hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma and his clinical stage was determined as T2N2cM0. Notably, the right retropharyngeal lymph node surrounded more than half of the right internal carotid artery. Concomitant conformal radiation therapy was administered for the primary hypopharyngeal lesion, and the whole neck and tumor response was evaluated at this point according to our algorithm-based chemoradioselection protocol. As the tumor responses at both the primary and lymph nodes were poor, with the right retropharyngeal lymph node in particular demonstrating mild enlargement, we performed a radical surgery: pharyngolaryngectomy, bilateral neck dissection, and reconstruction of the cervical esophagus with a free jejunal flap. Then, postoperative CRT was performed. During these therapies, the patient developed a fever and mild abdominal pain, which was associated with an increased C-reactive protein level. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography from the neck to the pelvis demonstrated mild peritoneal hypertrophy and ascites with no evidence of recurrent and/or metastatic tumor formation. We initially diagnosed acute abdomen symptoms as postoperative ileus. However, cytological examination of the refractory ascites resulted in a diagnosis of peritoneal carcinomatosis. Owing to rapid disease progress, the patient died 1.5 months after abdominal symptom onset. CONCLUSIONS: The present case is the second reported case of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma with peritoneal carcinomatosis as an incipient distant metastasis. Therefore, peritoneal carcinomatosis should be considered a differential diagnosis when acute abdomen is noted during treatment for head and neck cancers.
27591407	Human papillomavirus test with cytology triage in organized screening for cervical cancer.	INTRODUCTION: In randomized studies, testing for high-risk (HR) human papillomavirus (hrHPV) has been more sensitive than conventional cytology in detecting cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). The aim of this study was to evaluate the performance of HPV testing in the setting of an organized routine screening program. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Since 2012, 35- to 60-year-old women living in the city of Tampere have been screened with the Abbott RealTime hrHPV test. HPV-negative women are referred to the next screening round in five years. HPV-positive women are triaged with conventional cytology, and women with at least low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL+ ) are referred to colposcopy. The remaining HPV-positive women are referred for re-testing after 12 months, and then all HPV-positive women are referred to colposcopy. The data from the last cohort with cytological screening (screened in 2011) is presented for comparison. RESULTS: A total 5637 (70%) women attended the first round of HPV screening, and 369 were HPV-positive. Of them, 54 women LSIL+ were referred to colposcopy, resulting in 16 CIN2+ lesions found. Of the remaining HPV-positive women, 66% were still positive one year later, and were referred to colposcopy, with 18 additional CIN2+ lesions found. The attendance rate to the last round of cytological screening was 71% (5814 women). Sixty-four women with LSIL+ cytology were referred to colposcopy, and 11 CIN2+ lesions were found. Of the 777 women with borderline cytology and scheduled for reflex screening in the following year, 109 (19%) had ASC-US+ , and 57 underwent colposcopy, resulting in six additional CIN2+ lesions found. The total detection rate of CIN2+ was significantly higher in the HPV-screened cohort (6.0/1000 vs. 2.9/1000, p = 0.015). However, the total colposcopy rate was 4% vs. 2%, respectively (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Human papillomavirus testing also seems to be more sensitive than cytology in detecting CIN2+ lesions in the setting of a routine organized screening program, besides in the context of randomized trials. The problem of an increased colposcopy rate needs to be addressed in the future.
27564523	Colposcopy and additive diagnostic value of biopsies from colposcopy-negative areas to detect cervical dysplasia.	INTRODUCTION: We evaluated colposcopy in the routine diagnostic workup of women with abnormal cervical cytology, as well as the diagnostic value of endocervical curettage material and biopsies taken from colposcopy-positive and colposcopy-negative quadrants of the cervix. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 297 nonpregnant women with abnormal cervical cytology and no prior treatment for cervical dysplasia or cancer. All women underwent gynecological examination, colposcopy, endocervical curettage, and had cervical biopsies taken. Colposcopy was considered satisfactory if the squamocolumnar junction was fully visible, and biopsies were taken from all four quadrants of the cervix, regardless of colposcopy results. RESULTS: In all, 130 of the women in our study had satisfactory colposcopy results and were diagnosed with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or worse (CIN2+), 61% via a colposcopy-positive biopsy and 39% via a colposcopy-negative biopsy. Eighty-seven of them had positive colposcopy results, but CIN2+ was histologically verified from colposcopy-positive biopsies in 91% (n = 79) and from colposcopy-negative biopsies in 9% (n = 8). The remaining 43 women with CIN2+ had negative colposcopy findings, so their diagnosis was verified in colposcopy-negative biopsies. The sensitivity of colposcopy alone to detect CIN2+ was 61% (95% CI 52-69). CONCLUSIONS: In the present study, colposcopy was not a stand-alone diagnostic method. Colposcopy-negative biopsies had a clear additive value, identifying a substantial proportion of women with both positive and negative colposcopy results with treatment-worthy cervical dysplasia. Endocervical curettage material had little diagnostic value in this study.
27519498	Laparoscopic nerve-sparing radical hysterectomy for bulky cervical cancer (>/=6 cm) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy: A multicenter prospective cohort study.	OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to evaluate the clinical outcomes of laparoscopic nerve-sparing radical hysterectomy (LNRH) for bulky-stage cervical cancer (lesion >/= 6 cm) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). METHODS: This study prospective recruited patients with pathology-confirmed cervical cancer presenting as a bulky mass (lesion >/= 6 cm). Subjects included patients who underwent laparoscopic radical surgery. They were assigned to one of two groups by surgical method: patients who underwent LNRH after NAC and patients who underwent classical laparoscopic radical hysterectomy (LRH) after NAC. We compared the patients' general clinical characteristics, surgical profiles, pathological findings and adjuvant therapies between the two groups. Recovery of bladder and intestinal function was evaluated by questionnaire. Patients were followed for up to 1 year to determine the maintenance of effect. RESULTS: Compared with patients treated with LRH, patients who underwent LNRH presented no significant differences in age, surgery characteristics, pathological findings, adjuvant therapies or main adverse effects. The mean duration of residual urine <50 mL in the LNRH group was 11 days, much shorter than that in the LRH group (18 days; P < 0.001). The period of passage of gas by anus was shorter (38.9 +/- 4.1 h) in LNRH patients than that in LRH patients (56.5 +/- 4.0 h; P < 0.001). The urinary and intestinal symptoms were evaluated 1 year after surgery. The recovery of urinary and intestinal function of patients was better in the LNRH group than in the LRH group. CONCLUSION: LNRH is a safe and feasible surgical management for bulky-stage cervical cancer patients (lesion >/= 6 cm), and after NAC, the urinary and intestinal function of patients in LNRH group showed better recovery compared with functions in the LRH group. The technique is relatively new, and its oncologic efficiency has not yet been fully established. Prospective randomised controlled studies with an increased number of patients and long-term postoperative follow-up should be carried out to investigate the effect of this therapeutic strategy for bulky-stage cervical cancer.
27513888	Follow up with HPV test and cytology as test of cure, 6 months after conization, is reliable.	INTRODUCTION: Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is an objective marker with a high sensitivity for finding cervical dysplasia. The objective of the current study is to investigate whether HPV testing, combined with liquid-based cytology, is reliable as a test of cure after the loop electrical excision procedure (LEEP). MATERIAL AND METHODS: The LEEP was performed in 330 women for excision of cervical dysplasia. Follow up consisted of HPV testing and liquid-based cytology at six, 12, and 36 months after treatment. Patients with negative co-testing after 6 months were re-examined after 3 years. Patients who tested positive for high-risk HPV and/or dysplasia were followed up 12 months postoperatively. RESULTS: At 6 months, the co-testing was double negative in 169 of 260 tested cases (65%). A positive high-risk HPV test (n = 40) was associated with cytological abnormalities (p < 0.001). After 3 years, 227 of 275 examined cases (83%) co-tested negative, including 154 patients who had already tested negative at 6 months and 37 cases with viral clearance at 12 months. Of 26 patients with high-risk HPV at the 3-year follow up, six had LSIL findings on liquid-based cytology, but neither HSIL lesions nor glandular atypia or cervical cancer was found. A negative high-risk HPV test showed a negative predictive value for HSIL of 100% (95% CI 99.8-100%). CONCLUSIONS: Negative co-testing 6 months after LEEP can be considered a reliable test of cure as 3-year follow-up results are consistent with neither HSIL or cancer.
27754446	Synthesis and In Vitro Cytotoxic Properties of Polycarbo-Substituted 4-(Arylamino)quinazolines.	Herein, we describe the synthesis of novel unsymmetrical polycarbo-substituted 4-anilinoquinazolines derived from the 2-aryl-6-bromo-8-iodoquinazolines via one-pot three-step reaction sequences involving initial amination and subsequent double cross-coupling (bis-Suzuki, Sonogashira/Stille or Sonogashira/Suzuki-Miyaura) reactions with different cross coupling partners for the two carbon-carbon bond formation steps. The 4-anilinoquinazolines were evaluated for potential cytotoxicity against three cancer cell lines, namely, human breast adenocarcinoma (MCF-7) cells, human cervical cancer (HeLa) and human lung cancer (A549) cells. The most active compounds, 2b, 2c, 3c, 4a, 4c and 5a, were found to be more selective against the MCF-7 and HeLa cell lines than the human lung carcinoma (A549) cells. We selected compounds 2c, 3c and 7a as representatives for further evaluation for potential to induce apoptosis and/or necrotic properties in the three cancer cell lines. Compound 2c induced apoptosis of MCF-7 cells through cell membrane alteration. Treatment of Hela and A549 cell lines with compounds 3c and 7a, respectively, led to caspase-3 activation in both cell lines. Compound 3c, on the other hand, caused more necrosis than apoptosis induction in the membrane alteration assay.
27754347	Nujiangexathone A, a Novel Compound Derived from Garcinia nujiangensis, Induces Caspase-Dependent Apoptosis in Cervical Cancer through the ROS/JNK Pathway.	Nujiangexathone A (NJXA), a novel compound derived from Garcinia nujiangensis, has been demonstrated to inhibit the proliferation of several human cancer cell lines. This study is the first to demonstrate the apoptosis inductive activities of NJXA and the possible underlying mechanisms. Our results demonstrated that NJXA inhibited colony formation by HeLa and SiHa cells in a dose-dependent manner. An Annexin V-FITC/PI staining assay showed that NJXA strongly triggered apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. Western blotting analyses showed that NJXA induced the caspase-dependent apoptosis of HeLa and SiHa cells by triggering a series of events, including changes in the levels of Bcl-2 family proteins, cytochrome c release, caspase-3 activation, and chromosome fragmentation. Furthermore, we demonstrated that NJXA induced cell apoptosis by activating the reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated JNK signaling pathway. Consistent with this finding, a ROS scavenger, N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC, 10 mM), hindered NJXA-induced apoptosis and attenuated the sensitivity of HeLa and SiHa cells to NJXA. In vivo results further confirmed that the tumor inhibitory effect of NJXA was partially through the induction of apoptosis. Taken together, our results demonstrated that NJXA induced the apoptosis of HeLa and SiHa cells through the ROS/JNK signaling pathway, indicating that NJXA could be important candidate for the clinical treatment of cervical cancer.
27544453	T0070907 inhibits repair of radiation-induced DNA damage by targeting RAD51.	T0070907 (T007), a PPARgamma inhibitor, can reduce alpha and beta tubulin proteins in some cancer cell lines. Thus, T007 has been suggested as an antimicrotubule drug. We previously reported that T007 increased radiosensitivity by inducing mitotic catastrophe in cervical cancer cells. In this study, we investigated the underlying mechanisms of the T007-mediated increase in radiosensitivity. T007 pre-treatment attenuated RAD51 protein levels and ionising radiation (IR)-induced nuclear foci formation, resulting in more frequent centrosome amplification and multipolar mitotic spindle formation in cervical cancer cells. Furthermore, T007 pre-treatment delayed the clearance of IR-induced gamma-H2AX and increased radiosensitivity in cervical cancer cells. In contrast, none of these changes were observed in normal cells. Our data demonstrate for the first time that T007 impairs the repair of IR-induced DNA double-strand breaks by inhibiting RAD51, a key protein in homologous recombination repair, increases IR-induced mitotic catastrophe, and leads to increased death of IR-treated cells. These findings support T007 as a potential RAD51 inhibitor to increase tumour response to radiation therapy.
27750179	Indocyanine green and infrared fluorescence in detection of sentinel lymph nodes in endometrial and cervical cancer staging - a systematic review.	OBJECTIVE: Sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping for endometrial (EC) and cervical cancers (CC) is a current technique that could provide benefits over traditional lymphadenectomy. Near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence imaging is a promising technique to perform this procedure. We conducted a systematic review of the evidence regarding the technique and the effectiveness of indocyanine green (ICG) during SLN biopsy, using robotic and laparoscopic assisted surgery and laparotomy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a computer literature search for published English language studies in humans using PubMed since January 2010 up to May 2015. The initial search came up with 17 articles, of which 10 articles used ICG as tracer in SLN biopsy in EC and CC. RESULTS: 422 patients were included in 10 studies, ranging from 1 to 227 patients. The main surgical approach used in ICG SLN biopsy was robotic-assisted surgery in 368 patients. Laparotomy was performed in 39 patients and laparoscopy in 15. The detection rate in SLN mapping using ICG ranged from 78% to 100% for cervical injection and from 33% to 100% for hysteroscopic injection. Sensitivity and negative predictive value (NPV) vary from 50% to 100% and 88% to 100%, respectively. The most common site of injection was the cervix (two quadrants); this technique is correlated with a high detection rate (ranging from 78% to 95%). The cervical submucosal and stromal injections were the most frequent sites used. No complications related to ICG administration were described. CONCLUSIONS: NIR fluorescence imaging using ICG is performed in robotic-assisted surgery in laparoscopy and in laparotomy, being a feasible, safe, time-efficient and seemingly reliable method for lymphatic mapping in early stage of CC and EC. Although it has promising results in SLN mapping, randomized studies, with larger patient samples, are needed.
27749536	Can preoperative computed tomography predict tissue origin of primary maxillary cancer?	Based on the histopathologic origin, malignant maxillary neoplasms may share some clinical characteristics but have different biological behavior, treatments, and prognoses. The aim of the present study was to explore the association between CT characteristics and tissue origin of primary maxillary cancer (MC). A retrospective review of CT findings was performed in patients diagnosed with MC between January 1, 2005 and December 31, 2013. Univariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to determine the association between tissue of origin and CT characteristics, with adjustment for possible confounding factors. A total of 164 patients (70 male, 94 female, age: 46.8 +/- 18.3 years) were included. Patients were divided into epithelial (n = 88) and nonepithelial (n = 76), or odontogenic (n = 15) and nonodontogenic (n = 149) groups. After adjusting for age, sex, smoking status, alcohol use, tumor size, and stage in the multivariable logistic regression model, the lesions with cortical bowing were found more likely to be epithelial (odds ratio [OR] = 7.0, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.4-36.1) than nonepithelial origin, while lesions with cervical lymphadenopathy were more associated with a nonodontogenic origin (OR = 12.6, 95% CI, 1.1-140.0) rather than odontogenic. Among epithelial cancers, lesions with cortical bowing were 14 times more likely to be salivary gland-type (OR = 13.8, 95% CI, 1.3-141.5). CT characteristics of cortical bowing and cervical lymphadenopathy might be suggestive of tissue origin in MC. Larger prospective studies are warranted to further examine the association.
27749507	Are Women Who Exit Colposcopy Without Treatment at Elevated Risk for Cervical Cancer?	OBJECTIVE: This study aims to estimate the risk of cervical cancer and impact of treatment and other factors in women referred for high-grade (HG) and low-grade (LG) cytologic changes and discharged from colposcopy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective cohort study identified 14,787 and 41,916 women with a first-time HG and LG cytologic abnormality between 2007 and 2010 and underwent colposcopy within 1 year. Treatment status was determined within the episode of care. Incidence of cervical cancer postcolposcopy was determined up to March 2015. Logistic regression assessed impact of colposcopic care and patient factors on cancer risk. RESULTS: A total of 62% HG and 28.5% LG had treatment. A total of 28% and 37% with HG and LG abnormalities had only 1 colposcopic evaluation. Subsequent cancer incidence in the untreated HG group was 1.1% versus 0.3% in the treated group. For the LG group, cancer rates were 0.08% in both treatment groups. In the HG group, those with initial colposcopy only and no treatment had an elevated risk [adjusted odds ratio = 6.6 (95% CI = 3.9-11)] compared with treatment with multiple follow-ups. Other significant factors were advancing age and no screening postcolposcopy. For the LG group, those with initial colposcopy only were more at risk regardless of treatment [adjusted odds ratio = 3.8 (95% CI = 1.8-8.1)] compared with multiple colposcopies. CONCLUSIONS: Women who are untreated, with index HG cytology, remain at elevated risk for cervical cancer when the colposcopic episode is limited to 1 examination. Centralized programs are required to ensure that such women are not discharged prematurely or lost to follow up from colposcopy and subsequent screening.
27748903	Let7a suppresses cell proliferation via the TGFbeta/SMAD signaling pathway in cervical cancer.	Cervical cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed type of cancer among women after breast cancer. Recent research has addressed the role of microRNAs in cervical cancer. In the present study, we aimed to determine the effect of let7a on the regulation of the cell proliferation of cervical cancer and the related signaling pathway. Realtime RTPCR was used to detect the expression of let7a in the blood of cervical cancer patients and normal controls. The expression of let7a was also assessed in cervical cancer cell lines: HeLa, SiHa and normal human immortalized keratinocyes HaCaT. Cell proliferation was tested by MTT assay, and cell apoptosis and cell cycle were examined by flow cytometric analysis in HeLa cells. Moreover, bioinformatic analysis, dualluciferase reporter assay and western blotting were used to confirm the target gene for let7a. In addition, the expression of TGFbeta1, SMAD4 and p53 were assessed by western blotting and realtime PCR. Our studies showed that the expression of let7a in cervical cancer was significantly reduced in cervical cancer patients compared with the expression in the normal control group. Cell proliferation of HeLa cells was inhibited by overexpression of let7a. The cell cycle analysis showed that an increased population was arrested in the G2 phase in the let7a mimic group when compared with that in the mimic control and untreated groups. In addition, the cell cyclerelated factor p53 was increased in the let7a overexpression group compared with that in the control and untreated groups. Furthermore, TGFBR1 was confirmed to be a target of let7a. Moreover, the expression of TGFbeta1 and SMAD4 proteins was elevated in cervical squamous carcinoma and cervical adenocarcinoma tissues. However, the expression of TGFbeta1 and SMAD4 was decreased in the let7aoverexpressing cervical cancer cell lines (HeLa, SiHa and CaSki). Our data suggest that let7a may play a role in the cell proliferation of cervical cancer by regulating the TGFbeta/SMAD pathway, and may participate in the regulation of the occurrence and development of cervical cancer.
27748558	Multispectral autofluorescence imaging for detection of cervical lesions: A preclinical study.	AIM: The aim of this study was to develop a novel optical imaging system for detecting protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) autofluorescence, to prove that PpIX autofluorescence is as useful as 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA)-induced fluorescence for detecting and localizing cervical cancer, and to monitor the change in PpIX autofluorescence or induced PpIX fluorescence before, during, and after photodynamic therapy (PDT). METHODS: TC-1 cells - highly tumorigenic cells immortalized using human papillomavirus type 16 proteins E6 and E7 - were subcutaneously grafted into the thighs of nude mice. The suspected tumor tissues were visualized using autofluorescence imaging and induced fluorescence imaging under 5-ALA administration. When the 5-ALA-induced PpIX was sufficiently accumulated in tumor tissues, PDT was performed using a 635-nm laser. We observed the change in fluorescence intensity during PDT. For 3 weeks after PDT, we monitored tumor remission by using white-light imaging and fluorescence imaging. RESULTS: The transplanted cells were visualized by PpIX autofluorescence, which was induced by heme synthesis. After 5-ALA administration, PpIX could be targeted by using PDT, which decreased PpIX autofluorescence. Photobleaching is useful for monitoring PDT dosimetry and for determining the photodynamic response to therapy. CONCLUSION: PpIX autofluorescence clearly differentiated the tumor from adjacent normal tissues. The results of PpIX autofluorescence imaging and 5-ALA-induced fluorescence imaging were identical. PpIX autofluorescence imaging is a simple and cost-effective cervical cancer screening method that could be performed during or after PDT to ensure effective treatment or remission as a change in fluorescence intensity can be observed in real time without a blinding effect.
27746423	Beneficial Effects of Human Papillomavirus Vaccine for Prevention of Cervical Abnormalities in Miyagi, Japan.	Prevention of cervical cancer has been unsuccessful in Japan because of low rates of cancer screening and vaccination. The Vaccine Adverse Review Committee of the Japanese Government investigated 2,475 adverse events and reported 617 (6.9/100,000) severe cases and 176 (2.0/100,000) cases with chronic pain. The proactive recommendation for human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination has been suspended since June 2013. In this study, we examined vaccination rate and incidence of abnormal cervical cytology in women aged 20 to 24 years attending cancer screening in Miyagi. Among the 3,272 women who underwent a health check in the fiscal year 2014 (April 2014-March 2015), 332 (10.2%) received a HPV vaccination. The HPV vaccination rates were 42.3%, 10%, 17.5%, 3.8% and 4.0% in women aged 20, 21, 22, 23 and 24 years, respectively. The rates of atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US) or worse were 2.41% (8/332) in women with HPV vaccination and 5.03% (148/2,940) in those without HPV vaccination, indicating a significant decrease in vaccinated women (p = 0.03). ASC-US cases were referred to HPV DNA tests. In addition, the rates of high grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) or worse were 0.30% (1/332) in women with HPV vaccination and 0.82% (24/2,940) in those without HPV vaccination, showing the marginal decrease in women who were vaccinated (p = 0.3). Thus, this study indicates that HPV vaccination is associated with a reduction in the incidence of cervical abnormalities, suggesting a need for scientific discussion of reinstatement of proactive recommendation for HPV vaccine in Japan.
25268149	Epirubicin loading in poly(butyl cyanoacrylate) nanoparticles manifests via altered intracellular localization and cellular response in cervical carcinoma (HeLa) cells.	OBJECTIVE: Drug loading into nanocarriers is used to facilitate drug delivery to target cells and organs. We have previously reported a change in cellular localization of epirubicin after loading to poly(butyl cyanoacrylate) (PBCA) nanoparticles. We aimed to further investigate the altered cellular localization and cellular responses to the described drug formulation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: HeLa cells were treated with epirubicin-loaded PBCA nanoparticles prepared by the pre-polymerization method. A systematic study was performed to evaluate the formulation cytotoxicity. Cellular localization and uptake of the formulation as well as cellular response to the treatment were evaluated. RESULTS: Our studies revealed decreased cytotoxicity of the nanoparticle-formulated epirubicin compared to the free drug as well as a noticeable change in the drug's intracellular localization. Epirubicin-loaded nanoparticles were internalized via endocytosis, accumulated inside endosomal vesicles and induced a two-fold stronger pro-apoptotic signal when compared to the free drug. The level of the tumor suppressor protein p53 in HeLa cells increased significantly upon treatment with free epirubicin, but remained relatively unchanged when cells were treated with equivalent dose of nanoparticle-loaded drug, suggesting a possible shift from p53-dependent DNA/RNA intercalation-based induction of cytotoxicity by free epirubicin to a caspase 3-induced cell death by the epirubicin-loaded PBCA formulation.
27744185	Design and synthesis of imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole linked triazole conjugates: Microtubule-destabilizing agents.	A series of imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole linked triazole conjugates were synthesized by using Huisgen 1,3-dipolar cyclo-addition reaction (click chemistry approach) and evaluated for their antiproliferative activity against some human cancer cell lines like, HeLa (cervical), DU-145 (prostate), A549 (lung), MCF-7 (breast) and HepG2 (liver). Among them, Conjugates 4g and 4h demonstrated a significant antiproliferative effect against human lung cancer cells (A549) with IC50 values of 0.92 and 0.78 muM respectively. Flow cytometric analysis revealed that these conjugates induced cell cycle arrest in G2/M phase in A549 lung cancer cells. The tubulin polymerization assay and immunofluorescence analysis showed that these conjugates effectively inhibit microtubule assembly in cell free and cell based (A549) experiment respectively. Moreover, the apoptosis inducing properties were evaluated by Hoechst staining, mitochondrial membrane potential and Annexin V-FITC assay. Further, western blot analysis was performed for proapoptotic protein Bax and antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 and the results demonstrated that there was up regulation of Bax and down regulation of Bcl-2 suggesting that these compounds induced apoptosis in human lung cancer cells, A549.
27743413	miR-25-3p reverses epithelial-mesenchymal transition via targeting Sema4C in cisplatin-resistance cervical cancer cells.	Acquisition of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) has recently been proposed as an important contributor of drug resistance in cervical cancer cells. However, the underlying mechanisms are still unclear. MicroRNAs play a crucial role in regulating EMT. The aim of this study was to explore the potential role of miR-25-3p in regulating EMT in cisplatin-resistant (CR) cervical cancer cells. To this end, we established stable CR cervical cancer cells, HeLa-CR and CaSki-CR, and investigated the function of miR-25-3p in regulating EMT. It is found that CR cervical cancer cells possessed more EMT characteristics and demonstrated higher migratory abilities and invasiveness. miR-25-3p downregulation was also seen in HeLa-CR and CaSki-CR cells. Of note, ectopic expression of miR-25-3p reversed the EMT phenotype and sensitized CR cells to cisplatin via targeting Sema4C. Furthermore, stable overexpression of miR-25-3p in HeLa-CR cells suppressed tumor growth in mice, downregulated Sema4C and Snail, and upregulated E-cadherin compared with the control group. These results suggest that miR-25-3p is an important regulator of cervical cancer EMT and chemoresistance. Thus, upregulation of miR-25-3p could be a novel approach to treat cervical cancers that are resistant to chemotherapy.
27741039	Improvement of Gynecological Screening of Female Renal Transplant Recipients by Self-Sampling for Human Papillomavirus Detection.	OBJECTIVES: Female renal transplant recipients (RTRs) have increased risk for developing human papillomavirus (HPV)-related (pre)malignancies of the lower genital tract. Annual cervical screening is advised for RTRs, but the participation rate is low. The aim of this study is to investigate whether HPV self-sampling is suitable for gynecological screening of RTRs to increase participation rate. METHODS: A large cohort of 253 RTRs was investigated for the prevalence of HPV. All participants received a device for a cervicovaginal self-sample. Questionnaires were sent to assess the experience with this device. High-risk (hrHPV) presence was determined with the SPF10-LiPA25 system and GP5+/6+ PCR. HrHPV-positive patients underwent gynecological examination. RESULTS: More than 90% of the patients rated their experience with the self-sample device as good to excellent, and 77% preferred self-sampling over a physician taken sample. Approximately thirty-five of 217 women tested hrHPV positive with SPF10- LiPA25, and 22 tested positive with the GP5+/6+ PCR. Eleven hrHPV-positive patients had clinically relevant gynecological abnormalities, and they all tested positive with GP5+/6+ PCR. CONCLUSIONS: Self-sampling is clinically applicable in a gynecological screening and is preferred by female RTRs. Therefore, self-sampling could be implemented with the aim to increase the participation rate of female RTRs in yearly gynecological screening.
27740962	Endometrial Endometrioid Carcinoma With Large Cystic Growth Configuration and Deceptive Pattern of Invasion Associated With Abundant Nodular Fasciitis-like Stroma: A Unique Hitherto Unreported Histology in Endometrioid Carcinoma.	We describe a case of an unusual endometrial endometrioid carcinoma occurring in a 67-year-old woman. The tumor involved uterine corpus as well as lower uterine segment and presented as polypoid tumor protruding through the cervical orifice. Microscopically, the tumor was characterized by broad zones of cytologically bland fibromyxoid stroma resembling nodular fasciitis, showing vaguely nodular architecture. Neoplastic glands were characterized by interconnected elongated slit-like and large cystic profiles, mostly lined by flattened epithelium with variable squamous differentiation, whereas typical columnar endometrioid cells were only focally present. Voluminous nodules of the stroma produced phyllodes-like appearance of the tumor. The tumor showed some resemblance to the microcystic, elongated, and fragmented (MELF) glands growth pattern, but in contrast with MELF pattern, where fibromyxoid change occurs focally, in the presented case abundant myofibroblastic proliferation was present throughout the tumor and the neoplastic glands showed anastomosing "large cystic" rather than "small cystic" profiles. Some of the neoplastic glands presented almost complete or complete squamous differentiation, with relatively bland-looking squamous cells and no hint of endometrioid differentiation, which resulted in initial misdiagnosis of Mullerian adenofibroma. We believe that nodular fasciitis-like pattern represents yet undescribed, and diagnostically challenging pattern of invasion in endometrial endometrioid carcinoma.
27740393	Intradural chondroma in the cervical spine: case report.	Chondromas are benign tumors that are rarely located in the spine. The authors present a rare occurrence of a spinal chondroma that developed as an intradural but extramedullary tumor in a 60-year-old woman. The location of the tumor at C4-5 was confirmed by MRI, with hyperintensity on T2-weighted images and isointensity on T1-weighted images. The tumor was completely contained intradurally, with no continuity to any vertebrae. It adhered to the anterior dura, indicative of its likely origin from the dura mater. The tumor was completely resected, with no sign of recurrence after 3 years postoperatively. Although reports of chondromas originating from the dura mater have been previously described, these have all been intracranial tumors. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first report of an intradural chondroma located in the spine. Therefore, chondromas should be considered in the differential diagnosis of intradural spinal tumors.
27739250	Clinical application of a rapid cervical cancer screening method: Folate receptor-mediated staining of cervical neoplastic epithelia.	AIM: A newly developed cervical cancer screening method - folate receptor-mediated epithelium staining utilizes methylene blue internalized by folate receptor-mediated endocytosis to stain cervical intra-epithelial neoplasia. We test the clinical feasibility of this method in this study. METHODS: A total of 14 344 women who were at least 21 years old and had been sexually active, participated in the study. In gynecological clinics, participants underwent cervical cancer screening with folate receptor-mediated epithelium staining followed by cytology sampling. The color change of methylene blue in the cervical neoplastic epithelium can then be detected by the cotton swabs placed inside the cervix. A change of color to blue, bluish black or black is positive, whereas a change of color to green or no color change indicates negative result. Three hundred and twenty-three women who were positive with either or both tests had histopathologic diagnosis. RESULTS: The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of folate receptor-mediated epithelium staining for cervical intra-epithelial neoplasia grade 2 and worse was 85.7%, 76.4%, 61.3% and 92.5%, respectively. Folate receptor-mediated epithelium staining had moderate agreement with cytology thresholded at atypical squamous cells, unable to exclude a high grade intra-epithelial lesion and was more sensitive that the later (85.7% vs 74.5% for intra-epithelial neoplasia grade 2 and worse; 89.2% vs 75.4% for intra-epithelial neoplasia grade 3 and worse). CONCLUSION: Folate receptor-mediated epithelium staining is capable of detecting cervical precancerous and cancerous lesions rapidly and cost-effectively.
27738729	Efficacy of qualitative response assessment interpretation criteria at 18F-FDG PET-CT for predicting outcome in locally advanced cervical carcinoma treated with chemoradiotherapy.	OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the utility of a standardized qualitative scoring system for treatment response assessment at 18F-FDG PET-CT in patients undergoing chemoradiotherapy for locally advanced cervical carcinoma and correlate this with subsequent patient outcome. METHODS: Ninety-six consecutive patients with locally advanced cervical carcinoma treated with radical chemoradiotherapy (CRT) in a single centre between 2011 and 2014 underwent 18F-FDG PET-CT approximately 3 months post-treatment. Tumour metabolic response was assessed qualitatively using a 5-point scale ranging from background level activity only through to progressive metabolic disease. Clinical and radiological (MRI pelvis) follow-up was performed in all patients. Progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS) was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method (Mantel-Cox log-rank) and correlated with qualitative score using Chi-squared test. RESULTS: Forty patients (41.7 %) demonstrated complete metabolic response (CMR) on post-treatment PET-CT (Score 1/2) with 38 patients (95.0 %) remaining disease free after a minimum follow-up period of 18 months. Twenty-four patients (25.0 %) had indeterminate residual uptake (ID, Score 3) at primary or nodal sites after treatment, of these eight patients (33.3 %) relapsed on follow-up, including all patients with residual nodal uptake (n = 4Eleven11 of 17 patients (64.7 %) with significant residual uptake (partial metabolic response, PMR, Score 4) subsequently relapsed. In 15 patients (15.6 %) PET-CT demonstrated progressive disease (PD, Score 5) following treatment. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed a highly statistically significant difference in PFS and OS between patients with CMR, indeterminate uptake, PMR and PD (Log-rank, P < 0.0001). Chi-squared test demonstrated a highly statistically significant association between increasing qualitative score and risk of recurrence or death (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Use of a 5-point qualitative scoring system to assess metabolic response to CRT in locally advanced cervical carcinoma predicts survival outcome and this prognostic information may help guide further patient management.
27737700	Mucosal melanoma of the head and neck: a population-based study from Slovenia, 1985-2013.	OBJECTIVES: To assess the incidence and to review experience with the treatment of mucosal melanoma of the head and neck (MMHN) in Slovenia between 1985 and 2013. METHODS: The National Cancer Registry database and clinical records with outcome data of identified patients treated during the period 1985-2013 in Slovenia were reviewed. RESULTS: In a 29-year period, 61 patients with MMHN were identified, representing 0.5 % of all head and neck malignant tumors and 42 % of all mucosal melanomas in Slovenia. 72 % originated in the sinonasal tract and were predominantly (78 %) diagnosed as a local disease. Regional metastases at diagnosis were more frequent in patients with oral/oropharyngeal primary (44 %; sinonasal MMHN 11 %, p = 0.006). Curative intent treatment was given to 48 (79 %) patients. The overall survival (OS) rates at 2 and 5 years for the whole cohort were 43 % and 18 %, respectively, and for the curative intent group 53 % and 24 %, respectively. In the latter group, multivariate analyses showed postoperative radiotherapy (PORT) to be predictive for locoregional control (LRC) (hazard ratios [HR] for surgery with PORT vs. surgery alone: 1.0 vs. 3.9, p = 0.037), whereas only the World Health Organization performance status (HR for grade 0 vs. grade 1 vs. grade >1: 1.0 (p = 0.022) vs. 1.2 (p = 0.640) vs. 7.7 (p = 0.008)) significantly influenced OS. CONCLUSIONS: MMHN is a rare tumor with a poor prognosis. Combination of surgery and PORT offers the best prospects for LRC but without improvement of OS. Due to potential toxicity of high-dose RT such treatment is indicated in patients in whom LRC outweighs the risks of serious adverse effects.
27736623	Impact of the Australian National Cervical Screening Program in women of different ages.	OBJECTIVES: The Australian National Cervical Screening Program (NCSP) will transition in 2017 from cytology-based screening every two years, starting from age 18-20 years, to HPV-based screening every 5 years, starting from age 25. To examine the impact of the program before this transition we analysed trends in the incidence of cervical cancer, by age and histological subtype. DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: National cervical cancer incidence data, 1982-2010. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Standardised rate ratios (SRR) for 3-yearly average cervical cancer incidence, relative to the rate during 1988-1990, by age group and histological type. RESULTS: Between 1988-1990 and 2008-2010, cervical cancer incidence fell substantially in women aged 25-49 (SRR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.51-0.59), 50-69 (SRR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.42-0.51) and 70 years or more (SRR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.43-0.58), but not in women aged 20-24 years (SRR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.46-1.05). These declines were primarily driven by drops in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) in women aged 25-49 (SRR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.46-0.55), 50-69 (SRR, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.35-0.45) and more than 70 years (SRR, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.36-0.51). However, rates have now plateaued in women aged 25-69 years. The incidence of adenocarcinoma did not consistently decline across the program period in any age group. The incidence of neither SCC (SRR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.55-1.51) nor adenocarcinoma (SRR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.35-2.40) declined in women aged 20-24 years. CONCLUSION: Although women aged 20-24 years have been included in the NCSP since its inception, no significant impact on cervical cancer incidence was observed in this age group. The NCSP has had a substantial impact on SCC and overall cervical cancer incidence in women aged 25 years and over. Its impact on the incidence of adenocarcinoma, in contrast, has been limited.
27734106	Magnetic resonance image-guided brachytherapy for cervical cancer : Prognostic factors for survival.	OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this work was to identify prognostic factors for survival after magnetic resonance image (MRI)-guided brachytherapy combined with external beam radiotherapy for cervical cancer. MATERIAL AND METHODS: External beam radiotherapy of 45-50.4 Gy was delivered by either three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy or helical tomotherapy. Patients also received high-dose-rate MRI-guided brachytherapy of 5 Gy in 6 fractions. RESULTS: We analyzed 128 patients with International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage IB-IVB cervical cancer who underwent MRI-guided brachytherapy. Most patients (96 %) received concurrent chemotherapy. Pelvic lymph node metastases and para-aortic lymphadenopathies were found in 62 % and 14 % of patients, respectively. The median follow-up time was 44 months. Complete remission was achieved in 119 of 128 patients (93 %). The 5year local recurrence-free, cancer-specific, and overall survival rates were 94, 89, and 85 %, respectively. Negative pelvic lymphadenopathy, gross tumor volume (GTV) dose covering 90 % of the target (GTV D90) of >110 Gy, and treatment duration </=56 days were associated with better overall survival in univariate analyses. Multivariable analysis showed that GTV D90 of >110 Gy and treatment duration </=56 days were possibly associated with overall survival with near-significant P-values of 0.062 and 0.073, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The outcome of MRI-guided brachytherapy combined with external beam radiotherapy in patients with cervical cancer was excellent. GTV D90 of >110 Gy and treatment duration </=56 days were potentially associated with overall survival.
27723397	Tumour-inducing viruses.	Virus infections are an important factor in the global burden of human cancer. The discovery and mode of action of human tumour viruses is briefly reviewed together with the promise of prevention through vaccination.
27723194	High prevalence of genital HPV infection among long-term monogamous partners of women with cervical dysplasia or genital warts-Another reason for HPV vaccination of boys.	We conducted a cross-sectional study on the occurrence of a specific type of genital human papillomavirus (HPV) among long-term monogamous male partners of women with cervical dysplasia and genital warts. The purpose of the study was to improve knowledge with regards to the management of these couples. The presence of genital HPV-DNA was detected by PCR with broad spectrum primers followed by hybridization. 82 males met the study criteria, 41 in each group. Genital HPV-DNA prevalence was 67.5% in the genital warts group and 72.2% in the cervical dysplasia group. The prevalence of high risk HPVs was higher in the cervical dysplasia group, while low risk HPVs were more prevalent in the genital warts group (p < .05). The prevalence of HPV in males was independent of the duration of the relationship (73.5% for 6-24 months and 66.7% for longer relationships). In conclusion, our results suggest that the prevalence of the genital HPV infection in both groups of male partners is comparable and very high, but the spectrum of HPV types varies significantly. The presence of the genital HPV infection in male sexual partners seems to be independent of the duration of the relationship. Applying the HPV vaccination to boys may prevent this phenomenon.
27723187	Hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions between cell penetrating peptides and plasmid DNA are important for stable non-covalent complexation and intracellular delivery.	Cell penetrating peptides are useful tools for intracellular delivery of nucleic acids. Delivery of plasmid DNA, a large nucleic acid, poses a challenge for peptide mediated transport. The paper investigates and compares efficacy of five novel peptide designs for complexation of plasmid DNA and subsequent delivery into cells. The peptides were designed to contain reported DNA condensing agents and basic cell penetrating sequences, octa-arginine (R8 ) and CHK6 HC coupled to cell penetration accelerating peptides such as Bax inhibitory mutant peptide (KLPVM) and a peptide derived from the Kaposi fibroblast growth factor (kFGF) membrane translocating sequence. A tryptophan rich peptide, an analogue of Pep-3, flanked with CH3 on either ends was also a part of the study. The peptides were analysed for plasmid DNA complexation, protection of peptide-plasmid DNA complexes against DNase I, serum components and competitive ligands by simple agarose gel electrophoresis techniques. Hemolysis of rat red blood corpuscles (RBCs) in the presence of the peptides was used as a measure of peptide cytotoxicity. Plasmid DNA delivery through the designed peptides was evaluated in two cell lines, human cervical cancer cell line (HeLa) and (NIH/3 T3) mouse embryonic fibroblasts via expression of the secreted alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) reporter gene. The importance of hydrophobic sequences in addition to cationic sequences in peptides for non-covalent plasmid DNA complexation and delivery has been illustrated. An alternative to the employment of fatty acid moieties for enhanced gene transfer has been proposed. Comparison of peptides for plasmid DNA complexation and delivery of peptide-plasmid DNA complexes to cells estimated by expression of a reporter gene, SEAP.

27721247	Oxycodone versus dezocine for postoperative analgesia in patients with cervical cancer treated with radical surgery.	OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate oxycodone versus dezocine for postoperative analgesia in patients with cervical cancer treated with radical surgery. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty-one cases of cervical cancer treated with radical surgery were included in the present study and divided into oxycodone group (n = 26) and dezocine group (n = 25). Patients in the oxycodone group were given with oxycodone 1 mg/kg plus tropisetron 0.1 mg/kg diluting to 100 ml by 0.9% saline for patient-controlled intravenous analgesia (PCIA) after surgery. Moreover, patients in the dezocine group were given with dezocine 0.6 mg/kg plus tropisetron 0.1 mg/kg diluting to 100 ml by 0.9% saline for PCIA after surgery. The visual analog scale (VAS) and Ramsay sedation score of the two groups were recorded in the time point of 4, 8, 12, 24, and 48 h after surgery. The adverse event-related drugs were recorded and compared between the two groups. RESULTS: The VAS score was significantly lower in oxycodone group compared to dezocine group in the time point of 4, 8, 12, 24, and 48 h (Pall < 0.05). The Ramsay score at time point of 4, 8, 12, 24 h, and 48 h were obviously higher in oxycodone group than those in dezocine group (P < 0.05) which indicated that the sedative effect in oxycodone group was superior to dezocine. For oxycodone group, there were six cases (23.08%) with nausea and one case (3.85) with vomiting in the treatment procedure. Moreover, for dezocine group, there were one case (4.00%) with nausea, two cases (8.00%) with vomiting, and two cases (8.00%) with dizzy in the treatment procedure. There was no statistical difference of adverse event risk between the two groups (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Oxycodone postoperative analgesia is superior to dezocine for patients with cervical cancer treated with radical surgery.
27717891	The rs767649 polymorphism in the promoter of miR-155 contributes to the decreased risk for cervical cancer in a Chinese population.	Genetic variants in miRNAs have attracted more and more attention these years because they are capable of altering miRNA function and/or expression, consequently affecting downstream biological pathways and disease risk. The rs767649 polymorphism, locating in the promoter of miR-155, was recently reported to be able to alter transcriptional activity of miR-155 and relate to lung cancer risk. In this study, we aimed to assess the relationship between rs767649 and cervical cancer (CC) risk. We investigated the association of rs767649 with CC risk in a two-stage case-control study with 1157 cases and 1280 controls. Genotyping was determined with TaqMan allelic discrimination method. The results showed that the rs767649 TT genotype was associated with a significantly reduced risk of CC in both test (549 cases and 603 controls), validation (608 cases and 677 controls) and combined sets [adjusted odds ratio (OR)=0.67, 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.51-0.87 for the combined set] compared with the AA/AT genotypes. Moreover, the association was more prominent among patients of age>49years and postmenopausal status (OR=0.56, 95% CI=0.38-0.83, and 0.60, 0.40-0.89, respectively) and patients with clinical stage I and II CC (OR=0.67, 95% CI=0.50-0.91, and 0.60, 0.40-0.92, respectively). Further analyses showed that miR-155 was overexpressed in the CC tissues as compared with normal tissues, suggesting an oncogenic role in CC. Luciferase assay indicated that the transition of A to T allele might lead to miR-155 downregulation at the transcriptional level. In conclusion, rs767649 might be a causal variant for CC susceptibility.
27716233	Age and HPV type as risk factors for HPV persistence after loop excision in patients with high grade cervical lesions: an observational study.	BACKGROUND: Persistent infections with high risk human papillomaviruses (HR-HPV) cause virtually all cervical cancers. METHODS: An observational study was conducted aiming to estimate the rate of HPV infection persistence after LEEP in patients with high grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL). Moreover, the study investigated if persistence is age related. For this reason a total of 110 patients were included between January 2010 and June 2015. RESULTS: At 6 months after LEEP the overall HPV infection persistence rate was 40.9 %, at 12 months 20 % and at 18 months 11.8 %. Type 16 showed the highest persistence rate: 27.3 % at 6 months, 12.7 % at 12 months and 10 % at 18 months after LEEP. The persistence for HPV type 16 at 6 months after LEEP was significantly higher in the group > =36.5 years old compared to the persistence rate in the group <36.5 years old (p = 0.0027, RR = 2.75, 95 %(1.34; 5.64)) (see Table 3). CONCLUSIONS: LEEP does not completely eradicate HPV infection. HPV persistence rate after LEEP is higher in infections with type 16 and in women older than 36.5 years.
27714759	Prevalence of human papillomavirus infection among women in rural Nepal.	INTRODUCTION: In this study we aimed to determine the overall and type-specific prevalence of cervical human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and risk factors for such infection among women in rural Nepal, and to investigate the distribution of HPV infection by cervical cytology. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study was conducted among women aged >/=15 years in five rural villages within Kavre District in Nepal. Sociodemographic data and information on risk factors for cervical cancer were obtained through an interview, and a cervical specimen was collected for HPV DNA detection and typing using the Anyplex ll HPV28 Detection system, and for Papanicolaou test. RESULTS: Among the 1289 women in whom a valid HPV result was obtained the median age was 40 years (range 17-86 years). Overall, the HPV prevalence was 14.4%, 7.9% for high-risk and 6.5% for low-risk HPV types, and was similar between age groups. The five most common HR types were HPV-18 (2.3%), HPV-51 (1.2%), HPV-59 (1.1%), HPV-31 (0.9%), and HPV-16 (0.8%). The prevalence of high-risk types in women with and without abnormal cytology was 8.3 and 7.7%, respectively. HPV infection was associated with current smoking, formal education, and being married to a husband with at least one previous marriage. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first population-based study to report the prevalence of a broad range of HPV types among women from rural Nepal. These data are crucial for development of preventive strategies to reduce cervical cancer burden in the country.
27714520	The use of transureteroureterostomy during ureteral reconstruction for advanced primary or recurrent pelvic malignancy in the era of multimodal therapy.	PURPOSE: Cancerous involvement of a ureter is sometimes encountered in pelvic surgery for malignancy. We usually perform transureteroureterostomy (TUU) in cases of unilateral lower ureteral cancerous involvement. We report the outcomes in patients treated with TUU in our institute. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 11 patients who underwent TUU between June 2006 and September 2015. RESULTS: The primary disease was colon cancer in five patients, rectal cancer in four, and uterine cervical cancer and ovarian cancer in one patient each. Early postoperative complications relevant to TUU occurred in four patients; however, three patients were managed conservatively and recovered quickly. Only one patient developed ureteral obstruction, which resulted from anastomotic hematoma. Follow-up periods ranged from 5 to 78 months with a median of 28 months. The median estimated glomerular filtration rate before and after TUU was 59 ml/min (range, 31-90 ml/min) and 62.0 ml/min (range, 43-127 mL/min), respectively. No patients experienced worsening of their renal function or recurrent urinary tract infection. CONCLUSIONS: Short-term outcomes are good and long-term renal function is maintained following TUU. TUU is considered a feasible technique for ureteral reconstruction for pelvic malignancy, and TUU has great potential in the era of multimodal therapy.
27710981	Clinical Practice Guidelines on the Screening and Treatment of Precancerous Lesions for Cervical Cancer Prevention in Saudi Arabia.	BACKGROUND: Cervical cancer is the third most common gynecological malignancy in Saudi women with an estimated incidence rate of 1.9 cases per 100 000 women-years. More than 40% of cervical cancer cases are diagnosed at advanced stages due to lack of a routine screening program in Saudi Arabia. Thus, national guidelines for routine screening and treatment of precancerous cervical lesions are needed. METHODS: The Saudi Centre for Evidence-Based Healthcare invited a panel of local experts and partnered them with a team from McMaster University in Canada for methodological support, to develop national clinical practice guidelines on the screening and treatment of precancerous lesions for cervical cancer. After the panel identified key clinical questions, the McMaster University working group updated existing systematic reviews that had been used for the 2013 WHO Guidelines for screening and treatment of precancerous lesions for cervical cancer prevention. Recommendations were based on the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach. Those recommendations took into account the available evidence, patient values and preferences, and resource use in the Saudi context. The panel provided recommendations on two major issues: screening for precancerous lesions (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2 & 3) and treatment of those lesions to prevent cervical cancer in women who tested positive after screening. CONCLUSIONS: The Saudi expert panel recommends using the HPV DNA test followed by colposcopy or cytology (Pap test) followed by colposcopy to screen for CIN2+ in women at risk of cervical cancer. The panel recommends cryotherapy or loop excision electrosurgery procedure (LEEP) over cold knife cone biopsy to treat women at risk of cervical cancer that tests positive for CIN2+. Universal screening for precancerous cervical dysplasia in women in Saudi Arabia is recommended using HPV testing and or cytology. Either cryotherapy or LEEP are preferred for treatment. LIMITATIONS: National studies on cervical cancer screening modalities and treatment of precancerous cervical lesions, including HPV prevalence and its association with cervical cancer, are scarce.
27710973	Management of Isolated Vaginal Metastasis in Squamous Cell Cervical Cancer: 23 Years' Experience at a Single Center.	AIM: The aim of this study was to investigate the treatment options and survival of cervical cancer (CC) patients who develop isolated vaginal metastasis (IVM), and to establish risk factors for IVM. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 21 cases with IVM were evaluated retrospectively. In addition, 42 control patients diagnosed with CC without recurrence were matched. Tumor size, depth of stromal invasion (DOI), lymphovascular space invasion (LVSI), and size of vaginal and lymph node metastases were analyzed in accordance with the pathology reports. Patients who had IVM were investigated in terms of treatment options (chemotherapy (CT), radiotherapy (RT), or chemoradiotherapy (CRT)) and survival. RESULTS: After detection of IVM, the 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates were 57.1, 23.8, and 9.5%, respectively. The mean survival time after metastasis detection was 23.1 +/- 31.3 months. LVSI, DOI >/= 1/2, hemoglobin < 12 g/dl, postmenopausal status, and tumor size >/= 4 cm were independent risk factors for IVM. The 5-year survival rates were 30.0% for patients receiving RT, 17.1% for patients receiving CRT, and 0% for patients receiving CT. CONCLUSION: IVM typically develops within the first 2 years after the diagnosis of CC, and survival is generally poor. RT was the most effective treatment in patients with IVM.
27706774	Effect of miRNA-203 on cervical cancer cells and its underlying mechanism.	miRNA-203 is involved in the development and progression of various types of cancer. However, its role in cervical cancer remains unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of miRNA-203 on the proliferation and migration of HeLa cervical cancer cells, as well as survivin expression in these cells. A miRNA-203 primer probe was designed according to a sequence obtained from NCBI. The expression of miRNA-203 in cervical epithelial cells and cervical cancer cells was detected by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. The miRNA-203 expression pattern was compared between these two cell lines. The cervical cancer cells were transfected with miRNA-203 mimic or inhibitor to determine their effects on proliferation and migration. The expression of the miRNA-203 target protein (survivin) was analyzed by western blot. Cervical cancer cells showed reduced miRNA-203 expression compared to cervical epithelial cells. Transfection of miRNA-203 mimic upregulated the expression of miRNA-203, suppressed cell proliferation and migration, and downregulated survivin expression (P < 0.05). However, downregulation of miRNA-203 expression did not affect proliferation, migration, and survivin expression in cervical cancer cells (P > 0.05). In conclusion, upregulation of miRNA-203 in cervical cancer cells inhibits the proliferative and migratory capacities of these cells by downregulating the expression of survivin.
27702796	Safety of extending screening intervals beyond five years in cervical screening programmes with testing for high risk human papillomavirus: 14 year follow-up of population based randomised cohort in the Netherlands.	OBJECTIVES: To provide an early risk assessment of extending screening intervals beyond five years for a human papillomavirus (HPV) based cervical screening programme in the Netherlands. DESIGN: 14 year follow-up of a population based randomised cohort from the POBASCAM randomised trial. SETTING: Organised cervical screening in the Netherlands, based on a programme of three screening rounds (each round done every five years). PARTICIPANTS: 43 339 women aged 29-61 years with a negative HPV and/or negative cytology test participating in the POBASCAM trial. INTERVENTIONS: Women randomly assigned to HPV and cytology co-testing (intervention) or cytology testing only (control), and managed accordingly. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cumulative incidence of cervical cancer and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) grade 3 or worse (CIN3+). Associations with age were expressed as incidence rate ratios. In HPV positive women, reductions in CIN3+ incidence after negative cytology, HPV type 16/18 genotyping, and/or repeat cytology were estimated. RESULTS: The cumulative incidence of cervical cancer (0.09%) and CIN3+ (0.56%) among HPV negative women in the intervention group after three rounds of screening were similar to the cumulative among women with negative cytology in the control group after two rounds (0.09% and 0.69%, respectively). Cervical cancer and CIN3+ risk ratios were 0.97 (95% confidence interval 0.41 to 2.31, P=0.95) and 0.82 (0.62 to 1.09, P=0.17), respectively. CIN3+ incidence was 72.2% (95% confidence interval 61.6% to 79.9%, P<0.001) lower among HPV negative women aged at least 40 years than among younger women. No significant association between cervical cancer incidence and age could be demonstrated. CIN3+ incidence among HPV positive women with negative cytology, HPV 16/18 genotyping, and/or repeat cytology was 10.4 (95% confidence interval 5.9 to 18.4) times higher than among HPV negative women. CONCLUSIONS: Long term incidences of cervical cancer and CIN3+ were low among HPV negative women in this study cohort, and supports an extension of the cervical screening interval beyond five years for women aged 40 years and older. HPV positive women with subsequent negative cytology, HPV16/18 genotyping, and/or repeat cytology have at least a fivefold higher risk of CIN3+ than HPV negative women, indicating that HPV based programmes with long intervals (>five years) should be implemented with risk stratification.Trial registration POBASCAM trial number ISRCTN20781131.
27699529	HPV Integration in Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinomas: Cause and Consequence.	Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are a necessary cause of anogenital squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) and a subgroup of head and neck SCC, i.e., those originating in the oropharynx. The key events in high-risk HPV (HRHPV)-associated neoplastic progression include persistent infection, deregulated expression of virus early genes in basal epithelial cells, local immune suppression and the accumulation of chromosomal alterations. Evidence for these events particularly comes from studies of uterine cervical carcinogenesis; primary premalignant HRHPV-positive lesions of the head and neck mucosa are seldomly detected. Integration of virus DNA into host chromosomes is considered an important driver of carcinogenesis and observed in 40 up to 90 % of uterine cervical SCC (UCSCC) and oropharyngeal SCC (OPSCC), dependent on the integration detection method used and HRHPV type. In OPSCC, > 90 % HPV-positive tumors are infected with HPV16. Ten up to 60 % of HPV-positive tumors thus contain extrachromosomal (episomal) virus. In this chapter, causes and consequences of HPV integration are summarized from the literature, with special focus on the site of HPV integration in the cellular genome, and its effect on expression of viral oncogenes (particularly E6 and E7), on human (tumor) gene expression and on deregulation of cell proliferation, apoptosis and cell signaling pathways. Also data on DNA methylation, viral load and clinical outcome in relation to HPV integration are provided.
27699526	HPV in Head and Neck Cancer-30 Years of History.	The interesting history of papillomavirus (PV) research has been reviewed before. The history of human papillomavirus (HPV) in head and neck region starts in 1901 when the contagious transmission of warty lesions into the mouth via oral sex was described, although the confirmation of their viral etiology had to wait until 1907. Ullman was the first to associate the human wart virus with laryngeal warts. Parsons and Kidd described the natural history of oral PV infections in rabbits already in 1942, but these findings were corroborated in humans only recently. Koilocytotic atypia described by Koss and Durfee in 1956 was recognized as a sign of HPV infection in cervical precancer lesions only in 1976-1977 (Meisels and Fortin; Purola and Savia). This prompted systematic surveys of head and neck lesions for the detection of koilocytosis since the late 1970s, and the authors of this communication were the first to propose the HPV involvement in a subgroup of head and neck cancers. Brandsma and Abramson demonstrated HPV16 DNA in tonsillar SCCs in 1989. Since the early 2000s, HPV research of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) has made impressive progress, confirming that the specific anatomic site plays a key role in determining the susceptibility to HPV infection. The most likely cancer sites associated with HPV are the base of the tongue and palatine tonsils, followed by oral cavity, larynx, and sinonasal mucosa. There is substantial geographic variation in HPV association with HNSCC. Patients with HPV-associated HNSCC are younger, and survival is better than in the absence of HPV.
27699512	Synergistic effect of programmed cell death protein 1 blockade and secondary lymphoid tissue chemokine in the induction of anti-tumor immunity by a therapeutic cancer vaccine.	The use of DNA vaccines has become an attractive approach for generating antigen-specific cytotoxic CD8+ T lymphocytes (CTLs), which can mediate protective antitumor immunity. The potency of DNA vaccines encoding weakly immunogenic tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) can be improved by using an adjuvant injected together with checkpoint antibodies. In the current study, we evaluated whether the therapeutic effects of a DNA vaccine encoding human papilloma virus type 16 (HPV-16) E7 can be enhanced by combined application of an immune checkpoint blockade directed against the programmed death-1 (PD-1) pathway and secondary lymphoid tissue chemokine (SLC) also known as CCL21 adjuvant, in a mouse cervical cancer model. The therapeutic effects of the DNA vaccine in combination with CCL21 adjuvant plus PD-1 blockade was evaluated using a tumor growth curve. To further investigate the mechanism underlying the antitumor response, cytolytic and lymphocyte proliferation responses in splenocytes were measured using non-radioactive cytotoxicity and MTT assays, respectively. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and IL-10 expression in the tumor and the levels of IFN-gamma and IL-4 in supernatants of spleno-lymphocyte cultures were measured using ELISA. The immune efficacy was evaluated by in vivo tumor regression assay. The results showed that vaccination with a DNA vaccine in combination with the CCL21 adjuvant plus PD-1 blockade greatly enhanced cytotoxic T lymphocyte production and lymphocyte proliferation rates and greatly inhibited tumor progression. Moreover, the vaccine in combination with adjuvant and blockade significantly reduced intratumoral VEGF, IL-10 and splenic IL-4 but induced the expression of splenic IFN-gamma. This formulation could be an effective candidate for a vaccine against cervical cancers and merits further investigation.
27696414	Proof-of-principle study of a novel cervical screening and triage strategy: Computer-analyzed cytology to decide which HPV-positive women are likely to have >/=CIN2.	A challenge in implementation of sensitive HPV-based screening is limiting unnecessary referrals to colposcopic biopsy. We combined two commonly recommended triage methods: partial HPV typing and "reflex" cytology, evaluating the possibility of automated cytology. This investigation was based on 1,178 exfoliated cervical specimens collected during the enrollment phase of The Study to Understand Cervical Cancer Early Endpoints and Determinants (SUCCEED, Oklahoma City, OK). We chose a colposcopy clinic population to maximize number of outcomes, for this proof-of-principle cross-sectional study. Residual aliquots of PreservCyt were HPV-typed using Linear Array (LA, Roche Molecular Systems, Pleasanton, CA). High-risk HPV typing data and cytologic results (conventional and automated) were used jointly to predict risk of histologically defined >/=CIN2. We developed a novel computer algorithm that uses the same optical scanning features that are generated by the FocalPoint Slide Profiler (BD, Burlington, NC). We used the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) method to build the prediction model based on a training dataset (n = 600). In the validation set (n = 578), for triage of all HPV-positive women, a cytologic threshold of >/=ASC-US had a sensitivity of 0.94, and specificity of 0.30, in this colposcopy clinic setting. When we chose a threshold for the severity score (generated by the computer algorithm) that had an equal specificity of 0.30, the sensitivity was 0.91. Automated cytology also matched >/=ASC-US when partial HPV typing was added to the triage strategy, and when we re-defined cases as >/=CIN3. If this strategy works in a prospective screening setting, a totally automated screening and triage technology might be possible.
27693934	Cervical cancer screening after 50: near extinction?	OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were to determine the prevalence and predictors of Pap smear screening among women aged 50 years and older. STUDY DESIGN: This cross-sectional study was conducted at two large urban health centres in Selangor. A total of 515 women aged 50 and older were recruited. RESULTS: The mean age of the respondents was 58.83+/-7.05, with a range of 50- 83 years. The prevalence of Pap smear screening was 39.22% (n=202). From the multivariate analysis, Pap smear screening was significantly associated with health care provider advice (adjusted odds ratio (AOR)=18.75; 95% CI=8.30, 42.37); tertiary (AOR=11.26; 95% CI=1.50, 84.68) and secondary education level (AOR=9.47; 95% CI=1.43, 62.84); use of contraception (AOR=2.90; 95% CI=1.48, 5.69); heart disease (AOR=0.22; 95% CI=0.05, 0.97); and worry about Pap smear results (AOR=0.20; 95% CI=0.09, 0.42). CONCLUSION: The prevalence of Pap smear screening in the older women is unsatisfactory. Health care provider advice, education level, use of contraception, heart disease and worry about Pap smear results were predictors of undergoing Pap smear screening in this study population.
27692247	Influencing Factors of Intention to Receive Pap Tests in Vietnamese Women who Immigrated to Taiwan for Marriage.	PURPOSE: This study aimed to explore the factors associated with the intention to receive a Pap test among married immigrant women of Vietnamese origin living in Taiwan. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional community-based study. We enrolled 281 women aged 30 years and over in the study, from July 2013 to January 2014. The participants' characteristics, cervical cancer knowledge, Pap test knowledge, attitudes toward cervical cancer, barriers to receiving a Pap test, fatalism, and intention to receive a Pap test, were measured using self-report questionnaires. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses were performed to examine the variables associated with participants' intentions to receive a Pap test. RESULTS: Vietnamese women with low scores on the measures of cervical cancer knowledge and perceived barriers to receiving a Pap test were more willing to receive the test, as were those with high scores on the measures of Pap test knowledge and fatalism. Women who received a Pap test in the previous year were more willing to receive a Pap test within the next 3 years. CONCLUSIONS: Preventive healthcare for immigrant women should be a focus of nurses. The development of culturally appropriate health education and strategies should enhance their knowledge of Pap tests and reduce perceived barriers to Pap test participation. This study's results can be a reference for nurses who work with immigrant women.
27690631	HOTAIR rs920778 polymorphism is associated with ovarian cancer susceptibility and poor prognosis in a Chinese population.	AIM: The aim of this study was to determine if HOTAIR rs920778 polymorphism is associated with ovarian cancer susceptibility and prognosis. MATERIALS & METHODS: The data were obtained from two independent groups including 329 ovarian cancer patients and 680 cancer-free, age-matched women. Blood samples were collected and genomic DNA was extracted for genotyping. RESULTS: TT genotype and T allele of HOTAIR rs920778 were significantly associated with a decreased ovarian cancer risk (p = 0.0004 and p < 0.0001, respectively), which associated with advanced tumor stage, lymph node metastasis and poor prognosis. Moreover, TT and TC carriers obtained a much shorter survival (p = 0.026). CONCLUSION: These findings propose that HOTAIR rs920778 polymorphism influences ovarian cancer susceptibility and prognosis, and further studies are warranted in other populations.
27689353	Rapid and visual Chlamydia trachomatis detection using loop-mediated isothermal amplification and hydroxynaphthol blue.	We developed an assay comprising crude DNA lysis by simple heat treatment coupled loop-mediated isothermal amplification with hydroxynaphthol blue for Chlamydia trachomatis detection (petty patent pending), and evaluated the developed assay for its feasibility as a one-step point-of-care detection on 284 endocervical swab specimens from clinically symptomatic C. trachomatis and healthy subjects. This assay is sensitive to 0.04 pg of ompA, specific with six primers targeting C. trachomatis ompA region, rapid (45 min total assay time), inexpensive (approx. 3 USD/reaction), does not require sophisticated instrumentation, and has comparable assay effectiveness (95% specificity, 90-100% sensitivity) to bacterial DNA isolation by a commercial kit coupled with polymerase chain reaction and gel electrophoresis (98-100% specificity, 87-100% sensitivity) based on the clinical samples test. The test result could be read by naked eye through the colour change from violet (negative) to sky blue (positive) for C. trachomatis-infected specimens. Further, this assay uses all safe chemical reagents and is hence safe to the users. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Chlamydia trachomatis is the major bacterial sexually transmitted disease worldwide. The clinical symptoms are broad, and chronic C. trachomatis infections could lead to blindness, ectopic pregnancy, sterility in males and females, and a higher risk of the development of cervical cancer. The result indicates the potential usefulness of our crude DNA lysis coupled loop-mediated isothermal amplification with hydroxynaphthol blue for a simple, rapid, specific, sensitive and cost-effective assay for C. trachomatis detection from suspected specimens. This assay offers an alternative in the clinical diagnosis of C. trachomatis in resource-limited health-care facilities and clinical laboratories in developing countries, and in field tests.
27685108	Simultaneously integrated boost (SIB) spares OAR and reduces treatment time in locally advanced cervical cancer.	We performed a dosimetric comparison of sequential IMRT (sIMRT) and simul-taneously integrated boost (SIB) IMRT to boost PET-avid lymph nodes while concurrently treating pelvic targets to determine the potential of SIB IMRT to reduce overall treatment duration in locally advanced cervical cancer. Ten patients receiving definitive radiation therapy were identified retrospectively. RTOG consensus guidelines were followed to delineate the clinical target volume and organs at risk (OAR), which were then expanded per IMRT consortium guidelines to yield the planning target volume (PTV). Dosimetric parameters for PTVs and OAR including conformity (CI95%) were collected and compared using Wilcoxon signed-rank tests with Bonferroni correction. The median PTV volume was 1843 cc (1088-2225 cc) and the median boost volume was 43 cc (15-129 cc). Comparable target volume coverage was achieved with sIMRT and SIB plans, while hot spots were significantly reduced using SIB. SIB plans improved sparing for all OAR, though only rectum and small bowel doses were statistically significant. Comparing sIMRT and SIB plans averaged over all patients, rectal doses were V45: 70.8% vs. 64.5% (p = 0.002) and 0.1 cc: 50.7 Gy vs. 48.7 Gy (p = 0.006). For small bowel, sIMRT and SIB IMRT plans yielded V45: 13.4% vs. 11.4% (p = 0.006) and 1 cc: 54.4 Gy vs. 52.6 Gy (p = 0.006), respectively. Doses to femoral heads and blad-der trended towards significance in favor of SIB plans. The mean treatment time was 25 versus 29 days for SIB and sIMRT plans, respectively. When compared to sIMRT, SIB for treatment of nodal targets provides a significant, but small, dose reduction (3.8%-4.4%) to OAR, which leads to comparable biological dose despite higher fractional doses. Furthermore, SIB IMRT reduces overall treatment time and simplifies the planning process, and should be considered for targeting PET-positive nodal disease in patients with locally advanced cervical cancer.
27685104	Secondary cancer-incidence risk estimates for external radiotherapy and high-dose-rate brachytherapy in cervical cancer: phantom study.	This study was designed to estimate radiation-induced secondary cancer risks from high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy and external radiotherapy for patients with cervical cancer based on measurements of doses absorbed by various organs. Organ doses from HDR brachytherapy and external radiotherapy were measured using glass rod dosimeters. Doses to out-of-field organs were measured at various loca-tions inside an anthropomorphic phantom. Brachytherapy-associated organ doses were measured using a specialized phantom that enabled applicator insertion, with the pelvis portion of the existing anthropomorphic phantom replaced by this new phantom. Measured organ doses were used to calculate secondary cancer risk based on Biological Effects of Ionizing Radiation (BEIR) VII models. In both treatment modalities, organ doses per prescribed dose (PD) mostly depended on the distance between organs. The locations showing the highest and lowest doses were the right kidney (external radiotherapy: 215.2 mGy; brachytherapy: 655.17 mGy) and the brain (external radiotherapy: 15.82 mGy; brachytherapy: 2.49 mGy), respectively. Organ doses to nearby regions were higher for brachytherapy than for external beam therapy, whereas organ doses to distant regions were higher for external beam therapy. Organ doses to distant treatment regions in external radiotherapy were due primarily to out-of-field radiation resulting from scattering and leakage in the gantry head. For brachytherapy, the highest estimated lifetime attributable risk per 100,000 population was to the stomach (88.6), whereas the lowest risks were to the brain (0.4) and eye (0.4); for external radiotherapy, the highest and lowest risks were to the thyroid (305.1) and brain (2.4). These results may help provide a database on the impact of radiotherapy-induced secondary cancer incidence dur-ing cervical cancer treatment, as well as suggest further research on strategies to counteract the risks of radiotherapy-associated secondary malignancies.
27684810	Patterns of lymph node metastasis in locally advanced cervical cancer.	The aim of this study was to investigate patterns and locations of lymph node metastasis in locally advanced cervical cancers.A total of 244 consecutive patients with stage IIb cervical cancer were retrospectively evaluated. Contrast-enhanced CT scans were used for lymph node grading. Lymph nodes with the shortest axis (>1 cm) were categorized as positive and those between 0.5 and 1 cm were categorized as suspicious. All lymph nodes (LNs) were also classified by their anatomic locations.Nine hundred thirty-one LNs (136 positive and 795 suspicious) were identified. Sixty-three (25.8%) patients had positive LNs, and 153 (62.7%) patients had only suspicious LNs. The metastatic pattern was predictable traveling from level 1 (external iliac, internal iliac, obturator, and mesorectum groups) through level 2 (common iliac and presacral groups) to level 3 (para-aortic groups). In most groups, LNs were located within 1.0 cm of main blood vessels. Our novel findings were: presacral LNs metastases were rare (2/244, 0.82%); the left common iliac group (LCI) had significantly more enlarged nodes than the right common iliac group (P = 0.00); the LCI and left down-para-aortic group were further away from blood vessels than expected (1.2 cm and 1.4 cm, respectively); no additional margin was needed in anterolateral direction for external iliac groups.The lymph node metastatic patterns are relatively predicable. Different expansions from vessels should be used to include LNs for different groups. Presacral nodes metastases are rare, and further study is warranted to see whether this region can be excluded from nodal CTV.
27683269	Identification of genetic variation in the lncRNA HOTAIR associated with HPV16-related cervical cancer pathogenesis.	PURPOSE: Previously, over-expression of the long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) HOTAIR has been found to be associated with the invasive and metastatic capacities of several epithelial cancers, including cervical cancer (CaCx). Here, we aimed at identifying functionally relevant genetic variants that may be employed to differentiate between clinically distinct CaCx subtypes, i.e., those exhibiting high HOTAIR levels and molecular signatures of metastasis and those lacking such signatures in the presence of low HOTAIR expression levels. METHODS: Genomic DNA isolated from various cervical tissue samples (characterized by histopathology and HPV status) was used for HOTAIR amplicon sequencing, followed by validation of the findings by Sanger sequencing. The impact of the genetic variants found on the secondary structure of HOTAIR and the concomitant alterations in miRNA binding sites were determined through in silico analysis, followed by miRNA expression analysis by quantitative real-time PCR and confirmation of miRNA binding using a luciferase reporter assay. RESULTS: We found that rs2366152C was over-represented [ORage-adjusted = 2.58 (1.23-5.57); p = 0.014] in low HOTAIR expressing HPV positive CaCx cases compared to HPV negative controls. This genetic variant showed the propensity of a secondary structure alteration and gain of a miR-22 binding site in HOTAIR, which was found to be concordant with miR-22 over-expression in low HOTAIR CaCx cases compared to controls. We found that miR-22 expression negatively correlated with HOTAIR and E7 expression in HPV16 positive cases and in an E7 transfected HPV negative CaCx-derived cell line (C33A), but was not altered in high HOTAIR cases compared to controls. Reduced luciferase activity of a HOTAIR rs2366152C expression plasmid in C33A cells through miR-22 co-transfection confirmed the ability of miR-22 to specifically target rs2366152C-harbouring HOTAIR lncRNA in CaCx cells, ultimately leading to its down-regulation. CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that rs2366152C not only has the potential to serve as a marker for singling out CaCx cases lacking metastatic molecular signatures, but also to explain the functional inactivation of HOTAIR in these cases, including the mechanism of its down-regulation.
27677664	Adjuvant therapy after radical surgery for stage IB-IIB cervical adenocarcinoma with risk factors.	OBJECTIVE: Patients with adeno/adenosquamous carcinoma may have a poorer prognosis than patients with squamous cell carcinoma. Radiotherapy and concurrent chemoradiotherapy are used as adjuvant therapies for cervical cancer, regardless of the histological subtype. The aim of this study was to investigate the prognostic outcome of adjuvant therapy for patients with adeno/adenosquamous carcinoma with pathological risk factors. METHODS: The medical records of 135 patients with stage IB-IIB cervical cancer with squamous cell carcinoma or adeno/adenosquamous carcinoma who underwent primary surgery followed by adjuvant therapy were retrospectively reviewed. Patients with a pathologically confirmed bulky tumor (>/=4 cm), nodal metastasis and/or parametrium invasion were included in the study. RESULTS: The median follow-up period was 48 (1-132) months. Of the 135 patients, 90 with squamous cell carcinoma and 23 with adeno/adenosquamous carcinoma were treated with adjuvant radiotherapy and concurrent chemoradiotherapy (SCC-RT/CCRT and AC-RT/CCRT groups), and 22 with adeno/adenosquamous carcinoma were treated with adjuvant systemic chemotherapy (AC-CT group). There were no significant differences in clinicopathological factors between the SCC-RT/CCRT and AC-RT/CCRT groups and between the AC-RT/CCRT and AC-CT groups. Progression-free survival was significantly shorter in the AC-RT/CCRT group compared to the SCC-RT/CCRT group (P = 0.002). Adeno/adenosquamous carcinoma histology and multiple lymph node metastasis were independent prognostic factors for shorter progression-free survival in patients treated with adjuvant radiotherapy and concurrent chemoradiotherapy. Progression-free survival was also significantly shorter in the AC-RT/CCRT group compared to the AC-CT group (P = 0.026). CONCLUSIONS: Adjuvant radiotherapy and concurrent chemoradiotherapy may be less effective for patients with adeno/adenosquamous carcinoma than for those with squamous cell carcinoma. Adjuvant systemic chemotherapy may be beneficial for adeno/adenosquamous carcinoma and further studies are warranted.
27677565	Improved Functional Results After Minimally Invasive Esophagectomy: Intrathoracic Versus Cervical Anastomosis.	BACKGROUND: Both cervical esophagogastric anastomosis (CEA) and intrathoracic esophagogastric anastomosis (IEA) are used to restore gastrointestinal integrity following minimally invasive esophagectomy (MIE). No prospective randomized data on functional outcome, postoperative morbidity, and mortality between these techniques are currently available. METHODS: A comparison was conducted including all consecutive patients with esophageal carcinoma of the distal esophagus or gastroesophageal junction undergoing MIE with CEA or MIE with IEA from October 2009 to July 2014 in 3 high-volume esophageal cancer centers. Functional outcome, postoperative morbidity, and mortality were analyzed. RESULTS: MIE with CEA was performed in 146 patients and MIE with IEA in 210 patients. The incidence of recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy was 14.4% after CEA and 0% after IEA (p < 0.001). Dysphagia, dumping, and regurgitation were reported less frequently after IEA compared with CEA (p < 0.05). Dilatation of benign strictures occurred in 43.8% after CEA and this was 6.2% after IEA (p < 0.001). If a benign stricture was identified, it was dilated a median of 4 times in the CEA group and only once in the IEA group (p < 0.001). Anastomotic leakage for which reoperation was required occurred in 8.2% after CEA and in 11.4% after IEA (not significant). Median ICU stay, hospital stay, in-hospital mortality, 30-day mortality, and 90-day mortality were similar between the groups (not significant). CONCLUSIONS: MIE with IEA was associated with better functional results than MIE with CEA with less dysphagia, less benign anastomotic strictures requiring fewer dilatations, and a lower incidence of recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy. Other postoperative morbidity and mortality did not differ between the groups.
27677098	Good performance of p16/ki-67 dual-stained cytology for surveillance of women treated for high-grade CIN.	Women treated for high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) are at risk of recurrent CIN Grade 2 or worse (rCIN2+). Currently, posttreatment monitoring is performed using cytology or cytology/high-risk (hr)HPV cotesting. This study aimed to evaluate the performance of p16/Ki-67 dual-stained cytology (p16/Ki-67) for posttreatment monitoring. Three hundred and twenty-three women treated for high-grade CIN in the SIMONATH study underwent close surveillance by cytology, hrHPV and DNA methylation marker testing up to 12 months posttreatment. Histological endpoints were ascertained by colposcopy with biopsy at 6 and/or 12 months. p16/Ki-67 dual-staining was performed on residual liquid-based cytology samples obtained at, or shortly before biopsy collection. Clinical performance estimates of cytology, hrHPV, p16/Ki-67 testing and combinations thereof for the detection of rCIN2+ were determined and compared to each other. Sensitivity of p16/Ki-67 for rCIN2+ (69.2%) was nonsignificantly lower than that of cytology (82.1%; ratio 0.84, 95% CI: 0.71-1.01), but significantly lower than that of hrHPV testing (84.6%; ratio 0.82, 95% CI: 0.68-0.99). Specificity of p16/Ki-67 for rCIN2+ (90.4%) was significantly higher compared to both cytology (70.8%; ratio 1.28, 95% CI: 1.19-1.37) and hrHPV testing (76.2%; ratio 1.19, 95% CI: 1.12-1.26). Overall, hrHPV testing showed very high sensitivity, along with a good specificity. When considering cotesting, combined p16/Ki-67/hrHPV testing showed rCIN2+ sensitivity comparable to cytology/hrHPV cotesting (87.2% vs. 89.7%; ratio 0.97, 95% CI: 0.92-1.03), but with significantly increased specificity (74.2% vs. 58.1%; ratio 1.28, 95% CI: 1.19-1.38). Thus, when considered in combination with hrHPV, p16/Ki-67 might be an attractive approach for surveillance of women treated for high-grade CIN.
27673689	A Multi-Institutional Feasibility Study on the Use of Automated Screening Systems for Quality Control Rescreening of Cervical Cytology.	OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of the automated screening system FocalPoint for cervical cytology quality control (QC) rescreening. False-negative rates (FNRs) were evaluated by a multi-institutional retrospective study. STUDY DESIGN: Cervical cytology slides that had already been reported as negative for intraepithelial lesion or malignancy (NILM) were chosen arbitrarily for FocalPoint rescreening. Slides stratified into the highest 15% probability of being abnormal were rescreened by a cytotechnologist. The slides that were abnormal were reevaluated by a cytopathologist to be false negatives. RESULTS: Rescreening of 12,000 slides, i.e. 9,000 conventional slides and 3,000 liquid-based cytology (LBC) slides, was performed; 9,826 (7,393 conventional and 2,433 LBC) were satisfactory for FocalPoint (2,174 were determined unsatisfactory) and those within the highest 15% of probability (1,496, i.e. 1,123 conventional and 373 LBC) were rescreened. As a result, 117 (96 conventional and 21 LBC) were determined as abnormal (other than NILM) and the FNR was 1.19%. Among these 117 slides, 40 (35 conventional and 5 LBC) were determined as high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion and greater (HSIL+). CONCLUSION: Of 117 (1.19%) abnormal slides detected, 40 (0.41%) were determined to be HSIL+. This result suggests that FocalPoint is effective for QC rescreening of cervical cytology.
27672216	HPV self-sampling in CIN2+ detection: sensitivity and specificity of different RLU cut-off of HC2 in specimens from 786 women.	AIMS: Mortality for cervical cancer varies between the different regions of the world, with high rates in low-income countries where screening programmes are not present and organised. However, increasing screening coverage is still a priority in all countries: one way to do that is to base screening on self-sampled screening. The success of a self-sampling screening strategy depends on capacity to recruit unscreened women, on the performance and acceptability of the device and on the clinical performance of the high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) test. METHODS: This study based on 786 enrolled women investigates the best cut-off value of Hybrid Capture 2 HPV test (HC2) for self-sampled specimens in terms of sensitivity and specificity. RESULTS: In this population, we found that the sensitivity and the specificity for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or more detection of HC2 performed on self-sampled specimens were 82.5% and 82.8%, respectively considering the relative light units (RLU) cut-off value of 1. Increasing the cut-off value the sensitivity decreases and the specificity raises and the best area under the curve for the RLU cut-off value is 1. CONCLUSIONS: Our results confirm that the cut-off value of 1 suggested by Qiagen for PreservCyt specimen is the best cut-off value also for self-sampled specimens.
27671150	Cervical lymph node metastases of squamous cell carcinoma of unknown origin: the diagnostic value of FDG PET/CT and clinical outcome.	FDG PET/CT is perceived as a valuable diagnostic tool in addition to the standard diagnostic workup for patients with isolated neck lymph nodes of squamous cell carcinoma of unknown primary (SCCUP). For patients with SCCUP intended for primary radiotherapy, we hypothesize that the previously reported FDG PET/CT detection rates are too high. From 2008 to 2015, 30 SCCUP patients were examined with FDG PET/CT. The objective of the FDG PET/CT examination was twofold: (1) improve the radiotherapy target definition, and (2) identify the primary cancer. Before the FDG PET/CT, the patients had been through a standard workup consisting of CT of the neck and chest, examination with flexible endoscopy with patient awake, panendoscopy and examination under general anesthesia, tonsillectomy and sometimes blind sampling biopsies, and MRI (floor of the mouth). All FDG PET/CTs were performed applying a flat table, head support and fixation mask as part of the radiotherapy treatment planning. Diagnostic CT with contrast was an integrated part of the PET/CT examination. Only 1/30 patients (cancer of the vallecula) had their primary cancer detected by FDG PET/CT. In addition, a non-biopsied patient with high uptake in the ipsilateral palatine tonsil was included, giving a detection rate of </=7 % (95 % CI 2-21 %). In this retrospective study, we found that the FDG PET/CT detection rate of the primary for SCCUP patients is lower than previously reported. It is questionable whether FDG PET/CT is necessary for these patients when improved, advanced workup is available.
27669672	Poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix with sarcomatoid differentiation: Report of a case with cytohistological correlation.	Sarcomatoid squamous cell carcinoma (SSCC) of the uterine cervix is a rare malignancy with uncertain pathogenesis and aggressive clinical behavior. The diagnosis of this tumor poses a challenge to the cytopathologist since accurate diagnosis is based on identification of two malignant components, that is, epithelial and sarcomatoid. Most cases usually lack the sarcomatoid component on Papanicolaou test (Pap test). Therefore, a poorly differentiated carcinoma or malignant neoplasm is the most often rendered diagnosis. To date, less than 20 cases have been reported. Most of these cases were diagnosed by histopathologic findings. To our knowledge, cytomorphologic findings of SSCC on a liquid-based Pap test, with utility of cell block sections, in recognition of the two components of tumor, with follow-up histopathologic correlation have not been described. A case of SSCC occurring in a 57-year-old postmenopausal woman, describing the cytologic features on a liquid-based Pap-test, histopathologic findings of subsequent cervical biopsy, differential diagnosis, and role of ancillary studies are illustrated and discussed.

27668541	Evaluation of the antiproliferative activity of 2-amino thiophene derivatives against human cancer cells lines.	In spite of great progress in understanding cancer biology, current therapeutic procedures remain unsatisfactory. Chemotherapy is often followed by secondary effects with cellular toxicity negatively affecting the results. The discovery and development of new safe and efficient antitumor agents is necessary. Derivatives of 2-amino thiophene have been a topic of constant investigation due to their versatile synthetic applicability and broad spectrum of biological applications; among which are antifungal and antiproliferative activity shown in prior studies of our group. In the current study, compounds 6CN09, 6CN10, 6CN12, 6CN14, 7CN09 and 7CN11 were analyzed as to antiproliferative effect in human cells of cervical adenocarcinoma (HeLa), human pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PANC-1) and mice fibroblasts (3T3), which were exposed to the compounds in concentrations of 5, 10, 25 and 50muM during 24 and 48h. They were submitted to MTT assay. In order to elucidate the action mechanism of antitumor thiophene derivatives flow cytometry was performed to evaluate cell death and cell cycle analysis. The results showed that thiophene derivatives demonstrated great antiproliferative potential in the HeLa and PANC-1 cell lines when compared with the control, and the percentage of cell proliferation inhibition approximated or was higher than the standard drug used; doxorubicin (Dox). In highlight were the derivatives 6CN14 and 7CN09 that showed greater efficiency in the antiproliferative evaluation. Further, all compounds had a protective effect on the non-tumor 3T3 cell line. The flow cytometry analysis showed few cells in apoptosis in both the HeLa and PANC-1 lines, although the compounds interfered with the progression of the cell cycle, and avoided cell growth and multiplication in the HeLa tumor line. These thiophene derivatives demonstrated cytostatic and antiproliferative effects and may be considered as promising molecular candidates for anticancer drugs.
27665472	Fyn-related kinase expression predicts favorable prognosis in patients with cervical cancer and suppresses malignant progression by regulating migration and invasion.	AIM: To investigate expression pattern, clinical significance and potential roles of fyn related kinase (FRK) in cervical cancer. METHODS: Expression of FRK protein and mRNA in 100 pairs of cervical cancer and matched non-cancerous tissue samples were detected by Western blot, immunohistochemistry and quantitative PCR, respectively. Statistical analyses were performed to evaluate associations of FRK protein expression with various clinicopathologic features and patients' prognosis. The effects of FRK on cell migration and invasion were examined using in vitro migration and invasion assays, respectively. RESULTS: Weak/negative immunostaining of FRK protein was observed in 86 (86.00%) of 100 cervical cancer tissues. Low FRK expression was significantly associated with several aggressive clinicopathologic features of cervical cancer, such as higher International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetric stage (P=0.01), the presence of lymph node metastasis (P=0.01) and recurrence (P=0.02). In addition, the survival analysis showed that cervical cancer patients with low FRK expression often had shorter overall survival than those with high FRK expression. The multivariate analysis also identified FRK expression as an independent prognostic factor of cervical cancer. Functionally, the enforced expression of FRK could efficiently inhibit cell migration and invasion of cervical cancer cells, but the knockdown of FRK dramatically enhanced cell migration and invasion. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that loss of FRK protein may be implicated into the tumorigenesis and cell motility of human cervical cancer. More importantly, FRK expression may function as a promising prognostic marker of this malignancy, highlighting its potentials as a candidate target for gene therapy.
27664393	Improving outcomes for older women with gynaecological malignancies.	The incidence of most gynaecological malignancies rises significantly with increasing age. With an ageing population, the proportion of women over the age of 65 with cancer is expected to rise substantially over the next decade. Unfortunately, survival outcomes are much poorer in older patients and evidence suggests that older women with gynaecological cancers are less likely to receive current standard of care treatment options. Despite this, older women are under-represented in practice changing clinical studies. The evidence for efficacy and tolerability is therefore extrapolated from a younger; often more fit population and applied to in every day clinical practice to older patients with co-morbidities. There has been significant progress in the development of geriatric assessment in oncology to predict treatment outcomes and tolerability however there is still no clear evidence that undertaking a geriatric assessment improves patient outcomes. Clinical trials focusing on treating older patients are urgently required. In this review, we discuss the evidence for treatment of gynaecological cancers as well as methods of assessing older patients for therapy. Potential biomarkers of ageing are also summarised.
27663920	Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Infection and HPV Vaccination: Assessing the Level of Knowledge among Students of the University of Medicine and Pharmacy of Tirgu Mures, Romania.	Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, a causative factor for cervical cancer, remains a topic of great interest. About 80% of sexually active women are at risk of acquiring an HPV infection at some point in life, the peak incidence of infection having been identified in young women. The aim of the study was to assess the knowledge and attitudes of medical students about sexually transmitted diseases, HPV infection, HPV vaccinations, and student sexual behavior. A transversal study was conducted using a questionnaire on students on the 1st and 6th year at the Faculty of Medicine of Tirgu Mures University, Romania. The study resulted in 522 fully completed questionnaires. The percentage of students who had heard about HPV was 82.1% in the 1st year and 99.1% in the 6th year of medical school, but the level of knowledge was different: 62% of senior students had a good or very good level of knowledge, whereas 55.1% of first year students had little knowledge on the topic. About 75% of 6th year students would vaccinate their child against HPV, compared with only 52.4% of 1st year students (P<0.001). The level of knowledge about HPV infection among students in their first year of medical school is rather low, significantly lower compared to 6th year students, which suggests acquiring some basic information in this area since the first year of college or even high school.
27662486	Knockdown of Tripartite-59 (TRIM59) Inhibits Cellular Proliferation and Migration in Human Cervical Cancer Cells.	The tripartite motif (TRIM) family of proteins is a class of highly conservative proteins that have been implicated in multiple processes. TRIM59, one member of the TRIM family, has now received recognition as a key regulator in the development and progression of human diseases. However, its role in human tumorigenesis has remained largely unknown. In this study, the effects of TRIM59 expression on cell proliferation and migration were investigated in human cervical cancer cells. The expression of TRIM59 in clinical cervical cancer tissues and cervical cancer cells was initially determined by RT-PCR and Western blot. Specific shRNA against TRIM59 was then employed to knock down the expression of TRIM59 in cervical cancer lines HeLa and SiHa. The effects of TRIM59 knockdown on cell proliferation was assessed by MTT assay and colony formation assay. Transwell assay was conducted to reveal cell migration and invasion abilities before and after TRIM59 knockdown. Our results showed that the expression of TRIM59 was significantly elevated in cervical cancers. Knockdown of TRIM59 significantly inhibited cell proliferation and colony formation as well as cell migration and invasion abilities in cervical cancer HeLa and SiHa cells. Cell cycle progression analysis showed that TRIM59-depleted cells preferred to accumulate in the S phase. These data suggest that TRIM59 is a potential target that promotes the progression of cervical cancer.
27651839	Molecular Pap smear: HPV genotype and DNA methylation of ADCY8, CDH8, and ZNF582 as an integrated biomarker for high-grade cervical cytology.	BACKGROUND: The Pap smear has remained the foundation for cervical cancer screening for over 70 years. With advancements in molecular diagnostics, primary high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV) screening has recently become an accepted stand-alone or co-test with conventional cytology. However, both diagnostic tests have distinct limitations. The aim of this study was to determine the association between HPV genotypes and cellular epigenetic modifications in three grades of cervical cytology for screening biomarker discovery. METHODS: This prospective, cross-sectional study used residual liquid-based cytology samples for HPV genotyping and epigenetic analysis. Extracted DNA was subjected to parallel polymerase chain reactions using three primer sets (MY09/11, FAP59/64, E6-E7 F/B) for HPV DNA amplification. HPV+ samples were genotyped by DNA sequencing. Promoter methylation of four candidate tumor suppressor genes (adenylate cyclase 8 (ADCY8), cadherin 8, type 2 (CDH8), MGMT, and zinc finger protein 582 (ZNF582)) out of 48 genes screened was quantified by bisulfite-pyrosequencing of genomic DNA. Independent validation of methylation profiles was performed by analyzing data from cervical cancer cell lines and clinical samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). RESULTS: Two hundred seventy-seven quality cytology samples were analyzed. HPV was detected in 31/100 (31 %) negative for intraepithelial lesion or malignancy (NILM), 95/100 (95 %) low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL), and 71/77 (92 %) high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) samples. The proportion of IARC-defined carcinogenic HPV types in sequenced samples correlated with worsening grade: NILM 7/29 (24 %), LSIL 53/92 (58 %), and HSIL 65/70 (93 %). Promoter methylation of ADCY8, CDH8, and ZNF582 was measured in 170 samples: NILM (N = 33), LSIL (N = 70), and HSIL (N = 67) also correlated with worsening grade. Similar hypermethylation patterns were found in cancer cell lines and TCGA samples. The combination of four biomarkers, i.e., HPV genotype and three-gene promoter methylation, predicted HSIL (AUC 0.89) better than HPV alone (AUC 0.74) by logistic regression and probabilistic modeling. CONCLUSIONS: HPV genotype and DNA methylation of ADCY8, CDH8, and ZNF582 are correlated with cytological grade. Collectively, these biomarkers may serve as a molecular classifier of Pap smears.
27650915	Bidirectional Approach of Video-Assisted Neck Surgery (BAVANS): Endoscopic complete central node dissection with craniocaudal view for treatment of thyroid cancer.	INTRODUCTION: Endoscopic thyroidectomy is a well-established surgical technique that is mainly performed for benign thyroid disease. We considered that endoscopic surgery could also be widely indicated for the treatment of thyroid cancer. We herein describe our new bidirectional approach of video-assisted neck surgery (BAVANS) for complete central node dissection in endoscopic thyroid cancer surgery. METHODS: BAVANS involves two different directional pathways to the cervical lesion. Before lymph node dissection, we perform endoscopic thyroidectomy via a conventional gasless precordial or axillary approach. After thyroidectomy, the surgeon repositions by the head of the patient and inserts three ports in front of the upper neck lesion in the submandibular area to approach the paratracheal lesion from an overhead-to-caudal direction. RESULTS: BAVANS allows for an excellent craniocaudal view and easy access to the peritracheal lymph nodes. Sixteen patients with papillary thyroid cancer underwent BAVANS and progressed satisfactorily after surgery. Of those patients, eight underwent total or near total thyroidectomy, and five patients underwent bilateral central node dissection. The average number of retrieved lymph nodes with unilateral central node dissection was nine, which was higher than that achieved with conventional open surgery. All patients began oral intake within 5 h after surgery. Postoperative Horner syndrome occurred in one patient. No other complications were noted. CONCLUSIONS: BAVANS is a very effective surgical procedure that many endoscopic surgeons can perform safely and easily. It has both a cosmetic advantage and excellent curability in endoscopic thyroid cancer surgery.
27650602	Guidance on liquid-based cytology system conversion training: a secondary publication.	National cervical screening programmes are considering a move to HPV primary screening. HPV testing requires the cervical sample to be placed in liquid based cytology (LBC) media and the triage cytology test will be carried out using LBC preparations. The resources required for conversion training from conventional smears to LBC should not be underestimated as errors can be made without the use of a structured training plan and monitoring of performance. In the UK, many labs have converted between the two main LBC technologies, Thinprep and Surepath. The same logic apples: all staff including primary screeners and cytopathologists must undergo a structured conversion course with clear and measurable outcomes to ensure the competence of all staff before going "live" with the new technology. It is expected that conversion training will take approximately 39 hrs and a minimum of 95% high grade sensitivity and 70% specificity must be achieved.
27650600	Cytology training in the UK: a training centre prospective.	Training in both cervical and non-gynaecological cytology in the UK has never faced a more challenging environment. A national reconfiguration of cervical cytology services has focussed resources on large centres and damaged the traditional links and overlapping roles within non-gynaecological cytology. The UK is now at significant risk of falling behind most European countries in the use of non-gynaecological cytology. The UK currently has five training centres which are approved by the NHS Screening programme for training in cervical cytology; the planned introduction of HPV primary screening and the subsequent dramatic reduction in cervical cytology workload will increase pressure on the remaining training schools. Funding is variable across the country as is the degree of diversification that training schools have undertaken to try to ensure a viable future. It is vital for the future of cytology in the UK that the strong network of training schools remain to ensure the quality of the laboratory service as the UK moves towards HrHPV primary screening. There is no doubt that the training school roles will change and new technology embraced to deliver training fit for the changing role of cytology in healthcare but this will require funding and recognition of the vital role the training centres play in the delivery of high quality training in both cervical and non-gynaecological cytology.
27647799	Excellent analytical and clinical performance of a dry self-sampling device for human papillomavirus detection in an urban Chinese referral population.	AIM: To evaluate the analytical and clinical effectiveness of cervicovaginal self-sampling with a dry sampling device (Evalyn Brush) for high-risk human papillomavirus (hr-HPV) testing and detection of cervical disease. METHODS: The study population consisted of 101 patients from a large gynecological outpatient clinic in Shanghai referred for abnormal cervical screening results and 101 women without cervical lesions. Self-samples obtained in the clinic and physician-collected cervical specimens (reference) were stored at -20 degrees C for 16-18 weeks and then transferred to 20 ml of ThinPrep medium and tested for hr-HPV using a multiplex real time polymerase chain reaction assay. All women had a colposcopic examination with a Pap smear and directed or random biopsies. RESULTS: High risk-HPV was detected in 92 patients (45.5%) with the self-collected cervicovaginal specimens and in 93 (46.0%) with the physician-collected cervical specimens, resulting in an agreement of 97.5% and a Kappa of 0.95 (95% confidence interval 0.91-0.99). Among all of the included women, 46 (22.8%) had cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 or worse (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 3+). Hr-HPV was found in 43 of these patients (93.5%) with self-sampling and in 44 (95.7%) with the physician-collected specimens. CONCLUSIONS: Self-collected dry cervicovaginal samples transferred to ThinPrep medium and tested for hr-HPV using a clinically validated polymerase chain reaction assay showed very good agreement with physician-collected cervical specimens and a very high hr-HPV positivity rate for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 3 +.
27646608	Comparison of clinical outcomes of squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, and adenosquamous carcinoma of the uterine cervix after definitive radiotherapy: a population-based analysis.	PURPOSE: To evaluate the clinical outcomes in patients with International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage I to IVA squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), adenocarcinoma (AC), and adenosquamous carcinoma (ASC) of the uterine cervix after definitive radiotherapy. METHODS: Patients with a primary diagnosis of FIGO stage I-IVA SCC, AC, and ASC of the uterine cervix who had undergone definitive beam radiation with implants or isotopes between 1988 and 2013 were identified using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were performed to analyze the effect of histologic subtype on cause-specific survival (CSS) and overall survival (OS). RESULTS: A total of 8751 were identified, and 86.0, 10.6, and 3.4 % of patients were SCC, AC, and ASC, respectively. AC patients were more often well differentiated, while more patients were poorly/undifferentiated in ASC subtype. A higher percentage of AC and ASC patients were stage I, and fewer had stage III compared to SCC. Univariate and multivariate Cox analyses showed that histologic subtype was an independent prognostic factor for CSS and OS. SCC subtype had a better CSS and OS compared to AC and ASC subtype. The survival between AC and ASC had no significant difference. The impact of the histologic subtype on CSS and OS was not affected by FIGO stage and the year of diagnosis. CONCLUSION: AC and ASC subtypes are independent prognostic factors for cervical cancer patients treated with definitive radiotherapy. AC and ASC subtypes are associated with poor survival outcomes than those with SCC.
27646207	Vertically transmitted HPV-dependent squamous cell carcinoma of the external auditory canal : Case report of a child.	BACKGROUND: There is much evidence that high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) plays a causative role in a subset of head and neck squamous cell cancer (HNSCC) in adults. HPV-positive tumors behave differently even in their response to treatment and are therefore a distinct subset. Both HPV-positive and HPV-negative tumors of the head and neck region are usually in the domain of adults and cases in children are rare; thus when a 2year-old child was diagnosed with this cancer in the external auditory canal, an in-depth assessment of the tumor was considered necessary. CASE REPORT: A 2year-old girl was born to a HPV-positive mother who was diagnosed with cervical cancer during pregnancy. The child was delivered by caesarean section and the mother died of her cancer 7 months after delivery. After the diagnosis of locally invasive HPV-positive squamous cell cancer of the external auditory canal, the child was treated surgically, and with chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Full remission was obtained lasting up to 325 weeks since treatment was started, resulting in over 6 years of disease-free survival. CONCLUSION: This is the first case of advanced, HPV-related HNSCC in a 2year-old child, in whom the tumor was located in the external auditory canal and who made a dramatic recovery after treatment with nonradical surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy. The child has currently been disease free for 6 years. This case supports the observation that HPV-related HNSCC tumors appear to respond favorably to treatment despite the patient's young age and the clinically advanced stage of the tumor.
27644678	Prevalence and Risk Assessment of Cervical Cancer Screening by Papanicolaou Smear and Visual Inspection with Acetic Acid for Pregnant Women at a Thai Provincial Hospital.	BACKGROUND: Cervical cancer is the second most common in Thailand, but the mortality rate may be rising yearly. It is a cancer that can be prevented by early screening for precancerous lesions, several methods being available. OBJECTIVE: To identify the prevalence of abnormal Papanicolaou (Pap) smears and lesions with visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA) in pregnant women and assess risk factors for this group. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective study was performed at Prapokklao Hospital, Thailand during April-July 2016. All pregnant women of gestational age between 12-36 weeks who attended an antenatal clinic were recruited. All participants were screened for cervical cancer by Pap smear and VIA. If results of one or both were abnormal, colposcopic examination was evaluated by gynecologic oncologist. RESULTS: A total of 414 pregnant women were recruited. Prevalence of abnormal Pap smear and VIA were 6.0 and 6.7 percent, respectively. The most common abnormal Pap smear was low grade intraepithelial lesion (LSIL, 44%). Factors associated with abnormal Pap smear in pregnant women were low BMI, multiple partners and being a government officer. In pregnancy, Pap smear had higher sensitivity and specificity than VIA for detection of precancerous cervical lesion. Patients with young coitarche or more than 25 years of active sexual activity were high risk groups. CONCLUSIONS: Prevalence of abnormal Pap smear and VIA in pregnant women was 6.0 and 6.7 percent, respectively. Factors associated with abnormal Pap smear were coitarche, years of sexual activity, low BMI, multiple partners and being a government officer.
27644676	Promoter Methylation and Relative mRNA Expression of the p16 Gene in Cervical Cancer in North Indians.	BACKGROUND: Cervical carcinoma is one of the main causes of mortality in women worldwide as well as in India. It occurs as a result of various molecular events that develop from the combined influences of an individual's genetic predisposition and external agents such as smoking and menstrual hygiene, for example. However, infection with human papillomavirus (HPV) is the established major risk factor. The aim of the current study was to investigate p16 CpG island methylation and establish any correlation with mRNA expression in a north Indian population. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed 196 woman volunteers out of which 98 were cases and 98 healthy controls. For the analysis of methylation pattern, DNA extracted from blood samples was modified with a bisulfate kit and used as template for methylation specific PCR (MSP). Quantitative real-time PCR (QRT-PCR) was performed to check mRNA expression. RESULTS: Correlation between methylation status of p16 gene and poor menstrual hygiene was significant (p=0.006), high parity cases showed methylation of p16 gene (p=0.031) with increased risk up to 1.86 times for cervical cancer and smoking was a strong risk factor associated with cervical cancer. We analyzed methylation pattern and found 60.3% methylation in cases with low mRNA expression level (0.014) as compared to controls (1.24). It was also observed that promoter methylation of p16 gene was significantly greater in FIGO stage III. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that p16 methylation plays an important role in cervical cancer in the north Indian population and its methylation decreases mRNA expression. It can be used as an important and consistent blood biomarker in cervical cancer patients.
27644654	Does Microinvasive Adenocarcinoma of Cervix Have Poorer Treatment Outcomes than Microinvasive Squamous Cell Carcinoma?	BACKGROUND: To compare the pathological findings and oncologic outcomes of stage IA cervical carcinoma patients, between adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma cases. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 151 medical records of stage IA cervical carcinoma patients undergoing primary surgical treatment during 2006-2013 were reviewed. Information from pathological diagnosis and recurrence rates were compared with descriptive statistical analysis. The Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazards model were used for survival analysis. RESULTS: The median age was 48.9 years. There was no significant difference in rates of lymph node, parametrium, uterine, vaginal, or ovarian metastasis, when comparing adenocarcinoma with squamous cell carcinoma. Overall recurrence rates of adenocarcinoma (5.7%) and squamous cell carcinoma (2.6%) were not statistically significant different, even when stratified by stage. When comparing progression free survival with squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma had an HR of 0.448 (0.073-2.746), p=0.386. CONCLUSIONS: Microinvasive adenocarcinoma of cervix has similar rate of extracervical involvement and oncologic outcomes to squamous cell carcinoma.
27644649	Human Papillomavirus Infection and its Vaccines: Knowledge and Attitudes of Primary Health Clinic Nurses in Kelantan, Malaysia.	BACKGROUND: Cervical cancer though preventable is still the leading cause of cancer death among women secondary to breast cancer. Persistent infection with HPV has been causally linked to the disease. A school based HPV vaccination program was introduced in late 2010 in Malaysia and nurse support is essential for its success. OBJECTIVES: To determine nurses knowledge and attitudes about HPV infection and its vaccines, and factors associated with their knowledge. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted among nurses working at primary health clinics in Kelantan from mid-June till the end of July 2014. Its involved 330 nurses selected through multistage random sampling. A validated self-administered questionnaire consisting of 11 items for the knowledge domain and eight items for the attitude domain was used. RESULTS: The response rate of the study was 93.7%. The mean knowledge and mean attitude (SD) scores were 5.37 (1.76) and 29.8 (3.51) respectively. Only 24% knew that HPV is the most common sexually transmitted infection and 67% correctly answered that Gardasil vaccine can protect against four types of HPV. Nearly 60% of participants wrongly answered that HPV vaccines cannot be offered to sexually active women. Likewise, 70.9% participants were not aware that HPV vaccine may be appropriate for females aged 9 through 26 years. Though 90% of participants believed that the vaccine is safe, nearly half of them were unsure about efficacy. From multiple linear regression analysis, among the factors tested only participant's level of education showed a statistically significant association with the HPV knowledge score (<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates nurses have favorable attitudes towards HPV vaccination; however they have significant knowledge deficit and major misunderstanding in critical knowledge items. Among the factors tested, nursing qualification is the only factor that is significantly associated with the nurses knowledge score.
27644643	Significant Efficacy of Additional Concurrent Chemotherapy with Radiotherapy for Postoperative Cervical Cancer with Risk Factors: a Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.	BACKGROUND: Whether concurrent chemotherapy treatment is superior to radiotherapy alone as an adjuvant regimen for postoperative cervical carcinoma with risk factors remains controversial. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A literature search strategy was used to examine Pubmed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, the China National Knowledge Internet Web, the Chinese Biomedical Database and the Wanfang Database. Article reference lists and scientific meeting abstracts were also screened. Controlled trials comparing concurrent chemoradiotherapy versus radiotherapy alone in postoperative cervical cancer were included. The methodological quality of non-randomized controlled trials was evaluated using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Randomized controlled studies were evaluated with the Cochrane handbook. A meta-analysis was performed with RevMan 5.3. RESULTS: A total of 1,073 patients from 11 clinical trials were analysed, with 582 patients in the concurrent chemoradiotherapy group and 491 patients in the radiotherapy group. Hazard ratios (HR) of 0.47 (95% CI 0.31-0.72) and 0.50 (95% CI 0.35-0.72) were observed for overall survival and progression-free survival, indicating a benefit from the additional use of concurrent chemotherapy. Subgroup analyses demonstrated that cervical cancer with high risk factors significantly benefitted from concurrent chemotherapy when examining overall survival (HR 0.44, 95% CI 0.28-0.67) and progression-free survival (HR 0.48, 95% CI 0.33-0.70), but patients with intermediate risk factors showed no benefit from concurrent chemotherapy in overall survival (HR 1.72, 95% CI 0.28-10.41) and progression-free survival (HR 1.09, 95% CI 0.19-6.14). No significant differences were observed for grade 3-4 anaemia (risk ratio (RR) 3.87, 95% CI 0.69-21.84), grade 3-4 thrombocytopenia (RR 3.04, 95% CI 0.88- 10.58), grade 3-4 vomiting or nausea (RR 1.71, 95% CI 0.27-10.96), or grade 3-4 diarrhoea (RR 1.40, 95% CI 0.69-2.83). Significant differences were observed for grade 3-4 neutropenia in favour of the radiotherapy group (RR 7.23, 95% CI 3.94-13.26). CONCLUSIONS: Concurrent chemoradiotherapy improves survival in postoperative cervical cancer cases with high risk factors but not in those with intermediate risk factors.
27644635	Barriers to Breast and Cervical Cancer Screening in Singapore: a Mixed Methods Analysis.	BACKGROUND: In order to increase breast and cervical cancer screening uptake in Singapore, women's perceived barriers to screening need to be identified and overcome. Using data from both focus groups and surveys, we aimed to assess perceived barriers and motivations for breast and cervical cancer screening. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted 8 focus groups with 64 women, using thematic analysis to identify overarching themes related to women's attitudes towards screening. Based on recurring themes from focus groups, several hypotheses regarding potential barriers and motivations to screen were generated and tested through a national survey of 801 women aged 25-64. RESULTS: Focus group participants had misconceptions related to screening, believing that the procedures were painful. Cost was an issue, as well as efficacy and fatalism. CONCLUSIONS: By identifying barriers to and motivators for screening through a mixed-method design that has both nuance and external validity, this study offers valuable suggestions to policymakers to improve breast and cervical cancer screening uptake in Singapore.
27644619	Purification of Lovastatin from Aspergillus terreus (KM017963) and Evaluation of its Anticancer and Antioxidant Properties.	Cervical cancer is the second most common malignancy in women worldwide and thus one of the leading causes of mortality in women. Lovastatin, a non polar, anticholesterol drug has previously been reported to exert antitumour activity in vitro. In the present study, lovastatin from Aspergillus terreus (KM017963) was purified by adsorption chromatography and evaluated for its anticancer and anti-oxidant properties with a human cervical cancer cell line (HeLa). Growth inhibitory and proapoptotic effects of purified lovastatin on HeLa cells were investigated by determining its influence on cell numbers, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), DNA fragmentation and antioxidant properties in terms of hydroxy radical scavenging effects as well as levels of total reduced glutathione. Cell cycle analysis by ow cytometry (propidium iodide staining) confirmed induction of apoptotic cell death and revealed cell cycle arrest in the G0/G1 phase. The results of the study give leads for the anticancer effects of lovastatin and its potential usefulness in the chemotherapy of cervical cancer.
27644614	Determinants of Cervical Cancer Screening Uptake in Kurdish Women Living in Western Iran, 2014.	BACKGROUND: Cervical cancer is the second most common cancer among females across the world. It is a preventable cancer and early detection is very feasible. This study aimed to identify which women characteristics are potentially associated with and may have an important influence on the uptake of cervical cancer screening in Kurdish women living in the west of Iran.. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross sectional study was conducted in late 2014. A random sample of women aged 40 years and above without history of cervical cancer and identi ed as Kurdish background were selected and interviewed by two trained interviewers. Information about sociodemographic and reproductive factors, history of diseases, and cervical screening was collected using a questionnaire and women who had undergone a hysterectomy were excluded. Univariate analyses were used to describe the general characteristics of the study population. Multivariable logistic regression models with self-reported screening history were used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) with 95% con dence intervals (CI). Significance was considered at the 5% level. RESULTS: A total of 561 women were included in this study (mean age 43.6+/-5.17 years) participation in cervical screening at least once was about 32%. Cervical screening uptake percentage was significantly lower among people over 60 years of age (adjusted OR= 0.26, 95% CI: 0.11-0.64), and those who were illiterate (OR=0.41 95% CI: 0.23-0.73) and post-menopausal (OR= 0.56, 95% CI: 0.35- 0.91). Women with </=1 child were less likely to report a Pap test (adjusted OR=.43 95%CI: 0.13-1.37) Cervical screening uptake was higher among women with health insurance (OR= 2.31, 95% CI: 1.50- 3.56). CONCLUSIONS: Cervical screening participation in this study was low compared to other studies in developed countries. The screening uptake was different based on age, education, parity, insurance coverage and menopausal status. It is recommended to target these groups of women in a cervical screening program.
27644600	HPV and Cervical Cancer Epidemiology - Current Status of HPV Vaccination in India.	Cervical cancer (CaCx) is the second most fatal cancer contributing to 14% of cancers in Indian females, which account for 25.4% and 26.5% of the global burden of CaCx prevalence and mortality, respectively. Persistent infection with high-risk human papilloma virus (HPV- strains 16 and 18) is the most important risk factor for precursors of invasive CaCx. Comprehensive prevention strategies for CaCx should include screening and HPV vaccination. Three screening modalities for CaCx are cytology, visual inspection with acetic acid, and HPV testing. There is no Indian national policy on CaCx prevention, and screening of asymptomatic females against CaCx is practically non-existent. HPV vaccines can make a major breakthrough in the control of CaCx in India which has high disease load and no organized screening program. Despite the Indian Government's effort to introduce HPV vaccination in the National Immunization Program and bring down vaccine cost, challenges to implementing vaccination in India are strong such as: inadequate epidemiological evidence for disease prioritization, duration of vaccine use, parental attitudes, and vaccine acceptance. This paper reviews the current epidemiology of CaCx and HPV in India, and the current status of HPV vaccination in the country. This article stresses the need for more research in the Indian context, to evaluate interventions for CaCx and assess their applicability, success, scalability and sustainability within the constraints of the Indian health care system.
27644245	FABP5 correlates with poor prognosis and promotes tumor cell growth and metastasis in cervical cancer.	Fatty acid-binding protein 5 (FABP5) was found in our previous study to be a potential biomarker for lymph node metastasis of cervical cancer. However, the roles of FABP5 in cervical cancer remain unclear. In the present study, FABP5 expression was found to be significantly upregulated in cervical cancer tissues, and high FABP5 expression was significantly correlated with lymph node metastasis, lymphovascular space invasion, the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage, and tumor size. Moreover, FABP5 was an independent factor for poor prognosis in cervical cancer patients. Silencing of FABP5 inhibited cell proliferation, colony formation, cell migration, and invasion in vitro. Furthermore, FABP5 silencing significantly reduced tumor growth and lung metastases in a murine allograft model in vivo. In addition, FABP5 silencing decreased the expression of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) in vitro and in vivo. Collectively, these findings indicated that FABP5 plays an important role in the carcinogenesis and metastasis of cervical cancer, and FABP5 may be a novel predictor for prognostic assessment of cervical cancer patients.
27644091	Clinical significance of prophylactic central compartment neck dissection in the treatment of clinically node-negative papillary thyroid cancer patients.	BACKGROUND: Lymph nodal involvement is very common in differentiated thyroid cancer, and in addition, cervical lymph node micrometastases are observed in up to 80 % of papillary thyroid cancers. During the last decades, the role of routine central lymph node dissection (RCLD) in the treatment of papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) has been an object of research, and it is now still controversial. Nevertheless, many scientific societies and referral authors have definitely stated that even if in expert hands, RCLD is not associated to higher morbidity; it should be indicated only in selected cases. MAIN BODY: In order to better analyze the current role of prophylactic neck dissection in the surgical treatment of papillary thyroid cancers, an analysis of the most recent literature data was performed. Prophylactic or therapeutic lymph node dissection, selective, lateral or central lymph node dissection, modified radical neck dissection, and papillary thyroid cancer were used by the authors as keywords performing a PubMed database research. Literature reviews, PTCs large clinical series and the most recent guidelines of different referral endocrine societies, inhering neck dissection for papillary thyroid cancers, were also specifically evaluated. A higher PTC incidence was nowadays reported in differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) clinical series. In addition, ultrasound guided fine-needle aspiration citology allowed a more precocious diagnosis in the early phases of disease. The role of prophylactic neck dissection in papillary thyroid cancer management remains controversial especially regarding indications, approach, and surgical extension. Even if morbidity rates seem to be similar to those reported after total thyroidectomy alone, RCLD impact on local recurrence and long-term survival is still a matter of research. Nevertheless, only a selective use in high-risk cases is supported by more and more scientific data. CONCLUSIONS: In the last years, higher papillary thyroid cancer incidence and more precocious diagnoses were worldwide reported. Among endocrine and neck surgeons, there is agreement about indications to prophylactic treatment of node-negative "high-risk" patients. A recent trend toward RCLD avoiding radioactive treatment is still debated, but nevertheless, prophylactic dissections in low-risk cases should be avoided. Prospective randomized trials are needed to evaluate the benefits of different approaches and allow to drawn definitive conclusions.
27643582	Comparison of the Radiosensitizing Effect of ATR, ATM and DNA-PK Kinase Inhibitors on Cervical Carcinoma Cells.	Here, we compared the effects of inhibitors of three phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase-related kinases, ATM, ATR a DNA-PK, on radiosensitization of cervical carcinoma cells. We demonstrated that DNA-PK inhibitor NU7441 enhanced phosphorylation of Chk1 and Chk2 kinases 2 h after irradiation of HeLa cells at a dose of 8 Gy in contrast to ATM kinase inhibitor KU55933, which completely blocked the Chk2 kinase phosphorylation on threonine 68, and ATR kinase inhibitor VE-821, which blocked the Chk1 kinase phosphorylation on serine 345. Most HeLa cells were accumulated in G2 phase of the cell cycle 24 h after irradiation at a high dose of 15 Gy, which was even potentiated after adding the inhibitors NU7441 and KU55933. Compared to all other irradiated groups, inhibitor VE-821 increased the number of cells in S phase and reduced the number of cells in G2 phase 24 h after irradiation at the high dose of 15 Gy. HeLa cells entered the mitotic cycle with unrepaired DNA, which resulted in cell death and the radiosensitizing effect of VE-821. Short-term application of the inhibitors (2 h before and 30 min after the irradiation by the dose of 8 Gy) significantly decreased the colony-forming ability of HeLa cells. Using real-time monitoring of cell proliferation by the xCELLigence system we demonstrated that while the radiosensitizing effect of VE-821 (ATR inhibitor) is manifested early after the irradiation, the radiosensitizing effect of KU55933 (ATM inhibitor) and NU7441 (DNA-PK inhibitor) is only observed as late as 72 h after the irradiation.
27642473	The role of cervical mediastinoscopy in Nigerian thoracic surgical practice.	INTRODUCTION: Cervical mediastinoscopy is the gold standard for obtaining histological diagnosis of mediastinal pathology. It has been used for the staging of lung cancer as well as to determine the cause of Isolated Mediastinal Lymphadenopathy. There is very limited evidence in the literature of its use in Nigeria to assess mediastinal pathology. The aim of this study was to describe our institutional experience with cervical mediastinoscopy. METHODS: This study was a retrospective analysis of 40 patients that underwent cervical mediastinoscopy in our institution between March 2007 and February 2013. RESULTS: The indication for Cervical Mediastinoscopy was Isolated Mediastinal Lymphadenopathy in 24 patients (60%) and lung cancer staging in 16 patient (40%). The mean age of the patients was 52.7 + 15.1 years. There were 21 females (52.5%) and 19 males (47.5%). The most commonly biopsied lymph nodes were level 4 in 35 patients (87.5%) and level 7 in 21 patients (52.5%). Malignant diagnosis was made in 16 (66.7%) patients with Isolated Mediastinal Lymphadenopathy and in 13 (81.3%) patients staged for lung cancer. Hospital stay was less than 24 hours in all patients and there were no complications. CONCLUSION: Cervical Mediastinoscopy is available in Nigeria and has been performed in our institution with high diagnostic yield and no complications. Its increased use, along with the development of other mediastinal biopsy techniques is advocated to increase tissue biopsy of mediastinal pathology, especially for lung cancer and isolated mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
27642426	A rare cause of acute urinary retention in women: meatal condyloma accuminata, a case report.	Acute urinary retention in women is a rarely seen phenomenon due to pharmacological, neuromuscular, anatomical, functional and infectious causes. Human papillomaviruses causing condyloma acuminata is one of the rarely reported viral infectious cause of acute urinary retention in case reports. A 45-year-old woman with acute urinary retention was found to have a round solid lesion on external urethral meatus. Histopathological examination revealed as condyloma acuminata. Urethral condyloma can be treated by local excision as an effective method for early improvement of voiding function. Even if the genital condyloma can be locally excised, patients should be referred to the gynecologists for cervical cancer screening.
27641631	Project conducted in Hirakata to improve cervical cancer screening rates in 20-year-old Japanese: Influencing parents to recommend that their daughters undergo cervical cancer screening.	AIM: In Japan, the rate of routine cervical cancer screening is quite low, and the incidence of cervical cancer has recently been increasing. Our objective was to investigate ways to effectively influence parental willingness to recommend that their 20-year-old daughters undergo cervical cancer screening. METHODS: We targeted parents whose 20-year-old daughters were living with them. In fiscal year 2013, as usual, the daughter received a reminder postcard several months after they had received a free coupon for cervical cancer screening. In fiscal year 2014, the targeted parents received a cervical cancer information leaflet, as well as a cartoon about cervical cancer to show to their daughters, with a request that they recommend to their daughter that she undergo cervical cancer screening. The subsequent screening rates for fiscal years 2013 and 2014 were compared. RESULTS: The cervical cancer screening rate of 20-year-old women whose parents received the information packet in fiscal year 2014 was significantly higher than for the women who, in fiscal year 2013, received only a simple reminder postcard (P < 0.001). As a result, the total screening rate for 20-year-old women for the whole of the 2014 fiscal year was significantly increased over 2013 (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: For the first time, we have shown that the parents of 20-year-old daughters can be motivated to recommend that their daughters receive their first cervical cancer screening. This was achieved by sending a cervical cancer information leaflet and a cartoon about cervical cancer for these parents to show to their daughters. This method was significantly effective for improving cervical cancer screening rates.
27641071	Cervical cytological abnormalities and human papilloma virus infection in women infected with HIV in Southern India.	AIM: The aim of this study was to examine the association between CD4 count, human papilloma virus (HPV) infection, and the risk of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia among HIV-infected women. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 104 HIV-infected women attending an antiretroviral therapy clinic. They underwent Pap smear and cervical HPV DNA testing. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of HPV infection was 57.7%. HPV 16 was the commonest genotype found (38.5%); HPV 16 and 18 put together contributed to 73.3% of HPV infection; 27.5% of HIV-infected women had squamous cell abnormalities. Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia was less likely among women with CD4 count > 500/mm3 (12%) and in those without opportunistic infections (17.8%). The prevalence of high-risk HPV infection was higher in women with high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions or greater lesions (85.7%) as compared to women with normal cytology (52.1%). CONCLUSION: The high prevalence of HPV infection and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia in HIV-infected women warrants the need for regular Pap smear screening in these women and routine HPV vaccination for adolescents to reduce the burden of cervical cancer in India.
27640609	Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography for Gynecologic Malignancies.	IMPORTANCE: Positron emission tomography/Computed tomography(PET/CT) is widely used for gynecologic cancers. OBJECTIVE: To determine when PET/CT should be used for gynecologic cancers. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: PubMed was reviewed for articles on PET/CT of all gynecologic cancers. National Comprehensive Cancer Network, Society of Gynecologic Oncology, and American College of Radiology guidelines were reviewed. RESULTS: Whole-body PET/CT is useful for (1) initial staging of cervical and endometrial cancer, posttherapy assessment, radiation therapy planning, and posttreatment surveillance of cervical cancer, and (2) assessment of recurrence of cervical, endometrial, or ovarian cancer in the presence of symptoms. It is also useful for staging and recurrence of uterine sarcomas, and for staging of vulvar and vaginal cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Positron emission tomography/Computed tomography is clinically valuable for a variety of gynecologic cancers. RELEVANCE: PET/CT plays an important role in detection of initial disease and recurrence of gynecologic malignancies.
27639451	Characterization of cervical lymph-nodes using a multi-parametric and multi-modal approach for an early prediction of tumor response to chemo-radiotherapy.	PURPOSE: In the treatment of Head-and-Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC), the early prediction of residual malignant lymph nodes (LNs) is currently required. Here, we investigated the potential of a multi-modal characterization (combination of CT, T2w-MRI and DW-MRI) at baseline and at mid-treatment, based on texture analysis (TA), for the early prediction of LNs response to chemo-radiotherapy (CRT). METHODS: 30 patients with pathologically confirmed HNSCC treated with CRT were considered. All patients underwent a planning CT and two serial MR examinations (including T2w and DW images), one before and one at mid-CRT. For each patient the largest malignant LN was selected and within each LN, morphological and textural features were estimated from T2w-MRI and CT, besides a quantification of the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) from DW-MRI. After a median follow-up time of 26.6months, 19 LNs showed regional control, while 11 LNs showedregional failure at a median time of 4.6months. Linear discriminant analysis was used to test the accuracy of the image-based features in predicting the final response. RESULTS: Pre-treatment features showed higher predictive power than mid-CRT features, the ADC having the highest accuracy (80%); CT-based indices were found not predictive. When ADC was combined with TA, the classification performance increased (accuracy=82.8%). If only T2w-MRI features were considered, the best combination of pre-CRT indices and their variation reached an equivalent accuracy (81.8%). CONCLUSION: Our results may suggest that TA on T2w-MRI and ADC can be combined together to obtain a more accurate prediction of response to CRT.
27639369	Synthesis and apoptosis inducing studies of triazole linked 3-benzylidene isatin derivatives.	In our venture towards the development of effective cytotoxic agents, a panel of triazole linked 3-benzylidene isatin hybrids were synthesized and characterized by IR, 1H NMR, 13C NMR and Mass spectral analysis. All the newly synthesized target compounds were assessed against DU145 (prostate), PC-3 (prostate), MDA-MB-231 (breast), BT549 (breast), A549 (lung) and HeLa (cervical) human cancer cell lines by employing MTT assay for their cytotoxic potential. Significantly, compound Z-8l was found to be most potent amongst all the tested compounds with an IC50 value of (3.7 +/- 0.05 muM) on DU145 cells. The most active compound (Z-8l) was also tested on RWPE-1 (normal prostate) cells and was found to be safe compared to the DU145 cells. The influence of the cytotoxic compound Z-8l on the cell cycle distribution was assessed on the DU145 cell line, exhibiting a cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase. Additionally, treatment with compound Z-8l caused collapse of mitochondrial membrane potential (DPsim) in DU145 cells. Moreover, acridine orange/ethidium bromide staining, DAPI nuclear staining, DCFDA staining and annexin V binding assay confirmed that compound Z-8l can induce cell apoptosis in DU145 cells. Western blotting was performed to examine the appearance of active forms of cytochrome c, Bax, Bcl2 and PARP (Poly ADP ribose polymerase), indicator proteins of apoptosis in DU145 cells; the study confirmed the triggering of mitochondrial mediated apoptotic pathway upon exposure of compound Z-8l.
27639133	Interpretation of colposcopy in population-based cervical screening services in north-eastern Italy: an online interregional agreement study.	OBJECTIVE: An innovative web-based colposcopy quality assurance programme was implemented in population-based cervical screening services in three north-eastern Italian administrative regions with different colposcopists' training background. In this study, the levels of intra- and interregional intercolposcopist diagnostic agreement were evaluated. STUDY DESIGN: Of the 158 registered colposcopists, 125 accessed the website of the programme, logged-in, viewed a posted set of 50 digital colpophotographs selected by an expert steering committee, and classified them for the colposcopic impression, the visibility of the squamocolumnar junction, and the need for biopsy. Anonymous data were downloaded and analysed using the crude, or observed, proportion of agreement and the kappa coefficient. RESULTS: There were 113 eligible colposcopists. Overall, crude agreement on the colposcopic impression, the visibility of the squamocolumnar junction, and the need for biopsy was 0.72, 0.72, and 0.87, with kappa values of 0.60, 0.36, and 0.69, respectively. The homologous kappa values were 0.61, 0.41, and 0.69 in one region, 0.57, 0.36, and 0.69 in another, and 0.66, 0.38, and 0.74 in the third. Total intra- and interregional agreement were nearly identical, with kappa values of 0.59 and 0.60 for the colposcopic impression, 0.38 and 0.35 for the visibility of the squamocolumnar junction, and 0.69 and 0.69 for the need for biopsy. The width of 95% confidence intervals around the above kappa values was </=0.01. CONCLUSIONS: The levels of agreement varied between moderate and substantial both within and between regions. Regional differences in training background had minor effects. The interpretation of colposcopy is potentially well-reproducible.
27637965	Neuroepidemiology of cancer and treatment-related neurocognitive dysfunction in adult-onset cancer patients and survivors.	Cancer and treatment-related neurocognitive dysfunction (CRND) - impairments in aspects of cognition commonly including attention and memory, information-processing speed, and executive functioning - can negatively affect patients' and survivors' participation in routine activities of daily living and overall quality of life. CRND can be enduring, and varies in severity level. The epidemiology of CRND is not yet clearly established; reported incidence has ranged from 17% to 75% among patients and survivors of noncentral nervous system malignancies, including breast, prostate, cervical, and colorectal cancers. Progress in the development of strategies for assessing and treating CRND has been delayed by limitations in the knowledge of the precise etiology of this adverse condition, as well as the lack of sufficiently sensitive and reliable methods to determine its presence and quantify its severity. In this chapter, we present a brief description of the concept of CRND and its clinical presentation, and discuss the descriptive epidemiology, pathophysiology, risk factors, and availability of treatment interventions. This neuroepidemiologic perspective provides a framework for characterizing CRND, determining its etiology, and understanding its negative effects on routine activities of daily living, to help support the development and testing of reliable interventions to treat this deleterious condition for patients and survivors.
27636125	Assessment of Early Therapeutic Changes to Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy in Uterine Cervical Cancer Using Blood Oxygenation Level-Dependent Magnetic Resonance Imaging.	OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate blood oxygenation level-dependent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in assessing early therapeutic changes in cervical cancers to concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT). METHODS: Fifteen consecutive patients with cervical cancer treated with CCRT were evaluated with blood oxygenation level-dependent MRI at 3 T. Magnetic resonance imaging examinations were performed before treatment (preTx), 1 week after treatment (postT1) and 4 weeks after treatment (postT2). At each time, the rate of spin dephasing (R2*) values were measured in tumor and in normal uterus. RESULTS: Tumor R2* increased from preTx to postT2 (P < 0.01). In pairwise comparisons of tumor R2*, postT2 was significantly higher than preTx or postT1 (P < 0.01), whereas postT1 was not significantly different from preTx (P > 0.05). A significant difference in R2* was found between the tumors and normal uterus at preTx (P = 0.001), postT1 (P < 0.001), and postT2 (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Blood oxygenation level-dependent MRI may demonstrate early therapeutic changes of cervical cancers to CCRT.
27635667	Metastases to the parotid nodes: CT and MR imaging findings.	OBJECTIVES: To present and characterize CT and MR imaging findings of metastases to the parotid nodes. METHODS: CT (n = 10) and MR (n = 11) images from 14 patients with metastases to the parotid nodes were reviewed. The primary tumour sites were the ocular adnexa in five patients, facial skin in four patients, upper aerodigestive tract in four patients and thyroid gland in one patient. CT and MR images were evaluated with emphasis on the size and number of parotid tumours, their location in the parotid gland, the presence of associated clinically pathological cervical nodes or previous history of cervical node metastasis, margin characteristics and the presence of central necrosis. RESULTS: A total of 18 tumours were identified in 14 patients, with an average maximal cross-sectional diameter of 19 mm (7-44 mm). 12 patients had a single parotid tumour and 2 patients had unilateral multiple tumours; 12 tumours in 10 patients were located in the parotid tail, 6 tumours in 4 patients were located in the superficial lobe and no tumour was noted in the deep lobe. In the superficial lobe, four of six tumours were located in the pretragal area. Three of nine patients whose primary sites were the ocular adnexa or skin had associated clinically pathological cervical nodes. None of these patients had a previous history of cervical node metastasis. All five patients with other primary sites had associated pathological cervical nodes or a history of such. 11 tumours had well-defined margins and 7 tumours had ill-defined margins. Post-contrast images showed central necrosis in 2 of 11 tumours. CONCLUSIONS: Metastases to the parotid nodes tend to present as solitary parotid masses with two preferential sites.
27635096	Perception and risk factors for cervical cancer among women in northern Ghana.	OBJECTIVE: This study assessed the perception of risk of cervical cancer and existence of risk factors for cervical cancer based on five known risk factors among women attending the Tamale Teaching Hospital in Tamale, Ghana. METHODS: A consecutive sample of 300 women was interviewed using a semi-structured questionnaire to inquire about risk factors and perception of risk of cervical cancer. Specific risk factors that were explored included early coitarche, multiple sexual partners, polygamous relationships, history of smoking, and having a current partner who had multiple sexual partners. RESULTS: Sixty-one per cent of women reported that they had no personal risk for cervical cancer. 27% of respondents were in polygamous relationships, and of those, more than half didn't think they were at an increased risk of cervical cancer. 2 women had a total of >/= 5 sexual partners in their lifetime and neither believed they were at any risk for cervical cancer. 23% said their current partner had had at least 2 sexual partners in his lifetime, and of those, (61%) thought they were at no risk for cervical cancer. 46% of respondents reported not having any of the risk factors listed in the study. 23% of respondents reported having one risk factor while 21% had two risk factors and 11% had three or more risk factors. CONCLUSION: Women's perception of personal risk for cervical cancer is lower than their actual risk based on the five behavioural risk factors assessed and a lack of knowledge of the personal factors for the disease. FUNDING: This project was supported by NIH Research Training Grant #R25 TW009345 funded by the Fogarty International Centre, in partnership with several NIH Institutes (NIMH, NIGMS, NHLBI, OAR and OWH).
27631263	Submandibular oncocytic carcinoma: A case report and literature review.	BACKGROUND: Oncocytic carcinoma (OC) arising in the submandibular gland is an unusual malignant neoplasm, with <20 cases previously reported. The cancer is characterized by numerous morphologically abnormal mitochondria present in the cytoplasm and marked cellular pleomorphism. At its most severe, the tumor may invade into the surrounding tissues, including intravascular, lymphatic, or perineural invasion, and lead to regional nodal or distant metastasis. METHODS: The current study describes a novel OC case in a 46-year-old male, the youngest case of the review. The patient presented with a 5-month history of an intermittently painful mass. RESULTS: Following magnetic resonance imaging, excisional biopsy, hematoxylin-eosin staining, phosphotungstic acid-hematoxylin staining, and immunohistochemical examination, an OC of the submandibular gland was diagnosed. CONCLUSION: The current study summarizes the pathogenesis, diagnosis, therapeutics, and the prognosis of OC. The literature review regarding this rare disease is also presented to emphasize the lack of specific markers of OC and the risk of cervical lymph metastasis.
27631245	HIV and cancer registry linkage identifies a substantial burden of cancers in persons with HIV in India.	We utilized computerized record-linkage methods to link HIV and cancer databases with limited unique identifiers in Pune, India, to determine feasibility of linkage and obtain preliminary estimates of cancer risk in persons living with HIV (PLHIV) as compared with the general population.Records of 32,575 PLHIV were linked to 31,754 Pune Cancer Registry records (1996-2008) using a probabilistic-matching algorithm. Cancer risk was estimated by calculating standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) in the early (4-27 months after HIV registration), late (28-60 months), and overall (4-60 months) incidence periods. Cancers diagnosed prior to or within 3 months of HIV registration were considered prevalent.Of 613 linked cancers to PLHIV, 188 were prevalent, 106 early incident, and 319 late incident. Incident cancers comprised 11.5% AIDS-defining cancers (ADCs), including cervical cancer and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), but not Kaposi sarcoma (KS), and 88.5% non-AIDS-defining cancers (NADCs). Risk for any incident cancer diagnosis in early, late, and combined periods was significantly elevated among PLHIV (SIRs: 5.6 [95% CI 4.6-6.8], 17.7 [95% CI 15.8-19.8], and 11.5 [95% CI 10-12.6], respectively). Cervical cancer risk was elevated in both incidence periods (SIRs: 9.6 [95% CI 4.8-17.2] and 22.6 [95% CI 14.3-33.9], respectively), while NHL risk was elevated only in the late incidence period (SIR: 18.0 [95% CI 9.8-30.20]). Risks for NADCs were dramatically elevated (SIR > 100) for eye-orbit, substantially (SIR > 20) for all-mouth, esophagus, breast, unspecified-leukemia, colon-rectum-anus, and other/unspecified cancers; moderately elevated (SIR > 10) for salivary gland, penis, nasopharynx, and brain-nervous system, and mildly elevated (SIR > 5) for stomach. Risks for 6 NADCs (small intestine, testis, lymphocytic leukemia, prostate, ovary, and melanoma) were not elevated and 5 cancers, including multiple myeloma not seen.Our study demonstrates the feasibility of using probabilistic record-linkage to study cancer/other comorbidities among PLHIV in India and provides preliminary population-based estimates of cancer risks in PLHIV in India. Our results, suggesting a potentially substantial burden and slightly different spectrum of cancers among PLHIV in India, support efforts to conduct multicenter linkage studies to obtain precise estimates and to monitor cancer risk in PLHIV in India.
27630351	Lymphoma of the Cervix: Case Report and Review of the Literature.	BACKGROUND: Lymphoma of the uterine cervix (LUCX) is rare and may occur as a primary or secondary manifestation of this disease. Clinical and cytological presentations of LUCX vary and establishing diagnosis is often difficult. Surgery followed by radiation or chemotherapy is the mainstay of treatment. CASE REPORT: We present the case of a 73-year-old woman with recurrent pathological PAP smears of the cervix and a history of chronic lymphatic leukemia 15 years ago. Colposcopy of the cervix showed no acetowhite lesion and a conization was performed. Histology revealed endocervical lymphoid cells, specified as low-malignant B-Non-Hodgkin lymphoma of the cervix based on the expression of CD5, CD20, and CD23, whilst CD10 and cyclin D1 were negative. The diagnosis was confirmed by flow cytometry of peripheral blood. Staging revealed enlarged iliacal, para-aortic, mediastinal, cervical, subclavicular, and inguinal lymph nodes and hepatosplenomegaly. Bone marrow analysis confirmed lymphoid infiltration consistent with B-cell lymphoma. The patient was scheduled for a combined immuno-chemotherapy with obinutuzumab and chlorambucil. In a MEDLINE literature search, 246 cases of LUCX were identified. One hundred and eighty-five cases were primary and 61 cases were secondary manifestations of LUCX. With a mean follow-up time of 38 months, overall survival was 81%. Data in the literature including clinical and histological characteristics of LUCX as well as the clinical management and prognosis are discussed herein. CONCLUSION: LUCX is rare and has distinct clinical and histological features. LUCX is usually treated with local surgical excision followed by radiotherapy or chemotherapy.
27630347	Feasibility and Safety of Laparoscopic Total Mesometrial Resection in Early-stage Cervical Cancer.	AIM: In this study we aimed to analyze the safety and feasibility of total mesometrial resection (TMMR) using the laparoscopic approach. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Laparoscopic TMMR and pelvic lymphadenectomy (LNE) was carried out in 34 patients with cervical cancer FIGO IA-IIB from April 2012-April 2016 at our tertiary center. Para-aortic LNE was performed when indicated. The main outcomes included surgical margins, a number of retrieved lymph node, intra- and post-operative complications, and recurrence rates. RESULTS: Complete microscopic tumor resection was confirmed in 33/34 (97%) patients. No conversion to open surgery was necessary. Mean intra-operative blood loss was only 65.2 ml with no blood transfusions required. Intra-operative complications occurred in 4/34 (11.8%) cases (2 bladder injuries and 2 ureteric injuries). Post-operative complications were observed in 10/35 (29.4%) cases. Only one complication occurred after 30 days (vesico-vaginal fistula). There was a loco-regional recurrence within a mean follow-up time of 25.9 months. CONCLUSION: Laparoscopic TMMR appears to be feasible and safe in the treatment of early-stage cervical cancer. Further large-scale studies are required.
27630314	Prognostic Significance of Pre-treatment Serum C-Reactive Protein Level in Patients with Adenocarcinoma of the Uterine Cervix.	AIM: To evaluate pre-treatment serum C-reactive protein (CRP) level as a prognostic parameter in patients with adenocarcinoma of the uterine cervix. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Pre-treatment CRP levels were analyzed to determine potential associations with clinicopathological parameters and to assess prognostic value in 46 patients with sole adenocarcinoma of the uterine cervix. RESULTS: The mean (+/-SD) pre-treatment serum CRP level was 5.82 (7.21) mg/l. Serum CRP concentration significantly correlated positively with age at diagnosis (p=0.001), lymphovascular space invasion (p=0.0026), recurrent disease (p=0.0001) and International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage (p=0.0002). In multivariate Cox regression models with age, FIGO stage, histological grade and lymph node status, elevated CRP and cancer antigen 125 levels were associated with shortened survival (p<0.05). Overall 5-year survival rate of patients with pre-treatment serum CRP level <5.0 mg/l was 100% compared to 46.9% for patients with pre-treatment CRP level >/=5.0 mg/l. CONCLUSION: Serum CRP level can be seen as an additional independent prognostic parameter in patients with the rare histological subtype adenocarcinoma of the uterine cervix.
27629737	Multi- and Unifocal Thyroid Microcarcinoma: Are There Any Differences?	BACKGROUND: Thyroid microcarcinoma (TMC) often occurs as two or more separate foci, therefore a completion of primary surgery might be necessary. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate and compare the incidence, diagnostic accuracy, clinicopathological characteristics and surgical treatment of unifocal and multifocal thyroid microcarcinoma (UTMC vs. MTMC). MATERIAL AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 3,218 medical records of patients consecutively admitted and surgically treated in one center due to thyroid pathology. RESULTS: In the end, we evaluated 246 (7.64%) patients with thyroid malignancy. Ninety-seven of them (39.43%) were diagnosed as TMC: 84 (86.59%) UTMC and 13 (13.41%) MTMC (p < 0.0001). All MTMC were unilateral tumors. The papillary type of cancer was found in 82 (97.62%) patients with UTMC and in 12 (92.31%) with MTMC (p = 0.8661). In the UTMC group, 1 (1.19%) patient had follicular and 1 (1.19%) the medullary type of TMC. 1 (7.69%) individual in the MTMC group had tumors composed of papillary and follicular cancer. The number of younger patients (age < 45) was comparable in both groups (p = 0.825). The trend was observed that ultrasound guided fine needle aspiration biopsy (UG-FNAB) revealed malignant processes before surgery in a greater number of patients with MTMC than UTMC (84.62% vs. 58.33%, p = 0.131). In the MTMC group, the number of larger tumors (> 5 mm) was greater (84.62% vs. 65.48%), however the difference was not statistically significant. Thirteen percent of patients with UTMC presented cervical lymph node involvement, compared to nearly 8% of patients with MTMC (p = 0.298). Disease-related mortality was not observed in either group. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of UTMC was significantly higher than MTMC. The majority of UTMC and MTMC were composed of the papillary type of cancer. MTMC and UTMC were equally frequent in both age groups. The accuracy of UG-FNAB was higher in patients with MTMC. The dimensions of most UTMC and MTMC was above 5 mm. The involvement of the cervical lymph node at the time of diagnosis in both groups is comparable and not infrequent.
27628548	[Safety Assessment of a Short Hydration Regimen for Outpatient Cisplatin-Based Chemotherapy].	BACKGROUND: During administration of thecisplatin (CDDP)containing regimen, hospitalization is necessary to ensure adequate hydration. However, short hydration is widely used when administering CDDP in outpatient chemotherapy centers. METHOD: To assess the safety of the administration of CDDP during short hydration, we retrospectively evaluated adverse events and complications in the outpatients who received CDDP during short hydration between April 2012 and December 2014 in our hospital. RESULT: Sixty patients received CDDP during short hydration. Eighteen patients with non-small cell lung cancer, 17 with gastric cancer, 10 with small cell lung cancer, 9 with cervical cancer, 4 with biliary tract cancer, 1 with endometrial cancer, and 1 with duodenal papilla cancer were retrospectively evaluated. Fifty-five patients completed CDDP treatment(including treatment until PD). The reasons for discontinuation of CDDP treatment were deterioration of general condition, ileus, pneumothorax, cholangitis, and rejection of oral rehydration. Hydronephrosis after CDDP treatment during short hydration(weekly CDDP regimen)was observed in 1 patient. No patient discontinued CDDP due to grade 3 or 4 adverse events. CONCLUSION: No discontinuation of CDDP associated with a short hydration regimen suggests that it has enabled thesafeadministration of CDDP to outpatients.
27628228	Esophagogastrectomy with simultaneous intestinal repair.	AIM: to present treatment of patients with gastroesophageal cancer. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 41 cases of esophagogastrectomy with simultaneous intestinal repair were analyzed. There were 37 operations for malignancies and 4 operations for benign diseases. Indications for surgery were defined. Abdominocervical access was predominantly used. In 6 patients esophageal repair was finished by high intrapleural anastomosis due to insufficient length of the graft for cervical anastomosis. Surgical technique of esophagogastrectomy was described in detail at all stages. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Better functional results were achieved in isoperistaltic esophagocoloplasty when graft's aboral end was anastomosed with Roux-segment of jejunum or with vertical bend of duodenum in end-to-side fashion. Mortality rate was 12.2%. CONCLUSION: We consider that isoperistaltic repair on left colonic vessels has better functional results.
27627789	The effect of clamping the indwelling urinary catheter before removal in cervical cancer patients after radical hysterectomy.	AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To determine the effect of clamping the indwelling urinary catheter before its removal on bladder reconditioning in patients with cervical cancer after radical hysterectomy. BACKGROUND: It is suggested that indwelling urinary catheters should be clamped intermittently to fill the bladder and restore bladder function before removal. However, indwelling urinary catheter clamping showed no effect on bladder reconditioning according to some clinical studies. DESIGN: Randomised controlled study. METHODS: A total of 210 patients with cervical cancer after type C radical hysterectomy were randomised on 1:2 into two groups. In the clamping group, indwelling urinary catheters were clamped intermittently for 48 hours before removal based on a bladder-training sheet, while in the control group, the indwelling urinary catheters were removed without clamping. The primary outcome of the study was the rate of recatheterisation. The secondary outcomes included residual urine volume 24 hours after removal, incidence of urinary tract infection and duration of recatheterisation. RESULTS: Seventy patients were assigned to the clamping group and 128 to the control group with paralleled baseline characteristics. The days of the primary catheterisation (13.20 +/- 0.79 vs. 13.38 +/- 1.04) and the incidence of urinary tract infection (22.9% vs. 20.3%) had no significant differences between the two groups. Ten patients in the clamping group and 19 in the control group underwent recatheterisation, the incidence of which showed no significant difference (14.3% vs. 14.8%). The days of recatheterisation were not statistically different between the two groups (11.40 +/- 6.75 vs. 9.42 +/- 5.23). However, the residual urine volume 24 hours after removal was higher in the clamping group than that in the control group. CONCLUSIONS: Bladder recondition through indwelling urinary catheter clamping may not restore bladder function in patients after radical hysterectomy. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: As indwelling urinary catheter clamping may increase the residual urine volume after indwelling urinary catheter removal and lead to an increased nursing workload, it should not be recommended in patients with cervical cancer postoperatively.
27626412	Sulforaphane, a Dietary Isothiocyanate, Induces G(2)/M Arrest in Cervical Cancer Cells through CyclinB1 Downregulation and GADD45beta/CDC2 Association.	Globally, cervical cancer is the most common malignancy affecting women. The main treatment methods for this type of cancer include conization or hysterectomy procedures. Sulforaphane (SFN) is a natural, compound-based drug derived from dietary isothiocyanates which has previously been shown to possess potent anti-tumor and chemopreventive effects against several types of cancer. The present study investigated the effects of SFN on anti-proliferation and G(2)/M phase cell cycle arrest in cervical cancer cell lines (Cx, CxWJ, and HeLa). We found that cytotoxicity is associated with an accumulation of cells in the G(2)/M phases of the cell-cycle. Treatment with SFN led to cell cycle arrest as well as the down-regulation of Cyclin B1 expression, but not of CDC2 expression. In addition, the effects of GADD45beta gene activation in cell cycle arrest increase proportionally with the dose of SFN; however, mitotic delay and the inhibition of proliferation both depend on the dosage of SFN used to treat cancer cells. These results indicate that SFN may delay the development of cancer by arresting cell growth in the G(2)/M phase via down-regulation of Cyclin B1 gene expression, dissociation of the cyclin B1/CDC2 complex, and up-regulation of GADD45beta proteins.
27625132	[Removal of laryngeal cancer with thyroid cartilage membrane excision and repair of laryngeal cavity with outside thyroid cartilage membrane flap of healthy side: oncologic and functional outcomes].	OBJECTIVE: To study the efficacy and feasibility of removal of laryngeal cancer with thyroid cartilage membrane excision and repair of laryngeal cavity by the outside thyroid cartilage membrane flap of healthy side. METHODS: A total of 28 patients were reviewed who underwent the removal of laryngeal cancer with thyroid cartilage membrane excision combined with the repair of laryngeal cavity by the outside thyroid cartilage membrane flap in our hospital between 2005 and 2011. Respiratory function, swallowing function, and voice quality of patients after surgery were evaluated. Survival and recurrence were observed with the follow up of five years. RESULTS: The decannulation rate was 96.4%. Aspiration rate was 10.7%, but aspiration was completely revolved by swallowing training in the patients. All patients had the voice quality required for communication although they complained of hoarseness after surgery. Tumor recurrence was found in one patient and cervical lymph node metastasis in 2 patients. The three-year and five-year survival rates were 89.3% and 85.7% respectively. CONCLUSION: This surgical procedure was applicable in some of patients with T2 laryngeal cancer, with good laryngeal functions after surgery.
27623814	Comparison of plasma amino acid profile-based index and CA125 in the diagnosis of epithelial ovarian cancers and borderline malignant tumors.	BACKGROUND: We previously developed a new plasma amino acid profile-based index (API) to detect ovarian, cervical, and endometrial cancers. Here, we compared API to serum cancer antigen 125 (CA125) for distinguishing epithelial ovarian malignant tumors from benign growths. METHODS: API and CA125 were measured preoperatively in patients with ovarian tumors, which were later classified into 59 epithelial ovarian cancers, 21 epithelial borderline malignant tumors, and 97 benign tumors including 40 endometriotic cysts. The diagnostic accuracy and cutoff points of API were evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. RESULTS: The area under the ROC curves showed the equivalent performance of API and CA125 to discriminate between malignant/borderline malignant and benign tumors (both 0.77), and API was superior to CA125 for discrimination between malignant/borderline malignant lesions and endometriotic cysts (API, 0.75 vs. CA125, 0.59; p < 0.05). At the API cutoff level of 6.0, API and CA125 had equal positive rates of detecting cancers and borderline malignancies (API, 0.71 vs. CA125, 0.74; p = 0.84) or cancers alone (API, 0.73 vs. CA125, 0.85; p = 0.12). However, API had a significantly lower detection rate of benign endometriotic cysts (0.35; 95 % CI, 0.21-0.52) compared with that of CA125 (0.65; 95 % CI, 0.48-0.79) (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: API is an effective new tumor marker to detect ovarian cancers and borderline malignancies with a low false-positive rate for endometriosis. A large-scale prospective clinical study using the cutoff value of API determined in this study is warranted to validate API for practical clinical use.
27621244	Menopausal hormone therapy in cancer survivors: A narrative review of the literature.	Decision making regarding the use of menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) for the treatment of bothersome menopausal symptoms in a cancer survivor can be complex, and includes assessment of its impact on disease-free or overall survival. Estrogen receptors are present in several cancer types, but this does not always result in estrogen-mediated tumor proliferation and adverse cancer-related outcomes. Estrogen may even be protective against certain cancers. Menopausal hormone therapy is associated with an increased risk of recurrence and mortality after diagnosis of some cancer types, but not others. We provide a narrative review of the medical literature regarding the risk of cancer recurrence and associated mortality with initiation of MHT after the diagnosis of breast, gynecologic, lung, colorectal, hematologic cancers, and melanoma. Menopausal hormone therapy may be considered for management of bothersome menopausal symptoms in women with some cancer types (e.g., colorectal and hematologic cancer, localized melanoma, and most cervical, vulvar and vaginal cancers), while nonhormonal treatment options may be preferred for others (e.g., breast cancer). In women with other cancer types, recommendations are less straightforward, and the use of MHT must be individualized.
27619741	Cu(II), Ni(II) complexes derived from chiral Schiff-base ligands: Synthesis, characterization, cytotoxicity, protein and DNA-binding properties.	A series of novel copper (II) and nickel (II) complexes derived from chiral Schiff-base ligands [(R)/(S)-H2L(1)=(R)/(S)-2-[(1-Hydroxymethyl-propylimino)-methyl]-5-methoxy-phenol and (R)/(S)-H2L(2)=(R)/(S)-2-[(1-Hydroxymethyl-2-phenyl-ethylimino)-methyl]-5-methoxy -phenol], were synthesized and characterized by elemental analyses, (1)H NMR spectra, FT-IR spectrum. The crystal structures of complexes 1-5 were determined through single crystal X-ray diffraction (SXRD). The structures showed the ligands coordinated to the Cu/Ni (II) ion in a neutral manner via ONO donor atoms, and oxygen atoms of solvent molecules occupy the axial positions in Ni (II) complexes 3 and 4. The complexes interactions with BSA and CT-DNA were investigated by various spectroscopic methods (UV-Visible, circular dichroism spectrum, fluorescence spectroscopic and synchronous fluorescence spectra). Interactions of chiral copper (II) complexes are stronger than nickel (II) complexes. Further, the cytotoxicities of the complexes 1-6 towards three kinds of cancerous cell lines, were human lung adenocarcinoma (A549), human cervical carcinoma cell (HeLa) and human breast cancer cell (MCF-7) respectively, were evaluated by MTT assay. All complexes exhibited good cytotoxic activity. Furthermore, Cu (II) complex 5 derived from (R)-Schiff-base ligand was found to be more effective towards HeLa cancerous cell. The results showed that chirality and metal ion have important influence on their anticancer activities and interactions with DNA/BSA.
27614991	Radiotherapy of Cervical Cancer.	Curative-intent radical radiotherapy of cervical cancer consists of external-beam radiotherapy, brachytherapy, and concomitant chemotherapy with cisplatin. For each element, new developments aim to improve tumor control rates or treatment tolerance. Intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) has been shown to reduce gastrointestinal toxicity and can be used to selectively increase the radiotherapy dose. Individualized, image-guided brachytherapy enables better adaptation of high-dose volumes to the tumor extension. Intensification of concomitant or sequential systemic therapy is under evaluation.
27614953	Epidemiology and Early Detection of Cervical Cancer.	The new German S3 guideline 'Prevention of Cervical Cancer' published in 2016 is based on the latest available evidence about cervical cancer screening and treatment of cervical precancer. Large randomized controlled trials indicate that human papillomavirus (HPV)-based screening may provide better protection against cervical cancer than cytology alone through improved detection of premalignant disease in the first screening round prior to progression. Therefore, women aged 30 years and older should preferably be screened with HPV testing every 3-5 years (cytology alone every 2 years is an acceptable alternative). Co-testing is not recommended. Screening should start at 25 years using cytology alone every 2 years. The preferred triage test after a positive HPV screening test is cytology. Women positive for HPV 16 and HPV 18 should receive immediate colposcopy. Another alternative triage method is p16/Ki-67 dual stain cytology. The mean yearly participation rate in Germany is between 45 and 50%. Offering devices for HPV self-sampling has the potential to increase participation rates in those women who are at higher risk of developing cervical cancer. Regarding primary prevention, the 9-valent vaccine may provide protection against up to 85% of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 3 and 90% of cervical cancer, and is available in Europe as a 2-dose schedule from May 2016.
27614875	Surgical Treatment of Early-Stage Cervical Cancer.	Surgical treatment of cervical cancer has been a cornerstone in the management of this malignancy for more than 100 years. Today, for early-stage and low-risk cervical cancer, surgery is still considered the gold standard. If the preoperative assessment of the tumor reveals a situation prompting postoperative adjuvant radiochemotherapy, the latter should be planned as the primary treatment option, being preceded by staging laparoscopy including pelvic and paraaortic lymph node dissection. As an alternative to the open approach, the definitive surgical treatment should be either performed laparoscopically, or be laparoscopic-assisted, or laparoscopically robotic-assisted.
27614847	Photodynamic performance of zinc phthalocyanine in HeLa cells: A comparison between DPCC liposomes and BSA as delivery systems.	Comparable intracellular concentrations ( approximately 30pmol/10(6) cells) of bovine serum albumin-ZnPc (BSA) adduct outperformed dipalmitoyl-phosphatidyl-choline (DPPC) liposomes containing ZnPc at photodynamic-killing of human cervical cancer cells (HeLa) after only 15min of irradiation using red light (lambda>620nm, 30W/cm(2)). This result could not be simply explained in terms of dye aggregation within the carrier, since in the liposomes the dye was considerably less aggregated than in bovine serum albumin, formulation that was capable to induce cell apoptosis upon red light exposure. Thus, using specific organelle staining, our cumulative data points towards intrinsic differences in intra-cellular localization depending on the cargo vehicle used, being ZnPc:BSA preferentially located in the near vicinity of the nucleus and in the Golgi structures, while the liposomal formulation ZnPc:DPPC was preferentially located in cellular membrane and cytoplasm. In addition to those differences, using real-time advanced fluorescence lifetime imaging of HeLa cells loaded with the photosensitizer contained in the different vehicles, we have found that only for the ZnPc:BSA formulation, there was no significant changes in the fluorescence lifetime of the photosensitizer inside the cells. This contrasts with the in situ approximately two-fold reduction of the fluorescence lifetime measured for the liposomal ZnPc formulation. Those observations point towards the superiority of the protein to preserve dye aggregation, and its photochemical activity, post-cell uptake, demonstrating the pivotal role of the delivery vehicle at determining the ultimate fate of a photosensitizer.
27614740	Neoadjuvant and Adjuvant Chemotherapy of Cervical Cancer.	Neoadjuvant chemotherapy is indicated in patients who can tolerate the side effects of a chemotherapy and with preoperative presentation of one of the following clinical risk situations: bulky disease with a maximal tumor diameter of > 4 cm, suspicious lymph nodes in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT) scan or endosonography, histopathologically confirmed lymph node metastasis, or histopathologically documented risk factors such as G3 and L1V1. A neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgery should be performed with cisplatin at a dosage of > 25 mg/m2 per week and an application interval of < 14 days. The previously published data suggests an improved rate of complete resection and reduced incidences of positive lymph nodes and parametric infiltration. Accordingly, the percentage of patients in need for adjuvant radiochemotherapy after operation can be significantly reduced. Some studies demonstrated a prolongation of progression-free and overall survival. Following the previously published studies, adjuvant chemotherapy after operation or after radiochemotherapy has no significant effect on the overall survival and, following the current guidelines, should be avoided.
27614513	CTV to PTV in cervical cancer: From static margins to adaptive radiotherapy.	Intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) is increasingly used in order to minimize the gastrointestinal, genitourinary, and hematological toxicity in cervical and uterine cancers. However, the benefit of this high-precision approach is detracted by the margins applied to the clinical target volume (CTV) to generate the planning tumor volume (PTV), taking into account tumor and surrounding organs movements, deformations, and volume changes. Adequate PTV margins should be large enough to prevent geographical misses, but not excessive, which might end the benefit from IMRT. The objectives of this review were: (a) to present the evidence available for the determination of CTV-PTV margin for uterine cancers; (b) to highlight the impact of these margins in the context of adaptive radiotherapy; and (c) to discuss the role of the PTV concept in intracavitary brachytherapy.
27614445	State-of-the-Art Treatment and Novel Agents in Local and Distant Recurrences of Cervical Cancer.	Depending on the stage at initial presentation, cervical cancer will recur in 25-61% of women. Typical manifestations of recurrent cervical cancer include the central pelvis and the pelvic side walls as well as retroperitoneal lymph node basins in the pelvis and the para-aortic region, and - more rarely - supraclavicular lymph nodes. There are no typical symptoms of recurrent cervical cancer. Women with suspected recurrence after cervical cancer based on gynecological examination or organ-specific symptoms must undergo imaging studies and - if technically feasible - biopsy with histological verification, especially in cases of distant metastases, in order to rule out a second primary. Radiotherapy-naive women should be treated with salvage radiochemotherapy with curative intention. For women with previous radiotherapy, surgery in the form of hysterectomy, local resection, or pelvic exenteration is the treatment of choice. Pelvic exenteration can lead to cure in selected patients, but at the price of a high rate of complications and significant morbidity and mortality. If complete surgical resection is not feasible or if the woman is not a candidate for surgery, chemotherapy with palliative intent should be offered. Patients with recurrent disease outside the pelvis are candidates for systemic chemotherapy. Several agents have shown to be active in this situation, either in single-agent or combination regimens. Platinum-containing regimens have a superior efficacy over non-platinum regimens and bevacizumab may be added to chemotherapy.
27612716	Gated magnetic mesoporous silica nanoparticles for intracellular enzyme-triggered drug delivery.	The targeting drug release is significant to the anticancer treatment. In this context, the redox-responsive drug delivery has attracted most attention owing to the intracellular reductive environment, such as the high concentration of glutathione reductase in many cancer cells. Herein, a glutathione sensitive drug delivery nanoplatform was constructed by using core-shell mesoporous silica nanocomposite (Fe3O4@mSiO2) as carrier. By a simple silane coupling reaction, the glutathione cleavable diselenide linker has been prepared and grafted on to Fe3O4@mSiO2 to insure the encapsulation of anticancer drug doxorubicin. The detail release kinetics studies reveal the glutathione triggered drug release, which could be further adjusted by varying the amount of diselenide linker. To improve the tumor-targeting, folic acid was grafted. The cellular uptake and drug release investigation was carried out using HeLa (cervical cancer cell line) as the model cancer cell and L02 and HUVEC (human hepatic cell line and human umbilical vein endothelial cells, non-cancerous cell lines) as control, indicating the enhanced cytotoxicity toward HeLa cells that benefits from the fast endocytosis and enhanced cellular drug release owing to their overexpressing folic acid receptors and high concentration of glutathione. Associating with the magnetic targeting, these novel nanomaterials are expected to be promising in the potential application of tumor-targeting therapy.
27611439	Role of Telomerase in Cervical Lesions as Prognostic Marker: A Comparison Between Immunohistochemistry and Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization.	OBJECTIVES: Amplification of human telomerase is known to be associated with cervical tumorigenesis, although its role in tumor progression of cervical lesions is still unclear. We aimed to evaluate the role of telomerase in predicting the evolution of cervical lesions. METHODS: A total of 50 tissue samples taken by biopsy or conization once or repeatedly from 17 patients with cervical lesions over a 14-year follow-up was analyzed using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for hTERC gene alterations and immunohistochemistry (IHC) for hTERT expression. The accuracy of the biomarkers was measured using the area under the curve. RESULTS: Telomerase gene amplification is highly indicative of cervical lesion evolution and seems to be a more reliable biomarker than the protein expression detected by IHC. In fact, patients with benign lesions or cervical intraepithelial lesions (CINs) showing hTERC amplification relapsed or progressed into CIN 2 and CIN 3 more frequently than those without any gene amplification. FISH and IHC assays had both 86% sensitivity on conized material and 78% and 40% specificity, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that the most accurate method to evaluate telomerase alterations as prognostic markers in cervical lesions was FISH assay on hTERC gene. The best accuracy was obtained using conized materials.
27610364	Genotype Distribution of Human Papillomavirus among Women with Cervical Cytological Abnormalities or Invasive Squamous Cell Carcinoma in a High-Incidence Area of Esophageal Carcinoma in China.	Data of HPV genotype including 16 high-risk HPV (HR-HPV) and 4 low-risk HPV from 38,397 women with normal cytology, 1341 women with cervical cytology abnormalities, and 223 women with ISCC were retrospectively evaluated by a hospital-based study. The prevalence of high-risk HPV (HR-HPV) was 6.51%, 41.83%, and 96.86% in women with normal cytology, cervical cytology abnormalities, and ISCC, respectively. The three most common HPV types were HPV-52 (1.76%), HPV-16 (1.28%), and HPV-58 (0.97%) in women with normal cytology, whereas the most prevalent HPV type was HPV-16 (16.85%), followed by HPV-52 (9.55%) and HPV-58 (7.83%) in women with cervical cytology abnormalities. Specifically, HPV-16 had the highest frequency in ASC-H (24.16%, 36/149) and HSIL (35.71%, 110/308), while HPV-52 was the most common type in ASC-US (8.28%, 53/640) and LSIL (16.80%, 41/244). HPV-16 (75.78%), HPV18 (10.31%), and HPV58 (9.87%) were the most common types in women with ISCC. These data might contribute to increasing the knowledge of HPV epidemiology and providing the guide for vaccine selection for women in Shantou.
27605973	Factors influencing the recommendation of the Human Papillomavirus vaccine by South African doctors working in a tertiary hospital.	BACKGROUND: In South Africa, HPV vaccination programme has been incorporated recently in the school health system. Since doctors are the most trusted people regarding health issues in general, their knowledge and attitudes regarding HPV infections and vaccination are very important for HPV vaccine program nationally. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to investigate factors contributing to recommendation of HPV vaccines to the patients. METHODS: This was a quantitative cross-sectional study conducted among 320 doctors, using a self-administered anonymous questionnaire. RESULTS: All the doctors were aware of HPV and knew that HPV is transmitted sexually. Their overall level of knowledge regarding HPV infections and HPV vaccine was poor. But the majority intended to prescribe the vaccine to their patients. It was found that doctors who knew that HPV 6 and 11 are responsible for >90% of anogenital warts, their patients would comply with the counselling regarding HPV vaccination, and received sufficient information about HPV vaccination were 5.68, 4.91 and 4.46 times respectively more likely to recommend HPV vaccination to their patients, compared to their counterparts (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: There was a knowledge gap regarding HPV infection and HPV vaccine among the doctors.
27605479	[A Case of Spontaneous Cerebrospinal Fluid Leak Associated with Cervical Spondylosis].	Spontaneous cerebrospinal fluid leak and intracranial hypotension associated with cervical spondylosis have rarely been observed, and only a few cases are reported. A 69-year-old woman, previously treated for rectal and thyroid cancer, complained of a non-postural persistent headache. The patient regularly practiced aerobic exercise, but a month earlier she had started experiencing headache and neck pain while exercising. Computed tomography(CT)showed bilateral chronic subdural hematomas, and magnetic resonance imaging(MRI)revealed diffuse dural enhancement and tonsillar herniation. We drained the subdural hematomas and replaced the ventricular reservoir to safely access the cerebrospinal fluid space. After surgery, the persistent headache disappeared for several days, but a postural headache emerged. CT myelogram showed extradural accumulation of the contrast medium at the C2-5 level with cervical spondylosis. The patient was treated with conservative therapy of bed rest and intravenous fluid hydration for two weeks, and the headache improved. CT myelogram after treatment showed no extradural accumulation of the contrast medium. Spontaneous cerebrospinal fluid leak associated with cervical spondylosis could be induced by the repeated minor mechanical stress caused by physical exercise. Therefore, the possibility that non-postural persistent headache may be caused by spontaneous cerebrospinal fluid leak should not be underestimated.
27603383	Quality of life and sexuality in disease-free survivors of cervical cancer after radical hysterectomy alone: A comparison between total laparoscopy and laparotomy.	The aim of the present study was to evaluate the possible differences between total laparoscopy and laparotomy regarding their impact on postoperative quality of life and sexuality in disease-free cervical cancer survivors who received radical hysterectomy (RH) and/or lymphadenectomy alone and were followed for >1 year.We reviewed all patients with cervical cancer who had received surgical treatment in our hospital between January 2001 and March 2014. Consecutive sexually active survivors who received RH and/or lymphadenectomy for early stage cervical cancer were enrolled and divided into 2 groups based on surgical approach. Survivors were interviewed and completed validated questionnaires, including the European Organization for Research Treatment of Cancer Quality-of-Life Core Questionnaire including 30 items, the Cervical Cancer-Specific Module of European Organization for Research Treatment of Cancer Quality-of-Life Questionnaire including 24 items (EORTC QLQ-CX24), and the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI).In total, 273 patients with histologically confirmed cervical cancer were retrospectively reviewed. However, only 64 patients had received RH and/or lymphadenectomy alone; 58 survivors meeting the inclusion criteria were enrolled, including 42 total laparoscopy cases and 16 laparotomy cases, with an average follow-up of 46.1 and 51.2 months, respectively. The survivors in the 2 groups obtained good and similar scores on all items of the European Organization for Research Treatment of Cancer Quality-of-Life Core Questionnaire including 30 items and Cervical Cancer-Specific Module of European Organization for Research Treatment of Cancer Quality-of-Life Questionnaire including 24 items, without significant differences after controlling for covariate background characteristics. To the date of submission, 21.4% (9/42) of cases in the total laparoscopy group and 31.2% (5/16) of cases in the laparotomy group had not resumed sexual behavior after RH. Additionally, the scores on the FSFI items were comparable between the 2 groups; however, the total FSFI scores were 19.7 and 17.4 for total laparoscopy and laparotomy survivors, respectively, both of which were less than the validated cutoff value of 26.6 for diagnosing female sexual dysfunction.Disease-free cervical cancer survivors after RH and/or lymphadenectomy were able to cope well, although RH could greatly impair females' sexual function regardless of surgical approach. Moreover, the long-term quality of life and sexual function of survivors seemed to be independent of the surgical approach chosen. Randomized controlled and longitudinal trials with larger populations are needed to better compare these issues between patients receiving laparoscopy and laparotomy.
27601381	Time to viral clearance after successful conservative treatment for high-risk HPV-infected high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and early invasive squamous cervical carcinoma.	Two-thirds of 152 patients treated for high-grade cervical disease, free of persistence/recurrence, and followed-up both with human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA testing and HPV genotyping cleared their high-risk HPV infection within 1year. Viral clearance continued at diminishing rates during the second and the third year, at the end of which it was virtually complete.
27601129	p53, Bcl-2 and cox-2 are involved in berberine hydrochloride-induced apoptosis of HeLa229 cells.	The present study aimed to investigate the effects of berberine hydrochloride on the proliferation and apoptosis of HeLa229 human cervical cancer cells. A 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay was performed to examine the cytotoxicity of berberine hydrochloride against HeLa229 cells. The effects of berberine hydrochloride on the apoptosis of HeLa229 cells was detected by immunofluorescence and flow cytometry, and the mRNA expression levels of p53, Bcell lymphoma 2 (Bcl2) and cyclooxygenase2 (cox2) were analyzed by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Berberine hydrochloride inhibited the proliferation of HeLa229 cells in a dosedependent manner; minimum cell viability (3.61%) was detected following treatment with 215.164 micromol/l berberine hydrochloride and the half maximal inhibitory concentration value was 42.93 micromol/l following treatment for 72 h. In addition, berberine hydrochloride induced apoptosis in HeLa229 cells in a dose and timedependent manner. Berberine hydrochloride upregulated the mRNA expression levels of p53, and downregulated mRNA expression levels of Bcl2 and cox2, in a dosedependent manner. In conclusion, berberine hydrochloride inhibited the proliferation and induced apoptosis of HeLa229 cells, potentially via the upregulation of p53 and the downregulation of Bcl2 and cox2 mRNA expression levels.
27599684	[Head and neck intensity-modulated radiation therapy: Normal tissues dose constraints. Pharyngeal constrictor muscles and larynx].	Radio-induced pharyngolaryngeal chronic disorders may challenge the quality of life of head and neck cancer long survivors. Many anatomic structures have been identified as potentially impaired by irradiation and responsible for laryngeal edema, dysphonia and dysphagia. Some dose constraints might be plausible such as keeping the mean dose to the pharyngeal constrictor muscles under 50 to 55Gy, the mean dose to the supra-glottic larynx under 40 to 45Gy and, if feasible, the mean dose to the glottic larynx under 20Gy. A reduction of the dose delivered to the muscles of the floor of the mouth and the cervical esophagus would be beneficial as well. Nevertheless, the publications available do not provide an extensive enough level of proof. One should consider limiting as low as possible the dose delivered to these structures without compromising the quality of irradiation of the target tumor volumes.
27598277	[Human papilloma virus and Chlamydia trachomatis by number of sexual partners and time of sexual activity on university students in the Region of La Araucania, Chile].	BACKGROUND: Human papilloma virus (HPV) and Chlamydia trachomatis are the most prevalent sexually transmitted infections (STIs), among teenagers and young people, with risk factors: active sex life and multiple partners. Chlamydia trachomatis infection may favor HPV infection and this, the development of cervical cancer. Both infections can lead to consequences on sexual and reproductive health. OBJECTIVE: To determine frequency of HPV and C. trachomatis in asymptomatic university women less than 25 years, associating them with number of sexual partners (n degrees SxP) and time of sexual activity (TSxA). Material andMethods: 151 cervical samples for HPV and C. trachomatis, were processed by conventional and in real time reaction polymerase chain. RESULTS: HPV 21, 8%, C. trachomatis 11, 2% and co-infection (HPV/C.trachomatis), 4.6%. Aimong HPV +, 80, 6% showed high risk HPV. The n degrees SxP was strongly associated with HPV. Aimong young coinfected HPV/C. trachomatis, 71.4% had 3 or more PSx. Chlamydia trachomatis was more frequent (64,7%) that HPV within range of 3-5 years according to the TSxA, Discussion: A high prevalence of HPV and C. trachomatis was observed. Young women with coinfection HPV/C. trachomatis could be a high-risk group need to monitor their infections. It suggests the implementation of university programs in education, counseling and prevention in sexual health.
27598026	The role of Pap test screening against cervical cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.	OBJECTIVE: The first aim of this article is to quantify the role of Pap test in cervical cancer prevention, updating the pool of available studies included in a previous meta-analysis. Potential sources of meta-analysis heterogeneity were investigated as second aim. Further evidence of cost-effectiveness has been provided about age and best time interval to perform Pap test screening. DATA SOURCES: The articles' search was conducted using four medical electronic databases: PubMed, Google Scholar, ISI Web, and Scopus. Papers published until the 30th November 2013 were included. The research on Google Scholar was limited to the first 10 pages of web for each study design. METOD OF STUDY SELECTION: A systematic review/meta-analysis was performed according to PRISMA Statement. New-Castle-Ottawa Scale and Jadad have been adopted for articles quality assessment. From 4143 screened articles, 34 met eligibility criteria and 30 case-control studies were included in meta-analysis. Meta-analysis was carried out using StatsDirect2.8.0. Heterogeneity was investigated with qualitative and quantitative approaches in sensitivity-analysis. TABULATION, INTEGRATION AND RESULTS: Despite a great heterogeneity (Cochran Q=504.466, df=29, p<0.0001; I(2)=94.3%; 95%CI=93.1%-95.1%), a significant protective effect of Pap test has been identified (OR=0.33; 95%CI=0.268-0.408, P <0.00011) through the meta-analysis. Sensitivity analysis did not provide significant results (R=0.358 R2=0.128 p<0.469). CONCLUSIONS: The protective role of Pap test against cervical cancer has been confirmed especially among women <40 years. Annual screening still remains the most cost-effective preventive strategy.
27596034	Radiation therapy quality-of-care indicators for locally advanced cervical cancer: A consensus guideline.	PURPOSE: Radiation therapy plays an important curative role for patients with locally advanced cervical cancer (LACC). There are no standards to define best practice. The purpose of this study was to develop a suite of radiation therapy key quality-of-care indicators (KQIs) for the curative management of LACC based on expert consensus. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A modified Delphi method was used after identifying candidate KQIs. Round 1 involved surveying all Canadian gynecology radiation oncologists. The current and anticipated future (5 years) importance and current achievability of each KQI was ranked. Round 2 consisted of a facilitated face-to-face meeting with a smaller expert panel to discuss, revise, and develop consensus on the KQIs. RESULTS: The literature review identified 83 candidate KQIs. Survey response was 71%. Round 2 yielded a final suite of 40 KQIs in the following categories: pretreatment assessment, external beam radiation therapy, brachytherapy, follow-up, and expertise/workload. A prominent theme was the importance of having KQIs to measure the current state, evolution, and future uptake of magnetic resonance-guided brachytherapy. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first study establishing radiation therapy KQIs in LACC based on expert consensus. These KQIs should be used to guide programmatic direction and resource allocation to assure consistent and optimal patient care.
27593247	The Emerging Role of PET/MR Imaging in Gynecologic Cancers.	This article summarizes recent advances in PET/MR imaging in gynecologic cancers and the emerging clinical value of PET/MR imaging in the management of the 3 most common gynecologic malignancies: cervical, endometrial, and ovarian cancers. PET/MR imaging offers superior soft tissue contrast, improved assessment of primary tumor involvement because of high-resolution multiplanar reformats, and functional MR techniques such as diffusion-weighted MR imaging and dynamic contrast-enhanced MR imaging. This article discusses the challenges, future directions, and technical advances of PET/MR imaging, and the emerging new multimodality, multiparametric imaging techniques for integrating morphologic, functional, and molecular imaging data.
27592578	[Pathogenic bacterium and drug resistance in cervical cancer patients complicated with reproductive tract infection].	OBJECTIVE: To determine the vaginal flora distribution in cervical cancer patients and the common pathogenic bacteria as well as drug resistance, and to explore the correlation of vaginal bacterial infection and high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) infection with cervical cancer. METHODS: A total of 216 patients with cervical cancer served as an experimental group, and 53 patients with chronic cervicitis served as a control group. The patients' vaginal fluid in two groups was collected before the treatment for regular bacterial culture and HPV testing. The distribution and drug resistance of bacteria in two groups of vaginal secretion were observed, and the correlation of the bacterial infection and HPV infection with the cervical cancer was analyzed. RESULTS: The gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria accounted for 74.38% and 21.49% in the experimental group, respectively. They were mainly resistant to ampicillin and piperacillin or penicillin and erythromycin. The gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria accounted for 42.31% and 23.08% in the control group, respectively. They were mainly resistant to ampicillin and piperacillin or penicillin. HPV-positive rates in the experiment group and the control group were 60.65% and 41.51%, respectively. There were 70 patients (32.41%) and 12 patients (22.64%) with both bacterial infection and HPV-positive infection in the experiment group and the control group, respectively. However, there was no statistical difference between the 2 groups (P>0.05). CONCLUSION: Escherichia coli are the main pathogen in cervical cancer and they are highly resistant to antibiotics. Bacterial infection in genital tract is not an efficient cofactor for HPV to cause the cervical cancer.
27590369	Less radical surgery for early-stage cervical cancer: To what extent do we justify it?-Our belief.	Cancer of the uterine cervix, following breast cancer, is the second leading cause of death among gynecological cancers in the developed world. Traditionally, surgical management of early-stage cervical carcinoma is considered as a "sterilizing" procedure, since the uterus is removed. Nowadays, because of the postponement of childbearing to an older age, women younger than 45 years old who are diagnosed with early-stage cervical cancer have a strong desire to preserve fertility. Radical trachelectomy (vaginal or abdominal route) is used for fertility preservation in cases of early-stage (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics Stages IA-IB1) cervical carcinomas with remarkable oncological and obstetrical outcomes. However, less radical approaches for ideal candidates may prove safe when fertility preservation is probably feasible.
27588384	Cytotoxic effects of peanut phenolics possessing histone deacetylase inhibitory activity in breast and cervical cancer cell lines.	BACKGROUND: Epigenetic histone modifications are considered as a promising avenue for cancer preventive and therapeutic strategies. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the antiproliferative and histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitory activity of selected peanut phenolics, including p-coumaric acid, ferulic acid, sinapinic acid and resveratrol, in MCF-7 and HeLa cells. METHODS: The cytotoxic and HDAC inhibitory activities were assessed by MTT assays, flow cytometric analyses of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis induction, and western blotting. RESULTS: The results showed that all four phenolics inhibited proliferation of both MCF-7 and HeLa cells in a dose-dependent manner. Among the phenolics tested, resveratrol was the most effective in inhibiting growth of cancer cells. Treatment with all phenolics resulted in histone H3 hyperacetylation in both cell lines, indicating potential for HDAC inhibition. These phenolics induced apoptosis in both MCF-7 and HeLa cells in a concentration-dependent manner. Moreover, all phenolics induced G0/G1-phase arrest of the cell cycle in MCF-7 cells while p-coumaric and ferulic acids caused S-phase arrest in HeLa cells. Exposure to p-coumaric acid increased p53 and p21 expression but decreased CDK4 levels in both cell types, which could result in the observed G0/G1 arrest. Moreover, inhibition of ERK1/2 phosphorylation by ferulic acid and resveratrol contributed to cell growth inhibition. CONCLUSION: Peanut phenolics appear to influence the extent of histone acetylation in MCF-7 and HeLa cells, and this activity modulates multiple pathways that are implicated in cancer prevention.
27587745	'Inflammatory breast cancer' due to metastatic adenocarcinoma of lung.	A 67-year-old woman with a history of lung adenocarcinoma presented with 3 weeks of redness, pain, swelling and skin changes in her right breast. Her vital signs and physical examination were within physiological limits except for the right breast. She had extensive red streaks radiating from the right nipple with peau d'orange appearance of her overlying skin. Her breast was tender on examination and did not have any associated cervical or axillary lymphadenopathy. Her mammography revealed thickening of the skin, increased parenchymal markings and shrinkage the breast. Multiple skin biopsies demonstrated moderately differentiated lung adenocarcinoma with lymphovascular invasion. The patient made an informed decision to undergo radiotherapy following discussion with her oncologist and breast surgeon. She succumbed to her illness 2 months after the diagnosis of metastasis to her breast.
27586579	Cannabidiol rather than Cannabis sativa extracts inhibit cell growth and induce apoptosis in cervical cancer cells.	BACKGROUND: Cervical cancer remains a global health related issue among females of Sub-Saharan Africa, with over half a million new cases reported each year. Different therapeutic regimens have been suggested in various regions of Africa, however, over a quarter of a million women die of cervical cancer, annually. This makes it the most lethal cancer amongst black women and calls for urgent therapeutic strategies. In this study we compare the anti-proliferative effects of crude extract of Cannabis sativa and its main compound cannabidiol on different cervical cancer cell lines. METHODS: To achieve our aim, phytochemical screening, MTT assay, cell growth analysis, flow cytometry, morphology analysis, Western blot, caspase 3/7 assay, and ATP measurement assay were conducted. RESULTS: Results obtained indicate that both cannabidiol and Cannabis sativa extracts were able to halt cell proliferation in all cell lines at varying concentrations. They further revealed that apoptosis was induced by cannabidiol as shown by increased subG0/G1 and apoptosis through annexin V. Apoptosis was confirmed by overexpression of p53, caspase 3 and bax. Apoptosis induction was further confirmed by morphological changes, an increase in Caspase 3/7 and a decrease in the ATP levels. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, these data suggest that cannabidiol rather than Cannabis sativa crude extracts prevent cell growth and induce cell death in cervical cancer cell lines.
27585998	Solubility enhancement and targeted delivery of a potent anticancer flavonoid analogue to cancer cells using ligand decorated dendrimer nano-architectures.	Conventional chemotherapy using small molecule drugs is marred by several challenges such as short half-life, low therapeutic index and adverse systemic side effects. In this regard, targeted therapies using ligand directed polyamidoamine (PAMAM) dendrimers could be a promising strategy to specifically deliver anticancer drugs to cancer cells overexpressing complementary receptor binding domains. The aim of this study was to utilize folate decorated PAMAM to enhance the aqueous solubility of a highly hydrophobic but very potent anticancer flavonoid analogue, 3,4-difluorobenzylidene diferuloylmethane (CDF) and to deliver it specifically to folate receptor overexpressing cervical cancer cells (HeLa) and ovarian cancer cells (SKOV3). As compared to the non-targeted formulation, the targeted formulation exhibited significant anticancer activity with higher accumulation in folate receptor overexpressing cells, larger population of apoptotic cancer cells, elevated expression of tumor suppressor phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), and inhibition of nuclear factor kappa B (NFkappaB) which further confirmed the targeting ability and the promising anticancer activity of the folate based nanoformulation.
27585069	Trends in Colposcopy Volume: Where Do We Go From Here?	OBJECTIVE: To describe the change in colposcopy volume in light of recent guideline shifts, which target higher-risk women while limiting unnecessary procedures in low-risk women. METHODS: After institutional review board approval, colposcopy clinic visits at a large-volume referral center from January 2010 to December 2015 were reviewed. All women diagnosed with abnormal cervical cytology who were referred and subsequently underwent colposcopic evaluation were included. Mean monthly and annual clinic volumes were calculated. Return visit proportions were compared using chi-square test. Negative binomial regression analysis was used to examine trends. RESULTS: There were a total of 8722 colposcopy clinic visits between January 2010 and December 2015. Approximately 7395 visits (85%) were new patient visits, and 1327 visits (15%) were return visits. The percentage of return visits declined dramatically during the study period from 22.9% (2011) of total visits to 9.0% in 2015 (P < 0.001). Annual clinic volume ranged from 903 to 1884 with a mean monthly volume of 121.13 visits (SD, 42.1). Annual volume was highest in 2011 (n = 1884) and has since demonstrated a steady decline. In 2015, average monthly volume (75.3 visits) dropped to nearly one third of its peak 218 visits per month in July 2010. CONCLUSIONS: In a large referral clinic that adheres to guideline-based screening and management recommendations, monthly colposcopy volume has declined dramatically with a reduction by two thirds compared with peak volume in 2010.
27578750	Fertility-sparing surgery for uterine cervical cancer.	The standard treatment for early cervical cancer of the uterus (CC) is radical hysterectomy with resection of the parametrium and pelvic lymphadenectomy. At least 40% of patients develop early-stage CC during child-bearing age, therefore preserving the uterus to maintain fertility has been an important consideration. Several surgical procedures including conization and vaginal or abdominal radical trachelectomy have been reported. These procedures are safe for removing lymph node negative CC tumors with <2 cm diameter. Recently, less radical surgical procedures that maintain fertility, such as conization, simple trachelectomy, minimally invasive surgery and neoadjuvant chemotherapy, have been indicated for tumors greater than 2 cm in diameter. In this review, we discuss the currently accepted surgical approaches for treating CC while maintaining fertility.
27578366	Relevance of the Pap Test: A Report of HPV-DNA Test-Negative High-Grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesions of the Female Lower Genital Tract.	OBJECTIVE: A vast majority of cervicovaginal intraepithelial lesions are caused by high-risk human papillomaviruses (HPVs). The Pap test has been the sole method used for the screening of cervicovaginal squamous intraepithelial lesions (SIL). Recently, the FDA approved an HPV-DNA assay as a method of primary screening. We report on a series of FDA-approved HPV-DNA test-negative SIL with HPV genotyping, using an alternative method on the corresponding surgical biopsy specimens. STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective review identified cytology-positive HPV-negative cases over a 15-month period at a tertiary care gynecologic oncology institution. Corresponding biopsies were reviewed and genotyped for high-risk HPVs. RESULTS: Of the 18,200 total cases, 17 patients meeting the study criteria were selected with 27 surgical specimens corresponding to their cytologic diagnoses. Four patients with high-grade lesions were identified, 3 of whom (75%) were positive for HPV. One of these 4 patients (25%) showed high-grade SIL on biopsies from 4 separate sites in the cervix and vagina. Multiviral HPV infections were frequent. CONCLUSIONS: We discuss the relevance of cotesting for screening cervical SILs and emphasize that false-negative results are possible with the FDA-approved HPV screening assay, also in patients with high-grade SIL. These cases may be detectable by cytologic examination and this suggests that the Pap test remains an important diagnostic tool.
27577931	Patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy + radical surgery + adjuvant chemotherapy in locally advanced cervical cancer: long-term outcomes, survival and prognostic factors in a single-center 10-year follow-up.	We report the long-term follow-up in patients with locally advanced cervical cancer treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) + radical surgery (RS) + adjuvant chemotherapy (ACT) analyzing prognostic factors which may more influence, in a long time, the survival outcome using univariate and multivariate analysis. In this study, we included all patients with diagnosis of locally advanced cervical cancer (IB2-IIB) treated with NACT + RS + ACT from June 2000 and February 2007 as previously described by Angioli et al. (Gynecol Oncol 127(2):290-6, 2012). The primary end-point of the study was overall survival (OS) in patients with node metastases and in those without positive lymph nodes at the end of 10-year follow-up in order to confirm the prognostic role of nodes involvement for a long period. Moreover, we analyzed the impact of other prognostic factors, such as histotype, tumor size, grading and parametrial invasion. Secondary end-point was evaluated in the subgroup of patients with positive nodes the following prognostic factors: number of positive lymph nodes and site of positive lymph nodes. In the subgroup of patients with positive nodes, the OS was 63 %, and in that with negative nodes, the OS was 75 %. On multivariate analysis, the number of nodal metastases, parametrial involvement, grading and the lesion diameter were noted to be significant factors in determining OS. Neither the histotype nor the lymph nodal site is related to survival. Results suggest that CT alone may be an alternative postoperative therapy for patients with cervical cancer.
27575575	High-Grade Cervical Dysplasia After Negative Loop Electrosurgical Excision Procedure.	OBJECTIVES: To describe the prevalence and correlates of high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN2+) after a negative loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP), performed for high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) cervical cytology. METHODS: One hundred six women from our university-based colposcopy clinic underwent LEEP between 2007 and 2014. Negative LEEP was defined as CIN1 or less. Persistence/recurrence estimates were calculated by treatment (see-and-treat vs 3-step conventional strategy-cervical cytology, colposcopic biopsy, LEEP) and LEEP results (negative vs positive) using the Kaplan-Meier method. Predictors of CIN2+ after a negative LEEP were examined by multivariate Cox proportional hazards model. RESULTS: Overall, the prevalence of CIN2+ after a negative LEEP for HSIL was 14%. Persistence/recurrence of CIN2+ was similar between women with a negative and positive see-and-treat LEEP (25% vs 15%) and those with a negative or positive 3-step conventional LEEP (7% vs 22%) (log-rank, P = 0.58). Positive LEEP margin was more common among women with a positive LEEP (53.7% see-and-treat vs 42.6% conventional) compared with a negative result (0% see-and-treat vs 3.7% conventional, P < 0.0001). The risk of CIN2+ after a negative LEEP did not differ by management strategy (log-rank, P = 0.85) or LEEP result (log-rank, P = 0.58). In multivariate analysis, correlates of persistent/recurrent CIN2+ included older age (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.09; P = 0.0003), history of previous LEEP (aOR, 8.99; P < 0.0001), and positive LEEP margin (aOR, 13.56; P = 0.0005). CONCLUSIONS: A negative LEEP does not allow less stringent surveillance, as CIN2+ risk is similar to that after CIN2+ is found in the LEEP specimen, whether the specimen was obtained by see-and-treat or conventional 3-step approach.
27574106	Long non-coding RNA HOTAIR modulates HLA-G expression by absorbing miR-148a in human cervical cancer.	The long non-coding RNA HOX transcript antisense RNA (HOTAIR) has been found overexpressed in many human malignancies and involved in tumor progression and metastasis. However, little is known about the potential biological roles of HOTAIR in tumor escape. In the present study, the expression of HOTAIR was detected in 59 paired cervical cancer tissue samples by real-time PCR and then subjected to correlation analysis with clinical features. The effects of HOTAIR on cervical cancer cells as well as the expression of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-G were studied by overexpression and RNA interference approaches. Insight into the mechanism of HOTAIR acting as competitive endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) was gained from bioinformatic analysis and luciferase assays. HOTAIR expression was obviously increased in cervical cancer tissue. HOTAIR upregulation was associated with advanced pathological stage, histology, lymph node invasion and lymphatic metastasis, and also correlated with shorter overall survival of cervical cancer patients. Furthermore, HOTAIR overexpression promoted the proliferation, migration and invasion of cervical cancer cells, while HOTAIR knockdown inhibited cell invasion and cell viability, induced apoptosis and inhibited growth in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, HOTAIR modulated human leucocyte antigen-G (HLA-G) expression by competitively binding miR-148a. Our data suggest that HOTAIR plays an important oncogenic role in cervical cancer and might serve as a marker for cervical cancer prognosis and a potential target for therapeutic intervention.
27573546	Epidermal growth factor receptor kinase substrate 8 promotes the metastasis of cervical cancer via the epithelial-mesenchymal transition.	Epidermal growth factor receptor pathway substrate 8 (Eps8) has been identified as a novel substrate for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) kinase and is involved in EGFRmediated signaling pathways correlated with tumorigenesis, proliferation and metastasis in various cancer types. However, the precise role of Eps8 in cervical cancer metastasis remains to be elucidated. Immunohistochemistry revealed that Eps8 was significantly increased in cervical cancer specimens compared with squamous intraepithelial lesion and normal cervical tissues. Additionally, it was revealed that Eps8 expression not only correlated with cervical cancer progression, but also exhibited a close correlation with the epithelialmesenchymal transition (EMT) markers, Ecadherin and vimentin. Furthermore, the present study focused predominantly on the EMTassociated role of Eps8 in the EMT, migration and invasion of cervical cancer cells. Eps8short hairpin (sh)RNA was transfected into HeLa and SiHa cells to deplete its expression, and reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot analyses were performed to confirm Eps8knockdown and to investigate the influence of Eps8 on EMT markers. The present findings have revealed that Eps8 silencing led to the upregulation of the epithelial marker Ecadherin, while expression of the mesenchymal marker vimentin and the transcription factor snail was decreased at both mRNA and protein expression levels. Transwell cell migration and Matrigel invasion assays showed that downregulation of Eps8 significantly inhibited cell migration and invasion of HeLa and SiHa cells. Taken together, these results suggested that Eps8 promotes cervical cancer metastasis by orchestrating the EMT.
27573495	Retrospective analysis of HPV 16/18-related disease burden using archival clinical samples.	PURPOSE: Estimation of HPV-related disease burden lies at the core of effective disease management. HPV testing is heavily reliant on its retrospective detection in archival clinical cancer samples, especially in parts of the world where HPV screening is not routinely practiced. During the last decade, valuable insights were gained through regional reports based on occasional screening of cervical smears or biopsy sections for the presence of high-risk HPV. HPV 16 and 18 were found to be predominant high-risk HPV subtypes with some regional differences and incidences of co-infections, detected mostly through PCR-based methods. In cases of multiple infections, the presence of viral DNA may not signify its etiologic involvement. The current study, therefore, combines PCR-based detection method with the immunohistochemical (IHC) detection of early viral protein E6 expression, in order to obtain a reliable read out for the disease causing viral subtype, especially in cases of co-infections with oncogenic subtypes other than HPV 16 and 18. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and PCR-based methods are routinely used laboratory techniques in local hospitals. The concordance between IHC and PCR-based analyses may be useful for determining effective method for the retrospective testing of HPV 16 and 18 disease-related burden. METHODS: A total of 49 paraffin-embedded cervical cancer biopsy sections representing patients from the northwest region of the country were collected from the tertiary care hospital for this study. Genotyping for HPV 16 and 18 was carried out through PCR. The HPV 16/18 E6 protein expression was evaluated by IHC and was compared with the clinicopathological features of cervical cancer. RESULTS: Molecular analysis of 33 (67 %), E6-expressing paraffin-embedded cervical cancer biopsy sections revealed the presence of HPV 16 (n = 23; 47 %), HPV 18 (n = 6; 12 %) and co-infection (n = 4; 8 %) in 49 tumors through PCR. Despite the PCR-based detection of viral DNA in 37 cervical cancer samples, IHC analysis of E6 expression revealed the etiological involvement of HPV 16/18 in 33 out of 37 cervical cancer samples. Overall, there was 85 % concordance in the results of the two techniques. CONCLUSION: IHC analysis provides more conclusive evidence regarding the etiological involvement of the viral subtypes, especially in the presence of multiple infections. About two-thirds (67 %) of cervical cancer samples were found to be caused due to HPV 16/18. Latent occurrence of HPV 16 and 18 is suggested in less than 10 % cervical cancer samples which were found to harbor viral DNA without E6 expression. Furthermore, E6 expression was found to be significantly correlated with the tumor grade.
27573304	Use of rhenium-188 for in vivo imaging and treatment of human cervical cancer cells transfected with lentivirus expressing sodium iodide symporter.	Although survival rates for cervical cancer have improved, they need further improvement in patients with distant metastases. The sodium iodine symporter (NIS) gene has often been used in cancer therapy and imaging. We examined the therapeutic effects of rhenium-188 (188Re) in a cervical cancer xenograft model expressing the NIS gene under the control of the tumor-specific human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) promoter. We constructed two recombinant lentiviral vectors expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) or the NIS gene driven by the hTERT promoter. To determine the tumor-specific transcriptional activity of the hTERT promoter, the eGFP-expressing vector was stably transfected into tumor cells and normal cells. A cervical cancer HeLa cell line stably expressing NIS (HeLa-TERTNIS) was created and examined in a similar way. HeLa and HeLa-TERTNIS tumor xenografts were transplanted in nude mice, and in vivo 188Re distribution was measured using micro-SPECT/CT imaging. The therapeutic effects of 188Re were assessed over 21 days on the basis of tumor volume and the immunohistochemical findings of excised tumors. eGFP expression controlled by the hTERT promoter was substantially higher in the tumor cells than normal cells. Quantitative PCR and western blotting confirmed that HeLa-TERTNIS cells expressed high levels of NIS mRNA and protein, respectively. Further, 188Re uptake and accumulation were significantly higher in HeLa-TERTNIS cells and xenografts than HeLa cells and xenografts. In vitro and in vivo, 188Re significantly reduced the survival of HeLa-TERTNIS cells and inhibited the growth of HeLa-TERTNIS xenografts, respectively. Immunohistochemical staining showed that HeLa-TERTNIS xenograft tumors expressed higher levels of NIS and caspase-3 and lower levels of Ki-67 than HeLa xenograft tumors. Our findings indicated that hTERT promoter-driven expression of the NIS gene in HeLa cells led to 188Re uptake and therapeutic effects. Thus, NIS-based gene therapy and imaging using the hTERT promoter and 188Re may be possible.
27573039	Intracellular redox induced drug release in cancerous and mesenchymal stem cells.	In this report, we investigated intracellular redox induced drug release in cancerous cells and human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) as an example of healthy cells using redox-responsive microcapsules with covalently bonded anti-cancer drug (doxorubicin) via the amine-reactive cross-linker, 3,3'-dithiobis(sulfosuccinimidyl propionate) containing disulfide bond. Such rationally designed capsules with incorporated redox-sensitive cross-linker are capable of controllable Dox release in the presence of glutathione (GSH) due to a thiol-cleavable disulfide bonds. The treatment of human MSCs and human cervical cancer cell line (HeLa) with Dox-conjugated capsules showed that the Dox release was observed only when capsules incubated with HeLa cells which can be induced by high GSH level in cancerous (HeLa) cells. Moreover, the results of cell viability indicated that Dox-conjugated capsules are more effective when inducing cell death of HeLa than free Dox improving the anti-tumor efficacy of chemotherapeutic drug and simultaneously they possess lower cytotoxicity against MSCs compared to cancerous cells. Such properties are important in design of smart drug carriers for efficient cancer therapy.
27571703	MicroRNA-124 inhibits proliferation, invasion, migration and epithelial-mesenchymal transition of cervical carcinoma cells by targeting astrocyte-elevated gene-1.	MicroRNA-124 (miR-124) was reported to be attenuated in human cervical cancer (CC) specimens. However, its role in CC remains elusive. In the present study, quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis demonstrated that miR-124 expression is significantly downregulated in human CC tissues and several CC cell lines. Transfection of miR-124 mimics in CC cell lines HeLa and SiHa markedly inhibits cell proliferative, migratory and invasive capacities, as well as the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process in vitro. Further studies have identified astrocyte-elevated gene-1 (AEG-1) as a direct target gene of miR-124. miR-124 downregulated AEG-1 expression through interaction with its 3'-untranslated regions (3'-UTRs), and miR-124 expression was inversely correlated with AEG-1 levels in CC specimens. Moreover, exogenous overexpression of AEG-1 significantly rescued the miR-124-induced inhibition of cell proliferation, migration and invasion, as well as the EMT process in HeLa cells. In conclusion, these findings suggested that miR-124 was able to suppress cell proliferation, invasion and migration, as well as the EMT process in cervical carcinomas through directly targeting AEG-1. miR-124 and AEG-1 may be potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of cervical carcinoma.
27570452	Microwave-assisted green synthesis of superparamagnetic nanoparticles using fruit peel extracts: surface engineering, T 2 relaxometry, and photodynamic treatment potential.	Superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) have the potential to be used as multimodal imaging and cancer therapy agents due to their excellent magnetism and ability to generate reactive oxygen species when exposed to light. We report the synthesis of highly biocompatible SPIONs through a facile green approach using fruit peel extracts as the biogenic reductant. This green synthesis protocol involves the stabilization of SPIONs through coordination of different phytochemicals. The SPIONs were functionalized with polyethylene glycol (PEG)-6000 and succinic acid and were extensively characterized by X-ray diffraction analysis, field emission scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy, Rutherford backscattering spectrometry, diffused reflectance spectroscopy, fluorescence emission, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy, and magnetization analysis. The developed SPIONs were found to be stable, almost spherical with a size range of 17-25 nm. They exhibited excellent water dispersibility, colloidal stability, and relatively high R 2 relaxivity (225 mM(-1) s(-1)). Cell viability assay data revealed that PEGylation or carboxylation appears to significantly shield the surface of the particles but does not lead to improved cytocompatibility. A highly significant increase of reactive oxygen species in light-exposed samples was found to play an important role in the photokilling of human cervical epithelial malignant carcinoma (HeLa) cells. The bio-SPIONs developed are highly favorable for various biomedical applications without risking interference from potentially toxic reagents.
27569095	In vitro anticancer and cytotoxic activities of some plant extracts on HeLa and Vero cell lines.	PURPOSE: The aim of our study was to evaluate the effect of in vitro anticancer and cytotoxic activity of the methanolic extracts of 14 medicinal plants, 8 of which are endemic species in Anatolia, against the human HeLa cervical cancer cell line and to compare to the normal African green monkey kidney epithelial cell line (Vero) using the MTT colorimetric assay. METHODS: Values for cytotoxicity measured by MTT assay were expressed as the concentration that causes 50% decrease in cell viability (IC50, mug/mL). The degree of selectivity of the compounds can be expressed by its selectivity index (SI) value. High SI value (>2) of a compound gives the selective toxicity against cancer cells (SI = IC50 normal cell/IC50 cancer cell). RESULTS: Dose-dependent studies revealed IC50 of 293 mg/mL and >1000 mg/mL for Cotinus coggygria Scop., IC50 of 265 mug/mL and >1000 mg/mL for Rosa damascena Miller, IC50 of 2 mug/mL and 454 mg/mL for Colchicum sanguicolle K.M. Perss, IC50 of 427 mug/mL and >1000 mug/mL for Centaurea antiochia Boiss. var. praealta (Boiss & Bal) Wagenitz on the HeLa cells and the Vero cells, respectively. Four plants showed significant SI values which were 227 for Colchicum sanguicolle K.M. Perss (endemic species), >3.8 for Rosa damascena Miller, >3.4 for Cotinus coggygria Scop. and >2.3 for Centaurea antiochia Boiss. var. praealta (Boiss & Bal)Wagenitz (endemic species). CONCLUSION: According to our study, 4 methanolic extracts of 14 tested plants exhibit greater activity on the HeLa cell line and little activity on the Vero cell line, meaning that these plants can be evaluated for potential promising anticancer activity.
27569088	Prevalence of HPV genotypes in cervical adenocarcinoma: a study in Greek women.	PURPOSE: To study the prevalence of human papillomavirus (HPV) genotypes among cervical adenocarcinomas in Greek women. METHODS: The study group comprised 78 adenocarcinoma cases (20 in situ and 58 invasive). HPV DNA was amplified using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and HPV genotypes were identified by reverse hybridization. RESULTS: There was a high prevalence of HPV infection both for in situ (95%) or invasive (94.83%) adenocarcinomas, comprising also cancers of unusual morphology. HPV 16 was the commonest strain (N=57, 73.08%) followed by HPV 18 (N=28, 35.90%). Interestingly, 13 cases (16.67%) were also HPV 52 positive (as co-infection with HPV 16 or 18). All other strains with the exception of HPV 66 were found only as co-infections. No significant age difference was noted in terms of any HPV strain positivity. CONCLUSIONS: HPV DNA was found in the large majority of cervical adenocarcinomas. As opposed to other studies, HPV 52 was the third most commonly encountered strain after HPV 16 and HPV 18. The above findings would probably be of help in decision making concerning vaccination policy for the prevention of HPV infection in Greece.
27569087	Association of human papillomavirus infection with cytology, colposcopy, histopathology, and risk factors in the development of low and high-grade lesions of the cervix.	PURPOSE: Persistent human papilloma virus (HPV) infection is fundamental for the development of intraepithelial neoplasia and cervical cancer. The aim of this study was to examine the association between HPV infection and cervical cytology, colposcopy, biopsy and the risk factors entailed. METHODS: The study included 784 patients tested by in situ hybridization for HPV type 6/11, 16/18 and 31/33/35 infection. The participants were divided into three categories according to the presence of high squamous intraepithelial lesions (H-SIL), low squamous intraepithelial lesions (L-SIL) and benign histologic findings. RESULTS: Patients that had L-SIL and H-SIL demonstrated a significantly higher percentage of HPV infection than patients with benign histologic findings. The percentage of H-SIL was highest in patients infected with high risk (HR)-HPV types 16/18, who had sexual intercourse before the age of 16 years, with two to five sexual partners. CONCLUSION: Among high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia, there is a high prevalence of HR-HPV types 16/18, which is associated with the number of sexual partners and early sexual activity. There was a significant association between the presence of abnormal cytology and HR-HPV 16/18 in both groups (H-SIL and L-SIL). Benign colposcopic findings were not found in any patient with H-SIL, where no patient had only one sexual partner.
27566652	Human Uterine Cervical Stromal Stem Cells (hUCESCs): Why and How they Exert their Antitumor Activity.	Our research team has recently isolated and characterized a new stromal stem cell line (hUCESCs) obtained from cytological smears, as routinely performed for cervical cancer screening. We have, furthermore, described that both hUCESCs directly, as well as the secretome contained in the conditioned medium used for growing them (hUCESCs-CM) have potent antitumoral, anti-inflammatory, antibiotic, antimycotic and re-epitheliasation-enhancing properties. The scientific explanation our team proposes for these pleiotropic effects are directly related to the site of origin of hUCESCs, the human cervical transition zone, which has unique features that biologically justify the different actions of hUCESCs and hUCESCs-CM. We, herein, expose our working theory for the biological activity of hUCESCs and hUCESCs-CM.
27566032	Prognostic factors of gingival-alveolar squamous cell carcinoma of the maxilla.	OBJECTIVES: To determine prognostic factors in gingivo-alveolar squamous cell carcinoma of the maxilla (GA-SCC-M), and particularly the prognostic value of both vertical and antero-posterior tumor spread. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Our retrospective study included all naive-treatment patients treated in our center between 2006 and 2013 for GA-SCC-M. Posterior involvement was considered when the tumor extended behind the mesial side of the first maxillary molar. Spread posterior to the maxillary tuberosity was defined by the spread to at least one of the following structures: pterygomaxillary fissure, pterygoid muscles, and processes. Involvement of the maxillary sinus floor, nasal fossa, and orbital floor was assessed, concerning the vertical spread. RESULTS: A radiological tumor spread to the nasal fossa, maxillary sinus floor, and orbital floor were prognostic factors independently of age, cervical lymph node metastasis and positive margins in multivariate analysis (p < 0.05). Radiological suggested spread tended to be noticeably more predictive of a poor prognosis than histological proven tumoral spread. The prognosis was not significantly different between clinical tumoral spread anteriorly or posteriorly to the first molar (p = 0.46). The prognosis was not worsened, even in case of radiological suggested spread posterior to the maxillary tuberosity (p = 0.09). CONCLUSION: A vertical radiological spread of GA-SCC-M was a prognostic factor but not the extension posteriorly to the maxillary tuberosity. T4b tumors were mostly resectable, proving that a T4b stage was not predictive of unresectability in GA-SCC-M of the maxilla.
27566027	Prognostic factors and adjuvant therapy on survival in early-stage cervical adenocarcinoma/adenosquamous carcinoma after primary radical surgery: A Taiwanese Gynecologic Oncology Group (TGOG) study.	OBJECTIVE: We aimed to identify prognostic factors of early-stage cervical adenocarcinoma (AC) and adenosquamous carcinoma (ASC) treated with primary radical surgery, and to evaluate the impact of postoperative adjuvant therapy on outcome. METHODS: The clinical-pathological data of all patients (n = 1132) with stages I-II cervical AC/ASC treated with primary radical surgery at the member hospitals of the Taiwanese Gynecologic Oncology Group were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS: In multivariate analysis, stage II, deep stromal invasion (DSI), lymphovascular space invasion (LVSI), positive pelvic lymph node (PLN), and parametrial involvement (PI) were significant factors for recurrence-free survival (RFS), while only DSI, PI, and positive PLN were independent factors for cancer-specific survival (CSS). Low- and high-risk groups were defined by prognostic scores derived from the four factors (DSI, LVSI, positive PLN, PI) selected by internal validation. Postoperative adjuvant therapy significantly improved outcome for PLN-positive patients (RFS, p = 0.014; CSS, p = 0.016), but not for PLN-negative high-risk group because of higher mean prognostic score (p = 0.028) of adjuvant+ than adjuvant- patients. CONCLUSIONS: PLN metastasis, PI, DSI, and LVSI were independent prognostic factors. Prospective studies of postoperative adjuvant therapy with prognostic score and nodal status stratification for cervical AC/ASC are necessary.
27566023	Lower-extremity lymphedema following management for endometrial and cervical cancer.	BACKGROUND: Despite the alleged benefits conferred by a lymphadenectomy in the management of gynecologic malignancies, there are concerns regarding the development of postoperative lower-extremity lymphedema. The purpose of this study was to identify the incidence of lymphedema and associated risk factors in accordance with surgical staging during the management of endometrial and cervical cancer. METHOD: We conducted a 5-year review of all endometrial and cervical cancer patients who underwent a lymphadenectomy. The subjects' demographics, medical co-morbidities, diagnosis, surgical treatment, inclusion of adjuvant radiotherapy and incidence of lower-extremity lymphedema were noted. RESULTS: We identified 165 (135 endometrial cancer and 30 cervical cancer) subjects. Positive pelvic and para-aortic lymph nodes were present in 21 (12.7%) and 10 patients (6.1%), respectively. In the entire population, 6 (3.6% incidence) subjects developed post-operative lymphedema. Supplementary analyses revealed that a BMI >35 kg/m(2) and possessing numerous (>/=3) co-morbidities significantly correlated with the manifestation of lower-extremity lymphedema. CONCLUSION: In the current investigation, we observed a reasonably low, overall incidence of postoperative lower-extremity lymphedema. Nevertheless, when evaluating the potential for lymphedema in patients for whom a lymphadenectomy is indicated, specific risk factors should be considered in an effort to attenuate the development of this morbid condition.
27564398	Cluster analysis of dynamic contrast enhanced MRI reveals tumor subregions related to locoregional relapse for cervical cancer patients.	BACKGROUND: Solid tumors are known to be spatially heterogeneous. Detection of treatment-resistant tumor regions can improve clinical outcome, by enabling implementation of strategies targeting such regions. In this study, K-means clustering was used to group voxels in dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance images (DCE-MRI) of cervical cancers. The aim was to identify clusters reflecting treatment resistance that could be used for targeted radiotherapy with a dose-painting approach. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Eighty-one patients with locally advanced cervical cancer underwent DCE-MRI prior to chemoradiotherapy. The resulting image time series were fitted to two pharmacokinetic models, the Tofts model (yielding parameters Ktrans and nue) and the Brix model (ABrix, kep and kel). K-means clustering was used to group similar voxels based on either the pharmacokinetic parameter maps or the relative signal increase (RSI) time series. The associations between voxel clusters and treatment outcome (measured as locoregional control) were evaluated using the volume fraction or the spatial distribution of each cluster. RESULTS: One voxel cluster based on the RSI time series was significantly related to locoregional control (adjusted p-value 0.048). This cluster consisted of low-enhancing voxels. We found that tumors with poor prognosis had this RSI-based cluster gathered into few patches, making this cluster a potential candidate for targeted radiotherapy. None of the voxels clusters based on Tofts or Brix parameter maps were significantly related to treatment outcome. CONCLUSION: We identified one group of tumor voxels significantly associated with locoregional relapse that could potentially be used for dose painting. This tumor voxel cluster was identified using the raw MRI time series rather than the pharmacokinetic maps.
27562595	Terpenoid bioactive compound from Streptomyces rochei (M32): taxonomy, fermentation and biological activities.	The present study emphasized the production of biologically active terpenoid compound from Streptomyces rochei M32, which was isolated from Western Ghats ecosystem, South India. The presence of resistant genes like mecA, vanA of Staphylococcus aureus and bla SHV, bla TEM of Pseudomonas aeruginosa was confirmed by molecular studies. The isolated compound from Streptomyces rochei M32 inhibited wide range of standard and clinical drug resistant pathogens and enteric pathogens. The rice bran supplemented basal medium influenced the active compound production on 8th day of fermentation and yielded 1875 mg of crude extract from 10 g of rice bran substrate. Purification and characterization of crude ethyl acetate extract was achieved by preparative thin layer chromatography. The active fraction was identified as terpenoid class compound by chemical screening. Based on the results of spectral studies (NMR, LC-MS, FTIR, etc.), the active compound was tentatively identified as 1, 19-bis (3-hydroxyazetidin-1-yl) nonadeca-5, 14-diene-1, 8, 12, 19-tetraone with molecular weight 462.41 g/mol. Minimum inhibitory concentration value ranges between 7.6 and 31.2 microg/mL against test organisms was observed. The cytotoxicity results on cervical cancer (HeLa) cell line showed IC50 value of 2.034 microg/mL. The corresponding compound is not previously reported from any microbial resources.
27562047	[Predictive value of sonographic features in preoperative evaluation of medullary thyroid carcinoma].	OBJECTIVE: To summarize ultrasound features associated with medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) and investigate the predictive value of ultrasonography in preoperative diagnosis of MTC. METHODS: The sonographic and clinical data were studied in a series of nodules histologically proven as MTC collected from January 1993 to January 2013. RESULTS: A total of 86 patients (92 nodules proven as MTC) were enrolled in the study with an average age of (47+/-12) years.Among the MTCs, 21.7%(20/92) were excluded because of missing data and the remained 78.3%(72/92) had complete data with the average diameter of (2.1+/-1.3) cm.The common US findings for MTC were solid, hypoechogenicity, regular sharp, well-defined margin, AP/ TR<1 and calcification (mostly microcalcification). Calcification and vascularization were more common in MTC nodules(48.6% vs 5.6%, P=0.001). Nodules with enlargement of cervical lymph node tended to be undergone FNAB(76.0% vs 55.3%, P=0.084), and ill-defined margin was more common in MTC nodules with cervical lymph node metastasis(36.4% vs 12.8%, P=0.009). CONCLUSION: Despite having a few US features closely linked to the malignant nodules such as solid, hypoechogenicity and with microcalcification, the MTC nodules also have specific US imaging characteristics as regular sharp, well-defined margin and AP/ TR<1.
27557899	MicroRNA epigenetic signatures in human disease.	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short non-coding RNAs that act as important regulators of gene expression as part of the epigenetic machinery. In addition to posttranscriptional gene silencing by miRNAs, the epigenetic mechanisms also include DNA methylation, histone modifications and their crosstalk. Epigenetic modifications were reported to play an important role in many disease onsets and progressions and can be used to explain several features of complex diseases, such as late onset and fluctuation of symptoms. However, miRNAs not only function as a part of epigenetic machinery, but are also epigenetically modified by DNA methylation and histone modification like any other protein-coding gene. There is a strong connection between epigenome and miRNome, and any dysregulation of this complex system can result in various physiological and pathological conditions. In addition, miRNAs play an important role in toxicogenomics and may explain the relationship between toxicant exposure and tumorigenesis. The present review provides information on 63 miRNA genes shown to be epigenetically regulated in association with 21 diseases, including 11 cancer types: cardiac fibrosis, cardiovascular disease, preeclampsia, Hirschsprung's disease, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, temporal lobe epilepsy, autism, pulmonary fibrosis, melanoma, acute myeloid leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, colorectal, gastric, cervical, ovarian, prostate, lung, breast, and bladder cancer. The review revealed that hsa-miR-34a, hsa-miR-34b, and hsa-miR-34c are the most frequently reported epigenetically dysregulated miRNAs. There is a need to further study molecular mechanisms of various diseases to better understand the crosstalk between epigenetics and gene expression and to develop new therapeutic options and biomarkers.
27557412	Update on the College of American Pathologists Experience With High-Risk Human Papillomavirus Proficiency Testing for Cytology.	CONTEXT: - Since 2008, the College of American Pathologists has provided the human papillomavirus for cytology laboratories (CHPV) proficiency testing program to help laboratories meet the requirements of the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988. OBJECTIVES: - To provide an update on trends in proficiency testing performance in the College of American Pathologists CHPV program during the 4-year period from 2011 through 2014 and to compare those trends with the preceding first 3 years of the program. DESIGN: - Responses of laboratories participating in the CHPV program from 2011 through 2014 were analyzed using a nonlinear mixed model to compare different combinations of testing medium and platform. RESULTS: - In total, 818 laboratories participated in the CHPV program at least once during the 4 years, with participation increasing during the study period. Concordance of participant responses with the target result was more than 98% (38 280 of 38 892). Overall performance with all 3 testing media-ThinPrep (Hologic, Bedford, Massachusetts), SurePath (Becton, Dickinson and Company, Franklin Lakes, New Jersey), or Digene (Qiagen, Valencia, California)-was equivalent (P = .51), and all 4 US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved platforms-Hybrid Capture 2 (Qiagen), Cervista (Hologic), Aptima (Hologic), and cobas (Roche Molecular Systems, Pleasanton, California)-outperformed laboratory-developed tests, unspecified commercial kits, and other (noncommercial) methods in ThinPrep medium (P < .001). However, certain off-label combinations of platform and medium, most notably Cervista with SurePath, demonstrated suboptimal performance (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: - Laboratories demonstrated proficiency in using various combinations of testing media and platforms offered in the CHPV program, with statistically significant performance differences in certain combinations. These observations may be relevant in the current discussions about FDA oversight of laboratory-developed tests.
27556664	Multidisciplinary Management of Salivary Gland Cancers.	BACKGROUND: Salivary carcinomas are a rare group of biologically diverse neoplasms affecting the head and neck. The wide array of different histological entities and clinical presentations has historically limited attempts to establish well-defined treatment algorithms. In general, low-risk lesions can be managed with a single treatment modality, whereas advanced lesions require a more complex, multidisciplinary approach. METHODS: The relevant literature was reviewed, focusing on diagnostic and treatment algorithms for salivary malignancies. RESULTS: Salivary carcinomas with high-risk features require an aggressive treatment approach with complete surgical resection, neck dissection to appropriate cervical lymph-node basins, and postoperative radiotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: The heterogeneity of salivary neoplasms represents a unique clinical challenge. Despite the multidisciplinary management paradigm detailed in this review, outcomes for advanced disease are unsatisfactory. Future progress will likely require the addition of novel systemic therapeutic strategies.
27554015	The variable clinicopathological categories and role of human papillomavirus in cervical adenocarcinoma: A hospital based nation-wide multi-center retrospective study across China.	We investigated HPV in adenocarcinoma presenting and managed as cervical adenocarcinoma (CADC) at seven major representative regional cancer centres across China. From 1,051 CADC cases diagnosed locally in 2005-2010, 881 had available paraffin embedded tissue. Initial review excluded 154 cases as other diagnoses or inappropriate specimens. In 718 eligible cases consensus panel pathology diagnosis was made using an algorithm incorporating p16 and progesterone receptor immunohistochemistry (IHC). Classification of cervical adenocarcinoma categories was subject to substantial pathological disagreement. High-risk human papillomaviruses (HR-HPV) DNA was studied by the sensitive SPF10 PCR-DEIA-LiPA25 version 1 for L1 genes and type-specific HR-HPV E6/7 gene PCR's. HR-HPV prevalence in whole tissue samples in eligible tested CADC was 74.5%: 100.0% in neuro-endocrine carcinoma (NEC), 82.2% in classical cervical adenocarcinoma (ADC-CX), 40.0% in adenocarcinoma-not otherwise specified (ADC-NOS) and 33.3% in endometrioid adenocarcinoma (ADC-ENDO). Higher mean age at diagnosis correlated with histological categories showing low HPV prevalence (Linear regression: beta= -13.794, p < 0.001). HPV-16 and 18 were associated with early development of CADC and a lower mean age correlated with carcinogenic risk of associated HPV (beta = -0.1829, p < 0.001). HPV-16 or HPV-18 was found in 88.2% of all HPV positive cases including multiple-infections. HPV-18 was the commonest HPV type in NEC (58.3%), ASC (40.2%) and ADC-CX (40.9%). The proportion of HPV-unrelated CADC and in different final histological categories varied geographically and by age. Although HPV negativity was predominantly associated with special categories of CADC, some HPV-negative usual adenocarcinomas indistinguishable by adjudicated microscopic diagnosis from ADC-CX were found and varied in frequency across China.
27553069	Bacteremia due to Citrobacter braakii: A case report and literature review.	Among the Citrobacter genus, the most commonly isolated bacteria from human specimens are Citrobacter freundii and Citrobacter koseri, and previous cases of infection due to Citrobacter braakii have been rarely reported. We present a case of bacteremia due to C. braakii in a 38-year-old woman with cervical cancer. She was admitted to our hospital with complaints of a fever, chills, and nausea. Blood culture results showed gram-negative bacilli identified as C. braakii via matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry analysis, although biochemical testing findings were suggestive of C. freundii. Since a rare pathogen was detected in the present case and the results of additional biochemical studies were suggestive of both C. braakii and Citrobacter farmeri, genetic analysis was conducted. Finally, the gram-negative bacilli were confirmed as C. braakii, a member of the C. freundii complex since 1993, by 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing analysis. The gastrointestinal tract was considered the portal of entry, because the patient had a rectal fistula and other cultures such as urine and vaginal discharge incubated species other than C. braakii. The patient recovered after receiving treatment with ciprofloxacin for 14 days. The epidemiology and clinical characteristics of C. braakii infection are still unknown because of the limitations in accurate identification by using currently available commercial biochemical testing and previously, only 6 cases of C. braakii infection have been reported. Physicians should focus on this species, because it causes community-acquired infections, although further studies are needed to clarify the clinical characteristics of C. braakii infections.
27549328	Attitudes towards human papillomavirus vaccination among African parents in a city in the north of England: a qualitative study.	BACKGROUND: Human papillomavirus (HPV) is sexually transmitted and has been conclusively linked to cervical cancer and genital warts. Cervical cancer is attributed to approximately 1100 deaths annually in UK, and is the second most common female cancer globally. It has been suggested that black African women are more predisposed to HPV infection and cervical cancer. A vaccine has been developed to reduce HPV infection, and in the UK, has been offered to 12-13 year old adolescent girls through schools as part of their childhood immunization programme since 2008. Upon programme initiation, it was noted that vaccine uptake was lower in schools where girls from ethnic minority groups were proportionately higher. The study's objectives were to explore factors influencing UK based African parents' acceptance or decline of the HPV vaccine, whether fathers and mothers share similar views pertaining to vaccination and any interfamily tensions resulting from differing views. METHODS: A qualitative study was conducted with five African couples residing in north England. Face to face semi-structured interviews were carried out. Participants were parents to at least one daughter aged between 8 and 14 years. Recruitment was done through purposive sampling using snowballing. RESULTS: HPV and cervical cancer awareness was generally low, with awareness lower in fathers. HPV vaccination was generally unacceptable among the participants, with fear of promiscuity, infertility and concerns that it's still a new vaccine with yet unknown side effects cited as reasons for vaccine decline. There was HPV risk denial as religion and good cultural upbringing seemed to result in low risk perceptions, with HPV and cervical cancer generally perceived as a white person's disease. Religious values and cultural norms influenced vaccine decision-making, with fathers acting as the ultimate decision makers. Current information about why the vaccine is necessary was generally misunderstood. CONCLUSION: Tailored information addressing religious and cultural concerns may improve vaccine acceptability in African parents.
27548148	Trichostatin A Enhances the Apoptotic Potential of Palladium Nanoparticles in Human Cervical Cancer Cells.	Cervical cancer ranks seventh overall among all types of cancer in women. Although several treatments, including radiation, surgery and chemotherapy, are available to eradicate or reduce the size of cancer, many cancers eventually relapse. Thus, it is essential to identify possible alternative therapeutic approaches for cancer. We sought to identify alternative and effective therapeutic approaches, by first synthesizing palladium nanoparticles (PdNPs), using a novel biomolecule called saponin. The synthesized PdNPs were characterized by several analytical techniques. They were significantly spherical in shape, with an average size of 5 nm. Recently, PdNPs gained much interest in various therapies of cancer cells. Similarly, histone deacetylase inhibitors are known to play a vital role in anti-proliferative activity, gene expression, cell cycle arrest, differentiation and apoptosis in various cancer cells. Therefore, we selected trichostatin A (TSA) and PdNPs and studied their combined effect on apoptosis in cervical cancer cells. Cells treated with either TSA or PdNPs showed a dose-dependent effect on cell viability. The combinatorial effect, tested with 50 nM TSA and 50 nMPdNPs, had a more dramatic inhibitory effect on cell viability, than either TSA or PdNPs alone. The combination of TSA and PdNPs had a more pronounced effect on cytotoxicity, oxidative stress, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), caspase-3/9 activity and expression of pro- and anti-apoptotic genes. Our data show a strong synergistic interaction between TSA and PdNPs in cervical cancer cells. The combinatorial treatment increased the therapeutic potential and demonstrated relevant targeted therapy for cervical cancer. Furthermore, we provide the first evidence for the combinatory effect and cytotoxicity mechanism of TSA and PdNPs in cervical cancer cells.
27548144	MicroRNA-331-3p Suppresses Cervical Cancer Cell Proliferation and E6/E7 Expression by Targeting NRP2.	Aberrant expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) is involved in the development and progression of various types of cancers. In this study, we investigated the role of miR-331-3p in cell proliferation and the expression of keratinocyte differentiation markers of uterine cervical cancer cells. Moreover, we evaluated whether neuropilin 2 (NRP2) are putative target molecules that regulate the human papillomavirus (HPV) related oncoproteins E6 and E7. Cell proliferation in the human cervical cancer cell lines SKG-II, HCS-2, and HeLa was assessed using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetr azolium, inner salt (MTS) assay. Cellular apoptosis was measured using the TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) and Annexin V assays. Quantitative RT-PCR was used to measure the messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of the NRP2, E6, E7, p63, and involucrin (IVL) genes. A functional assay for cell growth was performed using cell cycle analyses. Overexpression of miR-331-3p inhibited cell proliferation, and induced G2/M phase arrest and apoptosis in SKG-II, HCS-2 and HeLa cells. The luciferase reporter assay of the NRP2 3'-untranslated region revealed the direct regulation of NRP2 by miR-331-3p. Gene expression analyses using quantitative RT-PCR in SKG-II, HCS-2, and HeLa cells overexpressing miR-331-3p or suppressing NRP2 revealed down-regulation of E6, E7, and p63 mRNA and up-regulation of IVL mRNA. Moreover, miR-331-3p overexpression was suppressed NRP2 expression in protein level. We showed that miR-331-3p and NRP2 were key effectors of cell proliferation by regulating the cell cycle, apoptosis. NRP-2 also regulates the expression of E6/E7 and keratinocyte differentiation markers. Our findings suggest that miR-331-3p has an important role in regulating cervical cancer cell proliferation, and that miR-331-3p may contribute to keratinocyte differentiation through NRP2 suppression. miR-331-3p and NRP2 may contribute to anti-cancer effects.
27548122	The Role of Natural Polyphenols in the Prevention and Treatment of Cervical Cancer-An Overview.	Cervical cancer represents the second leading cause of death for women worldwide. The importance of the diet and its impact on specific types of neoplasia has been highlighted, focusing again interest in the analysis of dietary phytochemicals. Polyphenols have shown a wide range of cellular effects: they may prevent carcinogens from reaching the targeted sites, support detoxification of reactive molecules, improve the elimination of transformed cells, increase the immune surveillance and the most important factor is that they can influence tumor suppressors and inhibit cellular proliferation, interfering in this way with the steps of carcinogenesis. From the studies reviewed in this paper, it is clear that certain dietary polyphenols hold great potential in the prevention and therapy of cervical cancer, because they interfere in carcinogenesis (in the initiation, development and progression) by modulating the critical processes of cellular proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, angiogenesis and metastasis. Specifically, polyphenols inhibit the proliferation of HPV cells, through induction of apoptosis, growth arrest, inhibition of DNA synthesis and modulation of signal transduction pathways. The effects of combinations of polyphenols with chemotherapy and radiotherapy used in the treatment of cervical cancer showed results in the resistance of cervical tumor cells to chemo- and radiotherapy, one of the main problems in the treatment of cervical neoplasia that can lead to failure of the treatment because of the decreased efficiency of the therapy.
27546189	Association of human papillomavirus type 16 and its genetic variants with cervical lesion in Korea.	Persistent human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV16) is the major risk factor for cervical cancer. HPV16 intratypic variants differ in their geographical distribution and oncogenic potential. This study aimed to analyze the distribution of HPV16 variants and their association with cervical lesion histopathology in Korean women. In total, 133 HPV16-positive cervical samples from women admitted to Seoul National University Boramae Hospital were analyzed by sequencing E6, E7, and L1 genes and the long control region (LCR), and the variant distribution according to cervical lesion grade was determined. Isolates were grouped into a phylogenetic lineage, and A1-3, A4, C, and D sublineages were detected in 54.1, 37.8, 0.7, and 7.4% of samples, respectively. The most commonly observed LCR variations were 7521G>A (91.5%), 7730A>C (59.6%), and 7842G>A (59.6%). Furthermore, A4 or D sublineage-positive women had a higher risk for cervical cancer than women who were positive for A1-3. Among HPV phylogenetic clusters, A1-3 was the predominant sublineage, and within A1-3, the 350G polymorphism was highly frequent. These results differed from those of previous studies in Korea and other Asian countries. The findings suggest that cervical neoplasia incidence in HPV16-infected patients could be affected by the distribution of HPV16 variants in the population.
27546053	The utility of thyroglobulin washout studies in predicting cervical lymph node metastases: One academic medical center's experience.	BACKGROUND: Fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) is useful for evaluating cervical lymph nodes for metastases from thyroid carcinomas. Reports have illustrated that with application of standardized technique and appropriate cutoffs, thyroglobulin (TG) washout studies increase the sensitivity and specificity of FNAC in identifying lymph node metastases. This project describes our experience at an academic medical center utilizing needle wash thyroglobulin analyses as an ancillary to FNAC. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed cases at our institution where thyroglobulin analysis was performed in conjunction with FNA of lymph nodes in patients with thyroid carcinoma. Thyroglobulin levels were measured on needle rinses from each FNA biopsy that appeared negative or equivocal at the time of immediate assessment. These results were compared with surgical pathology results from neck dissections, when performed. RESULTS: 168 FNA biopsies were performed on suspicious lymph nodes from 97 patients with known or suspected thyroid malignancy between April 2013 and present. Using a cutoff of 1.0 ng TG/ml, thyroglobulin studies performed at our institution were found to have sensitivity and specificity results of 0.95. Surgical pathology results were used as the gold standard. When surgical pathology results are not available, FNAC is used as the mode of comparison. False positive Tg results occurred in two prethyroidectomy patients suggesting that sample contamination with blood may influence this method's specificity. A false-negative Tg result occurred in a lymph node with <1 mm focus of metastatic PTC, indicating that Tg results may not be sensitive in cases with few tumor cells. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that thyroglobulin washout studies improve the quality of our biopsy diagnoses when used in conjunction with FNA in the assessment of metastatic disease in the context of established thyroid malignancy in post-thyroidectomy patients. Thyroglobulin values close to the cutoff of 1.0 ng/ml should be interpreted with caution, as these may represent a minute focus of metastatic tumor. Tg values in prethyroidectomy patients should also be interpreted with caution, as contamination with blood may cause its elevation. Diagn. Cytopathol. 2016;44:964-968.

27544688	DJ-1 Expression in Cervical Carcinoma and its Effects on Cell Viability and Apoptosis.	BACKGROUND This study aimed to investigate the expression of DJ-1 in cervical carcinoma and its effects on cell viability and apoptosis. MATERIAL AND METHODS Cervical carcinoma cell line Hela and 85 tissue samples, including 45 primary tumor biopsies, 30 para-carcinoma tissues, and 10 normal cervical tissues samples were used in this study. The expressions of DJ-1 in cervical carcinoma tissue, para-carcinoma tissue, and normal tissue samples were investigated by immunohistochemistry. DJ-1 expression in Hela cells was also investigated by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blot. DJ-1 was interfered and transfected with siRNA, then cell viability and apoptosis were assayed by MTT and flow cytometry, respectively. Additionally, the expressions of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), AKT, and phospho-AKT (P-AKT) were detected. RESULTS Immunohistochemistry results showed that DJ-1 was highly expressed in cervical carcinoma tissues. In Hela cells, the expression of DJ-1 was significantly higher than that in normal controls (P<0.05). When cells were treated with DJ-1 siRNA, the cell viability decreased significantly (P<0.05), and the percentage of apoptosis cells increased significantly (P<0.05). In addition, the expressions of PTEN and AKT were significantly higher in the DJ-1 siRNA treatment group than those in the control group (P<0.05). The expression of p-AKT was significantly lower in the DJ-1 siRNA treatment group than in the control group and the DJ-1 over-expression group (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS The aberrant up-regulation of DJ-1 expression might be an important step in the pathogenesis of cervical carcinoma.
27543984	Knowledge of Patients' Human Papillomavirus Status at the Time of Cytologic Review Significantly Affects the Performance of Cervical Cytology in the ATHENA Study.	OBJECTIVES: With human papillomavirus (HPV) testing, patients' HPV status may be known when reviewing cytology specimens. METHODS: 41,955 women 25 years or older had cytology and HPV screening. Originally, cytology was reviewed blinded to HPV status. We re-reviewed unblinded to HPV status a subset of 428 cytology slides from women with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 + (CIN2+) and 1,287 from women without CIN2+. RESULTS: Of the original interpretations of atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US), 33.7% were downgraded to negative after unblinded review, and 8.7% were upgraded to atypical squamous cells, cannot rule out a high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion or high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion. Of the original interpretations of ASC-US, 66.7% were downgraded on unblinded review in HPV-negative women and 30.2% were upgraded in HPV 16+/HPV 18+ women. Unblinding increases the sensitivity for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3+ of cotesting from 54.1% to 62.4% (P = .0015) and the sensitivity of HPV primary screening from 72.2% to 77.1% (P = .0029). With cotesting, specificity with unblinding is improved, whereas with HPV primary screening, there would be a small decrease in specificity. CONCLUSIONS: Unblinded cytology increases overall sensitivity with either cotesting or HPV primary screening; specificity is either slightly improved or is not affected by unblinding.
27541596	Will cervical screening remain cost-effective in women offered the next generation nonavalent HPV vaccine? Results for four developed countries.	A next generation nonavalent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine ("HPV9 vaccine") is being introduced in several countries. The aims of this study were to evaluate whether cervical screening will remain cost-effective in cohorts offered nonavalent vaccines and if so, to characterize the optimal number of screening tests. We used a dynamic model of HPV vaccination and cervical screening to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of strategies involving varying numbers of primary HPV tests per lifetime for cohorts offered the nonavalent vaccine as 12 year-olds. For each of four countries-the USA, New Zealand (NZ), Australia and England-we considered local factors including vaccine uptake rates (USA/NZ uptake approximately 50%; Australia/England uptake >70%), attributable fractions of HPV9-included types, demographic factors, costs and indicative willingness-to-pay (WTP) thresholds. Extensive probabilistic sensitivity analysis was performed. We found that, in the USA, four screens per lifetime was the most likely scenario, with 34% probability of being optimal at WTP US$50,000/LYS, increasing to 84% probability at US$100,000/LYS. In New Zealand, five screens per lifetime was the most likely scenario, with 100% probability of being optimal at NZ$42,000/LYS, given the assumptions used. In Australia, two screens per lifetime was the most likely scenario, with 62% probability of being optimal at AU$50,000/LYS. In England, four screens per lifetime was the most likely scenario, with 32% probability of being optimal at GB pound20,000/LYS, increasing to 96% probability at GB pound30,000/LYS. We conclude that some cervical screening will remain cost-effective, even in countries with high vaccination coverage. However, the optimal number of screens may vary between countries.
27541373	Prior human papillomavirus-16/18 AS04-adjuvanted vaccination prevents recurrent high grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia after definitive surgical therapy: Post-hoc analysis from a randomized controlled trial.	We evaluated the efficacy of the human papillomavirus (HPV)-16/18 AS04-adjuvanted vaccine in preventing HPV-related disease after surgery for cervical lesions in a post-hoc analysis of the PApilloma TRIal against Cancer In young Adults (PATRICIA; NCT00122681). Healthy women aged 15-25 years were randomized (1:1) to receive vaccine or control at months 0, 1 and 6 and followed for 4 years. Women were enrolled regardless of their baseline HPV DNA status, HPV-16/18 serostatus, or cytology, but excluded if they had previous or planned colposcopy. The primary and secondary endpoints of PATRICIA have been reported previously; the present post-hoc analysis evaluated efficacy in a subset of women who underwent an excisional procedure for cervical lesions after vaccination. The main outcome was the incidence of subsequent HPV-related cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or greater (CIN2+) 60 days or more post-surgery. Other outcomes included the incidence of HPV-related CIN1+, and vulvar or vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN/VaIN) 60 days or more post-surgery. Of the total vaccinated cohort of 18,644 women (vaccine = 9,319; control = 9,325), 454 (vaccine = 190, control = 264) underwent an excisional procedure during the trial. Efficacy 60 days or more post-surgery for a first lesion, irrespective of HPV DNA results, was 88.2% (95% CI: 14.8, 99.7) against CIN2+ and 42.6% (-21.1, 74.1) against CIN1+. No VIN was reported and one woman in each group had VaIN2+ 60 days or more post-surgery. Women who undergo surgical therapy for cervical lesions after vaccination with the HPV-16/18 vaccine may continue to benefit from vaccination, with a reduced risk of developing subsequent CIN2+.
27538012	New Cytotoxic Bibenzyl and Other Constituents from Bauhinia ungulata L. (Fabaceae).	A new bibenzyl, 2'-hydroxy-3,5-dimethoxy-4-methylbibenzyl (1) and four known compounds identified as 2'-hydroxy-3,5-dimethoxybibenzyl (2), liquiritigenin (3), guibourtinidol (4) and fisetinidol (5) were isolated from the roots of Bauhinia ungulata L. Phytochemical investigations of the stems of B. ungulata led to the isolation of the known compounds identified as liquiritigenin (3), guibourtinidol (4), fisetinidol (5), taraxerol (6), betulinic acid (7), taraxerone (8), glutinol (9), a mixture of sitosterol (10) and stigmasterol (11), pacharin (12), naringenin (13) and eriodictyol (14). The structures of these compounds were elucidated on the basis of their spectral data (IR, MS, 1D- and 2D-NMR). The cytotoxicity of the bibenzyl 1 has been evaluated against four human cancer cell lines, showing the IC50 values of 4.3 and 6.5 mug ml-1 against pro-myelocytic leukemia (HL-60) and cervical adenocarcinoma (HEP-2) cell lines, respectively. This article also registers for the first time the 13 C-NMR data of the known bibenzyl 2.
27537583	Factors involved in the delay of treatment initiation for cervical cancer patients: A nationwide population-based study.	Cervical cancer ranks as the fourth leading cause of cancer death in women worldwide. In Taiwan, although the universal health insurance system has achieved 99.9% coverage and ensured easy access to medical care, some cervical cancer patients continue to delay initiation of definitive treatment after diagnosis. This study focused on cervical cancer patients who delayed treatment for at least 4 months, and examined the characteristics, related factors, and survival in these patients.Data on patients with a new confirmed diagnosis of cervical cancer by the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) staging system between 2005 and 2010 were obtained from the National Health Insurance Research Database and the Taiwan Cancer Registry. Logistic regression analysis was performed to analyze the association of various factors with treatment delay. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to analyze the effects of various factors on mortality risk.The rate of treatment delay for cervical cancer decreased steadily from 6.46% in 2005 to 2.48% in 2010. Higher rates of treatment delay were observed among patients who were aged >/=75 years (9.91%), had severe comorbidity, had stage IV (9.50%), diagnosing hospital level at nonmedical center, or at public hospital ownership. Factors that correlated with treatment delay were age >/=75 years (odds ratio [OR] = 2.42), higher comorbidity Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) 4-6, or >/=7 (OR = 1.60, 2.00), cancer stage IV (OR = 2.60), the diagnosing hospital being a regional, district hospital, or other (OR = 3.00, 4.01, 4.60), and at public hospital ownership. Those who delayed treatment had 2.31 times the mortality risk of those who underwent timely treatment (P < 0.05).Delayed cervical cancer treatment in Taiwan was associated with age, comorbidity, cancer stage, diagnosing hospital level, and hospital ownership. Delaying treatment for >/=4 months substantially raised mortality risk in cervical cancer patients.
27537557	Pancreatic metastasis of angiosarcoma (Stewart-Treves syndrome) diagnosed using endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration: A case report.	BACKGROUND: Pancreatic involvement of angiosarcoma is extremely rare. METHODS: We herein report a rare case of angiosarcoma associated with chronic lymphedema (Stewart-Treves syndrome) with pancreatic metastasis that was diagnosed using endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)/fine needle aspiration (FNA). RESULTS: A 43-year-old woman with a history of radical hysterectomy with bilateral inguinal lymphadenectomy and chemoradiotherapy for cervical cancer 15 years prior noticed the presence of erythematous indurative plaques on her right femoral region, where chronic lymphedema had developed. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) revealed not only multiple nodules in the subcutaneous tissue of the right femoral region but also a 25 mm x 20 mm solid mass in the region of the pancreatic tail. A histological analysis of the specimens obtained using EUS/FNA revealed angiosarcoma that was immunohistochemically positive for platelet/endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 but negative for cytokeratin. The patient was diagnosed as Stewart-Treves syndrome that had metastasized to the pancreas. Chemotherapy was performed, but the patient died 14 months after her diagnosis. CONCLUSION: Unfortunately, this patient was not followed up, even though she had chronic lymphedema of the right femoral region due to the repeated occurrence of phlegmon. To improve the survival rate of this fatal secondary malignant complication of radical lymphadenectomy, an early diagnosis with consecutive and long-term clinical follow-up and close monitoring for Stewart-Treves syndrome is therefore important.
27534652	Inhibition of microRNA-181a may suppress proliferation and invasion and promote apoptosis of cervical cancer cells through the PTEN/Akt/FOXO1 pathway.	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous, non-coding, small RNAs, which play a critical role in regulating varieties of the biological and pathologic processes. miR-181a has been reported to participate in tumorigenic progression. However, the roles of miR-181a in cervical cancer (CC) are still unknown. The aim of this research was to explore the effects and molecular mechanism of miR-181a in CC cells. In this paper, the levels of miR-181a in CC cell lines were determined by real-time PCR. We found that the levels of miR-181a were evidently enhanced in CC cell lines compared with normal cervical epithelium cells. Then, the miR-181a inhibitor was transiently transfected into HeLa and CaSKi cells using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent. Subsequently, the Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) and BrdU-ELISA results showed that down-regulation of miR-181a inhibited the cell viability and proliferation. Our data also demonstrated that miR-181a inhibitor arrested cell cycle progression of HeLa and CaSKi cells by up-regulation of p21 and p27 expressions. In addition, inhibition of miR-181a promoted apoptosis of HeLa and CaSKi cells due to increasing Bax expression and decreasing Bcl-2 expression. Ultimately, the effect of miR-181a inhibitor on the PTEN/Akt/FOXO1 signaling pathway was investigated by Western blot. From our results, down-regulation of miR-181a increased the expression of PTEN and decreased phosphorylation of Akt and FOXO1. Altogether, miR-181a might be an oncogene in CC cells. The potential mechanism was that inhibition of miR-181a might suppress proliferation and invasion and promote apoptosis of HeLa and CaSKi cells by modulating the PTEN/Akt/FOXO1 signaling pathway.
27531273	[New challenges to the treatment of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia].	Due to the progress of intracavitary afterloading technology and dosage of brachytherapy, a similar dose distribution as that of cervical conization can be achieved and can be applied to the treatment of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), it is called "afterloading conization" . Being adjusted the radioactive source movement and weight, low exposure doses to the ovary, endometrium and vagina can be assured. So a high quality of life after treatment could be maintained and overcomes the shortcomings of cervical conization and hysterectomy, such as anesthesia, bleeding, over or insufficient treatment, early ovarian ageing and operative complications.
27530463	Adenocarcinoma of the cervix involving the fallopian tube mucosa: report of a case.	BACKGROUND: Fallopian tube involvement by cervical carcinoma has rarely been documented, with literature reports focusing primarily on squamous cell carcinoma. CASE PRESENTATION: In this report, we present the case of a 50 year old woman who presented with an abnormal Pap test with atypical squamous and glandular cells. A loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP) was performed and led to the diagnosis of stage IB1 endocervical adenocarcinoma. Subsequent radical hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, and bilateral pelvic lymph node dissection showed a well-differentiated endocervical adenocarcinoma of usual type with superficial spread to the endometrium and right fallopian tube. The patient received no adjuvant therapy and has remained without evidence of disease. CONCLUSIONS: While the advent of more extensive fallopian tube sampling has led to increased discovery and discussion of fallopian tube involvement by metastatic carcinoma, its impact on treatment and prognosis remains to be seen.
27529156	Diagnostic Value of Visual Examination of Cervical Polypoid Lesions and Predictors of Misdiagnosis.	OBJECTIVES: This study reviews occasions when cervical polyps removed in an outpatient setting proved not to be cervical polyps histologically. We aimed to identify any anatomical and/or clinical characteristics that predict 'incorrect diagnosis" in general practice. METHODS: A retrospective study of consecutive 345 patients who were initially diagnosed with cervical polyps based on a routine gynecological examination in an outpatient setting was included. After histopathological examination, the patients were divided into 2 groups: those with cervical (correct diagnosis, n = 307) and falsely diagnosed with cervical polyps (FDP, n = 38). These 2 groups were compared in terms of age, signs and symptoms, and size of the polypoid lesions. RESULTS: The initial clinical diagnosis was correct in 307, giving a positive predictive value of 89%. There were no significant difference between the groups with respect to age of patients (p = 0.59) and the size of the lesions (p = 0.42). According to our study, among misdiagnosed patients, nabothian cysts and cervicitis were the most common histological findings; FDPs were more often symptomatic (p < 0.001) and coexisted more frequently with inflammation or ulceration (p < 0.001). All FDPs were developing within the endocervical canal. There were no instances of FDPs that arise from ectocervix. Symptomatic polypoids have a higher risk of preliminary misdiagnosis (OR = 13.0; 95% confidence interval, 3.0-55.1). CONCLUSIONS: All cervical polypoid lesions must be sent to pathology because visual diagnosis is not sufficiently accurate to direct patient care.
27528387	Oncologic and obstetric outcomes of early stage cervical cancer with abdominal radical trachelectomy: Single-institution experience.	AIM: Radical trachelectomy (RT) is a widely used fertility-sparing treatment for patients with early cervical cancer (CCA). RT, however, is an investigational treatment, and its gynecological and obstetric efficacy are being investigated. We retrospectively assessed the efficacy of abdominal RT (ART) as a fertility-sparing surgery. METHODS: From 2010 to 2014, patients with stage IA2-IB1 CCA (tumor </=2 cm) who wished to preserve their fertility underwent ART. The major outcomes were mortality, recurrence, pregnancy complications, and obstetric outcome. RESULTS: Twenty-eight patients received ART. Adjuvant chemotherapy was performed in seven patients because of lymphovascular space invasion. During the median follow-up of 43 months, no recurrences occurred. Twelve women attempted to conceive, and eight of them became pregnant. A total of five children were born, and one baby was full term. Three cases of second trimester, and one case of third trimester preterm births were recorded. CONCLUSIONS: Fertility was preserved after ART in a moderate number of patients. The pregnancy and birth rates after ART have been improving, and increasing the full-term birth rate is the next goal. In addition, development of further types of minimally invasive surgery for CCA can be expected.
27527826	Risk of HSIL (CIN 2-3) on colposcopic biopsy is minimal in postmenopausal women with LSIL on cytology and a negative HRHPV test.	BACKGROUND: Current cervical cancer screening guidelines recommend a 1-year follow-up period for patients with a postmenopausal low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) who are test negative for high-risk human papillomavirus (HrHPV). The aim of this study was to assess whether such patients had an increased immediate risk of high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion. METHODS: We assessed 54 HrHPV-negative women with postmenopausal LSIL in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology of our hospital between 2012 and 2013. All patients underwent liquid-based cytology and reflex HrHPV testing (for human papillomavirus [HPV] types 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59, 66, and 68). Colposcopic examination and guided biopsy were performed by the same gynecologist (MO). RESULTS: The average age of the patients was 53.1 +/- 3.2 years. There were 33 patients (61%) with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) grade 1 and 21 who were non-dysplastic. None of the patients was positive for CIN 2 or any other lesions. CONCLUSIONS: If the HPV test is negative, repeat cytology after 12 months is recommended by the American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology for cases of HrHPV-negative postmenopausal LSIL. We recommend reflex HPV testing as the best choice for patients who test positive for postmenopausal LSIL by Pap smear, in line with the literature. Diagn. Cytopathol. 2016;44:969-974.

27527160	1-(2-Hydroxy-5-methylphenyl)-3-phenyl-1,3-propanedione Induces G1 Cell Cycle Arrest and Autophagy in HeLa Cervical Cancer Cells.	The natural agent, 1-(2-hydroxy-5-methylphenyl)-3-phenyl-1,3-propanedione (HMDB), has been reported to have growth inhibitory effects on several human cancer cells. However, the role of HMDB in cervical cancer remains unclear. Herein, we found that HMDB dose- and time-dependently inhibited growth of HeLa cervical cancer cells, accompanied with G1 cell cycle arrest. HMDB decreased protein expression of cyclins D1/D3/E and cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) 2/4/6 and reciprocally increased mRNA and protein levels of CDK inhibitors (p15, p16, p21, and p27), thereby leading to the accumulation of hypophosphorylated retinoblastoma (Rb) protein. HMDB also triggered the accumulation of acidic vesicles and formation of microtubule-associated protein-light chain 3 (LC3), followed by increased expression of LC3 and Beclin-1 and decreased expression of p62, suggesting that HMDB triggered autophagy in HeLa cells. Meanwhile, suppression of the expression of survivin and Bcl-2 implied that HMDB-induced autophagy is tightly linked to apoptosis. Exploring the action mechanism, HMDB induced autophagy via the modulation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and mTOR signaling pathway rather than the class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway. These results suggest that HMDB inhibits HeLa cell growth by eliciting a G1 arrest through modulation of G1 cell cycle regulators and by concomitantly inducing autophagy through the mediation of AMPK-mTOR and Akt-mTOR pathways, and may be a promising antitumor agent against cervical cancer.
27526956	Virological and cytological clearance in laser vaporization and conization for cervical intra-epithelial neoplasia grade 3.	AIM: Cervical intra-epithelial neoplasia (CIN) is the precancerous stage of cervical cancer. Standard treatment for high-grade CIN is conization of the cervix. The risk of preterm birth following conization has been discussed recently. In contrast, laser vaporization is believed not to affect perinatal outcome, but the long-term effectiveness of each surgical procedure is still unclear. The aim of this prospective unmatched-cohort study was therefore to compare virological and cytological clearance and recurrence risk between conization and vaporization for CIN3. METHODS: Subject consisted of CIN3 patients treated at the present hospital between 2007 to 2011 and followed up until December 2014. One hundred and one patients were treated with laser conization, and 137 with vaporization. The surgical procedure was selected on the basis of colposcopy, pathological grade and patient's hope for pregnancy. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in cure rate, human papilloma virus (HPV) clearance rate or recurrence rates between the conization and vaporization groups. Risk ratio of recurrence for each surgical procedure adjusted for age and HPV persistence status were analyzed on Cox proportional hazards modeling. Recurrence risk ratio for patients treated by vaporization was 6.21 (95%CI: 0.65-59.19; P = 0.111) compared with conization and there were no significant differences. No adverse pregnancy outcome was observed in the vaporization group compared with conization. CONCLUSIONS: Laser vaporization is useful for young patients with CIN3 who hope for pregnancy in the future.
27525949	cDNA cloning, characterization, and pharmacologic evaluation of anticancer activity of a lectin gene in Pinellia integrifolia.	Plant lectins are proteins that possess at least one non-catalytic domain, which could reversibly bind to specific monosaccharides or oligosaccharides. The important roles played by plant lectins in immune regulation, signaling pathways, and plant defense could be attributed to their specific binding activities with carbohydrates. In this study, a Pinellia integrifolia lectin gene, designated pia, was cloned using rapid amplification of cDNA ends. The open reading frame (ORF) of pia was constructed into the pET-28a vector, and a 33-kDa recombinant protein was induced in Escherichia coli BL21. The hemagglutination and anticancer properties of the purified recombinant protein were assayed in vitro. The results indicated that the full-length cDNA of pia was 1210 bp long, containing an 807-bp ORF encoding a 268-amino acid peptide. The putative P. integrifolia lectin protein (PIA) contained three mannose-binding sites. The agglutinating activity exhibited by PIA was inhibited by D-mannose. PIA was also shown to exert an anti-proliferative activity against nasopharyngeal carcinoma, human cervical carcinoma, and human breast cancer cell lines in vitro. These results could be applied to determine the function of PIA in the future.
27525910	Association between IL-10 genetic variations and cervical cancer susceptibility in a Chinese population.	We conducted an investigation into the role of the IL-10 polymorphisms -592A/C (rs1800872), -819C/T (rs1800871), and -1082A/G (rs1800896) in cervical cancer risk in a Chinese population. A case-control study was carried out, including 165 newly diagnosed cervical cancer patients and 165 control subjects. The polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism method was used to genotype the three IL-10 variant loci. Using conditional logistic regression analysis, we observed that homozygous IL-10 -819C/T TT carriers were at significantly increased risk of cervical cancer compared to homozygous CC individuals, with an adjusted odds ratio (OR) of 2.23 and a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 1.16-4.30. Moreover, the CT+TT genotype was significantly associated with cervical cancer in comparison to the wild-type variant (OR = 1.69, 95%CI = 1.04-2.76; P = 0.03). In conclusion, our study suggests that the IL-10 -819C/T genetic variation may contribute to cervical cancer risk in the Chinese population examined.
27524032	Antioxidant, DNA interaction, VEGFR2 kinase, topoisomerase I and in vitro cytotoxic activities of heteroleptic copper(II) complexes of tetrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidines and diimines.	A series of heteroleptic mononuclear copper(II) complexes of the type [Cu(L(1-3))(diimine)]ClO4 (1-6) containing three tetrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidine core ligands, ethyl 5-methyl-7-(2-hydroxyphenyl)-4,7-dihydrotetrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidine-6-carboxylate (HL(1)), ethyl 5-methyl-7-(4-diethylamino-2-hydroxyphenyl)-4,7-dihydrotetrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidine -6-carboxylate (HL(2)) or ethyl 5-methyl-7-(2-hydroxy-4-nitrophenyl)-4,7-dihydrotetrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidine-6-carb oxylate (HL(3)), and two diimine coligands, 2,2'-bipyridyl (bpy) or 1,10-phenanthroline (phen) have been synthesized and characterized by spectral methods. The geometry of complexes have been determined with the help of electronic absorption and EPR splitting patterns, which suggest four coordinated square planar geometry around copper(II) ion. The lowering of HOMO-LUMO band gap value of complex 4 implies its higher biological activity compared to other complexes. Antioxidant studies revealed that the complexes possess considerable radical scavenging potency against DPPH. The binding studies of the complexes with calf thymus DNA (CT-DNA) revealed groove mode of binding, which was further supported by docking simulation. The complexes 3 and 4 strongly inhibit the topoisomerase I, and also strongly interact with VEGFR2 kinase receptor via pi-pi, sigma-pi and hydrogen bonding interaction. Gel electrophoresis experiments demonstrated the ability of the complexes to cleave plasmid DNA in the absence of activators. In vitro cytotoxic activities of the complexes were examined on three cancerous cell lines such as human lung (A549), cervical (HeLa) and colon (HCT-15), and two normal cells such as human embryonic kidney (HEK) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). The live cell and fluorescent imaging of cancer cells were observed with acridine orange/ethidium bromide staining assay. All encouraging chemical and biological findings indicate that the complex 4 is a suitable candidate for drug target.
27524002	Improved efficacy of cisplatin in combination with a nano-formulation of pentacyclic triterpenediol.	Cisplatin is widely used for the treatment of various cancers including cervical, ovarian, lung and head and neck, however, its clinical success is limited owing to the dose-dependent adverse effects, mainly nephrotoxicity and neurotoxicity. In order to address this limitation, the present study was undertaken to investigate growth inhibitory effect of cisplatin in combination with a triterpenediol (3a, 24-dihydroxyurs-12-ene and 3a, 24-dihydroxyolean-12-ene, TPD) on human ovarian cancer cell line. Poly(dl-lactic-co-glycolic) acid nanoparticles loaded with TPD (TPD-PLGA-NPs) were successfully developed by emulsion solvent evaporation method. The TPD-PLGA-NPs were characterized for size distribution and zeta potential which was in order of 152.56+/-3.01nm and -17.36+/-0.37mV respectively. The morphological evaluation was carried out by transmission electron microscopy and the formulation was also characterized using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The drug loading of the optimized formulation was 51.03+/-1.52mug/mg and the formulation exhibited sustained drug release profile. The in vitro cellular uptake study of coumarin-6 loaded PLGA nanoparticles in OVCAR-5 cells demonstrated a time dependent increase in uptake efficiency. Further, growth inhibitory effect of cisplatin was investigated in combination with TPD-PLGA-NPs. The combination index (CI) was <1, indicating a synergistic interaction. Further, at 75% of cell growth inhibition (ED75) the dose of cisplatin was reduced to 3.8 folds using this combination. The results indicated the potential of cisplatin and TPD-PLGA-NPs combination in order to reduce to dose limiting toxicities of the former.
27523454	Defining risk groups of patients with cancer of unknown primary site and cervical nodal metastases by F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography and computed tomography imaging.	We sought to investigate the clinical utility of F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography and computed tomography (PET/CT) in Taiwanese patients with cancer of unknown primary site (CUP) and cervical nodal metastases. We also aimed to study the impact of F-18 FDG PET/CT on clinical treatment priority in this patient group. Between September 2006 and May 2014, patients with CUP and cervical nodal metastases who underwent F-18 FDG PET/CT imaging study were retrospectively identified. The clinicopathological risk factors and PET parameters were analyzed in relation to 2-year overall survival (OS) rates using univariate and multivariate analyses. Two-year OS curves were plotted with the Kaplan-Meier method. Of the eligible patients (n = 54), 12 (22.2%) had distant metastases (DM) at presentation. A total of 13 (24.1%) and 15 (27.8%) primary tumors were identified by FDG PET/CT imaging and an additional triple biopsy, respectively. The results of multivariate analysis identified smoking [p = 0.033, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.197-40.342], a maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) of cervical nodes >/= 14.2 (p = 0.035, 95% CI = 1.134-28.029), and DM at presentation (p = 0.031, 95% CI = 1.257-114.854) as independent predictors of 2-year OS. Specifically, patients who carried >/= 2 risk factors showed poorer outcomes (70.3% vs. 11.8%, p < 0.001). Fifteen study patients (27.8%) had their treatment modified by FDG PET/CT findings. We conclude that FDG PET/CT is clinically useful in CUP patients not only for tumor staging, but also for modifying treatment regimens.
27523423	[Radiotherapy of cervix and endometrial carcinoma].	External irradiation and brachytherapy still have a major place in the treatment of cervix and endometrial carcinoma. This review presents the French guidelines in terms of preparation and choice of irradiation techniques of these gynecological malignancies.
27522713	[Melanoma and Human Papillomaviruses: Is There an Outlook for Study?].	Melanoma is one of the most aggressive human malignant tumors. Its incidence and mortality are growing steadily. Ultraviolet irradiation is the main risk factor for melanoma involved in melanomagenesis. The probability of viral etiology of melanoma has been discussed. Human papillomaviruses (HPV) have been mentioned among candidates for its etiologic agents because some HPV types are the powerful carcinogens causing cervical cancer and other cancers. The review analyses the literature data on the association of melanoma with HPV Several groupsfound HPVin skin melanomas as well as in mucosa; viruses of high oncogenic risk were detected in some cases. For some organs the etiological role of high-risk HPV as inducers of invasive carcinomas is confirmed. These organs require special mention: cervix uteri, vulva, vagina, penis, anal region, and oral cavity. However in the majority of the studies in which viral DNA-positive melanomas were found, testing for viral genome expression was not done while this is the fact of primary importance. HPVare found in normal skin and mucous membranes thus creating justifiable threat of tumor specimen contamination with viral DNA in vivo. There are limited data on aggravation of the disease prognosis in papillomavirus-positive melanomas. However, any systematic observation of a sizeable patient group distinguished by that tumor type has not been performed yet. Viral E6 and E7 oncogenes of high-risk papillomaviruses were shown to be able to transform normal human melanocytes in vitro experiments. Thus, we can assume the presence of the association of melanoma with oncogenic HPV. The clinical significance of this problem is indisputable under the conditions of the steady increase in melanoma incidence and mortality rates in Russia and abroad. The problem requires further study.
27521334	Bone mineral density in women treated for various types of gynecological cancer.	AIM: Patients with gynecologic cancer frequently experience bone loss due to cancer treatments, including bilateral oophorectomy, chemotherapy and radiotherapy. This study evaluated treatment-associated changes in bone mineral density (BMD) in women with gynecologic cancer and compared changes among patients with different types of gynecologic cancer. METHODS: BMD of the lumbar spine and femur was retrospectively analyzed using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry in 118 women who underwent treatment for gynecological cancers and 132 women without gynecologic cancers. The cohort included 55 women with cervical cancer who underwent surgery followed by adjuvant chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy, 33 with endometrial cancer (EC) who underwent surgery followed by adjuvant radiation therapy and 30 with ovarian cancer who underwent bilateral oophorectomy followed by adjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy. Lumbar spine and femoral neck BMD were assessed at baseline and 12 months after treatment. Areal BMD, expressed as grams of mineral/cm2 scanned, was compared with that in young healthy women (T-score). RESULTS: Demographic characteristics and pretreatment BMDs, including T-scores, did not differ among cancer types. After adjustment for factors that can affect T-score, cancer type affected change in T-score 12 months after treatment. After adjustment for pretreatment age, parity, BMI and T-score, T-score 12 months after treatment was significantly lower in the EC than in the other groups. CONCLUSIONS: Women treated for gynecological cancer, particularly those with EC who undergo bilateral oophorectomy followed by adjuvant radiation therapy or chemotherapy, should be managed in a timely manner to prevent or minimize bone loss.
27518843	Lack of Agreement Between Endocervical Brush and Endocervical Curettage in Women Undergoing Repeat Endocervical Sampling.	OBJECTIVE: To evaluate agreement between an abnormal endocervical brush (ECB) collected at the time of colposcopy and subsequent endocervical curettage (ECC). METHODS: All women evaluated for lower genital tract disease at a single academic institution were prospectively entered into a database. The database was queried for those who had a colposcopic exam with ECB between April 1, 2013, and June 15, 2015, and who subsequently returned for an ECC to further evaluate eligibility for expectant management or ablative therapy. ECB and ECC results were divided into 2 groups: "low-grade" included low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL) or atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance, and "high-grade" included high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL) or atypical squamous cells-cannot exclude high-grade. Women with atypical glandular cells and unsatisfactory ECB results were excluded. Percent agreement between ECB and ECC was calculated based on these categories. RESULTS: Seventy-nine women were included: 54 (68%) had a low-grade ECB, and 25 (32%) had a high-grade ECB. Of those who had a low-grade ECB, 4 had a low-grade ECC, 3 had a high-grade ECC, and 47 were negative, resulting in an agreement of 7.4% (4/54). Of those who had a high-grade ECB, 1 had a low-grade ECC, 4 had a high-grade ECC, and 20 were negative, resulting in 16% (4/25) agreement. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that there is poor agreement between ECC and ECB in our patient population.
27517527	Immunoglobulin G4-related disease mimicking an epidural spinal cord tumor: case report.	The authors report a case of immunoglobulin G4-related disease (IgG4-RD) presenting as a paraspinal, epidural mass. This disease encompasses a host of autoimmune conditions that were previously thought to be separate entities. It is characterized by fibrosis, mediated by the aberrant proliferation and tissue invasion of IgG4-positive plasma cells, which can occur in any organ. As with other autoimmune conditions, it tends to be responsive to steroids and other immunosuppressants. It can rarely present as a tumefactive lesion of the central nervous system, creating the potential for misdiagnosis (given its similar radiological appearance to malignancy) and mistreatment. In 2015, a panel of experts convened to set forth guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of IgG4-RD. In the case presented here, the patient initially presented with pain and weakness in the left upper extremity. Initial neuroimages revealed a contrast-enhancing mass extending from C-4 to T-1, invading the epidural spinal canal, encasing the exiting nerve roots, infiltrating the paraspinal musculature, and surrounding the left vertebral artery. A PET scan confirmed the mass was hypermetabolic, but results of fine-needle aspiration and CT-guided biopsy were inconclusive. Open biopsy yielded fibrotic tissue that met the pathological criteria for IgG4-RD: lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate, fibrosis in a storiform pattern, and obliterative phlebitis. The patient was treated with 2 doses of 4 mg of dexamethasone (Decadron) and then 50 mg of prednisone per day. Within 2 weeks, the mass was radiologically shown to have drastically decreased in size. The prednisone dose was decreased to 40 mg per day, and 100 mg of azathioprine per day was added. The patient continued to improve and the mass continued to decrease over the next 6 months. Currently, she has been weaned from all steroids and will be maintained on a daily dose of 100 mg of azathioprine.
27515528	Psoas abscess secondary to retroperitoneal distant metastases from squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix with thrombosis of the inferior vena cava and duodenal infiltration treated by Whipple procedure: A case report and review of the literature.	BACKGROUND: Psoas abscess is a rare clinical disease of various origins. Most common causes include hematogenous spread of bacteria from a different primary source, spondylodiscitis or perforated intestinal organs. But rarely some abscesses are related to malignant metastatic disease. CASE PRESENTATION: In this case report we present the case of a patient with known squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix treated with radio-chemotherapy three years prior. She now presented with a psoas abscess and subsequent complete inferior vena cava thrombosis, as well as duodenal and vertebral infiltration. The abscess was drained over a prolonged period of time and later was found to be a complication caused by metastases of the cervical carcinoma. Due to the massive extent of the metastases a Whipple procedure was performed to successfully control the local progress of the metastasis. CONCLUSION: As psoas abscess is an unspecific disease which presents with non-specific symptoms adequate therapy may be delayed due to lack of early diagnostic results. This case report highlights the difficulties of managing a malignant abscess and demonstrates some diagnostic pitfalls that might be encountered. It stresses the necessity of adequate diagnostics to initiate successful therapy. Reports on psoas abscesses that are related to cervix carcinoma are scarce, probably due to the rarity of this event, and are limited to very few case reports. We are the first to report a case in which an extensive and complex abdominal procedure was needed for local control to improve quality of life.
27515281	Synergistic antitumor effect of a human papillomavirus DNA vaccine harboring E6E7 fusion gene and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 gene.	Human papillomavirus (HPV) has been identified as the primary etiological factor in cervical cancer as well as in subsets of anogenital and oropharyngeal cancers. The two HPV viral oncoproteins, E6 and E7, are uniquely and consistently expressed in all HPV-infected cells and are therefore promising targets for therapeutic vaccination. In order to achieve a synergistic antitumor and anti-angiogenesis effect, we designed and constructed a novel DNA vaccine that can express the HPV 16 E6E7 fusion protein and VEGFR2 in the same reading frame. A series of DNA plasmids encoding E6E7, VEGFR2 and their conjugates were constructed and injected into mice. The resultant humoral and cellular immune responses were detected by ELISA and enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT), respectively. To evaluate the antitumor efficacy of these plasmids, tumor-bearing mice expressing the E6E7 fusion protein were constructed. After injection into the tumor-bearing mouse model, the plasmid harboring the E6E7 fusion gene and VEGFR2 showed stronger inhibition of tumor growth than the plasmid expressing E6E7 or VEGFR2 alone, which indicated that the combination of E6E7 and VEGFR2 could exert a synergistic antitumor effect. These observations emphasize the potential of a synergistic antitumor and anti-angiogenesis strategy using a DNA vaccine, which could be a promising approach for tumor immunotherapy.
27514955	Prevalence of high-risk human papilloma virus types and cervical smear abnormalities in female sex workers in Chandigarh, India.	PURPOSE: Cervical cancer is the most common cancer among women in developing nations. Nearly 90% of the cases have been linked to the presence of high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV) types 16 and 18. The risk of cervical cancer may be high in female sex workers (FSWs) due to multiple sexual partners. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of cytological abnormalities and hrHPV types 16 and 18 in FSWs in Chandigarh, North India using the liquid-based cytology (LBC) approach. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The cervical brush samples were collected from 120 FSW and 98 age-matched healthy controls (HCs). These were subjected to pap smear using conventional method, LBC and the detection of hrHPV types 16 and 18 was carried out using polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: The LBC samples showed better cytological details and also reduced the number of unsatisfactory smears from 11% in Pap to 1.5% in the LBC. A significantly higher number of inflammatory smears were reported in FSWs (51.7% vs. 34.7%, P = 0.01). The hrHPV types 16/18 were detected in 33/120 (27.5%) FSW versus 23/98 (23.5%) HCs. The risk of acquiring hrHPV was higher in FSWs, who had age at first sex </=25 years, higher income and the habit of smoking. CONCLUSION: The high prevalence of hrHPV among FSWs and HCs suggests the need for the implementation of effective National Screening Programme for early detection of hrHPV types to decrease the burden of cervical cancer, especially in high-risk population.
27514145	[LOCALLY ADVANCED CERVICAL CANCER IN THE PUERPERIUM--CASE REPORT].	The cervical cancer is the most common gynaecological neoplasma during pregnancy. The average frequency during pregnancy and 1 year post partum is around 1 case per 2 200 pregnancies. The authors present a case of locally advanced cervical cancer (IV stage), diagnosed 30 days after Cesarean section. 5-years survival of this stage is 15%.
27514142	[BENEFITS AND RISKS AT IMPLEMENTATION OF PROPHILACTIC VACCINES FOR CERVICAL CANCER].	The aim of this review is to present the benefits and risks of the implementation of prophylactic vaccines for cervical cancer. The classical understanding of human papilloma virus (HPV) infection and its role for the cervical oncogenesis, as well as, the place of prophylactic HPV vaccines are discussed. Results concerning the effectiveness of vaccines 10 years after their introduction and data about their safety are presented. Reports of the use in practice of the new 9-valent HPV vaccine and the first results of its implementation are studied.
27514129	[CLINICO-MORPHOLOGICAL STUDY OF 68 CASES OF INVASIVE ENDOCERVICAL ADENOCARCINOMA].	UNLABELLED: Recent studies have demonstrate an increase in both relative and absolute frequency of the cervical adenocarcinoma (ECA) with incidence about 10-25% of all cervical malignancy. THE AIM: clinicopathological study of invasive ECA. MATERIALS AND METHOD: From 2007 to end of 2011, 68 cases of invasive ECA were collected. The tumors were classified according the WHO classification of tumors of Tumors of the Female Reproductive Organs 2014. RESULTS: The distribution of different histological types of ECA was as follow: Usual type-29 (42.65%); Endometroid type-15 (22.06%); Adenosquamous type-15 (22.06%); Villoglandular type-6 (8.82%); Signet-ring type-2 (2.94%); and Intestinal type-1(1.47%). The middle age of patients was 45 years and varied in large diapason 27-73 years. A synchrony presence of CIN and glandular dysplasia even to AIS in some cases with usual and adenosquamous type were detected. The clinical and morphological data of every type ECA was analised.
27512849	Peripheral platelet/lymphocyte ratio predicts lymph node metastasis and acts as a superior prognostic factor for cervical cancer when combined with neutrophil: Lymphocyte.	Inflammation-based indicators such as neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR), derived NLR (dNLR), and platelet/lymphocyte ratio (PLR) have been reported to possess significant predictive value for several types of cancer. We investigated the predictive value of these 3 biomarkers on lymph node metastasis (LNM) and clinical outcome in patients with stage Ib1-IIa cervical cancer undergoing radical surgery.A total of 407 patients with FIGO stage Ib1-IIa cervical cancer, who underwent radical surgery between January 2006 and December 2009 at the Department of Gynecological and Oncology of Shandong Cancer Hospital Affiliated to Shandong University were recruited. Binary logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the relationship between PLR, NLR, dNLR, and LNM. Multivariate Cox regression analysis was performed to determine the association between the 3 indices and recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS).Optimal cut-off values for the 3 indices were determined by applying receiver operating curve (ROC) analysis. Univariate and binary logistic regression analyses both indicate that PLR was significantly associated with increased LNM (P < 0.05). In the multivariate survival analysis, increased preoperative PLR and NLR were significantly associated with reduced RFS (P = 0.001 and P = 0.002, respectively), whereas a combination of both PLR and NLR revealed a more significant association with reduced RFS (P < 0.001). Furthermore, increased preoperative PLR and NLR were significantly associated with reduced OS (P = 0.007 and P = 0.009, respectively), whereas the combined use of PLR and NLR revealed a more significant association with reduced OS (P = 0.003).PLR is an independent risk factor for increased LNM and clinical outcome in patients with stage Ib1-IIa cervical cancer. A combination of PLR and NLR may enable better risk stratification for predicting survival.
27511626	Enhancement of active MMP release and invasive activity of lymph node metastatic tongue cancer cells by elevated signaling via the TNF-alpha-TNFR1-NF-kappaB pathway and a possible involvement of angiopoietin-like 4 in lung metastasis.	To study the role of TNF-alpha in tongue cancer metastasis, we made highly metastatic cells from a human oral squamous cell carcinoma cell line (SAS) by repeating the passage in which the cells were injected into a nude mouse tongue and harvested from metastasized cervical lymph nodes. Cancer cells after 5 passages (GSAS/N5) increased invasive activity 7-fold in a TNF-alpha receptor 1 (TNFR1)-dependent manner and enhanced mRNA expression of TNF-alpha and TNFR1. In the highly metastatic cells, NF-kappaB activation was upregulated via elevated phosphorylation of Akt and Ikkalpha/beta in the signaling pathway and secretion of TNF-alpha, active MMP-2 and MMP-9 increased. Suppression of increase of TNF-alpha mRNA expression and MMP secretion by NF-kappaB inhibitor NBD peptide suggested a positive feedback loop in GSAS/N5 cells; TNF-alpha activates NF-kappaB and activated NF-kappaB induces further TNF-alpha secretion, leading to increase of active MMP release and promotion of invasion and metastasis of the cells. GSAS/N5 cells that had been injected into the nude mouse tongue and harvested from metastasized lungs multiplied angiopoietin-like 4 (angptl4) expression with enhanced migration activity, which indicated a possible involvement of angptl4 in lung metastasis of the cells. These results suggest that TNF-alpha and angptl4 promote metastasis of the oral cancer cells, thus, these molecules may be therapeutic targets for patients with tongue cancer.
27510023	Detection of Human Papillomavirus among Women with Atypical Squamous Cells of Undetermined Significance Referred to Colposcopy: Implications for Clinical Management in Low and MiddleIncome Countries.	To determine the prevalence of human papillomavirus (HPV) among women with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US) referred to colposcopy and the implications for clinical management in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC), the present study was conducted. We included 200 women living in Maringa/Brazil referred to colposcopy service between August 2012 and March 2013 due to an abnormal cytology from ASC-US until high-grade intraepithelial lesion (HSIL). HPV was detected and genotyped by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The mean age was 36.8+/-10.5 years, and women with and without ASC-US had similar mean ages (37.4+/-11.5 and 36.4+/-9.96 years, respectively). The highest prevalence of ASC-US occurred at 20-24 years (40%). HPV-DNA was positive in 164 (82.0%) women.Of the 57 women with ASC-US, 30 (52.6%) were HPV-DNA-positive and 21 (70%) were high-risk HPV-positive (HR-HPV); the latter was similar to women without ASC-US (76.9%) but with other abnormal cytological findings present. Our data demonstrated that performing tests for HR-HPV can be used for management of women with ASC-US to support the decision of which women should be referred for an immediate or later colposcopy. The same conclusions can be applied to other LMICs for which HPV testing for primary screening has not been adopted.
27510000	Effects of Application of Social Marketing Theory and the Health Belief Model in Promoting Cervical Cancer Screening among Targeted Women in Sisaket Province, Thailand.	Cervical cancer is a major public health problem in Thailand, being ranked second only to breast cancer. Thai women have been reported to have a low rate of cervical cancer screening (27.7% of the 80% goal of WHO). We therefore aimed to apply the social marketing theory and health belief model in promoting cervical cancer screening in Kanthararom District, Sisaket Province. A total of 92 from 974 targeted women aged 3060 years were randomly divided into two groups. The experimental group underwent application of social marketing theory and a health belief model program promoting cervical cancer screening while the control group received normal services. Two research tools were used: (1) application of social marketing theory and health belief model program and (2) questionnaire used to evaluate perceptions of cervical cancer. Descriptive and inferential statistics including paired sample ttest and independent ttest were used to analyze the data. After the program had been used, the mean score of perception of cervical cancer of experimental group was at a higher level (x=4.09; S.D. =0.30), than in the control group (x=3.82; S.D. =0.20) with statistical significance (p<0.001). This research demonstrated an appropriate communication process in behavioral modification to prevent cervical cancer. It can be recommended that this program featuring social marketing and the health belief model be used to promote cervical cancer screening in targeted women and it can be promoted as a guideline for other health services, especially in health promotion and disease prevention.
27509997	SelfSampling Versus Physicians' Sampling for Cervical Cancer Screening Agreement of Cytological Diagnoses.	BACKGROUND: A major problem with cervical cancer screening in countries which have no organized national screening program for cervical cancer is suboptimal participation. Implementation of selfsampling method may increase the coverage. OBJECTIVE: We determined the agreement of cytological diagnoses made on samples collected by women themselves (selfsampling) versus samples collected by physicians (Physician sampling). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We invited women volunteers to undergo two procedures; cervical selfsampling using the Evalyn brush and physician sampling using a Cervex brush. The women were shown a video presentation on how to take their own cervical samples before the procedure. The samples taken by physicians were taken as per routine testing (Gold Standard). All samples were subjected to Thin Prep monolayer smears. The diagnoses made were according to the Bethesda classification. The results from these two sampling methods were analysed and compared. RESULTS: A total of 367 women were recruited into the study, ranging from 22 to 65 years age. There was a significant good agreement of the cytological diagnoses made on the samples from the two sampling methods with the Kappa value of 0.568 (p=0.040). Using the cytological smears taken by physicians as the gold standard, the sensitivity of selfsampling was 71.9% (95% CI:70.972.8), the specificity was 86.6% (95% CI:85.7 87.5), the positive predictive value was 74.2% (95% CI:73.375.1) and the negative predictive value was 85.1% (95% CI: 84.286.0). Selfsampling smears (22.9%) allowed detection of microorganisms better than physicians samples (18.5%). CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that samples taken by women themselves (selfsampling) and physicians have good diagnostic agreement. Selfsampling could be the method of choice in countries in which the coverage of women attending clinics for screening for cervical cancer is poor.
27509969	Comparison of Two Step LEEP and Cold Conisation For Cervical Intraepithelial Lesions to Decrease Positive Surgical Margins.	PURPOSE: To assess the success rates of two step loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP) compared with conventional cold conization procedures for decreasing positive surgical margins. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was conducted on 70 patients who underwent colposcopic evaluation in Zeynep Kamil Women and Children's Health Training and Research Hospital between 20132015 with indications of CIN 2/3 or persistent CIN 1 for more than 2 years. The study included age matched groups of patients with similar histopathololical lesions who underwent cold conization (n=40) or LEEP (N=30). RESULTS: Comparison of tissue characteristics between the two groups revealed significantly higher deepest depth and lower volume of tissue removed by the two step LEEP. Ectocervical positivity rate was similar between groups (1/39 versus 0/29, P>0.05), while endocervical surgical margin positivity rate was significantly higher in the cold conization group (9/39 versus 0/29, P<0.05). Surgical margin positive cases were significantly older than the cases with negative margins (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Two step LEEP made it easier to reach the squamocolumnar junction in the endocervical region with lower blood loss and applicability in office settings. Our study suggests to use two step approach in cases with high grade and glandular CIN.
27509954	Methyl Donor Status Influences DNMT Expression and Global DNA Methylation in Cervical Cancer Cells.	BACKGROUND: Methyl donor status influences DNA stability and DNA methylation although little is known about effects on DNA methyltransferases. The aim of this study was to determine whether methyldonor status influences DNA methyltransferase (Dnmt) gene expression in cervical cancer cells, and if so, whether there are associated effects on global DNA methylation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The human cervical cancer cell line, C4 II, was grown in complete medium and medium depleted of folate (FM+) and folate and methionine (FM). Growth rate, intracellular folate, intracellular methionine and homocysteine in the extracellular medium were measured to validate the cancer cell model of methyl donor depletion. Dnmt expression was measured by qRT PCR using relative quantification and global DNA methylation was measured using a flow cytometric method. RESULTS: Intracellular folate and methionine concentrations were significantly reduced after growth in depleted media. Growth rate was also reduced in response to methyl donor depletion. Extracellular homocysteine was raised compared with controls, indicating disturbance to the methyl cycle. Combined folate and methionine depletion led to a significant downregulation of Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b; this was associated with an 18% reduction in global DNA methylation compared with controls. Effects of folate and methionine depletion on Dnmt3a and 3b expression were reversed by transferring depleted cells to complete medium. CONCLUSIONS: Methyl donor status can evidently influence expression of Dnmts in cervical cancer cells, which is associated with DNA global hypomethylation. Effects on Dnmt expression are reversible, suggesting reversible modulating effects of dietary methyl donor intake on gene expression, which may be relevant for cancer progression.
27509952	Expression of the p16 and Ki67 in Cervical Squamous Intraepithelial Lesions and Cancer.	PURPOSE: To evaluate the expression of p16 and Ki67 in cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a immunohistochemical study of p16 and Ki67 in 243 cervical tissues 53 nondysplastic lesions, 106 CIN1, 61 CIN2/3 and 23 squamous cell carcinomas. The expression of p16 and Ki67 was interpreted independently by 2 researchers and the sensitivity and specificity to detect clinically significant lesions (>/= CIN2) were determined. RESULTS: The overall agreement results of positive or negative immunostaining of intrainter observer variability were 0.659 for p16 and 0.808 for Ki67. p16 expression was demonstrated in 91.3% of invasive carcinomas, 78.7% of CIN2/3, 10.4% of CIN1 and 9.4% of nondysplasic lesions. The corresponding Ki67 expression was: 100% of all invasive carcinomas, 75.4% of CIN2/3, 22.6% of CIN1, and 11.3% with nondysplasia. The expression was significantly different between CIN2/3 vs CIN1 for both p16 and Ki67 (pvalues <0.001 both), and cancer vs CIN2/3 for Ki67 (pvalue 0.008). The differences were not significant between CIN1 vs nondysplasia (pvalues 1.000 for p16 and 0.130 of Ki67), and cancer vs CIN2/3 for p16 (p value 0.219). The sensitivity and specificity to detect > CIN2 were 84.5% and 90.5% by p16 and 82.1% and 88.6% by Ki67. CONCLUSIONS: The rates for 16 and Ki67 expression were directly associated with the severity of cervical lesions. Significant differences in these markers expression may be useful in cases with equivocal histologic features among cervical intraepithelial lesions, but not between CIN1 and nondysplastic lesions. The two markers had high sensitivity and specificity in determining >CIN2.
27509950	High Risk Human Papilloma Virus Genotypes in Kurdistan Region in Patients with Vaginal Discharge.	BACKGROUND: The human papilloma virus (HPV) is considered as the major risk factor for the development of cervical cancer. This virus is of different genotypes and generally can be classified into high and low risk types. OBJECTIVE: To determine the rate of high risk HPV genotypes in women with vaginal discharge and lower abdominal pain in Kurdistan region, Iraq. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cervical swabs were taken from 104 women. DNA was extracted and the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique was used to determine the presence of high risk genotypes. RESULTS: It was found that 13/104 (12.5%) of the samples were positive for high risk HPV genotypes. Amongst those who were positive, 4/13 (30.7%) were typed as genotype 16 and 7/13 (53.8%) showed mixed genotyping. On the other hand, genotypes 53 and 56 were found in only one sample each. CONCLUSIONS: High risk HPV genotypes are not uncommon and further community based study is needed to determine the prevalence of HPV and its genotypes and plan for prevention of infection.
27509943	Prevalence and Associated Factors of Abnormal Cervical Cytology and HighRisk HPV DNA among Bangkok Metropolitan Women.	BACKGROUND: Many strategies are required for cervical cancer reduction e.g. provision of education cautious sexual behavior, HPV vaccination, and early detection of preinvasive cervical lesions and invasive cancer. Basic health data for cervical cytology/ HPV DNA and associated factors are important to make an appropriate policy to fight against cervical cancer. AIMS: To assess the prevalence of abnormal cervical cytology and/or HPV DNA and associated factors, including sexual behavior, among Bangkok Metropolitan women. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thai women, aged 25to65 years old, had lived in Bangkok for >/=5 years were invited into the study. Liquidbased cervical cytology and HPV DNA tests were performed. Personal data were collected. MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURES: Rates of abnormal cytology and/ or highrisk HPV (HRHPV) and factors associated with abnormal test(s) were studied. RESULTS: Abnormal cytology and positive HRHPV were found in 6.3% (279/4442 women) and 6.7% (295/4428), respectively. The most common abnormal cytology was ASCUS (3.5%) while the most common HRHPV genotype was HPV 16 (1.4%) followed by HPV 52 (1.0%), HPV 58 (0.9%), and HPV 18 and HPV 51 at equal frequency (0.7%). Both tests were abnormal in 1.6% (71/4428 women). Rates of HRHPV detection were directly associated with severity of abnormal cytology: 5.4% among normal cytology and 13.0%, 30.8%, 40.0%, 39.5%, 56.3% and 100.0% among ASCUS, ASCH, AGCNOS, LSIL, HSIL, and SCC, respectively. Some 5% of women who had no HRHPV had abnormal cytology, in which 0.3% had >/= HSIL. Factors associated with abnormal cytology or HRHPV were: age </=40 years, education lower than (for cytology) or higher than bachelor for HRHPV), history of sexual intercourse, and sexual partners >/=2. CONCLUSIONS: Rates for abnormal cytology and HRHPV detection were 6.3% and 6.7% HRHPV detection was directly associated with severity of abnormal cytology. Significant associated factors were age </=40 years, lower education, history of sexual intercourse, and sexual partners >/=2.

27509935	Quality of Life of Patients with Advanced Cervical Cancer before and after Chemoradiotherapy.	BACKGROUND: Cervical cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer among women in India. Understanding quality of life (QOL) in women undergoing chemoradiotherapy for cervical cancer will help in introducing interventions for better care and outcomes in these women. This study assessed QOL before and after chemo radiotherapy in cervical cancer patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This followup study covered sixtyseven newly diagnosed women with advanced cervical cancer (stages 2b to 4b). Structured questionnaires (the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer, EORTC QLQC30 and EORTC QLQCX24) were used to assess the change in QOL after 6 months of treatment. RESULTS: The mean age of women at the time of detection of cervical cancer was 52.3+/-11.29 years (Range 3075 years). Six months survival was 92.53%. The mean global health score of cervical cancer patients after six months of treatment was 59.52, which was significantly higher than the pretreatment score of 50.15 (p=0.00007). Physical, cognitive and emotional functioning improved significantly (p<0.05) after treatment. Fatigue, pain, insomnia and appetite loss improved but episodes of diarrhea increased after treatment. The mean "symptoms score" using EORTC QLQCX24 post treatment was 20.0 which was significantly lower as compared to the pre treatment score 30.0 (p<0.00001). Sexual enjoyment and sexual functioning decreased significantly after treatment. CONCLUSIONS: QOL of newly diagnosed cervical cancer patients improved significantly following chemoradio therapy. Enhancement was also demonstrated on three of the five functional scales of EORTC QLQC30. To further improve QOL, interventions focusing on social and psychological support and physical rehabilitation may be needed.
27509667	[IS THERE A PLACE FOR VIA AND VILI IN OUR PRACTICE].	UNLABELLED: The aim of this review is to discuss the possibilities and disadvantages of the techniques for visual inspection of the uterine cervix with acetic acid (VIA) and with Lugol's iodine (VILI) for early detection of cervical neoplasia. Efficient cervical screening method, approved in practice, is cytology--PAP smear. The lack of organized screening program in Bulgaria is the reason why a lot of cases of cervical cancer are missed or diagnosed late. This raises the question for searching alternative tests to assess the uterine cervix that do not use special techniques and have a reasonable cost. Published results show that VIA and VILI represent an appropriate alternative for cervical screening. The results of VIA and VILI are immediately available and do not require any laboratory processing. CONCLUSION: Both types of visual inspection of the uterine cervix are easy to accomplish, fast--the result is available at the moment of inspection, they do not require special equipment, the correlation between sensitivity and specificity is good and last but not least--they have low price. VIA and VILI have certain position in our practice.
27505047	MicroRNA-148b Acts as a Tumor Suppressor in Cervical Cancer by Inducing G1/S-Phase Cell Cycle Arrest and Apoptosis in a Caspase-3-Dependent Manner.	BACKGROUND The purpose of our study was to investigate the role of microRNA (miR)-148b in cervical cancer. MATERIAL AND METHODS The expression of miR-148b was determined in HPV-16-immortalized cervical epithelial cell line CRL-2614 cells and in cervical cancer cell line HeLa cells. The miR-148b mimics or scrambled RNA were then transfected into Hela cells. Forty-eight hours after transfection, the mRNA expression of miR-148b and DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) were confirmed. Cell proliferation ability (cell viability and colony formation ability), invasion ability, and apoptosis were assessed after transfection with miR-148b mimics or scrambled RNA, as well as the protein expression of cyclin D1 and caspase-3. RESULTS The expression of miR-148b was significantly downregulated in HeLa cells compared with CRL2614 cells (P<0.05), but was statistically upregulated by transfection with miR-148b mimics compared with the cells transfected with scrambled RNA (P<0.05). Also, we found that the expression of DNMT1 was significantly decreased by transfection with miR-148b mimics (P<0.05). Additionally, miR-148b mimics significantly decreased the cell proliferation ability and invasion ability, and statistically induced apoptosis. Furthermore, the expression of cyclin D1 protein was significantly decreased and the expression of caspase-3 protein was significantly increased by miR-148b mimics compared with that in the cells transfected with scrambled RNA (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS Our results suggest that overexpression of miR-148b protects against cervical cancer by inducing G1/S-phase cell cycle arrest and apoptosis through caspase-3-dependent manner, and overexpression of miR-148b might develop a therapeutic intervention for cervical cancer.
27504992	Team Reading (Peer Review) of Suspicious/Positive Slides for Continuous Quality Improvement in Cervical-Vaginal Cytology: A Comparison between Methods and Indicators.	AIM: In 2013, the Local Health Unit Roma 2 ex C screening laboratory introduced a new set of indicators for quality assurance. We compare 2 sets of indicators based on routine multiple readings (peer review) for their ability to identify problems in single-reader accuracy. METHODS: All suspect slides were blindly reviewed by all the cytologists of the laboratory. The standard set of indicators includes interreader Cohen's kappa, positivity rate and atypical squamous cell of undetermined significance/squamous intraepithelial lesion (ASC-US/SIL) ratio. The new set included sensitivity for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia of grade 2 or worse (CIN2+), positive predictive value (PPV) and percentage of positive high-risk (HR)-HPV cases among ASC-US. In order to estimate sensitivity and PPV, we considered all women for whom there was a consensus of negative cytology, negative HR-HPV test, negative colposcopy or negative histology true negative. RESULTS: Kappa values ranged from 0.521 to 0.753, with narrow 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Positivity rate ranged from 73.9 to 85.7 and the ASC-US/SIL ratio from 0.61 to 0.81. Sensitivity for CIN2+ at the low-grade SIL threshold ranged from 85.8 to 94.2, PPV ranged from 14.8 to 19.4, and both had a broad 95% CI. Readers with low sensitivity did not show low kappa values. The percentage proportion of HR-HPV-positives (HR-HPV+) among ASC-US ranged from 39.9 to 43.8% with a narrow 95% CI. CONCLUSION: The proportion of HR-HPV+ among ASC-US cases is a powerful indicator to address in training.
27499229	Curcumin causes DNA damage and affects associated protein expression in HeLa human cervical cancer cells.	Cervical cancer is one of the most common cancers in women worldwide and it is a prominent cause of cancer mortality. Curcumin is one of the major compounds from Turmeric and has been shown to induce cytotoxic cell death in human cervical cancer cells. However, there is no study to show curcumin induced DNA damage action via the effect on the DNA damage and repair protein in cervical cancer cells in detail. In this study, we investigated whether or not curcumin induced cell death via DNA damage, chromatin condensation in human cervical cancer HeLa cells by using comet assay and DAPI staining, respectively, we found that curcumin induced cell death through the induction of DNA damage, and chromatin condensation. Western blotting and confocal laser microscopy examination were used to examine the effects of curcumin on protein expression associated with DNA damage, repair and translocation of proteins. We found that curcumin at 13 microM increased the protein levels associated with DNA damage and repair, such as O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase, early-onset breast cancer 1 (BRCA1), mediator of DNA damage checkpoint 1, p-p53 and p-H2A.XSer140 in HeLa cells. Results from confocal laser systems microscopy indicated that curcumin increased the translocation of p-p53 and p-H2A.XSer140 from cytosol to nuclei in HeLa cells. In conclusion, curcumin induced cell death in HeLa cells via induction of DNA damage, and chromatin condensation in vitro.
27499017	Natural compound oblongifolin C inhibits autophagic flux, and induces apoptosis and mitochondrial dysfunction in human cholangiocarcinoma QBC939 cells.	The compounds, which are obtained from natural plants or microbes may offer potential as one of the strategies for the management of cholangiocarcinoma. Oblongifolin C (OC), a natural small molecule compound extracted and purified from Garcinia yunnanensis Hu, can activate the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway in human cervical cancer cells. However, the direct effects of OC on cholangiocarcinoma cells are not well defined. The effect of OC on cell apoptosis and its underlying mechanisms were investigated in cultured QBC939 cells by the methyl thiazol tetrazolium assay, mitochondrial membrane potential, ATP content and western blot analysis. The present study reported that the in vitro treatment of human cholangiocarcinoma QBC939 cells with different concentrations (5, 10, 20 and 40 microM) of OC decreased cell viability and induced apoptosis in a dosedependent manner. The results of the present study also showed that OCinduced QBC939 cell apoptosis was mediated through the inhibition of autophagy and mitochondrial dysfunction (MtD). Additionally, inhibiting autophagy increased OCinduced apoptosis and MtD, whereas exposure to the autophagy inducer, rapmycin, attenuated these changes. Together, the results of the present study are the first, to the best of our knowledge, to identify OC as a chemotherapeutic agent against human cholangiocarcinoma QBC939 cells in vitro via the regulation of autophagy and MtD.
27498446	Marketing communication in the area of breast and cervical cancer prevention.	BACKGROUND/AIM: Innovative marketing campaigns and promotional activities can successfully contribute to the improvement of public health by raising the level of general knowledge about health issues and benefits that the change of habits, eradication of undesirable behaviour and regular medical controls have. The focus should be on continuous marketing communication through various mass media or direct communication between medical staff and patients. The aim of this paper was to define the role that various communication channels have in the process of informing and educating the target group in case of breast and cervical cancer prevention. METHODS: The survey based on polling a sample of 2,100 female patients of the Serbian Railways Medical Centre was conducted in the period October- December 2013. The questionnaire included questions about demographic characteristics, prevention habits of women, their level of information on that topic and communication channels they prefer. RESULTS: There is a difference among respondents' awareness level about preventive measures depending on demographic and geographical criteria. The results indicate the existence of variations in frequency of performing gynaecological examinations and Pap tests depending on different age, educational and residential groups. Although the largest percentage of women stated familiarity with the way of performing breast self-examination (78%), the majority of them had never performed mammography or ultrasonography (67%). The greatest number of women were informed about the possibility of preventing breast and cervical cancer by posters or brochures in health institutions (71%) and mass media--television on the first place (74%), then specialized magazines about health (48%), radio (48%), web sites about health (42%), and daily newspapers (34%). The respondents consider the Ministry of Health and health institutions as the most responsible subjects for education of women about cancer prevention, while the self-initiative was given the least importance. CONCLUSION: Determined informing habits of the target group, their prevention habits and attitudes on the subject should be used as the basis for planning and implementation of prevention marketing campaigns that would be the most effective.
27498340	Human Papillomavirus Awareness in Haiti: Preparing for a National HPV Vaccination Program.	STUDY OBJECTIVE: Cervical cancer morbidity and mortality are pressing public health issues that affect women in Haiti. To inform efforts to develop a human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination program in Haiti, we sought to understand HPV awareness and willingness to get HPV vaccination in Haiti. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We interviewed a convenience sample of 475 women and men in 2 clinical settings in Port-au-Prince and Leogane, Haiti between April and July 2014. INTERVENTIONS AND MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: HPV awareness and willingness to get HPV vaccine for daughters. RESULTS: Few participants (27%, 130/475) had heard of HPV. Awareness of HPV was higher among respondents with a previous sexually transmitted infection compared with those without a previous sexually transmitted infection (odds ratio, 2.38; 95% confidence interval, 1.10-5.13). Adults who had heard of genital warts were also more likely to be aware of HPV compared with those who had not (odds ratio, 4.37; 95% confidence interval, 2.59-7.38). Only 10% (24/250) of parents had previously heard of HPV vaccine; however, after researchers explained the purpose of the vaccine, nearly all (96%, 240/250) said they would be willing to get HPV vaccine for their daughters if it were available. CONCLUSION: Despite low awareness of HPV in Haiti, interest in HPV vaccination was nearly universal in our study of health care-seeking adults. This high acceptability suggests that HPV vaccination programs instituted in Haiti would be well received.
27496192	Dimethylfumarate induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis via regulating intracellular redox systems in HeLa cells.	Dimethylfumarate (DMF) is cytotoxic to several kinds of cells and serves as an anti-tumor drug. This study was designed to investigate the effects and underlying mechanism of DMF on cervical cancer cells. HeLa cells were cultured and treated with 0, 50, 100, 150, and 200 muM DMF, respectively. After 24 h, cell growth was evaluated using Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay and the cell cycle was examined using flow cytometry. In addition, cell apoptosis was detected by Annexin V/propidium iodide (PI) staining and the expressions of caspase-3 and poly-ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) were detected using western blotting. The redox-related factors were then assessed. Furthermore, all of the indicators were detected in HeLa cells after combined treatment of DMF and N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC, an oxygen-free radical scavenger). The cell number and cell growth of HeLa were obviously inhibited by DMF in a dose-dependent manner, as the cell cycle was arrested at G0/G1 phase (P < 0.05). The apoptotic HeLa cells were markedly increased, and the expression levels of caspase-3 and PARP were significantly increased in a DMF concentration-dependent way (P < 0.05). Meanwhile, loss of big up tri, openPsim, increase in reactive oxygen species and O2.-, and the decrease in catalase activity and glutathione (GSH) level were found after DMF treatment (P < 0.05). All these changes were significantly attenuated and even completely disappeared by adding NAC (P < 0.05). In conclusion, the cytotoxicity of DMF on cell proliferation and apoptosis of HeLa cells was mainly related to the intracellular redox systems by depletion of intracellular GSH.
27495263	Antibacterial, anti-biofilm and anticancer potentials of green synthesized silver nanoparticles using benzoin gum (Styrax benzoin) extract.	This study described a simple and green approach for the synthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) employing benzoin gum water extract as a reducing and capping agent and their applications. The AgNPs were characterized by ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometer, X-ray diffraction pattern, field emission transmission electron microscopy, dynamic light scattering, zeta potential and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The AgNPs showed promising antimicrobial activity against various pathogens (Gram-negative, Gram-positive and fungus) and possessed high free radical scavenging activity (104.5 +/- 7.21 % at 1 mg/ml). In addition, the AgNPs exhibited strong cytotoxicity towards human cervical cancer and human lung cancer cells as compared to the normal mouse macrophage cells. Moreover, the AgNPs possessed anti-biofilm activity against Escherichia coli, and compatibility to human keratinocyte HaCaT cells, which suggests the use of dressing with the AgNPs in chronic wound treatment. Therefore, AgNPs synthesized by benzoin gum extract are comparatively green and may have broad spectrum potential application in biomedicine.
27494810	Magnetic nanowires for rapid and ultrasensitive isolation of DNA from cervical specimens for the detection of multiple human papillomaviruses genotypes.	Detecting human papillomavirus (HPV) is central in diagnosing and monitoring HPV-related disease. However, limited sensitivity and the wide variability of the HPV genome pose challenges in the identification of HPV genes, particularly high-risk types. This study reports the development of polyethyleneimine-conjugated magnetic nanowires (PEI-MNWs) and their use in the isolation, identification, and analysis of multiple genotypes of HPV DNA from cervical cancer specimens. The nanowires are electrochemically doped with a high density of magnetic nanoparticles and biotin moieties during potentiostatic deposition, thereby allowing conjugating cationic branched polymers to direct the attachment of negatively charged DNA molecules with strong magnetic response. For proof of concept, the rapid and ultrasensitive isolation of HPV DNA is performed at concentrations as low as 10pg/mL with an efficiency of >95%. For clinical optimization, the analytical and clinical sensitivity of PEI-MNWs is compared with that of the Roche Cobas 4800 HPV Test and demonstrates excellent correlation for multiple HPV DNA genotypes with superior threshold cycle values. The high sensitivity, specificity, and good reproducibility of PEI-MNWs are particularly well suited for the recovery of DNA and provide significant and clinically meaningful evidence for the early detection and treatment of HPV-associated cancers.
27490700	Clinical Relevance of ASC-H Cytologies: Experience in a Single Tertiary Hospital.	OBJECTIVES: To review the cases of atypical squamous cells (ASC), cannot exclude squamous intraepithelial lesion (ASC-H) diagnosed at a single institution and to discuss the interpretation challenges and clinical management of these cases. STUDY DESIGN: The ASC-H cases diagnosed at our institution from 2006 to 2015 were studied retrospectively; of 159,000 Pap smears, there were 959 cases of ASC of undetermined significance (ASC-US) and 148 cases of ASC-H. We have reviewed the clinical records of the ASC-H cases, and data have been analyzed using SPSS 20.0. RESULTS: Median age was 43.1 years; 49.6% of the patients had previous cervical cytologies, and 55.9% of them were negative. Following ASC-H diagnosis, another smear was obtained in 97.1% of the cases and in 67.6% a biopsy was performed. Biopsy revealed low-grade dysplasia in 18.8% of the cases, high-grade dysplasia in 27.8%, and infiltrating carcinoma in 2.3%. Patients with significant lesions in histology were younger than patients with negative results (p = 0.08). A diagnosis of ASC-H/squamous intraepithelial lesion in the repeated cytology had a sensitivity of 74.2%, specificity of 39.6%, positive predictive value of 44.8%, and negative predictive value of 70% for the diagnosis of dysplasia. CONCLUSIONS: ASC-H diagnosis is associated with a high incidence of histological high-grade lesions. A repeat cytology can aid in the selection of high-risk patients, but there may be false-negative results.
27487950	Carrageenan delays cell cycle progression in human cancer cells in vitro demonstrated by FUCCI imaging.	BACKGROUND: Carrageenan is a sulfated polysaccharide that exists in red seaweeds recently shown to have anticancer properties. Previous findings show various effects of carrageenan suppressing tumor cell growth. One of the hallmarks of cancer is uncontrolled proliferation, a consequence of loss of normal cell-cycle control, that underlies tumor growth. Recently there is an increasing interest in potential anticancer agents that affect cell cycle in cancer cells. Thus, in this study we investigated the effects of carrageenan on the tumor cell cycle. METHODS: Using human cervical carcinoma cells (HeLa) cells as and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), the cytotoxic effects of kappa carrageenan (k-CO) and lambda carrageenan (lambda-CO) at the concentrations of 250-2500 mug/mL were observed. Cell viability was determined using the MTT assay while cell death rates were determined using staining with calcein-AM/propidium iodide. Cell-cycle profile and progression were demonstrated with HeLa cells expressing FUCCI (fluorescence ubiquitination-based cell-cycle indicator) probes (HeLa-FUCCI). RESULTS: Carrageenan had no significant effect on HUVEC (normal cells). In contrast both forms of carrageenan were cytotoxic towards HeLa cells (cancer cells). Furthermore, according to cell-cycle analysis with FUCCI cells, the cell cycle of HeLa cells was delayed in specific phases due to different carrageenan treatments. CONCLUSION: Considering these results, it could be suggested that carrageenan affects the cell-cycle of HeLa cells not only by arresting the cell cycle in specific phases but also by delaying the time needed for the cell to progress through the cell cycle. Additionally, different types of carrageenans have different effects on cell cycle progression. This effect of carrageenan towards cancer cells could possibly be developed into a tumor cell-specific anticancer agent.
27487047	Risk Factors for Parametrial Involvement in Early-Stage Cervical Cancer and Identification of Patients Suitable for Less Radical Surgery.	BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to determine risk factors associated with parametrial involvement (PI) and to identify the subgroup of patients at low risk for PI. METHODS: The study comprised 565 patients with early-stage cervical cancer, who underwent radical hysterectomy with pelvic node dissection at Songklanagarind Hospital between 1987 and 2011. Analysis was performed to determine factors associated with PI. RESULTS: Overall, 24 (4.25%) women had PI. PI was more common in patients with non-squamous cell carcinoma, deep stromal invasion (DSI), tumor size > 2 cm, lymphovascular space invasion (LVSI), and pelvic node involvement. Multivariate analysis showed that DSI (p < 0.001) and tumor size > 2 cm (p < 0.001) were independently associated with PI. PI was linked with decreased recurrence-free (p < 0.001) and overall (p = 0.002) survival. Of 347 patients with tumor size </= 2 cm and no DSI, only 1 (0.29%) had PI. CONCLUSION: These findings confirm that PI in early-stage cervical cancer is uncommon. Risk factors associated with PI were DSI and tumor size > 2 cm. PI is a predictor of cervical cancer recurrence and decreased survival. Less radical surgery may be considered in low-risk patients.
27485253	Evaluation of synergistic effects of sulforaphene with photodynamic therapy in human cervical cancer cell line.	Sulforaphene from cruciferous vegetable has shown to modulate various signaling pathways of apoptosis. But it has not yet been studied extensively for the cervical cancer treatment. Previous studies show the promising role of photodynamic therapy for cervical cancer. Here, we confirm that sulforaphene can synergistically enhance the efficacy of photodynamic therapy. Human cervical cancer cells HeLa were treated with a very low dose of sulforaphene (2.0 mug/ml) and photodynamic therapy with radachlorin (0.5 mug/ml) at a fluence of 27 J/cm2 (30 milliwatts/cm2, lambdamax approximately 670 +/- 3 nm). The combination treatment showed a synergistic effect to induce apoptosis. The mitochondrial apoptotic pathway was activated via caspase 3 and caspase 9. On the other hand, caspase 12 and C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) were expressed that indicated endoplasmic reticulum stress. This combination treatment also activated death receptor pathway via activation of caspase 8 and inhibited cell proliferation via down-regulation of EGFR. Thus, several apoptotic pathways were simultaneously activated in this combination treatment which results in a synergistic efficacy of sulforaphene with photodynamic therapy. Therefore, this study could be useful in the improvement of therapies for human cervical and other types of cancers.
27483973	A POST ANALYSIS OF A PREVENTIVE AND CHRONIC HEALTHCARE TOOL.	This study uses the data set from Kaiser Permanente to examine the post implementation of a preventive and chronic care that utilizes clinical information system, delivery system design, and clinical decision support to maximize the office visit. The analysis suggests a significant positive relationship between frequency of utilization rates to address preventive and chronic care gaps. There is no implication of a significant positive relationship with the successfully captured rate, which satisfies closing the care gap within 45 days. The use of the preventive care tool will assist members in satisfying the preventive care gap, cervical cancer screening, within 45 days of the encounter.
27483657	[A Case of EXIT (Ex-utero Intrapartum Treatment) in a Fetus with Prenatal Diagnosis of a Giant Cervical Tumor: Successful Airway Management but without Indication of Treatment for a Tumor].	The ex-utero intrapartum treatment (EXIT) is a rare procedure, and often comes as an emergency surgery. A careful preparation is crucial and a multidisciplinary team discussion during the prenatal period is necessary because it may be practically and ethically difficult to plan a surgical treatment for a fetus for EXIT. An elective caesarean section and EXIT for a fetus with a giant cervical tumor, which may cause airway obstruction and difficult intubation, were scheduled. The anesthesiologist tried oral intubation by direct laryngoscope; however, neither blade nor rigid bronchoscope insertion was impossible as a firm mass protruded in oral cavity from the left side. Tracheotomy was successfully performed and the airway was secured. As for maternal anesthesia, adequate uterine relaxation was obtained by inhalational agents and nitroglycerine. After ligation of the umbilical cord, anesthesia was maintained with propofol and fentanyl, and good uterine contraction was provided by infusion of oxytocin. The duration of EXIT was 44 minutes. The fetal tumor, containing both solid and cystic components, was 14 centimeters in diameter, and infiltrated into intracranial space. There was no indication of resection nor chemotherapy for the tumor. Palliative care was selected, and the neonate died forty days after birth.
27482797	Analysis of Human Papillomavirus Infection in 16,320 Patients From a Gynecology Clinic in Central South China.	OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the relationship between persistent human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and cervical lesion. METHODS: Clinical data of 16,320 patients who visited our clinic between January 2009 and December 2013 were collected. Retrospective analysis was performed to analyze the overall HPV infection and compare the infection rates of different subtypes among different age groups, to reveal the relationship between persistent HPV infection and cervical cytology. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of HPV was 26.54%. The most common genotypes were HPV 52, HPV 16, HPV 58, CP8304, and HPV 53. The highest overall high-risk HPV prevalence was found in women older than 60 years, and the lowest prevalence was found in women between the ages of 30 and 39 years. There was no significant difference in low-risk HPV prevalence among different age groups (p = .693). The HPV clearance rate after 1 year among those with initial positive test was 87.65%. The constituent ratios of high- or low-risk HPV subtypes were not significantly different (p = .545) between nonpersistent-positive and persistent-positive (PP) groups. Conversely, the constituent ratios of singe- or multi-type HPV infection were significantly different (p < .05) between these 2 groups. The most common subtypes in PP group were HPV 16, 52, 58, CP8304, and 33. The occurrence rates of atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance, high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion, and squamous cell carcinoma in the PP group significantly increased (p < .05). CONCLUSIONS: Persistent HPV infections are mainly caused by multiple types of HPV and high-risk HPV. Our region should particularly pay attention to the prevention and treatment of HPV 16, 52, and 58.
27482796	Observational Management of CIN 2 in Young Women: A Prospective Multicenter Trial.	OBJECTIVES: We present the rationale and methods for PRINCess-a multicenter prospective trial-which aims to determine outcome and predictors of regression in a large cohort of women younger than 25 years with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 (CIN 2) undergoing observational management. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Six hundred women younger than 25 years with newly diagnosed biopsy-proven CIN 2 are being recruited to observational management (i.e., repeat colposcopy, cytology, and cervical biopsy every 6 months for 2 years). Five hundred fifty-two women from throughout New Zealand and 1 site in Australia have been recruited so far. Measures include histology, cytology, human papillomavirus genotyping, and immunohistochemical staining. Women who develop CIN 3 will be treated with large loop excision of the transformation zone. The primary outcomes are rates of clinical regression of CIN 2 (i.e., 2 consecutive colposcopy follow-ups showing CIN 1 or normal), loss to follow-up, and progression to invasion. CONCLUSIONS: The optimal treatment for young women with a diagnosis of CIN 2 is controversial. Although many undergo surgical treatment, observational management is increasingly recommended. However, there is little evidence from large clinical trials of the safety and practicality of observational management of young women with CIN 2. When completed, we will have adequate evidence by which to counsel women regarding their likely outcomes and to offer advice on clinical follow-up protocols.
27481184	A review of postoperative analgesia for breast cancer surgery.	An online database search with subsequent article review was performed in order to review the various analgesic modalities for breast cancer surgery. Of 514 abstracts, 284 full-length manuscripts were reviewed. The effect of pharmacologic interventions is varied (NSAIDS, opioids, anticonvulsants, ketamine, lidocaine). Likewise, data from high-quality randomized, controlled studies on wound infiltration (including liposome encapsulated) and infusion of local anesthetic are minimal and conflicting. Conversely, abundant evidence demonstrates paravertebral blocks and thoracic epidural infusions provide effective analgesia and minimize opioid requirements, while decreasing opioid-related side effects in the immediate postoperative period. Other techniques with promising - but extremely limited - data include cervical epidural infusion, brachial plexus, interfascial plane and interpleural blocks. In conclusion, procedural interventions involving regional blocks are more conclusively effective than pharmacologic modalities in providing analgesia to patients following surgery for breast cancer.
27479334	Human Papillomavirus Genotyping Testing Practice in 2014: Results of a College of American Pathologists National Survey.	CONTEXT: - College of American Pathologists (CAP) surveys are used to establish national benchmarks for laboratories. OBJECTIVE: - To investigate human papillomavirus (HPV) genotyping testing practice patterns in laboratories in 2014. DESIGN: - Data were analyzed from the CAP HPV Genotyping Practices Supplemental Questionnaire distributed to 749 laboratories participating in the CAP Human Papillomavirus (High Risk) for Cytology Program. RESULTS: - Six hundred four of 749 laboratories (80.6%) responded to the survey. More laboratories offered HPV genotyping testing and performed in-house HPV genotyping testing as compared to previous surveys. The Roche cobas HPV test was the most commonly used genotyping method (37.0%; 160 of 433), followed by Hologic Aptima HPV16 18/45 (26.1%; 113 of 433) and Hologic Cervista HPV16/18 (14.3%; 62 of 433). Most laboratories (287 of 399; 71.9%) offered HPV genotyping for high-risk HPV cases regardless of Papanicolaou (Pap) test results and patient age; this pattern was more common in laboratories using cobas. The remaining laboratories specifically offered testing to women with a negative Pap test result at age 30 years and older (65.2%, 73 of 112) or all ages (37.5%, 42 of 112). The median reporting rates of HPV16 and/or HPV18 positivity were 20.6%, 25.7%, 21.1%, and 57.4% for women with positive high-risk HPV adjunctive negative Pap results, atypical squamous cells of undermined significance, low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion, and high-grade squamous lesion, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: - Human papillomavirus genotyping testing has increased. Roche cobas and Hologic Aptima genotype methods were the most common, and laboratories using cobas usually offered genotyping regardless of Pap test result and age. The data provide a baseline and trend of HPV genotyping test practices in 2014.
27478909	Predictive value of p16/Ki-67 immunocytochemistry for triage of women with abnormal Papanicolaou test in cervical cancer screening: a systematic review and meta-analysis.	BACKGROUND: The Papanicolaou (Pap) test is one screening strategy used to prevent cervical cancer in developed countries. The p16/Ki-67 immunocytochemistry is a triage test performed on Pap smears in women with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS) or low grade squamous intraepithelial lesion. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to review studies investigating the diagnostic performance of p16/Ki-67 dual stain for triage of women with abnormal Pap tests. DESIGN: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of diagnostic test accuracy studies. SETTINGS: We followed the protocol of systematic review of diagnostic accuracy studies. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We searched PubMed, The Cochrane Library, BioMed Central, and ClinicalTrials.gov for relevant studies. We included research that assessed the accuracy of p16/Ki-67 dual stain and high risk human papillomavirus testing for triage of abnormal Pap smears. Review articles and studies that provided insufficient data to construct 2.2 tables were excluded. Data synthesis was conducted using a random-effects model. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Sensitivity and specificity. RESULTS: In seven studies encompassing 2628 patients, the pooled sensitivity and specificity of p16/Ki-67 for triage of abnormal Pap smear results were 0.91 (95% CI, 0.89 to 0.93) and 0.64 (95% CI, 0.62 to 0.66), respectively. No study used a case-control design. A subgroup analysis involving liquid-based cytology showed a sensitivity of 0.91 (95%CI, 0.89 to 0.93) and specificity of 0.64 (95%CI, 0.61 to 0.66). CONCLUSIONS: Our meta-analysis of p16/Ki-67 dual stain studies showed that the test achieved high sensitivity and moderate specificity for p16/Ki-67 immunocytochemistry for high-grade squamous intraepi.thelial lesion and cervical cancer. We suggest that p16/Ki-67 dual stain might be a reliable ancillary method identifying high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions in women with abnormal Pap tests. LIMITATIONS: No study in the meta-analysis examined the accuracy of the p16/Ki-67 dual stain for inter.pretation of glandular neoplasms.
27478333	News Portrayal of Cancer: Content Analysis of Threat and Efficacy by Cancer Type and Comparison with Incidence and Mortality in Korea.	How the news media cover cancer may have profound significance for cancer prevention and control; however, little is known about the actual content of cancer news coverage in Korea. This research thus aimed to examine news portrayal of specific cancer types with respect to threat and efficacy, and to investigate whether news portrayal corresponds to actual cancer statistics. A content analysis of 1,138 cancer news stories was conducted, using a representative sample from 23 news outlets (television, newspapers, and other news media) in Korea over a 5-year period from 2008 to 2012. Cancer incidence and mortality rates were obtained from the Korean Statistical Information Service. Results suggest that threat was most prominent in news stories on pancreatic cancer (with 87% of the articles containing threat information with specific details), followed by liver (80%) and lung cancers (70%), and least in stomach cancer (41%). Efficacy information with details was conveyed most often in articles on colorectal (54%), skin (54%), and liver (50%) cancers, and least in thyroid cancer (17%). In terms of discrepancies between news portrayal and actual statistics, the threat of pancreatic and liver cancers was overreported, whereas the threat of stomach and prostate cancers was underreported. Efficacy information regarding cervical and colorectal cancers was overrepresented in the news relative to cancer statistics; efficacy of lung and thyroid cancers was underreported. Findings provide important implications for medical professionals to understand news information about particular cancers as a basis for public (mis)perception, and to communicate effectively about cancer risk with the public and patients.
27476847	Thirty-day readmission and reoperation after surgery for spinal tumors: a National Surgical Quality Improvement Program analysis.	OBJECTIVE The goal of this study was to use a large national registry to evaluate the 30-day cumulative incidence and predictors of adverse events, readmissions, and reoperations after surgery for primary and secondary spinal tumors. METHODS Data from adult patients who underwent surgery for spinal tumors (2011-2014) were extracted from the prospective National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) registry. Multivariable logistic regression was used to evaluate predictors of reoperation, readmission, and major complications (death, neurological, cardiopulmonary, venous thromboembolism [VTE], surgical site infection [SSI], and sepsis). Variables screened included patient age, sex, tumor location, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical classification, preoperative functional status, comorbidities, preoperative laboratory values, case urgency, and operative time. Additional variables that were evaluated when analyzing readmission included complications during the surgical hospitalization, hospital length of stay (LOS), and discharge disposition. RESULTS Among the 2207 patients evaluated, 51.4% had extradural tumors, 36.4% had intradural extramedullary tumors, and 12.3% had intramedullary tumors. By spinal level, 20.7% were cervical lesions, 47.4% were thoracic lesions, 29.1% were lumbar lesions, and 2.8% were sacral lesions. Readmission occurred in 10.2% of patients at a median of 18 days (interquartile range [IQR] 12-23 days); the most common reasons for readmission were SSIs (23.7%), systemic infections (17.8%), VTE (12.7%), and CNS complications (11.9%). Predictors of readmission were comorbidities (dyspnea, hypertension, and anemia), disseminated cancer, preoperative steroid use, and an extended hospitalization. Reoperation occurred in 5.3% of patients at a median of 13 days (IQR 8-20 days) postoperatively and was associated with preoperative steroid use and ASA Class 4-5 designation. Major complications occurred in 14.4% of patients: the most common complications and their median time to occurrence were VTE (4.5%) at 9 days (IQR 4-19 days) postoperatively, SSIs (3.6%) at 18 days (IQR 14-25 days), and sepsis (2.9%) at 13 days (IQR 7-21 days). Predictors of major complications included dependent functional status, emergency case status, male sex, comorbidities (dyspnea, bleeding disorders, preoperative systemic inflammatory response syndrome, preoperative leukocytosis), and ASA Class 3-5 designation (p < 0.05). The median hospital LOS was 5 days (IQR 3-9 days), the 30-day mortality rate was 3.3%, and the median time to death was 20 days (IQR 12.5-26 days). CONCLUSIONS In this NSQIP analysis, 10.2% of patients undergoing surgery for spinal tumors were readmitted within 30 days, 5.3% underwent a reoperation, and 14.4% experienced a major complication. The most common complications were SSIs, systemic infections, and VTE, which often occurred late (after discharge from the surgical hospitalization). Patients were primarily readmitted for new complications that developed following discharge rather than exacerbation of complications from the surgical hospital stay. The strongest predictors of adverse events were comorbidities, preoperative steroid use, and higher ASA classification. These models can be used by surgeons to risk-stratify patients preoperatively and identify those who may benefit from increased surveillance following hospital discharge.
27473168	Temporo-spatial cell-cycle kinetics in HeLa cells irradiated by Ir-192 high dose-rate remote afterloading system (HDR-RALS).	BACKGROUND: Intracavitary irradiation plays a pivotal role in definitive radiotherapy for cervical cancer, and the Ir-192 high dose-rate remote afterloading system (HDR-RALS) is often used for this purpose. Under this condition, tumor tissues receive remarkably different absorption doses, with a steep gradient, depending on distance from the radiation source. To obtain temporo-spatial information regarding cell-cycle kinetics in cervical cancer following irradiation by Ir-192 HDR-RALS, we examined HeLa cells expressing the fluorescence ubiquitination-based cell cycle indicator (Fucci), which allowed us to visualize cell-cycle progression. METHODS: HeLa-Fucci cells, which emit red and green fluorescence in G1 and S/G2/M phases, respectively, were grown on 35-mm dishes and irradiated by Ir-192 HDR-RALS under normoxic and hypoxic conditions. A 6 French (Fr) catheter was used as an applicator. A radiation dose of 6 Gy was prescribed at hypothetical treatment point A, located 20 mm from the radiation source. Changes in Fucci fluorescence after irradiation were visualized for cells from 5 to 20 mm from the Ir-192 source. Several indices, including first green phase duration after irradiation (FGPD), were measured by analysis of time-lapse images. RESULTS: Cells located 5 to 20 mm from the Ir-192 source became green, reflecting arrest in G2, in a similar manner up to 12 h after irradiation; at more distant positions, however, cells were gradually released from the G2 arrest and became red. This could be explained by the observation that the FGPD was longer for cells closer to the radiation source. Detailed observation revealed that FGPD was significantly longer in cells irradiated in the green phase than in the red phase at positions closer to the Ir-192 source. Unexpectedly, the FGPD was significantly longer after irradiation under hypoxia than normoxia, due in large part to the elongation of FGPD in cells irradiated in the red phase. CONCLUSION: Using HeLa-Fucci cells, we obtained the first temporo-spatial information about cell-cycle kinetics following irradiation by Ir-192 HDR-RALS. Our findings suggest that the potentially surviving hypoxic cells, especially those arising from positions around point A, exhibit different cell-cycle kinetics from normoxic cells destined to be eradicated.
27470402	The effect of quercetin nanoparticle on cervical cancer progression by inducing apoptosis, autophagy and anti-proliferation via JAK2 suppression.	Cervical cancer is a cause of cancer death, making it as the one of the most common cause for death among women globally. Though many studies before have explored a lot for cervical cancer prevention and treatment, there are still a lot far from to know based on the molecular mechanisms. Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) has been reported to play an essential role in the progression of apoptosis, autophagy and proliferation for cells. We loaded gold-quercetin into poly (dl-lactide-co-glycolide) nanoparticles to cervical cancer cells due to the propertities of quercetin in ameliorating cellular processes and the easier absorbance of nanoparticles. Here, in our study, quercetin nanoparticles (NQ) were administrated to cells to investigate the underlying mechanism by which the cervical cancer was regulated. First, JAK2-inhibited carvical cancer cell lines were involved for our experiments in vitro and in vivo. Western blotting, quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR), ELISA, Immunohistochemistry, and flow-cytometric analysis were used to determine the key signaling pathway regulated by JAK2 for cervical cancer progression. And the role of quercetin nanoparticles was determined during the process. Data here indicated that JAK2, indeed, expressed highly in cancer cell lines compared to the normal cervical cells. And apoptosis and autophagy were found in JAK2-inhibited cancer cells through activating Caspase-3, and suppressing Cyclin-D1 and mTOR regulated by Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription (STAT) 3/5 and phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase/protein kinases (PI3K/AKT) signaling pathway. The cervical cancer cells proliferation was inhibited. Further, tumor size and weight were reduced by inhibition of JAK2 in vivo experiments. Notably, administration with quercetin nanoparticles displayed similar role with JAK2 suppression, which could inhibit cervical cancer cells proliferation, invasion and migration. In addition, autophogy and apoptosis were induced, promoting cervical cancer cell death. To our knowledge, it was the first time to evaluate the role of quercetin nanoparticles in improving cervical cancer from apoptosis, autophagy and proliferation, which could be a potential target for future therapeutic approach clinically.
27470354	The inhibitory effects of carnosic acid on cervical cancer cells growth by promoting apoptosis via ROS-regulated signaling pathway.	Cervical cancer has been the fourth most common cancer killing many women across the world. Carnosic acid (CA), as a phenolic diterpene, has been suggested to against cancer, exerting protective effects associated with inflammatory cytokines. It is aimed to demonstrate the therapeutic role of carnosic acid against cervical cancer and indicate its underlying molecular mechanisms. 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2-H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) was performed to assess the possible anti-proliferative effects of carnosic acid. And also, colony formation was used to further estimate carnosic acid's ability in suppressing cervical cancer cells proliferation. Flow cytometry assays were performed here to indicate the alterations of cervical cancer cells cycle and the development of apoptosis. Western blot assays and RT-PCR were also applied to clarify the apoptosis-associated signaling pathways affected by reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. And immunofluorescence was used to detect ROS-positive cells. In vivo experiments, CaSki xenograft model samples of nude mice were involved to further elucidate the effects of carnosic acid. In our results, we found that carnosic acid exerted anti-tumor ability in vitro supported by up-regulation of apoptosis and ROS production in cervical cancer cells. Also, acceleration of ROS led to the phospharylation of (c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and its-related signals, as well as activation of Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) stress, promoting the progression of apoptosis via stimulating Caspase3 expression. The development and growth of xenograft tumors in nude mice were found to be inhibited by the administration of carnosic acid for five weeks. And the suppressed role of carnosic acid in proliferation of cervical cancer cells and apoptosis of nude mice with tumor tissues were observed in our study. Taken together, our data indicated that carnosic acid resulted in apoptosis both in vitro and vivo experiments via promoting ROS and activating JNK signaling pathways in human cervical cancer cells, which supplied a potential therapy for the application of carnosic acid in clinical treatment.
27470347	Interferon beta improves the efficacy of low dose cisplatin by inhibiting NF-kappaB/p-Akt signaling on HeLa cells.	The purpose of this study was to evaluate the anticancer efficacy of interferon beta in combination with low dose of cisplatin on human cervical cancer progression, as well as its principal action mechanism. The combination treatment synergistically potentiated the effect of interferon beta on cell growth inhibition and DNA damage on HeLa cells by repressing NF-kappaB/p-Akt signaling. Synergistic targeting of these pathways has a therapeutic potential. Further, the combination treatment ameliorated the expression of pro-apoptotic Bax, and decreased the expression of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2. Additionally, the expression of active PARP was significantly increased and MMP-9 level was decreased in combination group as compared to the expression seen for the treatment with interferon beta or cisplatin alone. Results demonstrate that the synergistic inhibitory effects of interferon beta and low dose of cisplatin on human cervical cancer cells and also suggest that the inhibition of NF-kappaB/p-Akt signaling pathway plays a critical role in the anticancer effects of combination treatment along with the induction of PARP. Therefore, the combination of interferon beta and cisplatin may be a useful treatment for human cervical cancer, with a greater effectiveness than other treatments.
27469988	Adverse obstetric outcomes after local treatment for cervical preinvasive and early invasive disease according to cone depth: systematic review and meta-analysis.	OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of treatment for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) on obstetric outcomes and to correlate this with cone depth and comparison group used. DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis. DATA SOURCES: CENTRAL, Medline, Embase from 1948 to April 2016 were searched for studies assessing obstetric outcomes in women with or without previous local cervical treatment. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Independent reviewers extracted the data and performed quality assessment using the Newcastle-Ottawa criteria. Studies were classified according to method and obstetric endpoint. Pooled risk ratios were calculated with a random effect model and inverse variance. Heterogeneity between studies was assessed with I(2) statistics. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Obstetric outcomes comprised preterm birth (including spontaneous and threatened), premature rupture of the membranes, chorioamnionitis, mode of delivery, length of labour, induction of delivery, oxytocin use, haemorrhage, analgesia, cervical cerclage, and cervical stenosis. Neonatal outcomes comprised low birth weight, admission to neonatal intensive care, stillbirth, APGAR scores, and perinatal mortality. RESULTS: 71 studies were included (6 338 982 participants: 65 082 treated/6 292 563 untreated). Treatment significantly increased the risk of overall (<37 weeks; 10.7% v 5.4%; relative risk 1.78, 95% confidence interval 1.60 to 1.98), severe (<32-34 weeks; 3.5% v 1.4%; 2.40, 1.92 to 2.99), and extreme (<28-30 weeks; 1.0% v 0.3%; 2.54, 1.77 to 3.63) preterm birth. Techniques removing or ablating more tissue were associated with worse outcomes. Relative risks for delivery at <37 weeks were 2.70 (2.14 to 3.40) for cold knife conisation, 2.11 (1.26 to 3.54) for laser conisation, 2.02 (1.60 to 2.55) for excision not otherwise specified, 1.56 (1.36 to 1.79) for large loop excision of the transformation zone, and 1.46 (1.27 to 1.66) for ablation not otherwise specified. Compared with no treatment, the risk of preterm birth was higher in women who had undergone more than one treatment (13.2% v 4.1%; 3.78, 2.65 to 5.39) and with increasing cone depth (</=10-12 mm; 7.1% v 3.4%; 1.54, 1.09 to 2.18; >/=10-12 mm: 9.8% v 3.4%, 1.93, 1.62 to 2.31; >/=15-17 mm: 10.1% v 3.4%; 2.77, 1.95 to 3.93; >/=20 mm: 10.2% v 3.4%; 4.91, 2.06 to 11.68). The choice of comparison group affected the magnitude of effect. This was higher for external comparators, followed by internal comparators, and ultimately women with disease who did not undergo treatment. In women with untreated CIN and in pregnancies before treatment, the risk of preterm birth was higher than the risk in the general population (5.9% v 5.6%; 1.24, 1.14 to 1.35). Spontaneous preterm birth, premature rupture of the membranes, chorioamnionitis, low birth weight, admission to neonatal intensive care, and perinatal mortality were also significantly increased after treatment. : CONCLUSIONS: Women with CIN have a higher baseline risk for prematurity. Excisional and ablative treatment further increases that risk. The frequency and severity of adverse sequelae increases with increasing cone depth and is higher for excision than for ablation.
27468574	Detecting of p16 Autoantibody as a Potential Early Diagnostic Serum Biomarker in Patients with Cervical Cancer.	BACKGROUND: Over-expression of tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) may trigger secretion of their auto-antibodies. The present work was designed to test whether circulating antibody to P16 protein-derived antigens was altered in cervical cancer. METHODS: 141 cases of cervical cancer patients, 133 cases of cervical benign tumor patients, and 153 healthy volunteers matched in age were recruited. The level of circulating P16 auto-antibody was tested using an ELISA developed in-house with linear peptide antigens derived from the P16 protein. RESULTS: The P16 auto-antibody in the malignant tumor group had a significantly higher level than the healthy control group and the benign tumor group (t = 4.016, p < 0.001; t = 3.879, p < 0.001). Patients with stage I cervical cancer have the highest level of P16 autoantibody and the sensitivity against > 90% specificity was 20.3%. CONCLUSIONS: The circulating auto-antibody to P16 may be one of a series of potential biomarkers with early prognostic values for cervical cancer.
27468570	Establishment and Application of a Method for High-Risk Human Papillomavirus Genotyping in Cervical Cancer Tissue.	BACKGROUND: Persistent high-risk HPV infection is a major cause of cervical cancer and E6/E7 genes and the Li gene in the HPV genome are key targets to detect high-risk HPV. This study aims to explore the relationship between cervical lesions and E6/7 by establishing a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect multiplex genes based on HPV EE7 genes. It is hoped that such methods will provide a more reliable method for clinical screening and the prevention of cervical cancer. METHODS: Based on alignment, specific primers were designed for HPV E6/E7 genes, the sequences of which came from five5 high-risk papillomaviruses that are common in China. This enabled an E6/E7 gene detection method based on multiplex PCR to be established. E6/E7 and Li gene testing were then performed on 65 cervical cancer tissue samples. The gene copy number of HPV E6/E7 genes and the Li gene were detected from different classifications by real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR. RESULTS: Out of the 65 cervical cancer tissue samples, 47 (72.31%) showed positive results in E6/E7 multiplex PCR, 21 (32.31%) showed positive results in the Ll gene PCR, and out of the 219 cervical exfoliate cell samples, 56 (25.57%) showed positive results in E6/E7 multiplex PCR, 21 (13.24%) showed positive results in the L1 gene PCR. There were significant differences (p < 0.05) between these two test results. Fluorescent quantitative PCR showed that the ratio of gene copy number of L1 genes and E6/E7 genes was below 1 (p < 0.05) in cervical cancer tissue, in which both the Li and E6/E7 genes coexist. CONCLUSIONS: The established HPV multiplex PCR assay based on the design of E6/E7 gene is a specific and sensitive method for the detection and genotype of five high-risk HPVs.
27467824	Prevalence of Primary HPV in Djibouti: Feasibility of Screening for Early Diagnosis of Squamous Intraepithelial Lesions.	OBJECTIVE: In many African Sub-Saharan countries, human papilloma virus (HPV) prevalence data are not available. The current study estimated the prevalence of HPV virus in the female population of Djibouti. METHODS: Approximately 1000 asymptomatic women 16 to 64 years old were enrolled from 3 of the main health structures of Djibouti in 2014 and 2015; 998 cervical samples were tested for HPV-DNA of high risk types, 499 during the first year, and 499 during the second. Positive samples were typed with an HPV genotyping kit. RESULTS: The women were an average age of 38.8 years (SD, 10.2); 54 women tested positive for HPV (prevalence rate, 5.4% [95% confidence interval, 4.0-6.8]). The highest prevalence was observed among the women younger than 35 years. HPV66 was the most prevalent (15.4% of the infections), followed by HPV31 and HPV52 (10.8% both) and HPV16 (9.2%). All 54 women who tested HPV-positive underwent a Pap test, which was positive in 8 cases (14.8%): 2 high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) and 6 low-grade (LSIL). CONCLUSIONS: The HPV prevalence shows a curve by age similar to that of other African countries. The proportion of HPV16 is among the lowest ever seen in similar studies. The findings suggest to Djibouti the choice of a strategy of screening that includes forms of cytological triage, thus limiting recourse to colposcopy.
27466497	Expression Profile of MicroRNA-203 and its DeltaNp63 Target in Cervical Carcinogenesis: Prospects for Cervical Cancer Screening.	BACKGROUND/AIM: Host molecules disturbed by human papillomavirus (HPV) oncoproteins have been shown to be potential biomarkers of cervical carcinogenesis and represent an alternative or supplementary aid to cytological testing and HPV detection. The miR-203 and one of its targets, DeltaNp63, are known to be host molecules that interact with each other to control the proliferation and differentiation of keratinocytes; both have been found to be dysregulated in many cancers. As the role of p63 and miR-203 in cervical carcinogenesis is not yet well-understood, we have, thus, decided to evaluate the changes of expression of both in cervical carcinogenesis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was carried out by obtaining quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) data from cervical biopsies. RESULTS: miR-203 and DeltaNp63 displayed a similar expression pattern across cervical tissues and both targets showed statistically significant differences between low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) x high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL); HSIL x Cancer. Additionally, we did not observe an inverse correlation between DeltaNp63 mRNA and miR-203 levels as expected but, rather, a positive correlation between cervical tissues. CONCLUSION: Although preliminary, the expression levels of DeltaNp63 mRNA and miR-203 seem to be promising for cervical cancer screening. In addition, positive correlation between miR-203 and DeltaNp63 expression suggests the possible existence of some indirect pathways. However, further studies are needed to clarify the role of DeltaNp63 and miR-203 in cervical carcinogenesis and, thus, determine how they can be applied in new strategies for diagnosis.
27465872	[Comparison of the clinical efficacy of different treatments based on radical surgery in stage b2 and a2 cervical cancer: a prospective randomized control study].	OBJECTIVE: To compare the clinical efficacy of different treatments based on radical surgery in stage b2 and a2 cervical cancer through prospective randomized controlled study. METHODS: A total of 133 patients with stage b2 and a2 cervical cancer treated at Beijing Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital of Capital Medical University during January 2009 to December 2012 were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive one of the following three treatments: preoperative intracavitary irradiation(PII)group, radical hysterectomy(RH)group, and neoadjuvant chemotherapy(NACT)group. Operation method included uterine extensive resection, pelvic lymph node excision, with or without para-aortic lymph node resection. The recent curative effect and side effect of preoperative treatment were observed. The operation time, intraoperative blood loss, surgical complications, postoperative pathological risk factors and postoperative adjuvant therapy and side effect, the survival situation were evaluated among the 3 groups. RESULTS: (1)The response rates were 88%(37/42)and 82%(37/45)respectively of the PII group and NACT group. The difference was insignificant(P=0.528). Side effects were less in the PII group. Only 5 patients(12% , 5/42)had slight gastrointestinal reaction. Myelosuppression and gastrointestinal reaction in NACT group were 76%(34/45)and 67%(30/45)respectively, which were more serious than that in group PII group(P<0.05).(2)Intraoperative blood loss and operation time in PII group [(678+/- 239)ml and(181+/-39)minutes]and NACT group [(625+/-137)ml and(168+/-25)minutes]had a decreasing trend compared with that in RH group [(711 +/- 319)ml and(202 +/- 64)minutes], but the differences were no significant(P >0.05). NACT group could shorten operation time compared with the RH group(P <0.05). The lymph node metastases rate were 30%(14/46), 29%(12/42)and 29%(13/45)and the deep stromal invasion rate were 22%(10/46), 31%(13/42)and 31%(14/45)in RH group, PII group and NACT group respectively(all P>0.05). The lymph-vascular space involvement(LVSI)in NACT group was significantly lower than that in RH group [31%(14/45)vs 57%(26/46), P=0.015]. The number of patients with histological risk factors in NACT group was higher thanthat in RH group [27%(12/45)vs 9%(4/46), P= 0.024]. All surgery were successfully completed and no treatment-related deaths occurred in three groups. The incidence of 3-4 grade adverse reactions evaluated by the common terminology criteria for adverse event(CTCAE)was 13%(6/46), 14%(6/42), 18%(8/45)in RH group, PII group and NACT group respectively(P=0.855). Three-year disease free survival(PFS)were 74.0%, 78.5% and 80.0%, and 3-year overall survival(OS)were 80.4%, 83.3% and 84.4% in RH group, PII group and NACT group respectively(all P>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The recent curative effect of PII and NACT were similar. They couldn't improve 3-year of PFS and OS of the patients with b2 and a2 stage cervical cancer. But NACT can reduce the operation difficulty and can reduce the incidence of postoperative pathological risk factors, which could reduce postoperative adjuvant therapy.
27465834	Cervical polyps: Is histologic evaluation necessary?	OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine a series of clinically identified cervical polyps and determine the incidence of significant histologic and concurrent cytologic findings. METHODS: Consecutive cervical polyps from January 2000 through September 2012 were retrieved from the hospital laboratory information system. Histologic evaluation of these polyps was performed, followed by a chart review of clinical findings and correlation with the immediately prior or concurrently collected cervical Papanicolaou (Pap) test results, when available. RESULTS: A total of 369 cervical polyps were identified and reviewed. The patient ages ranged from 18 to 87 years (mean 46.5years). Eight polyps demonstrated squamous dysplasia (6 Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia/CIN I, and 2 CIN II/III), while 6 had malignant or atypical/potentially malignant features (2 adenosarcoma, 2 atypical polyps concerning for Mullerian adenosarcoma, 1 endometrioid endometrial adenocarcinoma and 1 adenocarcinoma in-situ). An increased incidence of atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS) and atypical glandular cells not otherwise specified (AGC NOS) Pap diagnoses (12.7% and 6.1%, respectively) was found in women with benign polyps on biopsy. DISCUSSION: We demonstrated a higher rate of clinically significant histologic findings in cervical polyps (14 of 369 cases, 3.7%) compared to previously reported studies. The increase in ASCUS and AGC Pap results was most likely related to reactive and inflammatory changes present in benign polyps. Our results suggest that removal of all cervical polyps with subsequent histologic review is warranted.
27465475	Psychological impact of positive cervical cancer screening results among Japanese women.	BACKGROUND: While cervical cancer screening is useful for detecting and then treating the disease at an early stage, most women with screen-positive results are free from cervical cancer but nevertheless subject to the unnecessary worry entailed in receiving such results. The purpose of this study was to examine whether receiving a screen-positive result was actually related to psychological distress among Japanese women who underwent cervical cancer screening. METHODS: We conducted a questionnaire survey at health facilities in a semiurban city of Ibaraki prefecture, involving 1744 women who underwent cervical cancer screening and 72 who received screen-positive results and then underwent further testing. We used the K6 scale to assess their psychological distress (K6 score >/=5) and performed multiple logistic regression analyses to estimate the relative effect of receiving screen-positive results on psychological distress. RESULTS: Psychological distress was more prevalent among women with screen-positive results (OR 2.22; 95 % CI 1.32-3.74), while it was also related to history of mental health consultation (OR 2.26; 95 % CI 1.69-3.01) and marital status (OR 1.32; 95 % CI 1.02-1.70). CONCLUSIONS: Receiving a positive cervical cancer screening result was associated with psychological distress. To alleviate this psychological impact, the current form of communicating the screening results should be reconsidered.
27464542	[Study of ultrasonographic features in predicting reginal lymph node metastasis in patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma].	OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate the ultrasonographic features of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) in predicting associated cervical lymph nodes metastasis (LNM). METHODS: A total of 136 patients diagnosed with PTC in Beijing Tongren Hospital between January 2014 and September 2014 were enrolled.Of 136 cases, forty patients were confirmed with cervical lymph node metastasis.Seven were males, 33 were females, aged from 18 to 65 years old, mean age was (39.6+/-10.3) years .The remaining 96 were reported without lymph node metastasis.Twenty-one were males, 75 were females, aged from 23 to 86 years old, mean age was (47.7+/-12.8) years.Medical record was reviewed for demographic characteristics and pathological findings.The ultrasonographic features of each case were evaluated retrospectively.The difference of ultrasonographic features between the patients with and without LNM was examined. RESULTS: There were 178 PTCs confirmed with pathology, 159 lesions (89.3%) were detected by ultrasonography, the remaining 19 lesions (10.7%) were under-detected.Of 136 patients with PTC, 40 cases (40/136, 29.4%) were confirmed with cervical LNM, while the remaining 96 cases (96/136, 70.6%) were determined without cervical LNM.PTC with cervical LNM was more frequently seen in the patients who were younger (P=0.000 5) and presenting with multifocal tumors (P=0.014 6). Ultrasonographic features of PTC which significantly associated with LNM were ill-defined margins (P=0.018), solid appearance (P=0.003), and presence of calcification (P=0.000). Of 40 cases with LNM, central cervical LNM was seen in 32 cases (80%), 72.5% of whom appeared as unilateral distribution. CONCLUSIONS: Patients diagnosed with PTC with younger age and identified with multiple foci of tumors at the time of diagnosis are in an increased risk of associated cervical LNM.Ultrasonographic features of ill-defined margins, solid appearance and calcification in PTC are significant predictors of LNM.
27464068	Integrating Chemotherapy in the Management of Cervical Cancer: A Critical Appraisal.	The management of locally advanced cervix cancer has undergone a paradigm shift during the last decade. Concurrent chemoradiation (CCRT) (with cisplatin alone or in combination) is currently the standard treatment approach. CCRT results in a 5-year overall survival rate of 66% and a disease-free survival of 58%. About 30-40% of patients with locally advanced cervical cancer fail to achieve complete response to CCRT; alternative approaches are needed to improve the outcome for such patients. Weekly paclitaxel and carboplatin for 4-6 weeks as dose-dense chemotherapy prior to CCRT could be one such potential approach. The role of adjuvant chemotherapy after CCRT in patients with positive lymph nodes, larger tumor volume and stage III-IVA disease needs further exploration. Adjuvant chemotherapy is also being investigated for early-stage (stages IA2, IB1 or IIA) cervical cancer with presence of risk factors such as lymph node metastasis, lymphovascular space invasion and invasion depth of more than 10 mm, microscopic parametrial invasion, non-squamous histology and positive surgical margins. For patients with early-stage disease (IA2-IIA), short-course chemotherapy prior to surgery is associated with an improved outcome in many studies. Neo-adjuvant chemotherapy followed by fertility preservation surgery is feasible in carefully selected young patients with bulky stage IB1 disease. Recently, a number of molecular pathways have been identified as potential therapeutic targets. Bevacizumab - an inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor - is associated with improved survival in patients with recurrent/metastatic cervical cancer. Whether bevacizumab and other similar novel agents targeting molecular pathways could be used in front-line treatment along with cytotoxic chemotherapy is likely to be an area of research in future studies.
27463969	Prevention of Cervix Cancer in India.	Cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer among women globally and the second most common cancer among Indian women. India alone bears 23% of the global cervical cancer burden. In India, population-based cervical cancer screening is largely nonexistent in most regions due to competing healthcare priorities, insufficient financial resources and a limited number of trained providers. Hence, most of the cases present in advanced stages of the disease, thus leading to increased mortality and reduced survival. Various screening options like cytology, visual-based screening and testing for high-risk HPV are available. Several cross-sectional studies have looked at the comparative efficacy of different screening tests. Three important randomized controlled trials from India have shown the efficacy of screening once in a life time with HPV DNA, one-time screening with VIA by trained nurses and four-time screening with VIA by trained primary health workers, reducing mortality due to cervical cancers. Prevention of cervical cancers with two-dose HPV vaccination and early detection of precancerous cervical lesions of the eligible population through screening and their appropriate treatment with a single-visit 'screen-and-treat' approach appear to be promising for low-middle-income countries including India.
27461827	Prognostic significance of human papillomavirus viral load in correlation with different therapeutic modalities in cervical cancer patients.	PURPOSE: High-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) infections were the causal factor in the development of cervical cancer, but the significance of HPV viral load in the prediction of the response to current therapeutic approaches had not reached consensus. The present study was performed to assess the high risk HPV viral load of cervical cancer patients who underwent radiotherapy alone or in combination with chemotherapy or hyperthermotherapy or both in correlation to long-term survival. METHODS: 116 cervical cancer patients were recruited and assigned into four groups of different therapeutic modalities. The prevalent high risk types of HPV 16, 18, 58 were detected by type specific in situ hybridization (ISH), and HPV mRNA was detected by RNA scope assay using RNA scope 2.0 FFPE Reagent Kit. Semi-quantification of the HR-HPV viral load was measured based on the intensity of ISH signal captured from the tumor nests in the grey scale. RESULTS: The HR-HPV viral load had a significant negative correlation with survival (rs=-0.368, P=0.001). The 15-year survival rate of low viral load group was 68.18%, moderate viral load group was 52.17%, and high viral load group was 34.69% (P=0.001). HPV mRNA expression was strongly consistent with HPV viral load. The 15-year survival rates of different therapeutic groups were 39.29%, 58.62%, 50.00%, 55.17%, respectively (P=0.545). Combinatorial treatment modalities improved the actual survival, which demonstrated no significant difference among 5, 10 and 15 years comparison. Cox regression analysis showed that the relative risk of death was obviously higher in the HPV 18 single positive group and high HPV viral load group. CONCLUSIONS: The semi-quantitive viral load assessment in situ is a feasible approach in clinical practice. The more the HPV viral load was, the worse the survival of patients would be. The combinational treatments were in favor of the disease-stabilization.
27461738	Influence of previous treatment of oral squamous cell carcinoma on the geographic distribution of recurrent neck metastases: A case series of unusual level 4 metastases.	BACKGROUND: Cervical node management is vital for the successful treatment of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Lymphatic spread from intra-oral malignancies usually follows a predictable path. We report on two patients with isolated level 4 recurrence following previous treatment for OSCC. METHODS: Single institutional case series. RESULTS: Two patients, initially N0, treated by surgery and ipsilateral neck dissection, presented with recurrent OSCC. One patient received adjuvant radiotherapy. Both patients developed recurrent/new disease at 7years and and 22months, respectively, and had salvage surgery, one had adjuvant radiation therapy. Both, subsequently, presented again at 3 and 12months with isolated, ipsilateral level 4 metastases. CONCLUSION: These two patients presented with delayed skip metastases which defies normal drainage patterns. The experience with these patients and a review of the literature raises the question of addressing the treatment of level 4 lymph nodes in recurrent OSCC due to altered drainage.
27461689	The significance of enlarged cervical lymph nodes in diagnosing thyroid cancer.	INTRODUCTION: We aim to investigate the significance of enlarged cervical lymph nodes (ECLN) identified by initial surgeon-performed ultrasound (US) as a tool for determining the risk of malignancy in the patients presenting with suspicious thyroid nodules. METHODS: Radiological and surgical reports were retrospectively reviewed for the patients with suspicious thyroid nodules who underwent thyroidectomy and preoperative comprehensive neck US. Ultrasonographic features of the identified cervical lymph nodes were correlated with the final pathology report. Patients with malignancy other than papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) were excluded. RESULTS: The study consisted of 440 patients. On final pathology, PTC was found in 142 patients (32.3%), the remaining 298 (67.7%) exhibited benign findings. ECLN (>1 cm) were found in 66 (46.5%) patient with PTC compared to only 53 (17.8%) patients with benign nodules (P < 0.001). Of the 119 patients with ECLN, 54.6% had benign appearing ECLN with no suspicious features, 26.1% had one suspicious feature, and 19.3% had more than one suspicious features. Benign appearing ECLN had a positive predictive value (PPV) of 41.54%, negative predictive value (NPV) of 59.02%, sensitivity of 51.92%, and specificity of 48.65% in predicting malignancy as opposed to the absence of ECLN. While as opposed to benign looking ECLN, ECLN with only one suspicious feature had a PPV of 70.97%, NPV of 50.00%, sensitivity of 33.33%, and specificity of 83.02%, and ECLN with two or more suspicious feature had a PPV of 73.91%, NPV of 48.96%, sensitivity of 25.76%, and specificity of 88.68%. CONCLUSION: ECLN are associated with an increased likelihood of thyroid malignancy in the patients undergoing evaluation of a suspicious nodule. The risk of malignancy in thyroid nodules increases with the presence of suspicious ultrasonographic features on cervical lymph nodes.
27461684	Dosimetric comparison of different treatment planning techniques with International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements Report-83 recommendations in adjuvant pelvic radiotherapy of gynecological malignancies.	AIM: The study evaluates the different treatment planning techniques according to three recommendation levels of the International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements Report-83 in gynecologic cancer patients treated with adjuvant pelvic radiotherapy (APR). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Computerized tomography images of ten endometrial and cervical cancer patients who were treated with APR were assessed. For each patient, five different treatment plans were created. One homogeneity index and four different conformity indexes (CIs) were calculated for three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT), field-in-field (FIF), seven-field intensity modulated radiotherapy (7-IMRT) with two different degrees beginning (7A-IMRT, 7B-IMRT) and 9-IMRT treatment plans. Dose volume histogram parameters and normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) were compared for organs at risk (OAR). RESULTS: The CI values of the IMRT were closer to 1 with respect to other plans (P < 0.05). The rectum and the bladder volumes which received more than 40 Gy were decreased with IMRT compared to 3D-CRT (P < 0.05). Doses received by the 195 cc volume of the small intestine and NTCP values were significantly decreased with IMRT (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: IMRT provided more protection than FIF plans at high dose volumes of the OAR; however, it did not show any superiority at low-dose volumes. The NTCP results supported IMRT for only small intestine protection. Because IMRT is increasingly used clinically, the comparison of NTCP will become more common in the near future. Therefore, new prospective studies with sufficient number of patients and appropriate NTCP models are needed for this treatment modality.
27461683	Systematic meta-analysis on association of human papilloma virus and oral cancer.	BACKGROUND: Oral cancer is a disease with complex etiology. There is a strong evidence for the role of smoking, alcohol, genetic susceptibility, and indications that DNA viruses could also be involved in oral cancer. Recognized initially as sexually transmitted agent, human papilloma virus (HPV) is now considered a human carcinogen. Papilloma viruses are epitheliotropic viruses. A strong association of cervical cancer has been implicated with high-risk HPV16 and HPV18 infections, establishing the viral pathogenesis of the carcinoma. The etiopathogenesis is still unclear referring mainly to conflicting evidences in the detection of such viruses in oral carcinoma in spite of few studies suggesting their positive correlation. AIM OF THE STUDY: This systematic meta-analysis aimed to provide evidence-based analysis of literature relating oral cancer and HPV, along with identification of reliable diagnostic methodology for identifying HPV in oral and oropharyngeal cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A systematic review was performed using PubMed (from the year 1995 to 2015), Medline, Cochrane, ScienceDirect, and the Internet search. Reviewed literature included randomized control trials, cross sectional and cohort studies. Pooled data were analyzed by calculating relative risk and odds ratios (ORs), using a binary random-effects model. RESULTS: Out of 1497 cases, 588 patients were positive for HPV DNA, detected by various methods. About 39.27% of case samples were positive for HPV DNA. The calculated OR was 2.82 and 95% confidence interval, which showed significantly an increased risk of HPV among case group when compared to that of controls. CONCLUSION: The present meta-analysis suggests a potentially significant casual relation between HPV and oral and oropharyngeal cancers.
27461678	Survey of cervical cancer survivors regarding quality of life and sexual function.	OBJECTIVE: To investigate the quality of life (QOL) of cervical cancer survivors in China. METHODS: Cervical cancer survivors were selected from 4 Tertiary Provincial Hospitals in Changsha, Hunan Province. Enrolled were 140 patients who received cancer treatments in these hospitals from 2007 to 2010. The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Cervix (FACT-Cx) Questionnaire was used to assess the QOL of the participants. Spiritual well-being was evaluated with the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Spiritual Well-being (FACIT-Sp). Sexual function was measured with the Female Sexual Functioning Index. RESULTS: The average total FACT-Cx score was 124.45 (70-157). The average FACT-general score was 112.39 (49-150), and the average FACIT-Sp score was 13.9 (2-33.6). The prevalence of sexual dysfunction in our participants was 78%. Factors that were associated with QOL in cervical cancer survivors included gastrointestinal symptoms, health insurance, age, sleep disorders, and the number of complications. Sexual function was affected by radiotherapy, age, type of surgery, sleep disorders, and occupation. CONCLUSION: The QOL and sexual function of cervical cancer survivors were lower than the general population. Treatment-related complications and sexual dysfunction significantly affected patients' QOL. Having health insurance was associated with better QOL. Sexual function was adversely affected by radiotherapy and radical hysterectomy.
27461673	Prognostic significance of residual or recurrent lymph nodes in the neck for patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma after radiotherapy.	BACKGROUND: Nasopharyngeal carcinoma is the most frequently diagnosed primary tumor originating from the nasopharynx, and the preferred treatment modality is radiotherapy. AIMS: To identify nasopharyngeal carcinoma prognostic factors in patients with residual or recurrent cervical lymph node metastases after radiotherapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The clinicopathologic characteristics and prognoses of 67 nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients with residual or recurrent cervical lymph node metastases who were diagnosed and treated were analyzed retrospectively. The Chi-squared test and Cox proportional hazard regression model were used to investigate associations between survival and clinicopathological features. Cumulative survival plots were obtained using the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: Data analysis using the Cox proportional hazard regression model revealed that the size of residual or recurrent lymph node metastases, level V lymph node involvement, number of involved levels, surgical procedure performed, and distant metastases were significantly associated with overall survival. Chi-squared analysis only determined a significant correlation between distant metastases and patient survival. Furthermore, the Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated that the 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates for patients were 86.6%, 52.2%, and 38.6%, respectively. Radical neck dissection resulted in substantially longer overall survival than modified neck dissection. CONCLUSION: The size of residual or recurrent lymph node metastases, level V lymph node involvement, number of involved levels, surgical procedure performed, and presence of distant metastases were prognostic factors for nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients with residual or recurrent cervical lymph node metastases after radiotherapy, with distant metastases being the most important determinant. Classical radical neck dissection is recommended for treating recurrent nodal disease in nasopharyngeal carcinoma.
27461659	Treatment of the early-stage glottic cancer using low-temperature radiofrequency coblation.	OBJECTIVE: Radiofrequency (RF) coblation operates at low temperatures (40-70 degrees C) and allows for ablation, hemostasis, and aspiration, in addition to the lesion excision; thermal damage to the surrounding tissues is thus minimized. Herein, we evaluated the benefit of low-temperature RF coblation treatment of the early-stage glottic cancer. The main aim of the study was to evaluate the feasibility, complications, and efficacy of low-temperature RF coblation as a treatment modality for the early-stage glottic cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The data obtained from a 1-year study of six T1 glottic cancer patients treated at our department are presented. Six early-stage glottic cancer (Tla = 5; Tlb = 1) patients (male; mean age 60.1 years) treated using low-temperature RF coblation were enrolled in this study. RESULTS: The outcomes of the surgical technique were analyzed. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: Study outcomes were analyzed (noted and/or photographed). All patients were able to eat on the next day after the surgery. No gastric tube or tracheotomy was required. No postoperative cough, discomfort or difficult breathing was noted. No complications, such as recurrence or cervical lymph node metastasis, occurred over the 6-12 months follow-up. All patients regained satisfactory voice 2 months after the surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Although the current probe design has limitations for the resection of certain tumors, low-temperature RF coblation appears to be a potentially effective method for the endoscopic resection of selected glottic cancers.
27461638	GSTM1 null genotype and susceptibility to cervical cancer in the Chinese population: An updated meta-analysis.	AIM OF STUDY: To clarify the effects of glutathione S-transferases mu-1. (GSTM1) null genotype on the risk of CC, an updated meta-analysis. was performed in Chinese populations. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An extensive literature search for relevant studies was conducted on Pub Med, Springer Link, Ovid SP, Chinese Biomedical (CBM), Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), VIP, and Wan fang Database from their inception through 22 October, 2014. This meta-analysis was performed using the STATA 10.0 software. The crude odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated. RESULTS: A total of four studies including 364 cervical cancer cases and 378 controls were involved in this meta-analysis. Overall, significant association was found between GSTM1 null genotype and CC risk when all studies in the Chinese population pooled into the meta--analysis. In subgroup analyses stratified by geographical location, ethnicity, and source of controls; the same results were observed. CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis provides the evidence that GSTM1 null genotype may contribute to the CC development in Chinese and studies with large sample size and wider spectrum of population are warranted to verify this finding.
27461597	Tele-cytology: An innovative approach for cervical cancer screening in resource-poor settings.	Carcinoma cervix remains a leading cause of cancer mortality among women in countries lacking any screening program. The existing screening policy and approach via conventional cytology centered mainly in Tertiary Care Center, is totally unaffordable to Indian women, especially in the remote areas. This suggests the need of depolarizing the resources via generating the near real time modalities which could be used at the door step of the needy ones. For any screening modality to be effective it should be adequately sensitive, specific, reproducible, cheap, simple, affordable, and the most important is should be real time to ensure wide coverage and curtail loss to follow-up. Incorporating telecytology as a screening tool could make the dream come true. Telecytology is the interpretation of cytology material at a distance using digital images. Use of mobile telecytology unit housed in a van carrying satellite equipment and the automated image capturing systems is the central theme behind this idea. The imaging equipment would be carrying out the imaging of Papanicolaou smears prepared at the screening site and sending the images to the central laboratories situated at some tertiary care level. This concept could overcome the hindrance of trained cytology infrastructure in the resource poor settings and could provide an efficient and economical way of screening patients. There is possibility that the designed approach may not detect the entire women positive for the disease but if the desired objective was to diagnose as many cases as possible in resource poor setting, then this process offers an advantage over no screening at all.
27461263	Concurrent hyperthyroidism and papillary thyroid cancer: a fortuitous and ambiguous case report from a resource-poor setting.	BACKGROUND: Concurrent thyroid cancer (TC) and hyperthyroidism (HT) is rare though increasingly being reported. HT due to TC is much rarer and more challenging especially in Africa where TC and HT have significant case fatality rates. CASE PRESENTATION: We present a 37-year-old Cameroonian female who had been on irregular regimens of propranolol and digoxin as treatment for worsening palpitations for 12 months. She came to our district hospital for her propranolol medication refill. We fortuitously identified features of HT and found a left uninodular goiter with no cervical lymphadenopathy. She was referred for thyroid assessment which suggested primary HT and an enlarged heterogeneous left lobe with a well-defined homogenous solid mass. We restarted her on propranolol and referred her for a course of methimazole. At the referral hospital, she also underwent a left thyroid lobectomy. The resected lobe was sent for histopathology which revealed a neoplastic nodule with features suggestive of a papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) causing HT. The patient's clinical progress postoperatively was good and there was regression of hyperthyroid symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: The historical, clinical, and laboratory findings were suggestive of HT due to PTC. A high index of suspicion, prompt referral and counter-referral lead to a positive outcome of such a rare case in a resource poor setting. We advocate for systematic and careful evaluation of all thyroid nodules.
27461126	High-risk human papilloma virus genotypes in cervical carcinoma of Serbian women: Distribution and association with pathohistological findings.	A significant role of high-risk Human papilloma viruses (HR HPV) in the development of cervical carcinoma is well known. HR HPV 16 and 18 account for approximately 70% of all cases of cervical cancer worldwide. The incidence of cervical cancer in Serbia, is one of the highest in Europe. The aim of our study was to investigate the distribution of HR HPV types in cervical carcinoma of Serbian women, as well as association between the HPV types and pathohistological findings. The study included 80 archival cervical cancer tissues from the same number of patients. The presence of HPV DNA was determined using MY09/MY11 primers for L1 gene and GP1/GP2 primers for E1 gene. HPV was detected in 78.75% tissues. HR HPV genotypes found in the decreasing order of frequency were: HPV16 (80.39%), HPV33 (7.84%), HPV58 (5.88%), HPV18 (1.96%), HPV45 (1.96%) and HPV53 (1.96%). The examined tissues were 91.25% squamous cell carcinomas and 8.75% adenocarcinoma. The high frequency of HPV 16 was observed in both types of carcinoma (80.8% and 75%, respectively) while the prevalence of HPV18 was low. These results may contribute to the implementation of cervical carcinoma prevention program in Serbia, including the selection of the most appropriate vaccine and immunization program.
27461104	Extraction and purification of total flavonoids from pine needles of Cedrus deodara contribute to anti-tumor in vitro.	BACKGROUND: Cedrus deodara is one of the traditional Chinese medicinal herbs that exhibits a line of biological activities. The current study extracted the total flavonoids from the pine needles of Cedrus deodara (TFPNCD), and investigated its anti-cancer effects in tumor cell lines. METHODS: The total flavonoids was extracted from pine needles of Cedrus deodara by ethanol hot refluxing and purified by HPD722 macroporous resin. The contents of total flavonoids and the active ingredients of TFPNCD were analyzed through UV and HPLC. MTT assay was used to investigate its inhibitory effect on tumor cell lines. The flow cytometry was employed to determine the apoptosis and cell cycle distribution after treated TFPNCD on HepG2 cells. RESULTS: The TFPNCD, in which the contents of total flavonoid reached up to 54.28 %, and the major ingredients of myricetin, quercetin, kaempferol and isorhamnetin in TFPNCD were 1.89, 2.01, 2.94 and 1.22 mg/g, respectively. The MTT assays demonstrated that TFPNCD inhibited the growth of HepG2 cells in a dose-dependent manner, with the IC50 values of 114.12 mug/mL. By comparison, TFPNCD inhibited the proliferation to a less extent in human cervical carcinoma HeLa, gastric cancer MKN28 cells, glioma SHG-44 cells and lung carcinoma A549 than HepG2 cells. We found that even at the lower doses, the total flavonoids effectively inhibited the proliferation of HepG2 cells. Comparison of IC50 values implicated that HepG2 cells might be more sensitive to the treatment with total flavonoids. TFPNCD was able to increase the population of HepG2 cells in G0 /G1 phase. Meanwhile, TFPNCD treatment increased the percentage of apoptotic HepG2 cells. CONCLUSION: These data suggested that TFPNCD might have therapeutic potential in cancer through the regulation of cell cycle and apoptosis.
27456447	Presentations to general practice before a cancer diagnosis in Victoria: a cross-sectional survey.	OBJECTIVE: To assess variations in the number of general practitioner visits preceding a cancer diagnosis, and in the length of the interval between the patient first suspecting a problem and their seeing a hospital specialist. DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Analysis of data provided to the Cancer Patient Experience Survey (CPES; survey response rate, 37.7%) by 1552 patients with one of 19 cancer types and treated in one of five Victorian Comprehensive Cancer Centre hospitals, 1 October 2012 - 30 April 2013. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was the proportion of patients who had had three or more GP consultations about cancer-related health problems before being referred to hospital. The secondary outcome was the interval between the patient first suspecting a problem and their seeing a hospital specialist. RESULTS: 34% of the patients included in the final analyses (426 of 1248) had visited a GP at least three times before referral to a hospital doctor. The odds ratios (reference: rectal cancer; adjusted for age, sex, language spoken at home, and socio-economic disadvantage index score) varied according to cancer type, being highest for pancreatic cancer (3.2; 95% CI, 1.02-9.9), thyroid cancer (2.5; 95% CI, 0.9-6.6), vulval cancer (2.5; 95% CI, 0.7-8.7) and multiple myeloma (2.4; 95% CI, 1.1-5.5), and lowest for patients with breast cancer (0.4; 95% CI, 0.2-0.8), cervical cancer (0.5; 95% CI, 0.1-2.1), endometrial cancer (0.5; 95% CI, 0.2-1.4) or melanoma (0.7; 95% CI, 0.3-1.5). Cancer type also affected the duration of the interval from symptom onset to seeing a hospital doctor; it took at least 3 months for more than one-third of patients with prostate or colon cancer to see a hospital doctor. CONCLUSION: Certain cancer types were more frequently associated with multiple GP visits, suggesting they are more challenging to recognise early. In Victoria, longer intervals from the first symptoms to seeing a hospital doctor for colon or prostate cancer may reflect poorer community symptom awareness, later GP referral, or limited access to gastroenterology and urology services.
27456356	Downregulation of HMGB1 by miR-34a is sufficient to suppress proliferation, migration and invasion of human cervical and colorectal cancer cells.	High mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) is a ubiquitous nuclear protein known to be highly expressed in human cervical (CaCx) and colorectal (CRC) cancers, and sustained high levels of HMGB1 contribute to tumourigenesis and metastasis. HMGB1-targeted cancer therapy is of recent interest, and there are not many studies on miRNA-mediated HMGB1 regulation in these cancers. Since miRNA-based therapeutics for cancer is gaining importance in recent years, it was of interest to predict miRNAs targeting HMGB1. Based on the identification of a potential miR-34a response element in HMGB1-3' untranslated region (3'UTR) and an inverse correlation between HMGB1 and miR-34a expression levels in CaCx and CRC tissues, from a subset of the local population as well as a large sampling from TCGA database, experiments were performed to validate HMGB1 as a direct target of miR-34a in CaCx and CRC cells. Ectopic expression of miR-34a decreased the wild-type HMGB1-3'UTR luciferase activity but not that of its mutant in 3'UTR luciferase assays. While forced expression of miR-34a in CaCx and CRC cells inhibited HMGB1 mRNA and protein levels, proliferation, migration and invasion, inhibition of endogenous miR-34a enhanced these tumourigenic properties. siRNA-mediated HMGB1 suppression imitated miR-34a expression in reducing proliferation and metastasis-related events. Combined with the disparity in expression of miR-34a and HMGB1 in clinical specimens, the current findings would help in not only understanding the complexity of miRNA-target regulatory mechanisms but also in designing novel therapeutic interventions in CaCx and CRC.
27453113	[Correlation between high risk type human papillomavirus E6/E7 mRNA and cervical cancer].	OBJECTIVE: To investigate the correlation between the positive rate of high risk human papillomavirus(HPV)mRNA E6/E7 and cervical cancer, and provide evidence for the prevention and treatment of cervical cancer. METHODS: A total of 100 cervical cancer cases and 100 healthy controls were selected in our hospital from January 2015 to December 2015. The fluorescence quantitative PCR and pathological examination on HPV E6/E7 mRNA were carried out. The correlation between HPV E6/E7 mRNA and cervical squamous epithelial lesions were analyzed. RESULTS: In case group, the positive rate of HPV E6/E7 mRNA was 76.0%(76/100). In control group, the positive rate was 13.0%(13/100). The positive rate in case group was significantly higher than that in control group, and the difference was statistically significant(chi(2)=24.522, P<0.001). The positive predictive value and negative predictive value of the two groups were compared, and the difference was not significant(P>0.05). The positive rate of HPV E6/E7 mRNA was significantly higher than high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion(SIL)rate(26.1%), low-grade SIL rate(17.6%)and atypical squamous cell hyperplasia rate(6.7%), the difference was statistically significant(chi(2)=7.615, P= 0.001; chi(2) =9.114, P=0.001; chi(2)=18.241, P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The detection rate of HPV E6/E7 mRNA in cervical cancer patients was high. And with the increased severity of cervical squamous epithelial lesions, the positive rate of HPV E6/E7 mRNA increased.
27453110	[Relationship and interaction between folate and expression of methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 in cervical cancerization].	OBJECTIVE: To explore the interaction between folate and the expression of methyl-CpG-binding protein 2(MeCP2)in cervical cancerization. METHODS: Forty one patients diagnosed with cervical squamous cell carcinoma(SCC), 71 patients diagnosed with cervical intraepithelial neoplasm(CIN1, n=34; CIN2 +, n=37)and 61 women with normal cervix(NC)were recruited in this study. Microbiological assay was conducted to detect the levels of serum folate and RBC folate, Western blot assay and real-time PCR were performed to detect the expression levels of MeCP2 protein and mRNA, respectively. The data were analyzed by Kruskal-Wallis H test, chi(2) test, trend chi(2) test and Spearman correlation with SPSS statistical software(version 20.0), and the interaction were evaluated by using generalized multifactor dimensionality reduction(GMDR)model. RESULTS: The levels of serum folate(H=44.71, P<0.001; trend chi(2)=24.48, P<0.001)and RBC folate(H=5.28, P<0.001; trend chi(2)=3.83, P<0.05)decreased gradually along with the severity of cervical lesions. There was a positive correlation between serum folate level and RBC folate level(r=0.270, P< 0.001). The expression levels of MeCP2 protein(H=33.72, P<0.001; trend chi(2)=14.74, P<0.001)and mRNA(H=19.50, P<0.001; trend chi(2)=10.74, P<0.001)increased gradually along with the severity of cervical lesions. There were negative correlation between folate level and the expression level of MeCP2 protein(serum folate: r=-0.226, P=0.003; RBC folate: r=-0.164, P=0.004). Moreover, the results by GMDR model revealed there were interaction among serum folate deficiency, RBC folate deficiency, MeCP2 protein high expression and MeCP2 mRNA high expression in SCC and CIN2 + patients. CONCLUSION: Folate deficiency and high expression of MeCP2 gene might increase the risk of cervical cancer and its precancerous lesions through interaction among serum folate deficiency, RBC folate deficiency, MeCP2 protein high expression and mRNA high expression in the progression of cervical cancerization.
27452268	Evaluation of uterine ultrasound imaging in cervical radiotherapy; a comparison of autoscan and conventional probe.	OBJECTIVE: In cervical radiotherapy, it is essential that the uterine position is correctly determined prior to treatment delivery. The aim of this study was to evaluate an autoscan ultrasound (A-US) probe, a motorized transducer creating three-dimensional (3D) images by sweeping, by comparing it with a conventional ultrasound (C-US) probe, where manual scanning is required to acquire 3D images. METHODS: Nine healthy volunteers were scanned by seven operators, using the Clarity((R)) system (Elekta, Stockholm, Sweden). In total, 72 scans, 36 scans from the C-US and 36 scans from the A-US probes, were acquired. Two observers delineated the uterine structure, using the software-assisted segmentation in the Clarity workstation. The data of uterine volume, uterine centre of mass (COM) and maximum uterine lengths, in three orthogonal directions, were analyzed. RESULTS: In 53% of the C-US scans, the whole uterus was captured, compared with 89% using the A-US. F-test on 36 scans demonstrated statistically significant differences in interobserver COM standard deviation (SD) when comparing the C-US with the A-US probe for the inferior-superior (p < 0.006), left-right (p < 0.012) and anteroposterior directions (p < 0.001). The median of the interobserver COM distance (Euclidean distance for 36 scans) was reduced from 8.5 (C-US) to 6.0 mm (A-US). An F-test on the 36 scans showed strong significant differences (p < 0.001) in the SD of the Euclidean interobserver distance when comparing the C-US with the A-US scans. The average Dice coefficient when comparing the two observers was 0.67 (C-US) and 0.75 (A-US). The predictive interval demonstrated better interobserver delineation concordance using the A-US probe. CONCLUSION: The A-US probe imaging might be a better choice of image-guided radiotherapy system for correcting for daily uterine positional changes in cervical radiotherapy. ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: Using a novel A-US probe might reduce the uncertainty in interoperator variability during ultrasound scanning.
27450917	Genetic variability and lineage phylogeny of human papillomavirus type-16 and -53 based on the E6, E7, and L1 genes in Southwest China.	Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are circular double-stranded DNA viruses that are highly prevalent in the general population, and account for the cervical cancer burden in women worldwide. In this study, we analyzed HPV-16, the most prevalent type worldwide, and HPV-53, a possible high-risk type from infected women in Southwest China. To characterize mutations, intratypic variants, and genetic variability in the E6, E7, and L1 genes of HPV-16 (n=97) and HPV-53 (n=15), these genes were sequenced and submitted to GenBank. Phylogenetic trees were constructed using Bayesian trees, followed by secondary structure analysis and B-cell epitope prediction. Moreover, the selection pressures of the E6, E7, and L1 genes were estimated. In total, 27 novel variants of HPV-16 and 11 novel variants of HPV-53 were identified. In the HPV-16 E6-E7-L1 sequences, 73 nucleotide changes were observed with 40/73 being non-synonymous mutations (two in the alpha helix and five in the beta sheet) and 33/73 being synonymous. In the HPV-53 E6-E7-L1 sequences, 64 nucleotide changes were observed with 26/64 being non-synonymous mutations (three in the alpha helix and one in the beta sheet) and 38/64 being synonymous. Selective pressure analysis showed that most of these mutations did not reflect positive selection. The maximal divergence between any two variants within each gene of these two HPV types ranging from 0.94%(HPV-16 L1 gene)to 2.80%(HPV-53 E6 gene). Identifying new variants of HPV-16 and -53 from women in Southwest China may be helpful to design vaccines specifically for women in Southwest China and testing methods specifically for this region. The results of our study may contribute to future researches in diagnostic probes, vaccines improvement, or screening methods for a particular population.
27450469	Incidence of intraglandular lymph nodes within submandibular gland, and involvement by floor of mouth cancer.	Resection of the submandibular gland is generally undertaken as an integral component of level I neck dissection for oral cancer. However, it is unclear whether lymph nodes are present within the submandibular gland which may form the basis of lymphatic spread. Our purpose was to investigate the frequency of lymph nodes within the submandibular gland, and the incidence and mechanism of submandibular gland involvement in floor of mouth cancer. Retrospective review of 177 patients with oral cancer undergoing neck dissection. Original pathology slides of floor of mouth cases were re-reviewed by two pathologists to determine frequency of intraglandular lymph nodes, and incidence and mechanism of submandibular gland involvement by cancer. The overall incidence of cervical metastases was 36.4 %, of whom 44 % had level I metastases. Level I metastases were significantly more common in floor of mouth than tongue cancers (p = 0.004). Among 50 patients with floor of mouth cancer undergoing re-review of pathology slides, intraglandular lymph nodes were not found in any of 69 submandibular glands. Submandibular gland involvement by cancer was present in two patients, representing 1 % of all oral cancers, and 4 % FOM cases. Mechanisms of involvement were direct extension, and by an apparent novel mechanism of carcinoma growing along bilateral Wharton's ducts. Despite the high incidence of level I metastasis in floor of mouth, lymphatic metastases to submandibular gland are unlikely based on absence of intraglandular lymph nodes. We describe a previously unreported mechanism of submandibular gland involvement.
27449048	Human papillomavirus oncoproteins differentially modulate epithelial-mesenchymal transition in 5-FU-resistant cervical cancer cells.	Etiological role of viral proteins E6 and E7 of high-risk HPV in cervical carcinogenesis is well established. However, their contribution in chemoresistance and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) that leads to advanced metastatic lesions and chemoresistance is poorly defined. In the present study, contribution of viral oncoproteins in acquisition of EMT character during onset of chemoresistance was assessed. A chemoresistant cell line (SiHaCR) was developed from an established HPV16-positive cervical cancer cell line, SiHa, by escalating selection pressure of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). Expression of Survivin, ABCG2, Snail, Slug, Twist, and Vimentin was examined in SiHa and SiHaCR cells by reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR) and immunoblotting assays. Mesenchymal phenotype in SiHaCR cells was confirmed by assessment of migration and invasion potentials. SiHaCR cells displayed elevated level of functional and molecular markers associated with chemoresistance (Survivin, ABCG2) and EMT (Snail, Slug, Twist, Vimentin) and reduced E-cadherin. SiHaCR also showed increased levels of HPV16 E6 and E7 transcripts. Specific silencing of HPV16 E6, but not E7 using corresponding siRNA, demonstrated a differential involvement of HPV oncogenes in manifestation of EMT. HPV16 E6 silencing resulted in reduction of Slug and Twist expression. However, the expression of Snail and Vimentin was only marginally affected. In contrast, there was an increase in the expression of E-cadherin. A reduced migration and invasion capabilities were observed only in E6-silenced SiHaCR cells, which further confirmed functional contribution of HPV16 E6 in manifestation of EMT. Taken together, our study demonstrated an active involvement of HPV16 E6 in regulation of EMT, which promotes chemoresistance in cervical cancer.
27446968	Seminal Fluid-Mediated Inflammation in Physiology and Pathology of the Female Reproductive Tract.	Inflammation is a multifaceted process involving a host of resident and recruited immune cells that eliminate the insult or injury and initiate tissue repair. In the female reproductive tract (FMRT), inflammation-mediated alterations in epithelial, vascular, and immune functions are important components of complex physiological processes and many local and systemic pathologies. It is well established that intracoital and postcoital function of seminal fluid (SF) goes beyond nutritive support for the spermatozoa cells. SF, in particular, the inflammatory bioactive lipids, and prostaglandins present in vast quantities in SF, have a role in localized immune modulation and regulation of pathways that can exacerbate inflammation in the FMRT. In sexually active women SF-mediated inflammation has been implicated in physiologic processes such as ovulation, implantation, and parturition while also enhancing tumorigenesis and susceptibility to infection. This review highlights the molecular mechanism by which SF regulates inflammatory pathways in the FMRT and how alterations in these pathways contribute to physiology and pathology of the female reproductive function. In addition, based on findings from TaqMan(R) 96-Well Plate Arrays, on neoplastic cervical cells treated with SF, we discuss new findings on the role of SF as a potent driver of inflammatory and tumorigenic pathways in the cervix.
27445608	The Effect of Guidance regarding Home Exercise and ADL on Adolescent Females Suffering from Adverse Effects after HPV Vaccination in Japanese Multidisciplinary Pain Centers.	Background. Two prophylactic papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines have been available for primary prevention of cervical cancer. Although serious adverse effects (AE) were rare, more than 230 women have been suffering from severe AEs such as persistent pain and headache in Japan. Our research group started to treat adolescent females suffering from the AEs. Objective. To survey the characteristics of and the effects of cognitive behavioral therapy on adolescent female suffering from the AEs in Japanese multidisciplinary pain centers. Methods. One hundred and forty-five patients suffering from the AEs were reviewed retrospectively and 105 patients of them were provided guidance on home exercise and activities of daily living based partially on a cognitive-behavioral approach. The intensity of pain was rated by the patients using a numerical rating scale (NRS). Furthermore, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS) were used. Results. Eighty out of the 105 patients who received the guidance were followed up, 10 displayed a marked improvement, and 43 showed some improvement. Conclusions. Guidance on home exercise and activities of daily living based on a cognitive-behavioral approach alleviated the AEs that women suffered from after HPV vaccination in Japan.
27445314	Predicting tumor recurrence in patients with cervical carcinoma treated with definitive chemoradiotherapy: value of quantitative histogram analysis on diffusion-weighted MR images.	Background Further research is required for evaluating the use of ADC histogram analysis in more advanced stages of cervical cancer treated with definitive chemoradiotherapy (CRT). Purpose To investigate the utility of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) histogram derived from diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance images in cervical cancer patients treated with definitive CRT. Material and Methods The clinical and radiological data of 50 patients with histologically proven cervical squamous cell carcinoma treated with definitive CRT were retrospectively analyzed. The impact of clinicopathological factors and ADC histogram parameters on prognostic factors and treatment outcomes was assessed. Results The mean and median ADC values for the cohort were 1.043 +/- 0.135 x 10-3 mm2/s and 1.018 x 10-3 mm2/s (range, 0.787-1.443 x 10-3 mm2/s). The mean ADC was significantly lower for patients with advanced stage (>/=IIB) or lymph node metastasis compared with patients with stage <IIB or no lymph node metastasis. The mean ADC, 75th percentile ADC (ADC75), 90th percentile ADC (ADC90), and 95th percentile ADC (ADC95) were significantly lower in patients with tumor recurrence compared with patients without recurrence. In multivariate analysis, tumor size, ADC75 and ADC95 were independent prognostic factors for both overall survival and disease-free survival. Conclusion ADC histogram parameters could be markers for disease recurrence and for predicting survival outcomes. ADC75, ADC90, and ADC95 of the primary tumor were significant predictors of disease recurrence in cervical cancer patients treated with definitive CRT.
27443891	Management of HPV-related cervical disease: role of p16INK4a immunochemistry. Review of the literature.	This systematic review of 43 studies aims to evaluate the absolute and relative sensitivity and specificity of p16INK4a with regard to uterine cervix lesions, describing innovations and techniques for the detection of high-grade cervical dysplasia and allowing correct treatment. Studies were identified in the PubMed database up to March 2015. The keywords hrHPV, p16INK4a gene, and uterine cervical disease (MeSH terms) were used. Only English-language articles were included. We considered retrospective and prospective studies that assessed p16INK4a or p16INK4a/Ki67 staining, with or without HPV-DNA testing (HC2/PCR) as a comparator test, in cytological/histological specimens for which the diagnosis of ASCUS, LSIL or HSIL was verified with a reference standard. The primary outcome for cervical lesions was evaluation of the absolute p16INK4a immunoreactivity; the secondary outcome was evaluation of the relative p16INK4a immunoreactivity versus HPV testing in those studies where comparator tests were available. p16INK4a was more specific than HPV-DNA test (median values of 56.1% vs. 52.25% in CIN grade >/=2 lesions; 82.5% vs. 53% in negative and CIN grade >/=1 lesions). The main limitation of this study is linked to both qualitative and quantitative p16INK4a levels of expression, while the second limitation is the lack of standardized scales. p16INK4a and HPV-DNA used together increased the sensitivity and negative predictive value for CIN detection. p16INK4a can be considered a biomarker of CIN2 or CIN3, indicating a high risk of relapse or evolution to invasive carcinoma. Also p16INK4a-negative CIN should be considered and further research should be performed.
27442631	A case report of isolated lymphadenopathy revealing localized leishmanial lymphadenopathy in an asthenic 25-year-old man.	BACKGROUND: Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is endemic in large areas of the tropics, the subtropics, and the Mediterranean basin. Besides classical VL presentation, exceptional cases of a limited form of VL have been reported. Here we describe the challenges of diagnosis and management of this intriguing entity. CASE SUMMARY: A 25-year-old French Caucasian man presented with marked asthenia that had lasted 6 months and was strictly isolated except for a 2-cm left cervical lymphadenopathy. The rest of the clinical examination and extensive biological exploration were unremarkable.Histological examination of the cervical lymphadenopathy showed a reactive lymphoid hyperplasia with granulomatous organization associated with small particles in the cytoplasm of epithelioid histiocytes and giant cells evocative of Leishman-Donovan bodies. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) performed on the tissue confirmed the presence of Leishmania donovani/infantum DNA. Direct examination of a bone marrow aspiration, together with blood and bone marrow PCR, did not find other evidence for VL. Serology for leishmaniasis was unreactive. Extensive work-up for other causes of granulomatous lymphadenitis was negative. A diagnosis of localized leishmanial lymphadenopathy was made. Intravenous liposomal amphotericin B (20 mg/kg in five infusions) was initiated and well tolerated. Asthenia disappeared promptly and the patient fully recovered. CONCLUSION: Localized lymph node enlargement because of leishmanial infection should be included in the differential diagnosis of lymphadenopathy of unknown origin in patients who stayed or visited, even a long time ago and for a short period, endemic areas for leishmaniasis such as the Mediterranean basin. Fine-needle aspiration cytology and/or PCR for Leishmania sp of the lymphadenopathy might contribute to the diagnosis. A low-dose liposomal amphotericin B treatment might be effective, and deserves further study.
27442344	Utility of intravaginal ultrasound gel for local staging of cervical carcinoma on MRI.	PURPOSE: The aim of this study is to evaluate the utility of intravaginal ultrasound gel for the staging of cervical carcinoma on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and to confirm the results with pathological staging. METHODS: Nine patients were included in the study. T2-weighted images were compared without and with vaginal gel (VG). RESULTS: Five patients were evaluated as overstaged on MRI without VG. After VG, the results were compatible with the pathological stages in all patients. CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that this technique is easy, well tolerated, and effective, and it increases the accuracy rate of MRI staging in early cervical cancer.
27442151	Phospholipid-chitosan hybrid nanoliposomes promoting cell entry for drug delivery against cervical cancer.	This study emphasizes the development of a novel surface modified liposome as an anticancer drug nanocarrier. Quaternized N,O-oleoyl chitosan (QCS) was synthesized and incorporated into liposome vesicles, generating QCS-liposomes (Lip-QCS). The Lip-QCS liposomes were spherical in shape (average size diameter 171.5+/-0.8nm), with a narrow size distribution (PDI 0.1+/-0.0) and zeta potential of 11.7+/-0.7mV. In vitro mucoadhesive tests indicated that Lip-QCS possesses a mucoadhesive property. Moreover, the presence of QCS was able to induce the cationic charge on the surface of liposome. Cellular internalization of Lip-QCS was monitored over time, with the results revealing that the cell entry level of Lip-QCS was elevated at 24h. Following this, Lip-QCS were then employed to load cisplatin, a common platinum-containing anti-cancer drug, with a loading efficiency of 27.45+/-0.78% being obtained. The therapeutic potency of the loaded Lip-QCS was investigated using a 3D spheroid cervical cancer model (SiHa) which highlighted their cytotoxicity and apoptosis effect, and suitability as a controllable system for sustained drug release. This approach has the potential to assist in development of an effective drug delivery system against cervical cancer.
27442040	Stratified Mucin-Producing Intraepithelial Lesion of the Cervix: Subtle Features Not to Be Missed.	OBJECTIVES: Stratified mucin-producing intraepithelial lesion (SMILE) is an uncommon premalignant lesion of the uterine cervix. A detailed examination of preinvasive SMILE cases including a comparison of the cytologic features with usual-type adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS) and human papillomavirus (HPV) genotyping was performed. STUDY DESIGN: Excisions and preceding Papanicolaou (Pap) tests were retrieved from the files of 2 tertiary care centers. Histologic review estimated the lesional SMILE proportion. Pap tests were reviewed and assessed for architectural, cellular and background features. Cobas(R) HPV test was performed. RESULTS: 13 cases were identified. Mean/median patient age was 35/33 years (range 23-51 years). Concurrent high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion was found in 10/13 (77%) and AIS in 8/13 (62%) cases. In 6 cases, SMILE was dominant (>/=50%) and represented in 5/6 corresponding Pap tests. Cytology interpretations differed more often in the SMILE-dominant group (p < 0.05). SMILE and AIS had overlapping features. Feathering and prominent nucleoli were absent in SMILE. HPV DNA was detected in all 12 cases tested. HPV 18 was most common (7/12). Excisions with positive/suspicious margins were reported in 5/6 SMILE-dominant versus 3/7 nondominant cases. CONCLUSION: SMILE is best considered as an AIS variant for cytologic, etiologic and management purposes. Cytologic features overlap with AIS, but are more subtle and easily missed. HPV testing may play a role in facilitating SMILE detection.
27438585	Tumor Size Has a Time-Varying Effect on Recurrence in Cervical Cancer.	OBJECTIVE: This study analyzed the risk factors for their possible association with overall survival and progression-free survival in cervical cancer, with a flexible model that allowed time-varying effects. METHODS: Information about patients with cervical cancer from 2002 to 2012 was collected in the Kaohsiung Veterans General Hospital. All available biological and clinicopathologic factors were tested for the assumption of the Cox proportional hazard model, that is, whether they had time-varying effect on survival. The factors were also analyzed in univariate and multivariate statistics to identify independent risk factors. The multivariate analysis was performed with an extended Cox model so that those factors that failed the assumption test were allowed to vary with time. RESULTS: Approximately 797 patients were included in the final analysis. Most factors tested passed the Cox assumption test, except tumor size and body mass index in the event of recurrence and preoperative CA125 values in the event of death (P < 0.05). Univariate and multivariate analysis identified tumor size, stage, and lymph nodal metastasis as independent significant risk factors for both recurrence and death (P < 0.05), with tumor size being a time-varying factor for recurrence. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with larger tumor size, higher FIGO stage, and lymph nodal metastasis are faced with higher risk of recurrence and death. A larger tumor size poses increasingly higher risk for recurrence initially, and its importance declines as the patient survives longer without disease progression. These findings may be helpful to gynecologists when assessing tumor risk of patients with cervical cancer and in patient consultation.
27435888	Prognostic significance of number of nodes removed in patients with node-negative early cervical cancer.	AIM: The aim of this study was to investigate whether the number of removed lymph nodes was associated with survival of patients with node-negative early cervical cancer and to analyze the prognostic significance of clinical and pathologic features in these patients. METHODS: Patients with FIGO stage IA-IIB cervical cancer who underwent radical hysterectomy with lymphadenectomy without receiving preoperative therapy were reviewed retrospectively. Patients were all proved to have lymph-node-negative disease and classified into five groups based on the number of nodes removed. The Kaplan-Meier method and Cox's proportional hazards regression model were used in prognostic analysis. RESULTS: The final dataset included 359 patients: 45 (12.5%) patients had </=10 nodes removed, 93 (25.9%) had 11-15, 98 (27.3%) had 16-20, 64 (17.8%) had 21-25, and 59 (16.4%) had >25 nodes removed. There was no association between the number of nodes removed and survival of patients with node-negative early cervical cancer (chi2 = 6.19, P = 0.185). Similarly, subgroup analyses for FIGO stage IB1-IIB also showed that the number of lymph nodes was not significantly related to survival in each stage. Multivariate analyses showed that histology and depth of invasion were independent prognostic factors for survival in these patients. CONCLUSION: If a standardized lymphadenectomy is performed, the number of lymph nodes removed is not an independent prognostic factor for patients with node-negative early cervical cancer. Our study suggests that there is inconclusive evidence to support survival benefit of complete lymphadenectomy among these patients.
27434279	Metastatic urinary tract cancers in pap test: Cytomorphologic findings and differential diagnosis.	Although the cervical Pap test was devised for the detection of primary cervical neoplasia, it can provide additional diagnostic information, and in some cases, be diagnostic for noncervical processes. The diagnosis of metastatic extrauterine cervical cancers on the Pap test is extremely rare; and in most cases, it is the result of an ovarian or fallopian tube primary. Further, urinary tract cancers, including renal and urinary primaries are exceedingly rare. To our knowledge, six surgical cases of metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC) have been described. We report the first case of metastatic clear cell RCC detected on the cervical Pap test. Additionally, to our knowledge, we report the second case of metastatic high-grade urothelial carcinoma detected on the cervical Pap test. Both patients had a history of malignancy, which underscore the importance of broadening the differential diagnosis to rule out cytomorphologic features consistent with a patient's primary diagnosis when interpreting the cervical Pap test.

27434153	Modulating chromatin structure and DNA accessibility by deacetylase inhibition enhances the anti-cancer activity of silver nanoparticles.	Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors are considered as novel therapeutic agents inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptotic cell death in various cancer cells. Inhibition of deacetylase activity results in a relaxed chromatin structure thereby rendering the genetic material more vulnerable to DNA targeting agents that could be exploited by combinational cancer therapy. The unique potential of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) in tumor therapy relies on the generation of reactive radicals which trigger oxidative stress, DNA damage and apoptosis in cancer cells. The revolutionary application of AgNPs as chemotherapeutical drugs seems very promising, nevertheless the exact molecular mechanisms of AgNP action in combination with other anti-cancer agents have yet to be elucidated in details before clinical administrations. As a step towards this we investigated the combinational effect of HDAC inhibition and AgNP administration in HeLa cervical cancer cells. We identified synergistic inhibition of cancer cell growth and migration upon combinational treatments. Here we report that the HDAC inhibitor Trichostatin A enhances the DNA targeting capacity and apoptosis inducing efficacy of AgNPs most probably due to its effect on chromatin condensation. These results point to the potential benefits of combinational application of HDAC inhibitors and AgNPs in novel cancer medication protocols.
27431825	Effects of irreversible electroporation on cervical cancer cell lines in vitro.	The effects of irreversible electroporation (IRE) on the proliferation, migration, invasion and adhesion of human cervical cancer cell lines HeLa and SiHa were investigated in the present study. HeLa and SiHa cells were divided into a treatment group and control group. The treatment group cells were exposed to electric pulses at 16 pulses, 1 Hz frequency for 100 microsec with 1,000 V/cm strength. Cellular proliferation was determined 24 h after treatment using a Cell Counting Kit8 (CCK8) assay and carboxyfluorescein diacetatesuccinimidyl ester (CFDASE) labeling assay. The different phases of the cell cycle were detected using flow cytometry. Wound healing, Transwell invasion and Matrigel adhesion assays were performed to evaluate the migration, invasion and adhesion abilities of HeLa and SiHa cells. The expression levels of metastasisassociated proteins were determined by western blot analysis. CCK8 and CFSE labeling assays indicated that the inhibition of cellular proliferation occurs in cells treated with IRE. Additionally, cell cycle progression was arrested at the G1/S phase. A western blot analysis indicated that the expression levels of p53 and p21 proteins were increased, whilst those of cyclindependent kinase 2 (CDK2) and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) proteins were decreased. However, wound healing, invasion and adhesion assays indicated that cellular migration, invasion and adhesion abilities were not significantly altered following exposure to IRE. IRE was not observed to promote the migration, invasion or adhesion capacity of HeLa and SiHa cells. However, IRE may inhibit the capacity of cells to proliferate and their progression through the cell cycle in vitro. Preliminary evidence suggests that the underlying mechanism involves increased expression levels of p53 and p21 and decreased expression levels of CDK2 and PCNA.
27431773	Synthesis and cytotoxicity evaluation of 4'-amino-4'-dehydroxyloleandrin derivatives.	A series of C4'-substituted oleandrin analogues were designed, synthesized and evaluated for their cytotoxicity towards human cervical carcinoma cell line (HeLa). The structure-activity relationships (SARs) of these compounds were summarized in this paper, and 4'-alpha-amino-4'-dehydroxyloleandrin 4a (IC50=21.7nM) and 4'-beta-amino-4'-dehydroxyloleandrin 4b (IC50=10.9nM) exhibited stronger cytotoxicity compared with oleandrin (IC50=33.3nM). Furthermore, the cytotoxicity of these two compounds towards another five human cancer cell lines (NCI-H266, A549, Jurkat, HL-60 and PC-3) was also evaluated and the IC50 values of beta-amino derivative 4b were approximately 2-3 folds lower than that of oleandrin.
27431502	UHRF1 gene silencing inhibits cell proliferation and promotes cell apoptosis in human cervical squamous cell carcinoma CaSki cells.	BACKGROUND: Up-regulation of UHRF1 has been observed in a variety of cancers and appears to serve as an independent prognostic factor. OBJECTIVE: To explore the effect of UHRF1 gene silencing on apoptosis and proliferation of cervical squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC) CaSki cells. METHODS: This study consisted of 47 CSCC tissues and 40 normal cervical tissues. The CaSki cells were assigned into Blank group (CaSki cells not transfected), NC group (CaSki cells transfected with control siRNA), and UHRF1 Silence group (CaSki cells transfected with UHRF1 siRNA). qRT-PCR and Western blot were used for UHRF1 mRNA and protein expressions, CKK-8 assay for cell proliferation, flow cytometry for cell cycle and apoptosis, Western blot for expressions of apoptosis-related proteins. Nude mice tumor transplant experiment was performed. RESULTS: UHRF1 exhibited higher mRNA and protein expressions in the CSCC tissues than normal cervical tissues (both P < 0.05). The cell proliferation ability in the UHRF1 Silence group was reduced when compared with the Blank group and the NC group, the cells at S-G2M stage in the UHRF1 Silence group were dropped when compared with the Blank group and the NC group (P < 0.05), while the cells at G0/G1 stage were elevated (P < 0.05), and the proportion of Annexin V positive cells in the UHRF1 Silence group was increased in comparison with the Blank group and the NC group (P < 0.05). Nude mice tumor transplant experiment indicated that the growth rate and weight of tumor in the Blank group and NC group was higher and heavier than the UHRF1 Silence group (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: UHRF1 showed a high expression in CSCC and UHRF1 silencing can reduce proliferation and enhance apoptosis of the CaSki cells.
27430325	MicroRNA-497 inhibits the proliferation, migration and invasion of human bladder transitional cell carcinoma cells by targeting E2F3.	Accumulating evidence indicates that microRNAs (miRNAs) play critical roles in regulating cellular processes, such as cell growth and apoptosis, as well as cancer progression and metastasis. Low expression of miR-497 has been observed in breast, colorectal and cervical cancers. Human bladder transitional cell carcinoma (BTCC) progression typically follows a complex cascade from primary malignancy to distant metastasis, but whether the aberrant expression of miR-497 in BTCC is associated with malignancy, metastasis or prognosis remains unknown. In the present study, we found that miR-497 was markedly downregulated in BTCC tissue samples when compared with that noted in adjacent normal tissues, and low expression of miR-497 was correlated with poor prognosis in BTCC patients. We also found that overexpression of miR-497 inhibited the proliferation, migration and invasion of bladder cancer cells by downregulating E2F3 (an miR-497 target gene) mRNA and protein and that siRNA against E2F3 inhibited cell proliferation, migration and invasion, which was similar to the effect of miR-497 overexpression in the BTCC cells. Our experimental data indicated that miR-497 mediates the in vitro proliferation, migration and invasion of BTCC cells. Together, these results suggest that miR-497 may represent a novel prognostic indicator, a biomarker for the early detection of metastasis and a target for gene therapy of BTCC.
27430086	Vulvar and Vaginal Cancer, Vulvar Intraepithelial Neoplasia 3 and Vaginal Intraepithelial Neoplasia 3: Experience of a Referral Institute.	BACKGROUND: Vulvar and vaginal malignant and premalignant lesions are uncommon and are clinically heterogeneous diseases with two pathways of carcinogenesis: human papillomavirus (HPV) induced or non-HPV induced. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the demographic and clinical characteristics associated with vulvar or vaginal cancer and vulvar and vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia 3 (VIN3, VAIN3). METHODS: We conducted a retrospective chart review of 148 women with vulvar and vaginal malignancy and pre-malignancy for the period October 2004 to October 2012, and identified 59 and 19 patients with vulvar and vaginal cancer respectively, and 57 and 13 patients with VIN3 and VAIN3 respectively RESULTS: The median age of vulvar cancer patients was 30 years older than that of VIN3 patients. HPV was found in 60% and 66.6% of vulvar and vaginal cancer patients respectively, and in 82.3% and 84.6% of patients with VIN3 and VAIN3 respectively. A history of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) or warts was observed in 10% and 10.5% of vulvar and vaginal cancer patients respectively, and in 57.9% and 46% of patients with VIN3 and VAIN3 respectively. In 52.6% of patients the vaginal cancer was metastases from other organs. CONCLUSIONS: Most women with vulvar carcinoma are older than 70 years. VIN3 and VAIN3 are associated with HPV infection and the most prevalent type is HPV16. Almost half the vaginal cancers are associated with metastases from other organs and almost half of VAIN3 is associated with past cervical dysplasia or carcinoma.
27428114	Pain relief for women with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia undergoing colposcopy treatment.	BACKGROUND: Pre-cancerous lesions of cervix (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN)) are usually treated with excisional or ablative procedures. In the UK, the National Health Service (NHS) cervical screening guidelines suggest that over 80% of treatments should be performed in an outpatient setting (colposcopy clinics). Furthermore, these guidelines suggest that analgesia should always be given prior to laser or excisional treatments. Currently various pain relief strategies are employed that may reduce pain during these procedures. OBJECTIVES: To assess whether the administration of pain relief (analgesia) reduces pain during colposcopy treatment and in the postoperative period. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2016, Issue 2), MEDLINE (1950 to March week 3, 2016) and Embase (1980 to week 12, 2016) for studies of any design relating to analgesia for colposcopic management. We also searched registers of clinical trials, abstracts of scientific meetings, reference lists of included studies and contacted experts in the field. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared all types of pain relief before, during or after outpatient treatment to the cervix, in women with CIN undergoing loop excision, laser ablation, laser excision or cryosurgery in an outpatient colposcopy clinic setting. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We independently assessed study eligibility, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We entered data into Review Manager 5 and double checked it for accuracy. Where possible, we expressed results as mean pain score and standard error of the mean with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and synthesised data in a meta-analysis. MAIN RESULTS: We included 19 RCTs (1720 women) of varying methodological quality in the review. These trials compared a variety of interventions aimed at reducing pain in women who underwent treatment for CIN, including cervical injection with lignocaine alone, lignocaine with adrenaline, buffered lignocaine with adrenaline, prilocaine with felypressin, oral analgesics (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)), inhalation analgesia (gas mixture of isoflurane and desflurane), lignocaine spray, cocaine spray, local application of benzocaine gel, lignocaine-prilocaine cream (EMLA cream) and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS).Most comparisons were restricted to single trial analyses and were under-powered to detect differences in pain scores between treatments that may or may not have been present. There was no difference in pain relief between women who received local anaesthetic infiltration (lignocaine 2%; administered as a paracervical or direct cervical injection) and a saline placebo (mean difference (MD) -13.74; 95% CI -34.32 to 6.83; 2 trials; 130 women; low quality evidence). However, when local anaesthetic was combined with a vasoconstrictor agent (one trial used lignocaine plus adrenaline while the second trial used prilocaine plus felypressin), there was less pain (on visual analogue scale (VAS)) compared with no treatment (MD -23.73; 95% CI -37.53 to -9.93; 2 trials; 95 women; low quality evidence). Comparing two preparations of local anaesthetic combined with vasoconstrictor, prilocaine plus felypressin did not differ from lignocaine plus adrenaline for its effect on pain control (MD -0.05; 95% CI -0.26 to 0.16; 1 trial; 200 women). Although the mean (+/- standard deviation (SD)) observed blood loss score was less with lignocaine plus adrenaline (1.33 +/- 1.05) compared with prilocaine plus felypressin (1.74 +/- 0.98), the difference was not clinically as the overall scores in both groups were low (MD 0.41; 95% CI 0.13 to 0.69; 1 trial; 200 women). Inhalation of gas mixture (isoflurane and desflurane) in addition to standard cervical injection with prilocaine plus felypressin resulted in less pain during the LLETZ (loop excision of the transformation zone) procedure (MD -7.20; 95% CI -12.45 to -1.95; 1 trial; 389 women). Lignocaine plus ornipressin resulted in less measured blood loss (MD -8.75 ml; 95% CI -10.43 to -7.07; 1 trial; 100 women) and a shorter duration of treatment (MD -7.72 minutes; 95% CI -8.49 to -6.95; 1 trial; 100 women) than cervical infiltration with lignocaine alone. Buffered solution (sodium bicarbonate buffer mixed with lignocaine plus adrenaline) was not superior to non-buffered solution of lignocaine plus adrenaline in relieving pain during the procedure (MD -8.00; 95% CI -17.57 to 1.57; 1 trial; 52 women).One meta-analysis found no difference in pain using VAS between women who received oral analgesic and women who received placebo (MD -3.51; 95% CI -10.03 to 3.01; 2 trials; 129 women; low quality evidence).Cocaine spray was associated with less pain (MD -28.00; 95% CI -37.86 to -18.14; 1 trial; 50 women) and blood loss (MD 0.04; 95% CI 0 to 0.70; 1 trial; 50 women) than placebo.None of the trials reported serious adverse events and majority of trials were at moderate or high risk of bias (13 trials). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Based on two small trials, there was no difference in pain relief in women receiving oral analgesics compared with placebo or no treatment (MD -3.51; 95% CI -10.03 to 3.01; 129 women). We consider this evidence to be of a low to moderate quality. In routine clinical practice, intracervical injection of local anaesthetic with a vasoconstrictor (lignocaine plus adrenaline or prilocaine plus felypressin) appears to be the optimum analgesia for treatment. However, further high quality, adequately powered trials should be undertaken in order to provide the data necessary to estimate the efficacy of oral analgesics, the optimal route of administration and dose of local anaesthetics.
27427519	Mediastinal Staging: Endosonographic Ultrasound Lymph Node Biopsy or Mediastinoscopy.	Combined endosonographic lymph node biopsy techniques are a minimally invasive alternative to surgical staging in non-small cell lung cancer and may be superior to standard mediastinoscopy and surgical mediastinal staging techniques. Endosonography allows for the biopsy of lymph nodes and metastases unattainable with standard mediastinoscopy. Standard cervical mediastinoscopy is an invasive procedure, which requires general anesthesia and is associated with higher risk, cost, and major complication rates compared with minimally invasive endosonographic biopsy techniques. Combined endosonographic procedures are the new gold standard in staging of non-small cell lung cancer when performed by an experienced operator.
27421019	Prevalence of human papillomavirus (HPV), distribution of HPV types, and risk factors for infection in HPV-positive women.	The aim of this study was to describe the prevalence of human papillomavirus (HPV), the distribution of different HPV types, and the putative risk factors for infection among HPV-positive women from the State of Alagoas, Northeast Brazil. We analyzed data from 515 patients attending public and private health centers. HPV DNA from cervical samples was extracted and HPV genotyping was performed by polymerase chain reaction using MY09/11 consensus primers followed by direct sequencing. The chi-squared test for independence was used to assess statistical differences between the HPV groups. HPV DNA was found in 111 (21.55%) cervical samples. Twenty genotypes were detected: HPV6, 11, 16, 31, 33, 35, 39, 52, 53, 54, 58, 61, 62, 66, 70, 72, 81, 82, 83, and 84. In addition, multiple sexual partners (P = 0.002) and the use of oral contraceptives (P = 0.015) were associated with the presence of HPV. These findings may be relevant to the design of screening and vaccination strategies targeting specific groups of women in Northeast Brazil.
27420961	Evaluation of novel assays for the detection of human papilloma virus in self-collected samples for cervical cancer screening.	The aim of this study was to evaluate the performance of three new high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) assays for primary cervical cancer screening, by using self-collected samples, and to identify an HPV assay that could overcome the major obstacles faced during large-scale population-based screening. Two hundred and ten women showing abnormal cervical cytology (and referred for a colposcopy) were recruited in this study. Self-collected samples obtained from all women were tested with the Cobas, Seq, and BioPerfectus Multiplex Real Time HPV assays; simultaneously, clinician-collected samples (from the same women) were tested with the gold-standard Cobas HPV assay. The results of all the assays were consistent. The sensitivity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2+ (CIN2+) and CIN3+ were comparable between the self-collected samples tested with the three new assays and the clinician-collected samples tested with the Cobas HPV assay (P > 0.05). The single-genotype HPV load per sample did not differ significantly between the self- and clinician-collected samples (P = 0.195). In conclusion, the results of this study demonstrated the applicability of the three new HPV assays for primary cervical cancer screening based on self-collection.
27418281	Structural investigation on the intrinsically disordered N-terminal region of HPV16 E7 protein.	Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the major cause of cervical cancer, a deadly threat to millions of females. The early oncogene product (E7) of the high-risk HPV16 is the primary agent associated with HPV-related cervical cancers. In order to understand how E7 contributes to the transforming activity, we investigated the structural features of the flexible N-terminal region (46 residues) of E7 by carrying out N-15 heteronuclear NMR experiments and replica exchange molecular dynamics simulations. Several NMR parameters as well as simulation ensemble structures indicate that this intrinsically disordered region of E7 contains two transient (10-20% populated) helical pre-structured motifs that overlap with important target binding moieties such as an E2F-mimic motif and a pRb-binding LXCXE segment. Presence of such target-binding motifs in HPV16 E7 provides a reasonable explanation for its promiscuous target-binding behavior associated with its transforming activity. [BMB Reports 2016; 49(8): 431-436].
27417721	Expression of human selenoprotein genes selh, selk, selm, sels, selv, and gpx-6 in various tumor cell lines.	The expression level of the genes encoding six selenocysteine-containing human proteins was determined in the brain, cervical, liver, breast, prostate, and human fibrosarcoma cancer cells. It was found that a high level of expression in all studied types genes of tumor cells is characteristic for selh, selk, and selm genes, encoding SelH, SelK, and SelM proteins, respectively, whereas a complete lack of such expression was shown for gpx-6, selv, and sels genes. The results of this work can be regarded as a major prerequisite for further studies on the role of the three selenoproteins SelH, SelK, and SelM in the regulation of carcinogenesis processes associated with these types of cancer.
27417089	Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification Targeting Actin DNA of Trichomonas vaginalis.	Trichomoniasis caused by Trichomonas vaginalis is a common sexually transmitted disease. Its association with several health problems, including preterm birth, pelvic inflammatory disease, cervical cancer, and transmission of human immunodeficiency virus, emphasizes the importance of improved access to early and accurate detection of T. vaginalis. In this study, a rapid and efficient loop-mediated isothermal amplification-based method for the detection of T. vaginalis was developed and validated, using vaginal swab specimens from subjects suspected to have trichomoniasis. The LAMP assay targeting the actin gene was highly sensitive with detection limits of 1 trichomonad and 1 pg of T. vaginalis DNA per reaction, and specifically amplified the target gene only from T. vaginalis. Validation of this assay showed that it had the highest sensitivity and better agreement with PCR (used as the gold standard) compared to microscopy and multiplex PCR. This study showed that the LAMP assay, targeting the actin gene, could be used to diagnose early infections of T. vaginalis. Thus, we have provided an alternative molecular diagnostic tool and a point-of-care test that may help to prevent trichomoniasis transmission and associated complications.
27413748	Expression of HIF-2alpha and VEGF in Cervical Squamous Cell Carcinoma and Its Clinical Significance.	CSCC is a systemic disease involving polygenic alteration and multiple steps, and HIF and VEGF are closely associated with tumorigenesis. Specimens surgically resected from 64 cases of CSCC and 22 cases of normal cervical tissue were selected randomly to detect the expression of HIF-2alpha and VEGF in CSCC for exploring their clinical significance; information regarding the age, lymph node metastasis, and FIGO staging were collected as well; expression of HIF-2alpha and VEGF was detected by qPCR and immunohistochemistry. We found that the expression of HIF-2alpha and VEGF mRNA in CSCC was significantly higher than that of normal cervical tissues and showed a positive correlation between them. The positive rates of HIF-2alpha and VEGF protein expression in CSCC and normal cervical tissues were 93.8% and 18.2%, respectively, with correlation between them. The expression of both HIF-2alpha and VEGF mRNA did not relate closely to age but the FIGO staging and lymph node metastasis. Compared with the counterpart control group, CSCC tissues with high FIGO staging and lymph node metastasis had a higher level of HIF-2alpha and VEGF mRNA expression. So, HIF-2alpha and VEGF were overexpressed in CSCC, which has a great clinical significance for its diagnosis.
27411767	[Frequency, Intensity and Daily Life Distress of Urinary Dysfunction in Women with Cervical Cancer after Radical Hysterectomy].	PURPOSE: This study was done to identify frequency, intensity of urinary dysfunction and daily life distress in women after a radical hysterectomy for cervical cancer. METHODS: One hundred and fifty seven women who had undergone a radical hysterectomy and one hundred and sixty five women as healthy controls completed questionnaires on intensity of urinary dysfunction and daily life distress caused by urinary dysfunction. RESULTS: Women with cervical cancer showed higher frequency of urinary dysfunction than healthy controls. Major urinary dysfunction for women with cervical cancer in order of frequency were night-time incontinence (odds ratio=10.39, p<.001), difficulty in starting urination, weak urine stream and sense of incomplete emptying of bladder. The highest score on intensity was difficulty in starting urination, followed by urgency, weak urine stream, daytime frequency and sense of incomplete emptying. Night-time incontinence was the urinary symptom causing the most daily life distress for cervical cancer women followed by difficulty in starting urination, urgency, sense of incomplete emptying, and night-time frequency. CONCLUSION: Results suggest that nurses should address the potential postoperative urinary complications and develop long term interventions to decrease urinary dysfunction and daily life distress for women who have had a radical hysterectomy for cervical cancer.
27406233	Evaluation and clinical significance of cyclin-dependent kinase5 expression in cervical lesions: a clinical research study in Guangxi, China.	BACKGROUND: Studies have been reported that cyclin-dependent kinase5 (CDK5) was associated with the development of several cancers. However, the relationship between CDK5 level and clinicopathological factors is still poorly understood in cervical diseases. The aim of the current study was to investigate the expression of CDK5 and its clinical significance in variant cervical lesions. METHODS: Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was used to detect CDK5 expression in 54 cases of chronic cervicitis, 42 cases of condyloma acuminate (CA), 38 cases of carcinoma in situ, and 360 cases of cervical cancers [adenocarcinoma, n = 63; squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), n = 263; adenosquamous carcinoma, n = 34]. The clinicopathological characteristics in relation to CDK5 were examined by Pearson's Chi-square test. RESULTS: The positive rates of CDK5 were 27.8, 31.0, 50, 54.0, 58.8, and 62.7 % in chronic cervicitis, CA, carcinoma in situ, adenocarcinoma, adenosquamous carcinoma and SCC, respectively. Statistically analysis showed that CDK5 expression in cervical cancer tissues was higher than non-cervical cancer tissues (inflammation and CA) (P < 0.001). The overexpression of CDK5 was significantly correlated with lymph node metastasis (r = 0.317; P < 0.001), histological type (r = 0.198; P < 0.001), FIGO stage (r = 0.358; P < 0.001), TNM stage (r = 0.329; P < 0.001) and pathological grade (r = 0.259; P < 0.001) in cervical lesions evaluated by Pearson's Chi-square test. Furthermore, the positive relationships were found between CDK5 and lymph node metastasis (P < 0.001), FIGO stage (P < 0.001), TNM stage (P < 0.001) and pathological grade (P < 0.001) in SCC. CDK5 was positively interrelated to TNM stage (P = 0.017) in adenosquamous carcinoma. CONCLUSIONS: CDK5 may play a vital role in the development of cervical cancer, which may be a marker for the diagnosis, therapy and prognosis of cervical cancer.
27401682	Evaluation of the Antioxidant and Antiproliferative Effects of Three Peptide Fractions of Germinated Soybeans on Breast and Cervical Cancer Cell Lines.	Soybeans are an important source of bioactive molecules, such as peptides, which generation can improve through germination. In this study, the antioxidant and antiproliferative activities of three peptide fractions (>10 kDa, 5-10 kDa and <5 kDa) that were obtained by ultrafiltration of soybean protein hydrolysate after six days of germination were evaluated. The antioxidant activities of the peptide fractions were assessed by reducing power, Cu+2 and Fe+2 chelation and OH. scavenging assays, whereas their antiproliferative effects against cervical (HeLa, SiHa, CasKi) and breast (MCF7 and MDA-MB-231) cancer cell lines were evaluated by the MTT assay. Apoptosis was determined by Hoechst-PI staining. The most active peptide fraction (MAPF) was the >10 kDa fraction, which showed the greatest antioxidant and antiproliferative activity. The most sensitive cancer cell lines were the HeLa, CasKi and MDA-MB-231 cells, which had IC50 values of 16.2, 14.3 and 15.2 mg/mL, respectively, and apoptotic indices above 50 % after 6 or 8 h of exposure. The effect of MAPF on normal cells (HaCaT) was minimal. The amino acid composition of MAPF was characterized by high proline, phenylalanine and tyrosine content, and MALDI-TOF/TOF analysis showed six signals with molecular weights of 12 to 42 kDa.
27401655	Knowledge of HPV and Surgery among Women Who Underwent Cervical Conization: A Korean Multi-Center Study.	PURPOSE: Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is a well-known cause of cervical cancer, which, along with its precursors, can be diagnosed and treated with cervical conization (CC). This study aimed to assess HPV- and procedure-related knowledge among women who had undergone CC. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between February and May 2014, consecutive women who had undergone CC at five different educational hospitals were recruited. All patients had undergone a loop electrosurgical excision procedure as the method of CC. A survey was conducted with a self-developed, 29-item questionnaire, measuring knowledge related to HPV and CC. We analyzed the responses of 160 patients who completed the questionnaire. RESULTS: Mean total knowledge scores (+/-standard deviation) for HPV and CC were 5.2+/-3.0 of a possible 13.0 and 8.3+/-4.2 of a possible 16.0, respectively. While 73% of the patients knew that HPV is the main cause of cervical cancer, only 44% knew that HPV is sexually transmitted. The purpose of CC was correctly identified by 71% of the patients. However, 35% failed to indicate the anatomical area resected at the time of CC in the schematic diagram. Women who were younger (p<0.001), had higher education level (p<0.001), and higher family income (p=0.008) had higher knowledge scores. In contrast, neither interval from CC to survey nor disease severity were associated with total knowledge score. CONCLUSION: The level of knowledge related to HPV and CC was unexpectedly low in women who had undergone CC. Intuitive educational resources may improve this knowledge, and further cohort studies are warranted.
27401478	Identification of appropriate cone length to avoid positive cone margin in high grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia.	OBJECTIVE: To identify key factors for predicting positive cone margin and appropriate cone length. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the margin status of patients who received conization with high grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, along with other factors such as patient age, parity, preoperative cytology, size of disease, type of transformation zone, and cone length from patient records. Cut-off value of cone length was analyzed in women younger than 40 years old because we design conization with minimum length especially for women who wish for future pregnancy. Cut-off value of cone length was defined as length corresponds to estimated probability of positive cone margin equal to 0.1 by logistic regression analysis with variables selected by stepwise methods. RESULTS: Among 300 patients, 75 patients had positive cone margin. Multivariable analysis revealed that squamous cell carcinoma at preoperative cytology (p=0.001), 2 or more quadrant disease (p=0.011), and shorter cone length (p<0.001) were risk factors for positive cone margin. Stepwise methods identified cone length and size of lesion as important variables. With this condition, cut-off value of cone length was estimated as 15 mm in single quadrant disease and 20 mm in 2 or more quadrant disease, respectively. CONCLUSION: We identified the independent risk factors of positive cone margin and identified the cut-off value of cone length to avoid positive cone margin in women younger than 40 years old. Conization should be performed not only according to colposcopic findings including type of transformation zone but size of disease and cone length.
27400730	Treatment of gynecological cancers diagnosed during pregnancy.	Because of a notable increase in age at delivery, the incidence of malignancy diagnosed during pregnancy has substantially increased. This review aims to summarize the literature and expert knowledge on gynecologic cancers diagnosed in pregnancy regarding epidemiology, examination and staging procedures, description of treatment modalities and management of gynecological malignancies with special interest in cervical and ovarian cancer. Thorough attention is paid to the surgery and chemotherapy administration for early-stage cervical cancer diagnosed during pregnancy.
27396902	[Postoperative external beam radiotherapy for medullary thyroid carcinoma with high risk of locoregional relapse].	PURPOSE: To assess the outcome of locally advanced medullary thyroid carcinoma treated with surgery and adjuvant external beam radiotherapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-nine consecutive patients with non-metastatic medullary thyroid carcinoma treated in our institution between January 1995 and December 2012 were retrospectively evaluated. All underwent curative-intended optimal surgery, followed by external beam radiotherapy because of high risk of locoregional relapse. Twelve patients were stage III, 16 IVa and 1 IVb. Positive surgical margins were present in 11 cases (10 R1 and 1 R2). Median and average preradiotherapy serum calcitonin were 141pg/mL and 699pg/mL, respectively. Fourteen patients received 3D-conformal radiotherapy and 15 received intensity-modulated radiotherapy. Median prescribed dose was 63Gy to the high-risk volumes and 54Gy to the low-risk volumes. Treatment was delivered in 30 fractions. The median gap between surgery and radiotherapy was 1.9months. Median follow-up was 76.4months. RESULTS: Kaplan-Meier estimates of 5-year locoregional relapse-free survival and overall survival were 79 and 96 %, respectively. Among the five locoregional relapses, two were related to a macroscopic metastatic cervical lymph node that was unfortunately not removed during the lymphadenectomy. Eight of ten patients with microscopic positive margins (R1) were controlled regarding the thyroidectomy bed. Eight patients had normal serum calcitonin after external beam radiotherapy, of whom only one developed a locoregional relapse during follow-up. Regarding the 21 patients with persistent positive serum calcitonin after treatment, only ten developed a macroscopic locoregional or distant relapse. One grade III and no grade IV acute morbidity were reported. Fifteen patients reported grade II chronic morbidity and no grade III/IV. CONCLUSION: Maximal surgery followed by adjuvant external beam radiotherapy as a treatment for locally advanced medullary thyroid carcinoma provides a high rate of long-term locoregional control and overall survival with limited toxicity. Postoperative external beam radiotherapy should be considered when patients present features indicating a high risk of locoregional relapse.
27396204	Chlorogenic Acid Interaction with Cisplatin and Oxaliplatin: Studies in Cervical Carcinoma Cells.	The antiproliferative effect of the naturally occurring polyphenol chlorogenic acid (CGA) was evaluated in combination with either cisplatin or oxaliplatin in human cervical carcinoma cell lines that were either sensitive (A431) or resistant to cisplatin (A431Pt), in order to provide evidence to overcome drug resistance. Cytotoxicity of platinating drugs (IC50 - 10(-6) - 10(-5) M) was enhanced by 1-2 orders of magnitude by increasing incubation times (1, 4, and 24 hours) in the two cell lines. CGA treatment presented low cytotoxicity per se (IC50 ~ 10(-4) M at 24 h) if compared with platinum drugs and its activity was similar in A431Pt cells and in their sensitive A431 counterpart. The combination of the platinating drugs with CGA (10(-6) - 10(-4) M) indicated variable effects on cytotoxicity, ranging from potentiation to various degrees of antagonism (in A431 cells) and no effect (in A431Pt cells). In order to explain the different cytotoxic activity elicited by oxaliplatin and cisplatin in association with CGA, the possible presence of chemical interactions was investigated by HPLC analysis. The drug association with CGA caused evident changes in their chromatographic profile, suggesting occurrence of in vitro chemical interactions.
27393650	Calycosin induces apoptosis in colorectal cancer cells, through modulating the ERbeta/MiR-95 and IGF-1R, PI3K/Akt signaling pathways.	Calycosin, the main component extractable from the herb Radix astragali, has been shown to inhibit cellular proliferation and induce apoptosis in several cancer cell lines, but the underlying mechanisms by the way in which this occurs remain unclear. In the present study, we aimed to determine the potential effects of calycosin on proliferation in colorectal cancer cells in vitro and in vivo and to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms of action. Colorectal cancer cell lines SW480 and LoVo and cervical cancer cell line HeLa were treated with various concentrations of calycosin or plus ER beta (ERbeta) inhibitor PHTPP. The CCK8 assay, flow cytometry, and Hoechst 33258 stain were used to assess the effects on cellular proliferation and apoptosis. The mRNA levels of ERbeta and miR-95 were quantified by real-time PCR. The protein expression levels of ERbeta, ERalpha, IGF-1R, and p-Akt were evaluated by Western blot analysis. We demonstrated that calycosin inhibited the proliferation in SW480 and LoVo cells and induced apoptosis, particularly in SW480 cells, but not in HeLa cells. Calycosin increased ERbeta expression and reduced the ERalpha, IGF-1R, and p-Akt expression alongside down-regulation of miR-95 in SW480 cells. Inhibiting ERbeta blocked the change of miR-95 and the resulting increase in apoptosis in SW480 cells. Additionally, calycosin significantly suppressed xenograft tumor growth in nude mice. In conclusion, calycosin exerts an inhibitory effect on proliferation of CRC cells in vivo and in vitro, through ERbeta-mediated regulation of the IGF-1R, PI3K/Akt signaling pathways and of miR-95 expression.
27391454	Neurotropic Gamma-Delta T-Cell Lymphoma With CD30-Positive Lymphoid Infiltrates.	Primary cutaneous gamma-delta T-cell lymphoma (PCGD-TCL) is a clonal proliferation of gamma-delta T cells with a cytotoxic phenotype that is typically characterized by an aggressive clinical course with ulcerative plaques or subcutaneous nodules. In this report, the authors describe a patient who developed an ulcerated tumor on the left upper extremity and painful papules and nodules on the right lower extremity. Interestingly, several of the papulonodules on the right lower extremity underwent spontaneous involution. A skin biopsy of the papulonodular lesion demonstrated a superficial and deep perivascular interstitial infiltrate with a population of pleomorphic enlarged CD30-positive T cells. These enlarged lymphocytes lacked expression of TCR beta, CD4, CD8, and the pan T-cell antigen CD7, but were positive for TCR gamma, supporting the diagnosis of PCGD-TCL. The patient rapidly developed pain and severe weakness in the left upper limb and MRI revealed extensive neurolymphomatosis of the left brachial plexus. The patient was treated with chemotherapy with complete remission achieved. Unfortunately, her response was transient and the patient relapsed and ultimately died due to her disease. In this article, the authors describe an extraordinary case of a CD30-positive PCGD-TCL to expand the histopathological spectrum of CD30-positive and gamma-delta-positive lymphoproliferative disorders.
27390216	Extramammary paget's disease mimicking localized malignancy on cervical cytology.	A case of Extramammary Paget's Disease (EMPD) involving the cervix mimicking cervical carcinoma on routine cervical cytology in a 66-year-old woman with a history of recurrent multifocal EMPD involving the vulva, perineum, perianal area, and rectum is reported. The patient had undergone multiple excisions and reconstructions of EMPD, however, had a benign cervical smear history and reported no vaginal bleeding. The conventional papanicolaou smear was reported as concerning for carcinoma with abundant, well preserved material illustrating highly atypical cells with anisonucleosis and dense cytoplasm and focal microacini. Gross anatomical distortion from EMPD and previous surgery precluded satisfactory outpatient colposcopic assessment. Examination under anesthesia was performed and colposcopy revealed a four quadrant high grade lesion extending into the vagina with one area suspicious for malignancy on the cervix. Directed biopsies were taken and histopathology confirmed EMPD with diffuse adenocarcinoma in situ cells infiltrating skin and mucosa of all specimens. These large pale cells were seen both a singly and in clusters of nests within the mucosa. Periodic Acid Schiff staining was positive for intracytoplasmic mucin and supportive immunohistochemistry was performed with strong reactivity in atypical cells for CK7, CEA, and Cam 5.2. There was no evidence of invasive malignancy and the patient remains under clinical surveillance. Cervical EMPD is rare but should be considered in women with abnormal cervical cytology and a history of vulval EMPD. Diagn. Cytopathol. 2016;44:931-934. (c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
27388690	Incidence of malignancies in patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis: A retrospective single-center cohort study in Germany.	OBJECTIVES: In recent years, concern has been raised about Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA) that it could be associated with an increased risk for malignancies. Therefore, the cancer incidence in the JIA patients was evaluated and compared to the cancer incidence in the German population. METHODS: A retrospective single-center hospital-based cohort study was performed using data on the JIA patients treated between 1952 and 2010 at the German Center for Pediatric and Adolescent Rheumatology (GCPAR) (Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany). Self-administered standardized questionnaires were sent out in 2012. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95%CIs) were calculated. RESULTS: The study cohort consisted of 3691 JIA patients, and the response rate was 66%. Patients age ranged from 3 to 73 years of which 64% were female. Total follow-up time was 60,075 person-years; a history of malignancy was reported by 47 patients. Most common types of cancer were melanoma (n = 11), cervical cancer (n = 8) and breast cancer (n = 7). The overall SIR for women was 1.19 (95%CI: 0.77; 1.60) and for men was 0.67 (95%CI: 0.27; 1.07). The SIR for melanoma was 3.21 (95%CI: 1.60; 5.73) in women, whereas in men no melanoma cases were observed. CONCLUSION: Although no overall increased cancer risk was found, results suggest that the risk of melanoma might be increased in female JIA patients.
27388585	Landscape of Phosphatidylinositol-3-Kinase Pathway Alterations Across 19784 Diverse Solid Tumors.	Importance: Molecular aberrations in the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) pathway drive tumorigenesis. Frequently co-occurring alterations in hormone receptors and/or human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) may be relevant to mechanisms of response and resistance. Objective: To identify patterns of aberration in the PI3K and interactive pathways that might lead to targeted therapy opportunities in clinical practice. Design, Setting, and Participants: From January 2013 through December 2014, 19784 consecutive tumor samples (>40 cancer types) were sent from thousands of clinicians in 60 countries to a single commercial laboratory for molecular profiling, including next generation sequencing, protein expression (immunohistochemical analysis [IHC]), and gene amplification (fluorescent in situ hybridization or chromogenic in situ hybridization). Main Outcomes and Measures: Patterns in targetable genomic and proteomic alterations in the PI3K pathway and coincidence with hormone receptor and HER2 alterations. Exposures: Molecular profiling across solid tumors. Results: Overall, 38% of patients had an alteration in 1 or more PI3K pathway components, most commonly phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN) loss (by IHC) (30% of all patients), followed by mutations in PIK3CA (13%), PTEN (6%), or AKT1 (1%). Seventy percent of patients with endometrial cancer and more than 50% of patients with breast, prostate, anal, hepatocellular, colorectal, and cervical cancer exhibited alterations in at least 1 PI3K pathway gene and/or gene product. Examples of frequent aberrations included PTEN loss in hepatocellular (57% of patients), colorectal (48%), gastric (36%), prostate (52%), and endometrial cancer (49%); PIK3CA mutations in endometrial (37%), breast (31%), cervical (29%), and anal cancer (27%). PIK3CA, PTEN, and AKT1 mutations occurred more frequently in the presence of hormone receptor overexpression (androgen, progesterone, or estrogen receptor). PIK3CA mutations were also more common in the HER2-positive than in the HER2-negative group; the opposite pattern was seen for PTEN mutation or PTEN loss. Conclusions and Relevance: PI3K pathway aberrations are among the most common in cancer. They do not segregate by classic cancer histologic characteristics. Patterns of biomarker coalterations involving HER2 and hormone receptors may be important for optimizing combination treatments across cancer types.
27387669	Human Papillomavirus-Associated Cancers - United States, 2008-2012.	Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a known cause of cervical cancers, as well as some vulvar, vaginal, penile, oropharyngeal, anal, and rectal cancers (1,2). Although most HPV infections are asymptomatic and clear spontaneously, persistent infections with one of 13 oncogenic HPV types can progress to precancer or cancer. To assess the incidence of HPV-associated cancers, CDC analyzed 2008-2012 high-quality data from the CDC's National Program of Cancer Registries and the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program. During 2008-2012, an average of 38,793 HPV-associated cancers were diagnosed annually, including 23,000 (59%) among females and 15,793 (41%) among males. By multiplying these counts by the percentages attributable to HPV (3), CDC estimated that approximately 30,700 new cancers were attributable to HPV, including 19,200 among females and 11,600 among males. Cervical precancers can be detected through screening, and treatment can prevent progression to cancer; HPV vaccination can prevent infection with HPV types that cause cancer at cervical and other sites (3). Vaccines are available for HPV types 16 and 18, which cause 63% of all HPV-associated cancers in the United States, and for HPV types 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58, which cause an additional 10% (3). Among the oncogenic HPV types, HPV 16 is the most likely to both persist and to progress to cancer (3). The impact of these primary and secondary prevention interventions can be monitored using surveillance data from population-based cancer registries.
27387245	Treatment of severe life threatening hypocalcemia with recombinant human teriparatide in patients with postoperative hypoparathyroidism - a case series.	INTRODUCTION: Hypocalcaemia is a common postoperative complication, both after the resection of parathyroid adenoma associated with primary hyperparathyroidism and after total thyroidectomy due to thyroid cancer or nodular goitre. For a few years, in patients with postoperative hypoparathyroidism and severe hypocalcaemia, who cannot discontinue intravenous calcium preparations even with the use of high vitamin D doses, attempts have been made to add recombinant human parathormone (rhPTH) to the treatment schedule. In this work, for the first time in Poland, we demonstrate the potential use of teriparatide for the treatment of severe hypocalcaemia based on three different cases of postoperative hypoparathyroidism. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Case 1. Female (52) with postoperative hypoparathyroidism, after total thyroidectomy and the removal of lower left parathyroid gland due to hyperparathyroidism, several weeks after the surgery still required intravenous calcium infusions because of tetany symptoms. Just one month of teriparatide treatment at 20 mug/0.08 mL given in daily subcutaneous injections proved sufficient to control calcium levels with oral calcium and vitamin D preparations during the next few days until total resolution of hypocalcaemia symptoms and the achievement and maintenance of laboratory normocalcaemia in the following weeks. CASE 2: Female (33) with hypoparathyroidism following total thyroidectomy in 1996 because of papillary thyroid cancer, with congenital tubulopathy associated with renal loss of calcium and magnesium, and the symptoms of tetany recurring since the day of surgery, requiring intravenous calcium administration every 2-3 days. Currently, the patient has been hospitalised because of venous port infection, the only venous access, which made intravenous therapy impossible. Because of the life-threatening condition of the patient, bridging teriparatide treatment was prepared (20 mug/0.08 mL). Complete resolution of clinical symptoms of hypocalcaemia was obtained with teriparatide doses given every 8-12 hours, which made dose reduction possible. Case 3. Female (52) after major oncological surgery because of laryngopharyngeal and cervical oesophageal cancer with the removal of parathyroid glands, fed through PEG, was admitted to hospital with the symptoms of tetany. Despite treatment intensification, the patient experienced a hypocalcaemic crisis during hospitalisation. Teriparatide treatment at 2 x 20 mug/day resulted in the resolution of tetany symptoms, with gradual normalisation of calcium-phosphate balance parameters during the following days. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the analysis of these cases, the conclusion was drawn that the use of recombinant human teriparatide allows for the control of severe hypocalcaemia requiring intravenous infusions of calcium in patients with postoperative hypoparathyroidism. (Endokrynol Pol 2016; 67 (4): 403-412).
27383538	Reconstruction of Hypopharyngeal and Esophageal Defects Using a Gastric Tube after Total Esophagectomy and Pharyngolaryngectomy.	AIM: This study investigated the value of gastric tube during surgery for advanced hypopharyngeal and cervical esophageal cancer. METHOD: From November 2007 to December 2012, 42 patients underwent total pharyngo-laryngo-esophagectomy because of advanced hypopharyngeal or cervical esophageal cancer and were reconstructed with a gastric tube. Clinical swallowing function, morbidity, overall survival, and progression-free survival were evaluated postoperatively. RESULT: There were no severe complications, including no gastric necrosis, surgery-related postoperative morbidity, hemothorax, thoracostomach, or severe reflux esophagitis. Anastomotic leakage occurred in 2 cases, and these patients healed spontaneously with conservative management. Pulmonary infection developed in 5 patients. Anastomotic stenosis occurred in 2 cases and was managed with endoscopic dilatation. Regurgitation during the night was observed in 5 cases and was controlled by medication. All the patients regained their swallowing ability and thereby increased their quality of life. All patients were followed for 30-60 months; 2 of them were lost 6 months after surgery. The 3-year overall and progression-free survival rates were 58.1 and 56.2% respectively, and the 5-year overall and progression-free survival rates were 27.6 and 21.8%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Reconstruction by gastric tube is a dependable one-stage procedure that restores gastrointestinal continuity after total pharyngo-laryngo-esophagectomy.
27383190	The usefulness of fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose PET in the detection of recurrence in patients with differentiated thyroid cancer with elevated thyroglobulin and negative radioiodine whole-body scan.	INTRODUCTION: PET/computed tomography (CT) using fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (F-FDG) has been used in the diagnosis of recurrence and metastases of differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) in cases of negative whole-body scan (WBS) despite elevated concentrations of stimulated thyroglobulin (Tg). AIM: To assess the utility of PET/CT in the detection of recurrence among patients with DTC with increased Tg levels and negative results of WBS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: PET/CT results were retrospectively analyzed in patients with DTC with increased Tg and negative results of WBS as well as negative cervical ultrasonography and chest radiography. PET-CT was performed 1-2 weeks after recent diagnostics under conditions of endogenous or exogenous thyroid-stimulating hormone stimulation. PET/CT was performed using a Discovery ST scanner 1 h after an intravenously F-FDG injection (activity 4-5 MBq/kg). To determine the cutoff value of Tg, receiver operating characteristic curves were analyzed. RESULTS: Sixty-nine patients with DTC (48 women, 21 men) aged 22-83 years (mean 50.9+/-17.5 years) were qualified. In 44 patients (63.8%), PET/CT indicated lesions of DTC. Thirty (43.5%) patients had F-FDG positive findings. In the remaining 14 patients (20.3%), lesions were found in CT only. Patients with a positive PET/CT scan had significantly higher Tg values than patients with a negative PET/CT (mean 143.8 vs. 26.5 ng/ml, P=0.03). The cutoff value of Tg concentration measured with the receiver operating characteristic analysis was 32.9 ng/ml. CONCLUSION: PET/CT is a useful tool in the detection of recurrence among thyroid cancer patients in cases of conflicting results of standard procedures, particularly for those with high Tg levels and negative WBS. The probability of obtaining a positive PET-CT result increases with the level of Tg.
27382282	Robust aptamer-polydopamine-functionalized M-PLGA-TPGS nanoparticles for targeted delivery of docetaxel and enhanced cervical cancer therapy.	One limitation of current biodegradable polymeric nanoparticles (NPs) is the contradiction between functional modification and maintaining formerly excellent bioproperties with simple procedures. Here, we reported a robust aptamer-polydopamine-functionalized mannitol-functionalized poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (M-PLGA)-D-alpha-tocopheryl polyethylene glycol 1000 succinate (TPGS) nanoformulation (Apt-pD-NPs) for the delivery of docetaxel (DTX) with enhanced cervical cancer therapy effects. The novel DTX-loaded Apt-pD-NPs possess satisfactory advantages: 1) increased drug loading content and encapsulation efficiency induced by star-shaped copolymer M-PLGA-TPGS; 2) significant active targeting effect caused by conjugated AS1411 aptamers; and 3) excellent long-term compatibility by incorporation of TPGS. Therefore, with simple preparation procedures and excellent bioproperties, the new functionalized Apt-pD-NPs could maximally increase the local effective drug concentration on tumor sites, achieving enhanced treatment effectiveness and minimizing side effects. In a word, the robust DTX-loaded Apt-pD-NPs could be used as potential nanotherapeutics for cervical cancer treatment, and the aptamer-polydopamine modification strategy could be a promising method for active targeting of cancer therapy with simple procedures.
27380857	Knowledge, attitudes and practices regarding cervical cancer prevention at Thulamela Municipality of Vhembe District in Limpopo Province.	BACKGROUND: Cervical cancer is a widespread and often fatal disease that affected 1 million women globally in 2005. Not only is it the second most common cancer in women but it was also the second leading cause of cancer deaths, accounting for over 250 000 in 2006. PURPOSE: The purpose of the study was to assess the knowledge, attitudes and practices regarding cervical cancer prevention among rural women in Vhembe District in Limpopo Province. METHODOLOGY: A quantitative descriptive approach was adopted. The quantitative design enabled the discovery of more information by means of direct questioning of a sample of women aged 30 years and older. A convenience sampling was used to select the respondents. Data were analysed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences. Measures to ensure ethical issues were adhered to. RESULTS: The findings revealed that women lacked knowledge about cervical cancer and preventive methods, and displayed positive attitudes to the use of services if made available as health workers did not adequately inform them about the availability of the services. CONCLUSION: The awareness of cervical cancer among women in Vhembe District is limited. There is a need to educate and promote awareness of cervical cancer among women to reduce the burden of morbidity and mortality.
27380800	Whole-pelvic radiotherapy with spot-scanning proton beams for uterine cervical cancer: a planning study.	The aim of this study was to compare the dosimetric parameters of whole-pelvic radiotherapy (WPRT) for cervical cancer among plans involving 3D conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT), intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), or spot-scanning proton therapy (SSPT). The dose distributions of 3D-CRT-, IMRT-, and SSPT-based WPRT plans were compared in 10 patients with cervical cancer. All of the patients were treated with a prescribed dose of 50.4 Gy in 1.8-Gy daily fractions, and all of the plans involved the same planning target volume (PTV) constrictions. A 3D-CRT plan involving a four-field box, an IMRT plan involving seven coplanar fields, and an SSPT plan involving four fields were created. The median PTV D95% did not differ between the 3D-CRT, IMRT and SSPT plans. The median conformity index 95% and homogeneity index of the IMRT and SSPT were better than those of the 3D-CRT. The homogeneity index of the SSPT was better than that of the IMRT. SSPT resulted in lower median V20 values for the bladder wall, small intestine, colon, bilateral femoral heads, skin, and pelvic bone than IMRT. Comparing the Dmean values, SSPT spared the small intestine, colon, bilateral femoral heads, skin and pelvic bone to a greater extent than the other modalities. SSPT can reduce the irradiated volume of the organs at risk compared with 3D-CRT and IMRT, while maintaining excellent PTV coverage. Further investigations of SSPT are warranted to assess its role in the treatment of cervical cancer.
27380169	Neoadjuvant chemotherapy with docetaxel and carboplatin followed by radical hysterectomy for stage IB2, IIA2, and IIB patients with non-squamous cell carcinoma of the uterine cervix.	BACKGROUND: We conducted a phase II study to evaluate the efficacy of neoadjuvant chemotherapy with docetaxel and carboplatin followed by radical hysterectomy for patients with non-squamous cell carcinoma of the uterine cervix. METHODS: Sixty-one patients with International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage IB2, IIA2, or IIB non-squamous cell carcinoma of the uterine cervix were enrolled. The patients were administered docetaxel at a dose of 60 mg/m2, followed by carboplatin at a dose based on an area under the curve of 6. The treatments were repeated every 21 days for one to three cycles. Fifty-two patients were eligible to evaluate the efficacy of neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by radical hysterectomy. Adverse events were evaluated in 59 patients. RESULTS: The response rate was 69 % (95 % CI, 57-82 %), with 5 patients achieving complete response, 31 partial response, 15 stable disease, and 1 progressive disease. Median follow-up duration was 1913 days with a range of 145-2632 days. Of 52 patients, 50 underwent radical hysterectomy after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The 2-year overall survival rate was 81.8 % for stage IB2, 85.7 % for stage IIA2, and 92.6 % for stage IIB. The most frequent grade 3 and 4 hematological toxicity was neutropenia, with 43 patients experiencing grade 4 and 11 with grade 3. The nonhematological toxicities were mainly grade 1 or 2 in severity. CONCLUSION: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy with docetaxel and carboplatin followed by radical hysterectomy may be a useful strategy for patients with non-squamous cell carcinoma of uterine cervix.
27379616	Repositioning of anti-viral drugs as therapy for cervical cancer.	BACKGROUND: Increase in expression of eIF4E (Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E) protein is mediated by oncogenic proteins of Human Papilloma Virus (HPV). Increased expression of eIF4E plays an important role in HPV induced carcinogenesis. Ribavirin and Indinavir are known inhibitors of eIF4E activity. METHODS: The effect of the drugs on HeLa cells was assessed by in vitro assays including cell viability using MTT and Neutral red assay, apoptotic potential using Caspase-3, Caspase-8 and Caspase-9 activity assays and MMP-2 and MMP-9 secretion by determination of Gelatinase activity. The in vivo effect of Ribavirin treatment on tumor volume was assessed in human xenograft in immunocompromised C57BL/6 mice. RESULTS: In vitro analyses indicate that Ribavirin and Indinavir reduce viability of HeLa cells, induce apoptosis and decrease secretion of MMPs. Treatment with Ribavirin at a dose of 50mg/kg and 100mg/kg daily led to significant decrease in tumor volume in vivo. CONCLUSION: The study thus provides evidence that Ribavirin and Indinavir can be explored as therapy against HPV-18 induced cervical cancer.
27378675	Retrospective analysis of therapeutic effect and prognostic factors on early glottic carcinoma.	OBJECTIVE: To investigate the therapeutic effect of surgery, radiotherapy and photodynamic therapy on early glottic carcinoma and prognostic factors. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of 202 cases with early glottic carcinoma (Tis-T2N0M0) underwent surgery (n=152), radiotherapy (n=20) and PDT (n=30) from 2000 to 2013 The KPS score, the disease-free survival (DFS), overall survival (OS), local control (LC), larynx preservation rate, laryngeal function were evaluated. The methods of chi (2)test or Fisher's exact probability method, Kaplan Meier method, log-rank test of Kaplan-Meier method, Cox proportional hazards model were used to analyze the data. RESULTS: There was no statistical significance in OS, DFS and LC among the three groups. The laryngeal function preservation rate of RT group, PDT group and Surgery group were 90%, 86.7% and 65.1% respectively, with the former two groups significantly superior to Surgery group. While there is no statistical significance between RT group and PDT group. Single factor analysis showed that KPS score before treatment, vocal fold mobility limitation and differentiation degree could have an effect on prognosis. Multivariate regression analyses indicated that anterior commissure invasion, T stage and KPS score before treatment were independent adverse prognostic factors for OS. T stage and differentiation degree were adverse prognostic factors for DFS. T stage was also an adverse factor of LC. Thirty-three cases experienced local recurrence or cervical lymph node metastasis. Three groups showed no statistical difference in local recurrence or lymph node metastasis, with twenty-two cases in Surgery group, four in RT group and seven in PDT group. CONCLUSIONS: The therapeutic effect was approximate in surgery group, radiotherapy group and photodynamic group, and all three treatment regimens achieved good clinical effect. Radiotherapy and photodynamic therapy may be the first or very important treatment on early stage glottic squamous cell cancer (Tis approximately T2N0M0). However only 6 patients underwent PDT for T2 disease, making definitive treatment conclusions for this subgroup unclear.
27378467	Effect of human papillomavirus vaccination on cervical cancer screening in Alberta.	BACKGROUND: A school-based program with quadrivalent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination was implemented in Alberta in 2008. We assessed the impact of this program on Pap test cytology results using databases of province-wide vaccination and cervical cancer screening. METHODS: We conducted a nested case-control study involving a cohort of women in Alberta born between 1994 and 1997 who had at least 1 Pap test between 2012 and 2015. Women with negative cytology results were controls. Women with low-grade (atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance or low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion) and high-grade (atypical squamous cells, cannot rule out a high-grade lesion; or high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion) cervical abnormalities were cases. Exposure status was assigned according to records of HPV vaccination. Odds ratios (ORs) for abnormal cytology results by vaccination status were adjusted for neighbourhood income, laboratory service, rural versus urban residency, and age. RESULTS: The total study population was 10 204. Adjusting for age, vaccinated women had a higher screening rate than unvaccinated women (13.0% v. 11.4%, p < 0.001). Among women who received full vaccination (>/= 3 doses), the adjusted OR for cervical abnormalities was 0.72 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.63-0.82). For high-grade lesions, the adjusted OR was 0.50 (95% CI 0.30-0.85). With 2-dose HPV vaccination, the adjusted OR for cervical abnormalities was 1.08 (95% CI 0.84-1.38). INTERPRETATION: Quadrivalent HPV vaccination significantly reduced high-grade cervical abnormalities but required 3 doses. Vaccination against HPV was associated with screening uptake. Population-based vaccination and screening programs should work together to optimize cervical cancer prevention.
27378160	Is aortic lymphadenectomy indicated in locally advanced cervical cancer after neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by radical surgery? A retrospective study on 261 women.	OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to estimate the rate of aortic lymph nodes (LN) metastases/recurrences among patients affected by locally advanced stage cancer patients (LACC), treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) and radical surgery. METHODS: Retrospective evaluation of consecutive 261 patients affected by LACC (stage IB2-IIB), treated with NACT followed by radical surgery at National Cancer Institute, Milan, Italy, between 1990 and 2011. RESULTS: Stage at presentation included stage IB2, IIA and IIB in 100 (38.3%), 50 (19.2%) and 111 (42.5%) patients, respectively. Squamous cell carcinoma accounted for more than 80%, followed by adenocarcinoma or adenosquamous cancers (20%). Overall, 56 women (21.5%) had LN metastases. Four out of 83 women (5%) who underwent both pelvic and aortic LN dissection had aortic LN metastases, and all women had concomitant pelvic and aortic LN metastases. Only one woman out of 178 (0.5%) who underwent pelvic lymphadenectomy only, had an aortic LN recurrence. Overall 2% of women (5/261) had aortic LN metastases/recurrence. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that aortic lymphadenectomy at the time of surgery is not routinely indicated in LACC after NACT, but should reserved in case of bulky LN in both pelvic and/or aortic area. The risk of isolated aortic LN relapse is negligible. Further prospective studies are warranted.
27378054	A study on the predictors of Korean male students' intention to receive human papillomavirus vaccination.	AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: The objective was to survey the current state of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination and the predictors of vaccination intention among Korean male students of high school (ages 15-19) and university (ages 17-27). BACKGROUND: Human papillomavirus is a sexually transmitted infectious agent causing uterine cervical, anal, and/or penile cancer and genital warts in males and females. Infection rate of human papillomavirus increases from the age when sexual intercourse first occurs. Therefore, motivation to receive human papillomavirus vaccination is needed to protect infection. DESIGN: Cross-sectional descriptive survey was performed only in male students. They are less aware of human papillomavirus than females, because human papillomavirus vaccination has been targeted on females for preventing cervical cancer in Korea. METHODS: Data were collected using a self-reporting questionnaire for male high school and university students sampled from a city in Korea. Human papillomavirus vaccine-related knowledge, health beliefs, demographic, and sexual history information variables relating to intentions to vaccinate were assessed. RESULTS: The human papillomavirus vaccination rate was very low and the levels of knowledge and health beliefs were low. The significant predictors that raised the intention of human papillomavirus vaccination were a university student, experience of sexual intercourse and perceiving the benefits of human papillomavirus vaccination. CONCLUSIONS: To promote human papillomavirus vaccination, educational programming targeting males should include health beliefs and knowledge, emphasising that vaccination is important to prevent uterine cervical cancer and to role as a preventative measure against common male diseases. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Male high school students should be included as a major target population for school human papillomavirus education programmes, as they are at the age of commencing sexual intercourse. In addition, public health policies including human papillomavirus vaccination in the national immunisation programme are warranted.
27374445	[Diagnostic value of human papillomavirus E6/E7 mRNA for residue and recurrence after cervical conization].	OBJECTIVE: To explore the diagnostic value of human papillomavirus E6/E7 mRNA for residue and recurrence of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) patients after cervical conization. METHODS: A total of 154 patients, who underwent cervical conization and possessed complete follow-up data of high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CINII, III), were subjected to thin-prep cytology test (TCT), HPV-DNA typing and HPV E6/E7 mRNA test in 3-6 months and 12 months after cervical conization. Abnormal cytology (>/=ASC-US) or high-risk HPV-DNA (+) or HPV E6/E7 mRNA (+) cases were found by colposcopy and cervical biopsy pathological diagnosis. RESULTS: Nine patients had residue and 22 recurred. HPV-DNA detections after cervical conization in 57 patients were positive. Among them, 30 patients had residual/recurrent lesions. HPV E6/E7 mRNA detections in 26 patients were positive. Among them, 24 patients had residual/recurrent lesions. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and accuracy of diagnosis in the detection of HPV-DNA were 96.8%, 78%, 52.6%, 99%, and 81.8%, respectively. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and accuracy of diagnosis in the detection of HPV E6/E7 mRNA were 77.4%, 98.4%, 92.3%, 94.5%, and 94.2%, respectively. The specificity and positive predictive value of HPV E6/E7 mRNA test were greater than those of HPV-DNA typing test. There was a significant difference between the two groups (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: Detection of HPV E6/E7 mRNA during the follow-up period could timely and effectively forecast the risk of residue and recurrence of CIN after cervical conization, and reduce excessive examination and treatment.
27373783	Incorporating 3D laparoscopy for the management of locally advanced cervical cancer: a comparison with open surgery.	PURPOSE: To test the effects of the implementation of 3D laparoscopic technology for the execution of nerve-sparing radical hysterectomy. METHODS: Thirty patients undergoing nerve-sparing radical hysterectomy via 3D laparoscopic (3D-LNSRH, n = 10) or open surgery (NSRH, n = 20) were studied prospectively. RESULTS: No significant differences were observed in baseline patient characteristics. Operative times were similar between groups. We compared the first 10 patients undergoing 3D-LNSRH with the last 20 patients undergoing NSRH. Baseline characteristics were similar between groups (p&gt;0.2). Patients undergoing 3D-LNSRH had longer operative time (264.4 +/- 21.5 vs 217.2 +/- 41.0 minutes; p = 0.005), lower blood loss (53.4 +/- 26.1 vs 177.7 +/- 96.0 mL; p&lt;0.001), and shorter length of hospital stay (4.3 +/- 1.2 vs 5.4 +/- 0.7 days; p = 0.03) in comparison to patients undergoing open abdominal procedures. No intraoperative complication occurred. One (10%) patient had conversion to open surgery due to technical difficulties and the inability to insert the uterine manipulator. A trend towards higher complication (grade 2 or worse) rate was observed for patients undergoing NSRH in comparison to 3D-LNSRH (p = 0.06). Considering only severe complications (grade 3 or worse), no difference was observed (0/10 vs 2/20; p = 0.54). CONCLUSIONS: 3D-laparoscopic nerve-sparing radical hysterectomy is a safe and effective procedure. The implementation of 3D laparoscopic technology allows the execution of challenging operations via minimally invasive surgery, thus reducing open abdominal procedure rates. Further large prospective studies are warranted.
27373721	Prognostic significance of Livin expression in nasopharyngeal carcinoma after radiotherapy.	PURPOSE: This study was designed to investigate the expression levels of the inhibitor of apoptosis protein Livin in nasopharyngeal cancer tissues and its prognostic significance in nasopharyngeal carcinoma after radiotherapy. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 83 patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma who received radiotherapy were enrolled in this study from January 2008 to October 2010. Livin expression in nasopharynx pathological specimens extracted from patients was detected by immunohistochemistry. A Kaplan-Meier analysis was conducted to explore the effects of clinicopathological features and Livin expression on the overall survival and progression-free survival of patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and explore its prognosis relevance after radiotherapy. RESULTS: Of the 83 patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma, the overall Livin positive expression rate was 65.1% (54 patients), and the overall response rate of radiotherapy was 81.9% (68 patients). Significant differences in radiotherapy efficacy were found between patients who did not express Livin and those who did (P<0.05). The Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that Livin expression, high clinical staging, cervical lymph node metastasis, high T-staging and high N-staging were significantly correlated with a decrease in the overall survival of patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (all P<0.05). A Cox multivariate survival analysis showed that Livin expression, clinical staging and N-staging were independent risk factors for the overall survival of patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma treated with radiation (all P<0.05). Furthermore, Livin expression and clinical staging were independent risk factors for the progression-free survival of patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma once radiotherapy was introduced (all P<0.05). CONCLUSION: Expression of Livin, an inhibitor of apoptosis proteins, may be closely linked with poor prognosis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma post-radiotherapy and hence it may be a new therapeutic target in the treatment of the disease.
27373029	[Short-term complications in reconstruction of the postoperative defects with free jejunum graft in patients with pharyngeal, laryngeal or cervical esophageal cancers].	OBJECTIVE: To explore the clinical effects and short-term complications of using free jejunum graft (FJG) to reconstruct the defects by resections of pharyngeal, laryngeal or cervical esophageal cancers. METHOD: Fifty-eight cases of pharyngeal, laryngeal or cervical esophageal cancers were reconstructed with FJG. All cases were analyzed retrospectively. RESULT: The success rate of FJG transplantations was 91.4% (53/58). The incidence of post-operative short-term complication was 43.1% (25/58), which was not related to age or BMI. The most common complication was anastomotic leakage (18.9%), which was not related to per-operative radiation therapy. However, BMI > 25 cases had significantly higher incidence of anastomotic leakage than BMI </= 25 cases (P = 0.009). The second and third most common complications were respiratory system complications (10. 3%) and FJG necrosis (8. 6%). Para-operative death rate was 3.4% (2/58). Two-year overall survival rates of hypopharyngeal cancer and cervical esophageal cancer were 49% and 67% respectively. The group with no short-term complications had a slightly better survival rate than the group with short-term complications from the Kaplan-Meier curve, but there was no significant difference (P = 0.103). CONCLUSION: FJG is ideal to reconstruct cervical digestive tract circumferential defects with a high success rate and a low mortality. However, the post-operative complication rate is high. Intensive observation, early detection and timely treatment of complications are crucial.
27372708	Evaluation of diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and MR spectroscopy (MRS) as early response biomarkers in cervical cancer patients.	PURPOSE: To prospectively assess whether choline levels and Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (ADC) values within cervical cancers before, during, and after non-surgical therapy are predictive of tumour response. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients undergoing MR examination for staging of cervical cancer, candidate for non-surgical therapy, were prospectively enrolled. According to the status at the end of therapies, patients were divided into responders and non-responders. The final outcome after a 5-year follow-up was classified as No Evidence of Disease (NED) or Progression of Disease (PD). Baseline values of mean ADC and Cho/H2O were compared between responders and non-responders, as well as between patients with NED and PD. The percent variation of ADC and Cho/H2O values over time was compared. P values <0.05 were considered significant. RESULTS: 16 patients were included. There was no significant difference at baseline between responders (n = 12) and non-responders (n = 4), nor between NED (n = 11) PD patients (n = 5), in ADC values and Cho/H2O ratio. There was no significant difference in percent variation of ADC values and of Cho/H2O, comparing responders and non-responders. There was a significant increase in absolute values of ADC from the initial to mid-therapy MRI (p = 0.0001), while Cho/H2O was stable (p value: 0.61). In the four non-responders, the ADC increase was not significant (p value: 0.25), while it was significant in the 11 responders (p value: 0.001). Values of spectroscopy were stable in both responders and non-responders. CONCLUSIONS: High increases of ADC values from baseline to mid-therapy MR reflect response to therapies. There were no significant variations in choline/water ratios over time.
27371746	Biventricular metastatic invasion from cervical squamous cell carcinoma.	Metastasis to the heart has been previously described with primary lung and breast carcinoma, lymphoma, leukaemia, mesothelioma and melanoma. However, left-ventricular cardiac metastasis from primary cervical squamous cell carcinoma is poorly described. This report describes the clinical presentation of a patient with cardiac metastatic invasion from cervical cancer.
27370156	Interfractional variation in bladder volume and its impact on cervical cancer radiotherapy: Clinical significance of portable bladder scanner.	PURPOSE: A constant bladder volume (BV) is essential to direct the radiotherapy (RT) of pelvic tumors with precision. The purpose of this study was to investigate changes in BV and their impact on cervical cancer RT and to assess the clinical significance of a portable bladder scanner (BS) in achieving a constant BV. METHODS: A standard bladder phantom (133 ml) and measurements of actual urine volume were both used as benchmarks to evaluate the accuracy of the BS. Comparisons of BS with computed tomography (CT), cone-beam CT (CBCT), and an ultrasound diagnostic device (iU22) were made. Twenty-two consecutive patients with cervical cancer treated with external beam radical RT were divided into an experimental group (13 patients) and a control group (9 patients). In the experimental group, the BV was measured multiple times by BS pre-RT until it was consistent with that found by planning CT. Then a CBCT was performed. The BV was measured again immediately post-RT, after which the patient's urine was collected and recorded. In the control group, CBCT only was performed pre-RT. Interfractional changes in BV and their impact on cervical cancer RT were investigated in both groups. The time of bladder filling was also recorded and analyzed. RESULTS: In measuring the volume of the standard bladder phantom, the BS deviated by 1.4% in accuracy. The difference between the measurements of the BS and the iU22 had no statistical significance (linear correlation coefficient 0.96, P < 0.05). The BV measured by the BS was strongly correlated with the actual urine volume (R = 0.95, P < 0.05), planning CT (R = 0.95, P < 0.05), or CBCT (R = 0.91, P < 0.05). Compared with the BV at the time of CT, its value changed by -36.1% [1 SD (standard deviation) 42.3%; range, -79.1%-29.4%] in the control group, and 5.2% (1 SD 21.5%; range, -13.3%-22.1%) in the experimental group during treatment. The change in BV affected the target position in the superior-inferior (SI) direction but had little or no effect in the anterior-posterior and right-left directions. Based on the collected data, the target displacement in the SI direction was reduced from 2.0 to 0.4 mm, while the CTV-to-PTV (CTV: clinical target volume; PTV: planning target volume) margin in the SI direction was reduced from 11.1 to 6.4 mm. The BV increased by 3.7 +/- 1.0 ml/min (range, 1.7-4.7 ml/min), which depended on the amount of water ingested by the patient (R = 0.96, P < 0.05). No correlation was found between the rate of urinary inflow and the patient's body mass. The authors were able to reduce the workload of measuring by using individual patient information including the patient's age, the water-drinking amount, time at which water-drinking began, and patient's diet. CONCLUSIONS: Changes in the BV have an influence on the RT of cervical cancer. A consistent and reproducible BV is acquired by using a portable BS, whereby the target displacement and CTV-to-PTV margin can be both reduced in the SI direction.
27368915	Comparison of dosimetric parameters and acute toxicity of intensity-modulated and three-dimensional radiotherapy in patients with cervix carcinoma: A randomized prospective study.	PURPOSE: The use of intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) to treat cervix carcinoma has increased, however prospective randomized trials are still lacking. AIM: To compare the dosimetric parameters and associated acute toxicity in patients with cervix carcinoma treated with three-dimensional (3D) conformal radiotherapy and IMRT. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty patients were randomized in two arms each consisting of 20 patients. Patients in both arms received concurrent chemoradiation (cisplatin 40mg/m(2) weekly; 50Gy/25 fractions). Patients were treated with 3D conformal radiotherapy in one arm and with IMRT in another arm. After external beam radiotherapy, all patients received brachytherapy (21Gy/3 fractions at weekly interval). For dosimetric comparison, both kinds of the plans were done for all the patients. All patients were assessed throughout and until 90 days after completion of treatment for acute gastrointestinal, genitourinary and hematologic toxicities. RESULTS: Both plans achieved adequate planning target volume coverage, while mean conformity index was found significantly better in IMRT plans (P-value=0.001). D35 (dose to 35% volume) and D50 for bladder was reduced by 14.62 and 32.57% and for rectum by 23.82 and 43.68% in IMRT. For IMRT, V45 (volume receiving 45Gy) of bowel were found significantly lesser (P-value=0.0001), non-tumour integral dose was found significantly higher (P-value=0.0240) and V20 of bone marrow was found significantly reduced (P-value=0.019) in comparison to that in 3D conformal radiotherapy. Significant reduction of grade 2 or more (20 vs 45%; P-value=0.058) and grade>/=3 (5 vs 15%, P-value=0.004) acute genitourinary toxicity and grade 2 or more (20 vs 45%, P-value=0.003) and grade 3 or more (5 vs. 20%, P-value=0.004) acute gastrointestinal toxicity while no significant difference for grade 2 and 3 or more haematological toxicity was noted in patients treated with IMRT compared to 3D conformal radiotherapy. CONCLUSION: IMRT provide a good alternative for treatment of cervix carcinoma with lower acute gastrointestinal and acute genitourinary toxicity with similar target coverage compared to 3D conformal radiotherapy.
27366939	An estimate of the public health impact and cost-effectiveness of universal vaccination with a 9-valent HPV vaccine in Germany.	INTRODUCTION: Since 2007, the German Standing Vaccination Committee recommends HPV vaccination for girls aged 12-17 with a 2- (Cervarix(R)) or 4-valent (Gardasil(R)) vaccine. A 9-valent vaccine (Gardasil 9(R)) recently received a European market authorization in 2015. METHODS: A dynamic transmission model was calibrated to the German setting and used to estimate costs and QALYs associated with vaccination strategies. RESULTS: Compared to the current vaccination program, the 9-valent vaccine extended to boys shows further reductions of 24% in the incidence of cervical cancer, 30% and 14% in anal cancer for males and females, as well as over a million cases of genital warts avoided after 100 years. The new strategy is associated with an ICER of 22,987euro per QALY gained, decreasing to 329euro when considering the vaccine switch for girls-only. CONCLUSION: Universal vaccination with the 9-valent vaccine can yield significant health benefits when compared to the current program.
27365376	Overexpression of HPV16 E6* Alters beta-Integrin and Mitochondrial Dysfunction Pathways in Cervical Cancer Cells.	BACKGROUND: High-risk human papillomaviruses (HPV) cause nearly all cases of cervical cancer, as well as many types of oral and anogenital cancer. Alternative splicing increases the capacity of the HPV genome to encode the proteins necessary for successful completion of its infectious life cycle. However, the roles of these splice variants, including E6*, the smaller splice isoform of the E6 oncogene, in carcinogenesis are not clear. MATERIALS AND METHODS: SiHa (HPV16(+)) and C33A (HPV(-)) cells were transfected with the E6* plasmid, and tandem mass tag-labeled protein levels were quantified by mass spectrometry. Proteomic analyses identified pathways affected by E6* in both HPV(+) and HPV(-) cells, and pathways were validated using in vitro methods. RESULTS: A total of 4,300 proteins were identified and quantified in lysates of SiHa and C33A cells with and without HPV16 E6* expression. SiHa and C33A cells expressing E6* underwent changes in protein expression affecting integrin signaling and mitochondrial dysfunction pathways, respectively. Subsequent experiments were performed to validate selected E6*-mediated alterations in protein levels. CONCLUSION: E6* modifies the expression of proteins involved in mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative phosphorylation in C33A cells, and beta-integrin signaling in SiHa cells.
27364103	Production lost due to cervical cancer in Poland in 2012.	BACKGROUND: Poland has one of the highest cervical cancer mortality rates in Europe. It is related to the problem of late diagnosis and low attendance rate in screening programs. The objective of the study has been to assess the annual production loss due to the cervical cancer morbidity and mortality in Poland in 2012. The outcomes have been to provide comprehensive information on cervical cancer's influence on population's ability to work and its overall economic burden for the society. The study has also provided the methodological framework for disease-related production losses in Polish settings. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The human capital method was used. The production losses were calculated in both monetary and quantitative terms (working days lost) due to 4 following reasons: 1) temporary disability to work, 2) permanent disability, 3) informal care, and 4) mortality. RESULTS: Cervical cancer resulted in approx. 702 964 working days lost in 2012 due to absence at work for both patients and care givers and a total number of 957 678 working days lost due to patients' mortality. The total value of production lost was assessed at 111.4 million euros. More than 66% of this value was attributed to women's mortality. CONCLUSIONS: The calculation of production lost due to cervical cancer burden provides strong evidence to support adequate health promotion and disease prevention actions. Actions promoting cervical cancer screening should be intensified including workplace health promotion activities. Med Pr 2016;67(3):289-299.
27363402	Squamous cell carcinoma of unknown primary tumor metastatic to neck nodes: role of elective irradiation.	In patients with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) metastases to neck lymph nodes and unknown primary tumor, the role of elective irradiation of uninvolved neck and potential mucosal primary sites is yet to be determined. The aim of this study was to review the experience treating SCC of unknown primary metastatic to neck nodes with surgery and postoperative radiotherapy (PORT) in Slovenia between 1995 and 2010 and to determine the importance of the extent of irradiated volume. For this purpose, the nationwide Cancer Registry of Slovenia database was used for identifying patients. 126 patients were identified. Involved-field PORT and extended-field PORT was used in 50 and 76 patients, respectively. At 5 years, locoregional control was 86 %, disease-specific survival 77 %, and overall survival 57 %. In multivariate analysis, the extent of irradiated volume has not been predictive for any outcome under study. Grade >/=3 acute and late radiotherapy-induced toxicities were more frequent in the extended-field PORT group. In conclusion, although not superior, involved-field PORT seems to be a preferred treatment option in SCC of unknown primary metastatic to neck nodes due to significantly reduced toxicity and better prospects for successful salvage.
27362905	Comprehensive Analysis of PAX8 Expression in Epithelial Malignancies of the Uterine Cervix.	Immunohistochemistry for transcription factor PAX8 (paired box gene 8) has recently emerged as a powerful tool in the differential diagnosis of gynecologic malignancies, especially when encountered at a metastatic site. Previous studies have shown PAX8 expression in the majority of ovarian and endometrial carcinomas; however, data regarding PAX8 expression in cervical tumors are limited. In this study PAX8 expression was evaluated in 136 epithelial malignancies of the uterine cervix-including 103 squamous cell carcinomas (SCC), 20 adenocarcinomas of usual type, 6 endometrioid adenocarcinomas, and 7 adenosquamous carcinomas-on tissue microarray slides. PAX8 immunopositivity was defined as at least weak nuclear staining in >5% of tumor cells. The majority of SCC were PAX8 negative (92%; 95/103), whereas among the endocervical adenocarcinomas PAX8 was positive in 70% (14/20) of the usual type and in 83% (5/6) of the endometrioid-type tumors. PAX8 expression was observed in 29% (2/7) of adenosquamous carcinomas. We conclude that PAX8 immunostain is negative in most cervical SCC and is less frequently expressed in endocervical adenocarcinomas as compared with the previously reported high sensitivity for ovarian and endometrial adenocarcinomas. When evaluating possible primary sites of a metastatic lesion, a negative PAX8 immunostain does not rule out common cervical epithelial malignancies.
27359080	Cold-knife conisation and large loop excision of transformation zone significantly increase the risk for spontaneous preterm birth: a population-based cohort study.	OBJECTIVES: Our aim was to explore the association between cold-knife conisation and large loop excision of transformation zone (LLETZ) with spontaneous preterm birth in a large 10-year national sample. We wanted to explore further the association of these procedures with preterm birth according to gestation. STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a population based retrospective cohort study, using data from national Medical Birth Registry. The study population consisted of all women giving birth to singletons in the period 2003-2012 in Slovenia, excluding all induced labors and elective cesarean sections before 37 weeks of gestation (N=192730). We compared the prevalence of spontaneous preterm births (before 28 weeks, before 32 weeks, before 34 weeks and before 37 weeks of gestation) in women with cold-knife conisation or LLETZ compared to women without history of conisation, calculating odds ratios (OR), adjusted for potential confounders. Chi-square test was used for descriptive analysis. Logistic regression analyses were performed to estimate crude odds ratio (OR) and adjusted odds ratio (aOR) and their 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) with two-sided probability (p) values. RESULTS: A total of 8420 (4.4%) women had a preterm birth before 37 weeks of gestation, 2250 (1.2%) before 34 weeks of gestation, 1333 (0.7%) before 32 weeks of gestation and 603 (0.3%) before 28 weeks of gestation. A total of 4580 (2.4%) women had some type of conisation in their medical history: 2083 (1.1%) had cold-knife conisation and 2498 (1.3%) had LLETZ. In women with history of cold-knife conisation, the adjusted OR for preterm birth before 37 weeks of gestation was 3.13 (95% CI; 2.74-3.57) and for preterm birth before 28 weeks of gestation 5.96 (95% CI; 4.3-8.3). In women with history of LLETZ, the adjusted OR was 1.95 (95% CI; 1.68-2.25) and 2.88 (95% CI; 1.87-4.43), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Women with cervical excision procedure of any kind have significantly increased odds for preterm birth, especially for preterm birth before 28 weeks and before 32 weeks of gestation.
27357064	Evaluation of RNA and DNA extraction from liquid-based cytology specimens.	Molecular diagnosis using DNA and RNA derived from malignant tumors and molecular biological tools such as the quantitative polymerase-chain-reaction (qPCR) is a commonly used technique in clinical pathology. In this report, we compared the qualitative extraction of RNA and DNA from cancer cells fixed using several liquid-based cytology (LBC) kits. Ten to 1,000 cells from the T24 urinary bladder cancer cell line and SKG-II cervical cancer cell line were fixed with 55% methanol and three different methanol-based LBC solutions. The mRNA levels of CD44 in T24 cells and E7 in SKG-II cells and DNA levels of p53 in T24 cells and E7 in SKG-II cells were analyzed by qPCR. mRNA and DNA extracted from T24 and/or SKG-II cells fixed with methanol-based LBC solutions were efficiently detected, but to differing degrees, by qPCR. mRNA, and DNA from cells fixed with a formaldehyde-containing fixative liquid were detected at significantly low copy numbers by qPCR. Our results demonstrate that LBC systems are powerful tools for cytopathology and immunocytochemistry applications. However, the appropriate fixative must be selected for cell preservation when a small number of LBC samples is used for molecular testing, particularly in RNA-based molecular analyses. Diagn.

27356884	Glaucocalyxin B induces apoptosis and autophagy in human cervical cancer cells.	Glaucocalyxin (Gln), an entkaurane diterpenoid isolated from the Chinese traditional medicine, Rabdosia japonica, represents a novel class of anticancer drugs. GlnA is one of the three major forms of Gln and has demonstrated potent anticancer effects in a variety of cancer types. GlnB has only one structural difference from GlnA, an acetylated hydroxyl group at C14. This acetyl group results in high liposolubility and may enhance the antitumor activity of entkaurane diterpenoid GlnB. However, few studies have reported the role of GlnB in cancer. The present study investigated the effect of GlnB in cervical cancer proliferation and cell death. Treatment with GlnB inhibits the proliferation of HeLa and SiHa cervical cancer cell lines in a dosedependent manner, as assessed by 3(4,5dimethylthiazol-2yl)-2,5 diphenyl tetrazolium bromide assays. In addition, GlnB increases the apoptotic cell population of HeLa and SiHa cells, as determined by fluorescenceactivated cell sorting analysis and enhanced poly (ADPribose) polymerase 1 cleavage by western blotting. GlnB also induces increased light chain 3 II/I protein cleavage in both cells, indicating the induction of autophagy. Furthermore, GlnB treatment increased the expression of phosphatase and tensin homolog and decreased the expression of phosphorylatedprotein kinase B (Akt) in HeLa and SiHa cells, as assessed by western blotting. Taken together, the present results demonstrated that GlnB inhibited the proliferation of human cervical cancer cells in vitro through the induction of apoptosis and autophagy, which may be mediated by the phosphatidylinositol4,5bisphosphate 3kinase/Akt signaling pathway.
27356862	Analysis of the effect of adjuvant radiotherapy on outcomes and complications after radical hysterectomy in FIGO stage IB1 cervical cancer patients with intermediate risk factors (GOTIC Study).	BACKGROUND: There are no definitive criteria for identifying which patients with The International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage IB cervical cancer will benefit from adjuvant therapy after radical hysterectomy. The aims of this study were to clarify the efficacy of adjuvant therapy and assess complications after radical hysterectomy in patients with FIGO stage IB1 cervical cancer with intermediate risk factors. METHODS: Between January 2005 and December 2009, the medical records of 75 stage IB1 patients' intermediate risk factors (i.e., tumor size 2-4 cm, lymphovascular involvement, and/or deep stromal invasion >1/2) who underwent radical hysterectomy at six institutions were collected, and these patients were enrolled in this nonrandomized retrospective study. We simplified the criteria of intermediate risk factors as much as possible, as the criteria adopted in some clinical studies are complicated in practice. RESULTS: The patients were grouped according to the receipt of adjuvant therapy as follows: 46 patients, no further treatment; 19 patients, external beam radiation treatment, including 9 patients who received brachytherapy; 5 patients, concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT); and 5 patients, chemotherapy (CT). The clinical outcomes and complications in each group were analyzed. After an average follow-up of 82.6 months (range, 24-135 months), only one patient with all three risk factors who received radiotherapy (RT) experienced recurrence. Excluding this patient, the remaining patients who received RT, CCRT, or CT had two or three risk factors. Lymphedema was significantly more common among patients who received RT or CCRT, whereas the incidence of ileus and ureteral obstruction was not different among the treatment groups. However, an unsutured peritoneum increased the risk of ileus. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study suggest that RT and CCRT after radical hysterectomy are not beneficial in patients with intermediate risk factors. In particular, RT and CCRT appeared to increase the incidence of lymphedema. A prospective randomized study is needed to verify the findings of this study.
27356795	[Clinical analysis of 23 gynecologic carcinoma patients with brain metastasis].	OBJECTIVE: To explore the clinicopathological characteristics and treatments of brain metastasis (BM) in patients with gynecologic carcinoma. METHODS: Twenty-three pathologically confirmed patients with gynecologic carcinoma who had brain metastasis between February 2008 and October 2012 were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: The primary carcinoma was cervical cancer in 5 patients, endometrial carcinoma in 8 patients and ovarian cancer in 10 patients, which accounted for 1.81% (5/276), 2.10% (8/380) and 2.67% (10/374) of patient with the same diagnosis of the same period, respectively.Among them, 91.3% (21/23) patients had heterochronous BM.Single BM was documented in 52.2% (12/23) patients.Besides, 78.2% (18/23) BM located in cerebrum.At the time of BM, 91.3% (21/23) patients had symptoms of central nervous system, in which headache ranked the top (90.4%). Altogether, thirteen patients had extracranial metastasis, in which 9 of them had metastasis of the lung.The median post-brain-metastasis survival (mPBMS) for the recursive partitioning analysis (RPA) classes - was 54 months, 9 months and 1 month, respectively (P<0.01). None of surgery, radiotherapy or chemotherapy treatment was proven to have prognosis-improving ability either in single variant or multivariate analysis.However, in patients with extracranial metastasis, chemotherapy could significantly improve their mPBMS (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of brain metastasis in patients with cervical cancer, endometrial carcinoma, and ovarian cancer increased gradually.RPA was valuable for a prognostic assessment in gynecologic carcinoma patients with BM.Chemotherapy could significantly improve prognosis of gynecologic carcinoma patients with BM if extracranial metastasis was presented.
27356719	Knowledge of Cervical Cancer Screening among Health Care Workers Providing Services Across Different Socio-economic Regions of China.	BACKGROUND: China carries a heavy burden of cervical cancer (CC) and substantial disparities exist across regions within the country. In order to reduce regional disparities in CC, the government of China launched the National Cervical Cancer Screening Program in Rural Areas (NCCSPRA) in 2009. Critical to the success of the program are the health care workers who play a pivotal role in preventing and managing CC by encouraging and motivating women to use screening services and by providing identification and treatment services. This study aimed to assess cervical cancer knowledge among these health care workers at the county level in maternal and child health (MCH) hospitals across different socio-economic regions of China. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted and self-administered questionnaires were sent to all health care workers (a total of 66) providing cervical cancer screening services in 6 county level MCH hospitals in Liaoning, Hubei and Shaanxi provinces, representing eastern, central and western regions of China; 64 (97.0%, 64/66) of the workers responded. ANOVA and Chi-square test were used to compare the knowledge rate and scores in subgroups. RESULTS: The knowledge level of the respondents was generally low. The overall combined knowledge rate was 46.9%. The knowledge rates for risk factors, prevention, clinical symptoms, screening and diagnostic tests and understanding of positive results were 31.3%, 37.5%, 18.1%, 56.3% and 84.4%, respectively. Statistically significant differences in scores or rates of CC knowledge were seen across the different regions. The total and sectional scores in the less developed regions were statistically significantly lower than in the other regions. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of the health care workers who provide CC screening service in NCCSPRA at county level MCH hospitals do not have adequately equipped with knowledge about CC. Given the importance of knowledge to the program's success in reducing CC burden in rural women in China, efforts are needed to improve the knowledge of health care workers, especially in less developed regions.
27356705	Effects of Group Training Based on the Health Belief Model on Knowledge and Behavior Regarding the Pap Smear Test in Iranian Women: a Quasi-Experimental Study.	The Pap smear test is recommended for early diagnosis of cervical cancer. The aim of this study was to assess knowledge and behavior regarding the Pap smear test based on the Health Belief Model (HBM) in women referred to premarital counseling classes, Hamadan, Iran. This quasi-experimental study was conducted on 330 women, who were allocated randomly to two case and control groups (n=165). Two educational session classes were performed in the case group. Two stages in before and after intervention groups were evaluated. Analysis of data was performed by SPSS/16.0, using t-test, x2, and McNemar's test. P-values <0.05 were regarded as significant. There was no significant difference between the mean scores of the various structures of this model in two groups before the intervention. However, after the intervention there were significant increase in mean score of knowledge and all variables of HBM in the intervention group(<0.001). The findings of this study highlight the important role of education about cervical cancer on changing women's beliefs about cervical screening.
27356701	Limited Impact of Music Therapy on Patient Anxiety with the Large Loop Excision of Transformation Zone Procedure - a Randomized Controlled Trial.	BACKGROUND: Many studies have pointed to strategies to cope with patient anxiety in colposcopy. Evidence shows that patients experienced considerable distress with the large loop excision of transformation zone (LLETZ) procedure and suitable interventions should be introduced to reduce anxiety. This study aimed to investigate the effects of music therapy in patients undergoing LLETZ. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A randomized controlled trial was conducted with patients undergoing LLETZ performed under local anesthesia in an out patient setting at Ramathibodi Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand, from February 2015 to January 2016. After informed consent and demographic data were obtained, we assessed the anxiety level using State Anxiety Inventory pre and post procedures. Music group patients listened to classical songs through headphones, while the control group received the standard care. Pain score was evaluated with a visual analog scale (VAS). Statistical analysis was conducted using Pearson Chi-square, Fisher's Exact test and T-Test and p-values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. RESULTS: A total of 73 patients were enrolled and randomized, resulting in 36 women in the music group and 37 women in the non-music control group. The preoperative mean anxiety score was higher in the music group (46.8 VS 45.8 points). The postoperative mean anxiety scores in the music and the non-music groups were 38.7 and 41.3 points, respectively. VAS was lower in music group (2.55 VS 3.33). The percent change of anxiety was greater in the music group, although there was no significant difference between two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Music therapy did not significantly reduce anxiety in patients undergoing the LLETZ procedure. However, different interventions should be developed to ease the patients' apprehension during this procedure.
27356572	Comprehensive meta-analytical summary on human papillomavirus association with head and neck cancer.	An etiological role of high risk human papillomavirus (HPV) in the development of cervical cancer has been well established. Hence, attention of researchers has been focused on the role of HPV in pathogenesis of other malignancies, such as head and neck cancers. An analysis of epidemiological data on the prevalence of HPV infection among healthy people and patients with precancerous lesions and/or cancer is an important step in understanding the role of HPV in head and neck carcinogenesis. More and more data de-monstrate the impact of HPV infection on disease outcome. HPV-positive patients have been shown to have better responses to radiotherapy and better overall and disease-free survival than HPV-negative patients. This review presents data of the meta-analysis based on a large number of original studies on HPV prevalence in patients with precancerous lesions and in patients with oral, oropharyngeal and laryngeal cancers as well as findings on the impact of HPV infection on survival of these patients.
27356480	[A retrospective study on the outcomes of the oncology, fertility and pregnancy in patients with early-stage cervical cancer after undergoing the fertility-sparing treatments].	OBJECTIVE: To explore the outcomes of the oncology, the fertility and pregnancy on patients with early-stage cervical cancer after undergoing fertility-sparing treatments, and to investigate its value on clinical treatment. METHODS: A total of 29 patients with cervical cancer (stage a2-b1) who had undergone the fertility- sparing treatments in Renji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiaotong University from February 2010 to September 2015 were analyzed retrospectively. Surgical procedures included transvaginal cervical cold knife conization (CKC) + laparoscopic pelvic lymphadenectomy (PLD) or total laparoscopic uterine cervix extensive resection (RT; contains PLD); 48 patients with early cervical cancer under going laparoscopic uterine extensive resection (RH; contains PLD) by the same group of physicians in the same period were chosen as the control group. The perioperative related indicators, postoperative specimen examination, pregnancies after surgery and postoperative tumor follow- up results were retrospectively analyzed and compared between the two groups. RESULTS: (1) Among these 29 patients in the study group, 26 cases were underwent the fertility-sparing surgery quick frozen pathological examinations were positive in 3 cases, which underwent total laparoscopic RT eventually. (2) The perioperative related indicators: compared with the study group and the control group, the operation time [(182+/-21), (147+/-24) minutes, respectively] has significant difference (t=6.563, P<0.01). There were no significant difference (P> 0.05) in intra-operative blood loss [(102+/-26), (99+/-34) ml], postoperative aerofluxus time [(1.3+/-0.4), (1.1+/-0.9) days], the average length of hospital stay [(11.2+/-2.1), (10.6+/-3.5) days], rate of urine retention [10%(3/29), 10%(5/48)] and rate of postoperative infection [3% (1/29), 2%(1/48)]. (3)Postoperative specimen examination: compared with the study group and the control group, there were no significant difference (P>0.05) innumber of removed lymphatic nodes (23.4+/-4.1, 22.8+/-3.9), length of cardinal ligament [(2.9+/-0.5), (3.0+/-0.6) cm], lengthof uterosacral ligament [(2.6+/-0.7), (2.8+/-0.4) cm], length of removed vaginal [(3.4+/-0.3), (3.5+/-0.3) cm]. (4) Pregnancies after surgery and postoperative tumor follow-up results: in the study group, only 14 patients had fertility requirement after treatments. Pregnancies occurred in 5 women (5/14), which included1 case of full-term labor, 1 case of preterm labor, and 3 cases of spontaneous abortion. The Average follow-up time in postoperative patients of the study group and control group was 29.4, and 30.2 months respectively. In follow- up period, compare with study group and the control group, there was no significant difference (chi(2)=0.004, P> 0.05) in the recurrence rate [4% (1/26), 4% (2/48)]. CONCLUSION: Fertility-sparing surgery of early-stage cervical cancer is safe but the outcome of the fertility and pregnancy is still need toimprove.
27356074	Fertility and Early Pregnancy Outcomes Following Conservative Treatment for Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia and Early Cervical Cancer.	Clinical Question: Does local conservative treatment for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and early invasive cervical cancer adversely affect successful conception and early pregnancy outcomes in the first and second trimester (<24 weeks of gestation)? Clinical Application: Local cervical treatment does not adversely affect fertility or first trimester miscarriage, although it is associated with a significant increase in the risk of second trimester miscarriages.
27354621	Prognostic Value of Severe Lymphopenia During Pelvic Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy in Cervical Cancer.	AIM: To investigate whether common terminology criteria for adverse events (CTCAE) grade 4 lymphopenia (<200 cells/mul) during concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) is relevant to poor survival. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed 124 patients with newly diagnosed Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage I-III cervical cancer who received weekly cisplatin-based CCRT and brachytherapy using Kaplan-Meier curves and the Cox proportional hazard models. RESULTS: Grade 4 lymphopenia significantly predicted disease-specific survival (DSS) and progression-free survival (PFS) (adjusted hazard ratio (95% confidence interval (CI))=3.6 (1.37-9.44), p=0.009 and 3.28 (1.27-8.48), p=0.014, respectively). The 5-year DSS and 3-year PFS were significantly higher among patients with grade 2-3 lymphopenia (>/=200 cells/mul) than among those with grade 4 lymphopenia (84.8% vs. 50.4%, p<0.001, and 80.7% vs. 50%, p=0.002, respectively). CONCLUSION: Severe lymphopenia during CCRT could predict poor survival.
27354610	Prognostic Factors and Treatment Outcome for Patients with Stage IVB Cervical Cancer.	AIM: We report a retrospective evaluation for patients with stage IVB cervical cancer in order to identify survival rates and to improve our current practice. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed 85 patients with stage IVB cervical cancer. For patients appropriate for radical treatment, a combination of external-beam radiotherapy and intracavitary brachytherapy was delivered with/without chemotherapy. Patients with distant metastasis were treated using systemic chemotherapy or palliative radiotherapy. RESULTS: Forty-two patients were treated using radiotherapy alone, 31 using chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy, eight using chemotherapy alone, and four using best supportive care. The 5-year overall survival rate was 9.9%. Multivariate analysis revealed leukocytosis and a poor performance status were independent prognostic factors. Of the 43 patients without these prognostic factors, patients with only lymph node metastasis had a 5-year overall survival rate of 40.5%. CONCLUSION: Radical treatment should be considered in patients who have only lymph rode metastasis and are without leukocytosis and a poor performance status.
27354119	Synchronous endometrioid adenocarcinomas in the uterine cervix and corpus.	It is frequently difficult to distinguish multiple primary carcinomas from single primary carcinoma with metastasis. Here, we report a case of synchronous endometrioid adenocarcinomas that independently occurred in the uterine cervix and corpus. A 47-year-old woman complaining of genital bleeding was preoperatively diagnosed with cervical adenocarcinoma with an endometrial lesion. On surgical treatment, two separate malignant lesions bearing endometrioid adenocarcinoma were identified in the uterine cervix and cavity. Although both lesions expressed the same type of human papillomavirus (HPV) gene, type 16, microscopic continuity was not observed. Furthermore, we detected a critical difference in PTEN mutation between the tumors and finally diagnosed this case as multiple primary cancers. This is the first report to show multiple primary endometrioid adenocarcinomas simultaneously arising in the uterine cervix and corpus. Considering the rarity of this case, the coexistence of HPV suggests its possible involvement in the carcinogenesis of the endometrioid adenocarcinomas.
27353611	Knowledge, attitudes and practices regarding human papillomavirus vaccination among young women attending a tertiary institution in Singapore.	INTRODUCTION: This study aimed to describe the knowledge, attitudes and practices of young women regarding human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination. METHODS: We conducted a descriptive, cross-sectional, questionnaire-based study among female students at a tertiary institute in Singapore. RESULTS: A total of 255 questionnaires were completed and formed the basis of the analysis. 244 (95.7%) of the total participants were of the age group 15-22 years. 252 (98.8%) participants were unmarried and 240 (94.1%) had never had sexual intercourse. Only 25 (9.8%) women had received vaccination. Among the unvaccinated participants, 96 (41.7%) had no intention to receive HPV vaccination and 62 of them cited lack of information as a major barrier to HPV vaccination. Knowledge of cervical cancer and HPV vaccination was also assessed and graded via a point system, with a maximum score of 14. Knowledge was found to be low, with a median score of 7. There was a significant association between HPV vaccination uptake and the source from which they first heard about the vaccine (p = 0.007). Vaccinated respondents tended to first hear about it from their relatives and friends, as compared to unvaccinated respondents (60.0% vs. 27.0%). CONCLUSION: There is poor uptake of HPV vaccination amongst Singapore's susceptible youth as well as poor knowledge of cervical cancer and HPV vaccination. Public health education regarding cervical cancer and HPV vaccination is still needed and has to be targeted at not only respondents, but also their family and friends.
27353174	Simple vaginal trachelectomy as a fertility-sparing treatment to manage high-grade dyskaryosis following multiple large loop excision of the transformation zone.	A 34-year-old nullipara, wishing to start a family, presented to colposcopy clinic. Her most recent cervical cytology result showed high-grade dyskaryosis. Having undergone four large loop excisions of the transformation zone during the past 6 years, this woman had no remaining vaginal cervix. In order to excise presumed high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia while mitigating obstetric risk, she underwent a simple vaginal trachelectomy and isthmic cerclage. 6 months later, the patient had a negative test of cure. 7 months following surgery she became pregnant naturally. At 29 weeks she had antenatal sepsis of unknown cause, which was treated with intravenous antibiotics. She delivered by caesarean section at 37 weeks and now has a healthy child. This report will discuss the obstetric impact of colposcopic treatment, and simple vaginal trachelectomy as a fertility-sparing treatment option for women who have had multiple loop excision procedures to treat premalignant lesions.
27352568	MRI in the synchronic chemoradiotherapy of cervical squamous cell carcinoma.	OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore the predictive value of the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) of diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) in evaluating the therapeutic effects of synchronic chemoradiotherapy of cervical squamous cell carcinoma by using the functional imaging of 1.5T MR. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty patients with cervical squamous cell carcinoma receiving synchronic chemoradiotherapy in the present hospital from October 2010 to February 2014 were enrolled in this study. MRI examination was performed on each patient before and after chemoradiotherapy. Eleven patients received an additional MRI examination when the in vitro cumulative radiation dose reached 36 Gy. The mean tumor ADC values of DWI sequence were measured before, under, and after chemoradiotherapy. At the end of the treatment, patients were divided into complete remission (CR) and partial remission (PR) groups on the basis of the residual tumors. Then the tumor ADC values and their changes before and after the treatment were analyzed using independent sample t-test. RESULTS: At the end of the treatment, 32 patients achieved CR and 18 patients achieved PR. The tumor ADC values increased gradually with the treatment, showing significant difference between before, under, and after the treatment (p < 0.01). The mean tumor ADC values were remarkably higher in CR group than in PR group (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The ADC values of MR functional imaging DWI can reflect the hydrone diffusion movement of tumor after the treatment, so that it is able to identify CR and PR in the patients, providing a new way and method for evaluating the therapeutic effects of cervical squamous cell carcinoma.
27352563	An economic analysis of cisplatin alone versus cisplatin doublets in the treatment of women with advanced or recurrent cervical cancer.	PURPOSE OF INVESTIGATION: Randomized trials have demonstrated improvements in overall survival when using platinum doublets com- pared to single agent platinum in the treatment of women with advanced or recurrent cervical cancer. The authors sought to evaluate the cost effectiveness of these regimens. METHODS: A decision model was developed based on Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) protocols 179 and 204. Cisplatin alone was compared to cisplatin/paclitaxel (CP), cisplatin/topotecan (CT), cisplatin/gemcitabine (GC), cisplatin/vinorelbine (CV), and a hypothetical novel agent. Parameters included overall survival (OS), cost, and complications. One way sensitivity analyses were performed. In further sensitivity analysis, a hypothetical agent that added 3.7 months survival to CP's survival was studied. RESULTS: The chemotherapy drug costs for six cycles of cisplatin was 89 USD while for cisplatin/paclitaxel it was 489 USD. The highest chemotherapy cost was for GC at 18,306 USD. The average total cost of six cycles CP was 13,250 USD while the average cost of cisplatin alone was 14,573 USD. The highest average cost for six cycles was for GC at 33,559 USD. With cisplatin/paclitaxel being the most effective, the cost effectiveness analysis showed that cisplatin, CT, GC, and VC were all dominated by CP. Because of the regimens being dominated, no baseline ICERs compared to CP were calculable. Sensitivity analyses demonstrate that even all of the chemotherapies were given for free, CP would still be the regimen of choice. CONCLUSIONS: In this model, CP is the most cost effective regimen for the treatment of these patients with an average cost of 13,250 USD. With the fact that GOG 204 also showed statistically significantly improved survival for CP, CP should be considered the regimen of choice.
27352562	Serum lipid profile in gynecologic tumors: a retrospective clinical study of 1,550 patients.	BACKGROUND: The study was performed to characterize and compare the serum lipid profile in gynecologic cancers and benign diseases. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 1,550 age-matched females were included in this study: 760 patients with gynecologic cancers and 790 patients with benign diseases. Serum levels of triglycerides (TG), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c), total cholesterol (TC), and lipoprotein (a) were measured. RESULTS: Compared to gynecologic benign disease group, gynecologic cancer group was associated with higher level of TG (p = 0.0002), as well as lower level of HDL-c (p < 0.0001), LDL-c (p = 0.004) and TC (p = 0.003). Compared to benign ovarian tumor group, ovarian cancer group had significantly lower levels of HDL-c (p < 0.0001), LDL-c (p = 0.0009), and TC (p < 0.0001), as well as a trend of higher level of lipoprotein (a) (p = 0.10). Compared to endometriosis group, endometrial cancer group showed higher levels of TG (p < 0.0001) and lower levels of HDL-c (p = 0.002). There was no significant difference in any lipid parameters between cervical cancer group and uterine leiomyomas group. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, compared with benign diseases, gynecologic cancers are associated with a disordered lipid profile characterized by higher TG and lipoprotein (a) levels, and lower HDL-c, LDL-c, and TC levels. The association is most conspicuous in ovarian cancers. Endometrial cancer is accompanied by alterations only in TG and HDL-c levels, while cervical cancer does not appear to be associated with disordered lipid profile.
27352559	Pattern of distribution and metastasis of deep obturator and parametrial lymph nodes in early stage cervical cancer patients.	Pelvic lymphadenectomy has been widely performed as an essential part of the surgical treatment of early stage (IB-IIA) cervical cancer. In this study, the authors reviewed 128 patients who underwent this type of dissection to investigate the pattern of distribution and metastasis of deep obturator lymph node (DOLN) and parametrial lymph node (PLN), and the clinical hitstological factors that associated with detection of and metastasis to DOLN and PLN. The authors found the detection of DOLN and PLN significantly less common and more frequently unilateral compared with other groups of pelvic nodes. Tumor size and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) antigen may help to identify patients suitable for individualized dissection of PLN.
27352558	The problems of cervical conization for postmenopausal patients.	PURPOSE: Cervical conization is the definitive treatment for women of any age who have cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). However, complications of the procedure have not been fully investigated in postmenopausal patients. The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate the results and complications of cervical conization performed on premenopausal and postmenopausal patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study recruited 405 patients who had undergone cervical laser conization. The median age was 36 years (range 20 to 75), and there were 361 (89.1%) premenopausal and 44 (10.9%) postmenopausal women. RESULTS: The length of the cone removed from the postmenopausal patients was significantly longer than the length from the premenopausal patients (17.9 +/- 3.9 mm vs. 15.7 +/- 3.6 mm, respectively; p = 0.02). The rate of positive endocervical cone margins from the premenopausal patients was significantly higher than the rate from the postmenopausal patients (9.1% vs. 0%, respectively; p = 0.037). The rate of cervical stenosis was significantly higher in postmenopausal patients than in premenopausal patients (59.1% vs. 8.3%; respectively; p < 0.0001). There was no difference in the rates of frequency of intraoperative complications. CONCLUSIONS: Although deep incision is mandatory for complete excision of CIN in postmenopausal patients, it increases the incidence of cervical stenosis. Cervical conization may be a less invasive surgical procedure for older women with CIN than hysterectomy; however, the risk of postoperative complications remains, causing a dilemma for physicians treating postmenopausal women with CIN.
27352554	Replicating viruses for gynecologic cancer therapy.	Despite advanced therapeutic treatments, gynecologic malignancies such as cervical and ovarian cancers are still the top ten leading cause of cancer death among women in South Korea. Thus a novel and innovative approach is urgently needed. Naturally occurring viruses are live, replication-proficient viruses that specifically infect human cancer cells while sparing normal cell counterparts. Since the serendipitous discovery of the naturally oncotropic virus targeting gynecologic cancer in 1920s, various replicating viruses have shown various degrees of safety and efficacy in preclinical or clinical applications for gynecologic cancer therapy. Cellular oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, which are frequently dysregulated in gynecologic malignancies, play an important role in determining viral oncotropism. Published articles describing replicating, oncolytic viruses for gynecologic cancers are thoroughly reviewed. This review outlines the discovery of replication-proficient virus strains for targeting gynecologic malignancies, recent progresses elucidating molecular connections between oncogene/tumor suppressor gene abnormalities and viral oncotropism, and the associated preclinical/clinical implications. The authors would also like to propose future directions in the utility of the replicating viruses for gynecologic cancer therapy.
27350738	Colostomy is a simple and effective procedure for severe chronic radiation proctitis.	AIM: To assess the efficacy and safety of diverting colostomy in treating severe hemorrhagic chronic radiation proctitis (CRP). METHODS: Patients with severe hemorrhagic CRP who were admitted from 2008 to 2014 were enrolled into this study. All CRP patients were diagnosed by a combination of pelvic radiation history, clinical rectal bleeding, and endoscopic findings. Inclusion criteria were CRP patients with refractory bleeding with moderate to severe anemia with a hemoglobin level < 90 g/L. The study group included patients who were treated by diverting colostomy, while the control group included patients who received conservative treatment. The remission of bleeding was defined as complete cessation or only occasional bleeding that needed no further treatment. The primary outcome was bleeding remission at 6 mo after treatment. Quality of life before treatment and at follow-up was evaluated according to EORTC QLQ C30. Severe CRP complications were recorded during follow-up. RESULTS: Forty-seven consecutive patients were enrolled, including 22 in the colostomy group and 27 in the conservative treatment group. When compared to conservative treatment, colostomy obtained a higher rate of bleeding remission (94% vs 12%), especially in control of transfusion-dependent bleeding (100% vs 0%), and offered a better control of refractory perianal pain (100% vs 0%), and a lower score of bleeding (P < 0.001) at 6 mo after treatment. At 1 year after treatment, colostomy achieved better remission of both moderate bleeding (100% vs 21.5%, P = 0.002) and severe bleeding (100% vs 0%, P < 0.001), obtained a lower score of bleeding (0.8 vs 2.0, P < 0.001), and achieved obvious elevated hemoglobin levels (P = 0.003), when compared to the conservative treatment group. The quality of life dramatically improved after colostomy, which included global health, function, and symptoms, but it was not improved in the control group. Pathological evaluation after colostomy found diffused chronic inflammation cells, and massive fibrosis collagen depositions under the rectal wall, which revealed potential fibrosis formation. CONCLUSION: Diverting colostomy is a simple, effective and safe procedure for severe hemorrhagic CRP. Colostomy can improve quality of life and reduce serious complications secondary to radiotherapy.
27350227	Cervical cancer screening programs and guidelines in low- and middle-income countries.	BACKGROUND: Screening reduces cervical cancer incidence and mortality. OBJECTIVE: To describe cervical cancer epidemiology and screening guidelines in six low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) participating in the Study on global AGEing and adult health (SAGE). SEARCH STRATEGY: Incidence, mortality, and screening-rate data were obtained for six LMICs and three higher-income comparator countries (Australia, USA, and UK). SCOPUS and PubMed were used to identify literature published after 2000 in English, using several screening-linked terms. SELECTION CRITERIA: Literature describing the use of cervical cancer screening guidelines in China, Ghana, India, Mexico, Russia, and South Africa were included. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Incidence, mortality trends, and screening rates were graphed and screening recommendations were summarized. MAIN RESULTS: Higher rates of cervical cancer incidence, mortality, and 5-year prevalence were found in LMICs compared with the comparator countries. LMICs with absent or newly implemented screening guidelines had the lowest rates of crude and effective cervical cancer screening, with high cancer incidence and mortality. Countries with established guidelines had higher screening rates and lower disease burden. Cost, inadequate knowledge, geographical location, and cultural views were common barriers to effective screening coverage. CONCLUSION: Work must continue to improve the implementation of affordable, relevant, and achievable methods to improve screening coverage in LMICs.
27350095	Health-care providers' perceptions, attitudes towards and recommendation practice of cervical cancer screening.	In Libya, cervical cancer is ranked third as the most frequent cancer among women with early diagnosis being shown to reduce morbidity and mortality. Health-care providers can influence women's screening behaviours, and their lack of recommendations for screening can be one of the barriers that affect women's participation in screening programmes. This study aims to assess the health-care provider's perception around cervical cancer screening. In-depth, face-to-face interviews were conducted with 16 health-care providers, from both public and private sectors in Az-Zawiya city, Libya, between February and July of 2014. The interviews were recorded and transcribed, then analysed using thematic analysis. Our findings suggest that health-care providers did not provide sufficient information regarding cervical cancer screening for women who attend health-care facilities. The results highlight the role played by health-care professionals in motivating women to attend cervical cancer screening programs, and the need for health education of health-care providers to offer a precious advice regarding the screening. On the other hand, health-care providers highlighted that implementation of reminding system of cervical cancer screening will support them to improve screening attendance. In addition, health-care providers stressed the necessity for educational and awareness campaigns of cervical cancer screening among Libyan women.
27349249	Effect of human papillomavirus 16 oncoproteins on oncostatin M upregulation in oral squamous cell carcinoma.	Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection modulates several host cytokines contributing to cancer development. Oncostatin M (OSM), an IL-6 family cytokine, acts to promote cell senescence and inhibit growth. Its dysregulation promotes cell survival, cell proliferation and metastasis in various malignancies. The effect of HPV on OSM dysregulation has not been investigated. To elucidate this, immunohistochemistry was used on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) tissues: HPV-positive (50) and HPV-negative (50) cases. Immortalized human cervical keratinocytes expressing HPV16E6 (HCK1T, Tet-On system) were used to demonstrate the role of HPV16E6 in OSM expression. In addition, a vector containing HPV16E6/E7 was transiently transfected into oral cancer cell lines. Cell viability, cell-cycle progression and cell migration were evaluated using flow cytometry and a wound healing assay, respectively. The results showed various intensities of OSM expression in OSCC. Interestingly, the median percentages of strongly stained cells were significantly higher in HPV-positive OSCCs than in HPV-negative OSCCs. To explore the role of HPV oncoproteins on OSM expression, the expression of HPV16E6 in the HCK1T Tet-On condition was induced by doxycycline and HPV16E6 was found to significantly upregulate levels of OSM mRNA and protein, with concomitant upregulation of c-Myc. In addition, the levels of OSM mRNA and protein in E6/E7 transiently transfected oral cancer cells also gradually increased in a time-dependent manner and these transfected cells showed greater viability and higher migration rates and cell-cycle progression than controls. This result demonstrates that HPV16 oncoproteins upregulate OSM and play an important role to promote OSCC development.
27347298	Evaluation of the cost of cervical cancer at the National Institute of Oncology, Rabat.	INTRODUCTION: The Cervical Cancer (CC) is one of the heavy and costly diseases for the population and the health system. We want to know through this study, the first in Morocco, the annual cost of the treatment of this disease at the National Institute of Oncology (NIO) in Rabat, we also want to explore the possibility of flat-rate management of this disease in order to standardize medical practices and improve reimbursement by health insurance funds. METHODS: 550 patients were treated for their cervical cancer in the Rabat's NIO. Data of all of medical and surgical services offered to patients were collected from the NIO registry. The cost of care was assessed using the method of micro-costing. We will focus to the total direct cost of all the services lavished to patients in NIO. RESULTS: The global cost was about US$ 1,429,673 with an average estimated at US$ 2,599 +/- US$ 839. Radiotherapy accounts for 55% of total costs, followed by brachytherapy (27%) and surgery (7%). This three services plus chemotherapy influence the overall cost of care (p <0.001). Other services (radiology, laboratory tests and consultations) represent only 10%. The overall cost is influenced by the stage of the disease, this cost decreased significantly evolving in the stage of CC (p <0.001). CONCLUSION: The standardization of medical practices is essential to the equity and efficiency in access to care. The flat-rate or lump sum by stage of disease is possible and interesting for standardizing medical practices and improving the services of the health insurance plan.
27343739	The use and success of cold coagulation for the treatment of high grade squamous cervical intra-epithelial neoplasia: a retrospective review.	OBJECTIVE: Cold coagulation is recognised as a viable, cost-effective and successful treatment for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), being used less frequently than excisional treatments for high grade lesions. We set out to demonstrate successful long term follow-up of patient with high grade CIN treated with cold coagulation. STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a retrospective review over a one-year period of women with biopsy-proven CIN 2 and 3 who were treated with cold coagulation to the cervix, attending the colposcopy service of a large tertiary referral hospital. We examined follow-up cervical smear data for three years post treatment of low and high grade CIN, evaluated the success of treatment and re-treatment rates. RESULTS: 93 patients were included in our study, with 39 (41.9%) having CIN 1 and 54 (58.1%) diagnosed with CIN 2 or 3. Follow-up smears revealed low levels of recurrent high grade changes in both groups, with 31 (79.5%) of our CIN 1 group having a negative smear one year following treatment with cold coagulation, compared to 44 (81.1%) of patients with CIN 2 and 3. Successful primary treatment (i.e. no requirement for further treatment after 3 year follow-up) occurred in 33 (84.6%) of the CIN 1 group, and 42 (77.7%) of the CIN 2/3 group, demonstrating no statistical significance between re-treatment rates between both groups. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the effectiveness of cold coagulation for the treatment of high grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. High success rates, and low re-treatment rates confirm that this is an acceptable primary treatment for CIN 2 and 3.
27343048	Genomic characterization of viral integration sites in HPV-related cancers.	Persistent infection with carcinogenic human papillomaviruses (HPV) causes the majority of anogenital cancers and a subset of head and neck cancers. The HPV genome is frequently found integrated into the host genome of invasive cancers. The mechanisms of how it may promote disease progression are not well understood. Thoroughly characterizing integration events can provide insights into HPV carcinogenesis. Individual studies have reported limited number of integration sites in cell lines and human samples. We performed a systematic review of published integration sites in HPV-related cancers and conducted a pooled analysis to formally test for integration hotspots and genomic features enriched in integration events using data from the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE). Over 1,500 integration sites were reported in the literature, of which 90.8% (N = 1,407) were in human tissues. We found 10 cytobands enriched for integration events, three previously reported ones (3q28, 8q24.21 and 13q22.1) and seven additional ones (2q22.3, 3p14.2, 8q24.22, 14q24.1, 17p11.1, 17q23.1 and 17q23.2). Cervical infections with HPV18 were more likely to have breakpoints in 8q24.21 (p = 7.68 x 10(-4) ) than those with HPV16. Overall, integration sites were more likely to be in gene regions than expected by chance (p = 6.93 x 10(-9) ). They were also significantly closer to CpG regions, fragile sites, transcriptionally active regions and enhancers. Few integration events occurred within 50 Kb of known cervical cancer driver genes. This suggests that HPV integrates in accessible regions of the genome, preferentially genes and enhancers, which may affect the expression of target genes.
27342833	Phase II clinical study of neoadjuvant chemotherapy with CDDP/CPT-11 regimen in combination with radical hysterectomy for cervical cancer with a bulky mass.	BACKGROUND: We examined the efficacy and safety of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) with the CPT-11 + CDDP regimen in combination with radical hysterectomy. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The subjects were 42 patients with stages IB2 to IIIB squamous cell carcinoma of the uterine cervix with a bulky mass. CDDP at 70 mg/m2 was intravenously administered on day 1 and CPT-11 at 70 mg/m2 was intravenously administered on days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle. In principle, two cycles were administered followed by radical hysterectomy. We examined antitumor efficacy, adverse events, completion rate of radical hysterectomy, operative time, surgical blood loss, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). RESULTS: The antitumor effect was complete response in 7 patients, partial response in 28, stable disease in 6, and progressive disease in 1; the response rate was 83.3 % (95 % confidence interval, 68.6-93.0). Grade 3 or more severe neutropenia, anemia, and platelet count decreases were noted in 23 (54.8 %), 4 (9.5 %), and 1 (2.4 %) patient, respectively. Grade 3 nausea occurred in 3 patients (7.1 %), vomiting in 1 (2.4 %), and grade 3 febrile neutropenia in 2 (7.1 %). The completion rate of radical hysterectomy was 88.1 %. The median operative time and surgical blood loss were 260 min (range, 210-334) and 500 ml (range, 393-898), respectively. The 5-year PFS rate was 67.2 %, and the 5-year OS rate was 68.0 %. In multivariate analysis, lymph node metastasis before NAC [hazard ratio (HR), 34.88] and non-response to NAC (HR 30.58) were significant prognostic factors. CONCLUSION: NAC with the CDDP/CPT-11 regimen achieves a high antitumor efficacy with moderate adverse reactions, allowing safe radical hysterectomy, and is thus considered to be a useful therapeutic method that can improve prognosis.
27342077	Comparison of initial stream urine samples and cervical samples for detection of human papillomavirus.	BACKGROUND: Uterine cervical cancer is a treatable and preventable cancer. Medical efforts to reduce rates of cervical cancer focus on the promotion of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination and the promotion of routine cervical cancer screening done by cervical cytology and cervical HPV testing. Urine-based HPV testing would be simple and noninvasive approach to screen for cervical cancer. METHODS: Two biospecimens (clinician-taken sample from cervix and initial stream urine sample) were provided from a total of 240 healthy women attending for cancer screening provided for HPV testing. We have assessed the HPV detection rates among cervical samples and pellet fraction of urine samples using HPV test (Anyplex II HPV28 Detection kit, Seegene, Korea). RESULTS: Among 240 samples screened, HPV prevalence was 42.9% in pellet fractions of urine samples. The agreement between the two kinds of samples was 98.4%, k = 0.792. Discordant results were observed in 27 cases; 5 were positive only by urine samples and 22 were positive only by smear samples. Sensitivity and specificity for all HPV DNA in pellet fractions of urine using cervical samples as reference was 68.4% and 99.9%. CONCLUSIONS: Comparing methodologies of collection of samples for HPV detection, they showed the higher agreements for almost genotypes between cervical samples and pellet fractions of urine samples. These results suggest that urine could be a good noninvasive tool to monitor HPV infection in women. Additional research in a larger and general screening population would be needed.
27341273	Therapy Response Assessment and Patient Outcomes in Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma: FDG PET Hopkins Criteria Versus Residual Neck Node Size and Morphologic Features.	OBJECTIVE: This study investigates the prognostic value of (18)F-FDG PET/CT qualitative therapy assessment (Hopkins criteria) in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs) with residual neck nodes after definitive chemoradiation therapy and compares the Hopkins criteria with anatomic nodal size and morphologic features for prediction of survival outcomes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 72 patients with HNSCC, with negative primary tumor and positive residual neck nodes (CT criteria > 1 cm short-axis diameter) after the completion of definitive chemoradiation therapy, were included. PET/CT was performed 6-24 weeks after completion of treatment. FDG uptake in residual nodes on PET/CT was interpreted using a structured qualitative 5-point scale (Hopkins criteria). The 5-point scale was dichotomized to negative (scores 1, 2, and 3) or positive (scores 4 and 5) results. Cystic or necrotic nodes were defined as those with central low attenuation with a relatively hyperdense capsule. Kaplan-Meier curve and Cox regression analysis were performed. RESULTS: On the basis of the Hopkins criteria, 10 (13.9%) patients had positive findings and 62 (86.1%) had negative findings for residual nodal disease. According to CT interpretation, 25 patients (34.7%) had residual cervical lymph nodes greater than or equal to 1.5 cm in diameter, and 41 (56.9%) patients had cystic or necrotic nodes. Patients were followed for a median of 27 months after posttherapy PET/CT. There was a statistically significant difference in overall survival (OS) (hazard ratio, 7.06; p < 0.001) and progression-free survival (PFS) (hazard ratio, 6.18; p < 0.001) between patients with negative versus positive residual FDG nodal uptake. There was no statistically significant difference in OS and PFS in patients categorized on the basis of nodal size or morphologic features. CONCLUSION: PET-based structured qualitative therapy assessment (Hopkins criteria) can predict survival outcomes of patients with HNSCC with residual neck nodes after definitive chemoradiotherapy.
27340932	Contrast-enhanced ultrasonography of cervical carcinoma: perfusion pattern and relationship with tumour angiogenesis.	OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the use of contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (CEUS) and time-intensity curves to assess angiogenesis in cervical cancer. METHODS: 60 patients who were scheduled to undergo radical surgery for biopsy-proven cervical cancers underwent CEUS. Surgical tissue sections from 32 patients who did not receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy were analyzed with CD34 staining to estimate intratumoral microvessel density (MVD). CEUS images were analyzed for maximum intensity (IMAX), rise time (RT), time to peak (TTP) and mean transit time. RESULTS: Cervical lesions had a higher IMAX and shorter RT and TTP (p < 0.001) than reference regions. There was a linear association between the IMAX of the cervical lesion and the mean intratumoral MVD (r = 0.624, p < 0.001). There were no significant differences in CEUS variables according to histological type, grade and stage. CONCLUSION: Quantitative CEUS variables have potential use for monitoring perfusion changes in tumours after non-surgical therapy for advanced cervical cancer. ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: The article demonstrates the capability and value of quantitative CEUS as a non-invasive strategy for detecting the perfusion and angiogenic status of cervical cancer. Quantitative CEUS variables have potential use for monitoring tumour response to non-surgical therapy.
27339821	Linear viral load increase of a single HPV-type in women with multiple HPV infections predicts progression to cervical cancer.	Persistent high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is strongly associated with development of high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia or cancer (CIN3+). In single type infections, serial type-specific viral-load measurements predict the natural history of the infection. In infections with multiple HPV-types, the individual type-specific viral-load profile could distinguish progressing HPV-infections from regressing infections. A case-cohort natural history study was established using samples from untreated women with multiple HPV-infections who developed CIN3+ (n = 57) or cleared infections (n = 88). Enriched cell pellet from liquid based cytology samples were subjected to a clinically validated real-time qPCR-assay (18 HPV-types). Using serial type-specific viral-load measurements (>/=3) we calculated HPV-specific slopes and coefficient of determination (R(2) ) by linear regression. For each woman slopes and R(2) were used to calculate which HPV-induced processes were ongoing (progression, regression, serial transient, transient). In transient infections with multiple HPV-types, each single HPV-type generated similar increasing (0.27copies/cell/day) and decreasing (-0.27copies/cell/day) viral-load slopes. In CIN3+, at least one of the HPV-types had a clonal progressive course (R(2) >/= 0.85; 0.0025copies/cell/day). In selected CIN3+ cases (n = 6), immunostaining detecting type-specific HPV 16, 31, 33, 58 and 67 RNA showed an even staining in clonal populations (CIN3+), whereas in transient virion-producing infections the RNA-staining was less in the basal layer compared to the upper layer where cells were ready to desquamate and release newly-formed virions. RNA-hybridization patterns matched the calculated ongoing processes measured by R(2) and slope in serial type-specific viral-load measurements preceding the biopsy. In women with multiple HPV-types, serial type-specific viral-load measurements predict the natural history of the different HPV-types and elucidates HPV-genotype attribution.
27339270	The molecular mechanism of human papillomavirus-induced carcinogenesis in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.	Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is the sixth most common cancer worldwide. Recently, the incidence of oropharyngeal cancer (OPC) has increased markedly in comparison to that of HNSCC, which is associated with the use of tobacco or alcohol or both. This increase has resulted mainly from the global rise in the number of human papillomavirus (HPV)-related oropharyngeal cancers (HPV-OPCs). HPV-OPC has several unique characteristics, including presentation in younger patients, better response rates to treatment, and better prognosis compared to alcohol- and smoking-related HNSCC. HPV infection status is now an independent prognostic factor for survival in patients with OPC. In general, HPV oncoproteins E6 and E7 are the primary viral factors responsible for the initiation and progression of HPV-related cancers via the inactivation of p53 and pRb. However, alterations in additional factors, including genomic instability, HPV DNA integration, and epigenetic alterations, could be equally important for neoplastic transformation and tumor progression. The impact of genomic instability and external environmental factors on the initiation of cervical cancer development through high-risk HPV infection has been well characterized, although less is known about the mechanism underlying HPV-induced carcinogenesis in HNSCC. This review provides an overview of the biology and molecular mechanisms of HPV-related cancers, including a particular focus on several recent studies on the comprehensive characterization of genomic alterations in HPV-associated HNSCC.
27338217	Annual Report of the Committee on Gynecologic Oncology, Japan Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology: Patient Annual Report for 2013 and Treatment Annual Report for 2008.	The Japan Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology collects and analyzes annual data on gynecologic cancers from member institutions. We present the Patient Annual Report for 2013 and the Treatment Annual Report for 2008. Data on 7280 patients with cervical cancer, 8952 with endometrial cancer, 5792 with ovarian cancer and 1903 with ovarian borderline tumor for whom treatment was initiated in 2013 were summarized in the Patient Annual Report. Stage I accounted for 56.7%, stage II for 23.4%, stage III for 9.8% and stage IV for 10.2% of all patients with cervical cancer. Stage I accounted for 71.7%, stage II for 6.5%, stage III for 14.5% and stage IV for 7.3% of all patients with endometrial cancer. Stage I accounted for 42.2%, stage II for 9.8%, stage III for 28.2% and stage IV for 8.3% of all patients with ovarian cancer. Data on the prognosis of 3658 patients with cervical cancer, 4159 with endometrial cancer and 2866 with ovarian cancer for whom treatment was initiated in 2008 were analyzed in the Treatment Annual Report. Survival was analyzed by using the Kaplan-Meier method, the log-rank test and the Wilcoxon test. The 5-year overall survival rates for patients with cervical cancer were 93.0% for stage I, 73.1% for stage II, 55.2% for stage III and 24.2% for stage IV. The equivalent rates for patients with endometrial cancer were 94.5%, 90.3%, 74.2% and 24.0%, respectively; and those for patients with ovarian cancer (surface epithelial-stromal tumors) were 90.5%, 73.5%, 48.1% and 29.4%, respectively.
27336882	Clinical manifestations, course, and outcome of patients with neutralizing anti-interferon-gamma autoantibodies and disseminated nontuberculous mycobacterial infections.	Neutralizing anti-interferon-gamma autoantibody (nAIGA)-associated immunodeficiency is an emerging medical issue worldwide. In the present study, we describe and discuss the clinical features and outcomes of patients with nAIGAs and disseminated infections by nontuberculous mycobacteria (dNTM).We thoroughly reviewed the medical records of all patients. Microorganisms and nAIGAs were identified using previously described methods with modifications. All data were calculated and analyzed using SPSS software.Among 46 adult patients with dNTM infections, we identified 45 cases (97.8%) with nAIGAs. The average patient age was 58.6 years, and there was no sex predominance. Cervical lymphadenitis (81.8%) was the most common clinical manifestation. Endocrine disorder was the leading comorbidity (7 cases). Malignancies were found in 4 patients, and all of the malignancies originated from the T-cell/macrophage lineage. More than half of the identifiable isolates were slow-growing NTMs. Twenty-eight (62.2%) and 18 (40.0%) patients had a history of zoster and salmonellosis, respectively. A high proportion of patients with recurrent episodes of NTM infection or a history of zoster and dNTM infection had initial nAIGA titers >/=10 dilution (P < 0.05). Twenty-seven patients (60.0%) required long-term antimycobacterial therapy and had at least 1 episode of recurrent NTM disease. No mortality was related to dNTM infection.In Taiwan, nAIGAs are a recently recognized mechanism of dNTM infection. Long term of antibiotic treatment and adherence to medical advice are necessary to improve the clinical outcome of patients with nAIGAs.
27336876	Clinical outcomes in cervical cancer patients treated by FDG-PET/CT-based 3-dimensional planning for the first brachytherapy session.	The aim of the study was to evaluate the treatment outcomes in cervical cancer patients treated with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT)-guided 3-dimensional brachytherapy (3D-BT) planning for the first brachytherapy session.We retrospectively analyzed 87 patients with cervical cancer who received definitive radiotherapy (RT). Primary tumor size was </=4 cm in 22 patients (25.3%), >4 cm and </=6 cm in 45 patients (51.7%), and >6 cm in 20 patients (23.0%). The median total dose of external beam RT was 50.4 (50.4-60.4) Gy. FDG-PET/CT-guided 3D-BT with an iridium-192 source was performed. The clinical target volume (CTV) for 3D-BT included the entire cervix and the abnormal FDG-uptake with a 1-cm expansion. A planned total dose was 24 Gy at 4 Gy per insertion 3 times per week using a tandem and 2 ovoids.The mean D95 and D90 for the CTV were 73.4 (+/-5.9) Gy and 77.9 (+/-6.9) Gy, respectively (EQD2, alpha/beta=10). The D2cc for the rectum and bladder was 374 (+/-97.4) cGy and 394 (+/-107.6) cGy per fraction, respectively. The EQD2 (alpha/beta=3) for the D2cc was 74.5 (+/-12.4) Gy for the rectum and 77.3 (+/-14.6) Gy for the bladder. The median follow-up period was 40 (8-61) months. The 3-year overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and local control (LC) rates were 84.7%, 72.1%, and 89.2%, respectively. The 3-year LC rate was 100% for tumors </= 4 cm, 91.1% for tumors > 4 cm and </= 6 cm, and 70.5% for tumors > 6 cm (P = 0.014). Local failure developed in 9 patients. Three patients had local failures outside of the CTV. Grade 1, 2, and 3 rectal bleeding developed in 5, 4, and 2 patients, respectively. One patient experienced rectovaginal fistula.FDG-PET/CT-guided 3D-BT planning is a feasible approach, which showed favorable clinical outcomes.
27334754	Antagonizing canonical Wnt signaling pathway by recombinant human sFRP4 purified from E. coli and its implications in cancer therapy.	The Wnt signaling pathway plays a predominant role in aberrant proliferation in myriad of cancers. In non-cancerous cells, Wnts are blocked by the secreted frizzled-related proteins (sFRPs) that are generally downregulated in cancer cells. We have purified and characterized bacterially expressed glutathione S-transferase-tagged SFRP4 from a novel clone generated from human cell origin. Cervical cancer (HeLa) and lung cancer (A549) cells, in which Wnt and associated genes were found to be expressed, were treated with the purified recombinant sFRP4, which revealed a significant dose-dependent cell growth inhibition up to 40 %. The current investigation on functionality of this bacterially produced recombinant sFRP4 in arresting cancer cell proliferation is the first of its kind, where G2/M phase arrest and early apoptosis were evident. Increase in phosphorylated beta-catenin in sFRP4 treatment indicated inhibition of Wnt pathway, which was further confirmed by downregulation of pro-proliferative genes, namely cyclin D1, c-myc, and survivin. Functional activity of recombinant sFRP4 was further exploited in co-therapy module with chemotherapeutic drugs to decipher molecular events. Collectively, our study on purified recombinant sFRP4 from bacterial host holds great promise in targeting Wnt signaling for exploring new strategies to combat cancer.
27334572	Association between vascular endothelial growth factor expression and lymph node metastasis in cervical cancer: A meta-analysis.	AIM: The expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) by cancer cells has been identified as a factor that is associated with lymph node metastasis (LNM) in some cancers, but an accurate description of the relation between VEGF and LNM in cervical cancer is lacking. We conducted a concurrent meta-analysis to investigate this issue. METHODS: We searched PubMed and EMBASE for articles addressing the association between VEGF and cervical cancer. We used stata 12.0 and calculated the crude odds ratios (OR) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI). Heterogeneity between the studies included was assessed by Cochran's Q-test. RESULTS: Overall, 16 relevant studies with 426 cases and 751 controls were included in our study. The results demonstrated that cervical cancer patients with VEGF-positive expression had a 2.87-fold higher risk of LNM than patients without VEGF-positive expression (95%CI = 1.85-4.44, P < 0.001). Furthermore, subgroup analysis by ethnicity revealed that VEGF-positive expression could increase the risk of LNM in cervical cancer among Asian populations (OR = 2.55, 95%CI = 1.61-4.03, P < 0.001) and Caucasian populations (OR = 8.81, 95%CI = 2.78-27.88, P < 0.001). Moreover, subgroup analysis by country revealed that VEGF-positive expression could increase the risk of LNM in cervical cancer among Chinese populations (OR = 3.38, 95%CI = 2.18-5.25, P < 0.001) but not among Korean populations (P = 0.84) or Japanese populations (P = 0.06). Subgroup analysis based on sample size proved that VEGF-positive expression was statistically associated with LNM in a large sample group. CONCLUSION: Our study revealed that VEGF-positive expression is related with higher risk of LNM in cervical cancer.
27334141	Gastric-type adenocarcinoma in situ of uterine cervix: cytological and histopathological features of two cases.	Benign, premalignant, and malignant endocervical glandular lesions occasionally show a gastric phenotype. We report 2 cases of gastric-type adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS) of the endocervix, not associated with lobular endocervical glandular hyperplasia or gastric-type adenocarcinoma. Cytologically, both showed endocervical glands with slightly enlarged nuclei, distinctive nucleoli, pseudostratified strips, and intracytoplasmic golden yellow mucin. Histologically, both lesions were situated in preexisting endocervical glands and presented columnar cells with voluminous pale eosinophilic cytoplasm and evident nuclear atypia. In case 1, the lesion was located at the mid-zone of the endocervical canal and, in case 2, at the outer endocervical canal with extension to the transformation zone and prominent intestinal metaplasia. In both, the cells showed voluminous cytoplasm containing gastric-type mucin, stained red by combined alcian blue/periodic acid-Schiff stain. Immunohistochemically, both lesions were positive for HIK1083 and p53, while negative for p16 and ER. Human papilloma virus (HPV) DNA was not detected by polymerase chain reaction. Our cases illustrate that gastric-type AIS can occur without lobular endocervical glandular hyperplasia. The lesions can occur in the outer cervical canal and present extensive intestinal differentiation. Awareness of this rare type of endocervical glandular lesion is important since they are pathogenetically different from the more common HPV-associated lesions and may become more prevalent in the HPV-eradicating era.
27333137	[Opportunistic screening versus missed opportunities: non-adherence to Pap smear testing in women attending prenatal care].	The objectives were to estimate the prevalence of non-adherence to Pap smear testing in women attending prenatal care and to identify associated factors. This was a cross-sectional population-based study in 308 women from a rural municipality (county) in Minas Gerais State, Brazil. Complex stratified cluster sampling was used. Statistical analysis used the chi-square test and logistic regression model with the variables that presented p-value </= 0.05 in the bivariate model. Prevalence of lack of Pap smear test was 21.3%. Among women 25 years or older, prevalence was 15.1%. Non-adherence was more common in young, single women and those with low schooling. Low schooling remained associated with non-performance of Pap smear (OR = 0.41), indicating that women with more schooling enjoyed higher odds of testing. Contact with the prenatal clinic did not determine guaranteed access to the test, thus indicating missed opportunities when opportunistic screening is employed.
27331927	Cystic Cervicitis: A Case Report and Literature Review of Cystic Cervical Lesions.	We present a case of a 30-year-old woman who, while undergoing infertility evaluation, was found to have a large cystic cervical mass, shown to be cystic cervicitis on cervical cone biopsy. Differential diagnosis for benign cystic cervical lesions includes Nabothian cysts, tunnel cluster, endocervical hyperplasia, and cervicitis, whereas cystic cervical malignancies include adenocarcinoma and adenoma malignum. While it is crucial to differentiate benign from malignant lesions, imaging characteristics often overlap and may not provide a specific diagnosis. In difficult cases, definitive diagnosis should be based on clinical presentation and cervical biopsy.
27329200	Neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgery has no therapeutic advantages over concurrent chemoradiotherapy in International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage IB-IIB cervical cancer.	OBJECTIVE: We aimed to assess the efficacy of neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgery (NACT+S), and compared the clinical outcome with that of concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) in patients with International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) IB-IIB cervical cancer. METHODS: We reviewed 85 patients with FIGO IB-IIB cervical cancer who received NACT+S between 1989 and 2012, and compared them to 358 control patients who received CCRT. The clinical application of NACT was classified based on the following possible therapeutic benefits: increasing resectability after NACT by reducing tumor size or negative conversion of node metastasis; downstaging adenocarcinoma regarded as relatively radioresistant; and preservation of fertility through limited surgery after NACT. RESULTS: Of 85 patients in the NACT+S group, the pathologic downstaging and complete response rates were 68.2% and 22.6%, respectively. Only two young patients underwent limited surgery for preservation of fertility. Patients of the NACT+S group were younger, less likely to have node metastasis, and demonstrated a higher proportion of FIGO IB cases than those of the CCRT group (p</=0.001). The 5-year locoregional control, progression-free survival, and overall survival rates in the NACT+S group were 89.7%, 75.6%, and 92.1%, respectively, which were not significantly different from the rates of 92.5%, 74%, and 84.9% observed in the CCRT group, respectively (p>0.05). CONCLUSION: NACT+S has no therapeutic advantages over CCRT, the standard treatment. Therefore, NACT+S should be considered only in selected patients through multidisciplinary discussion or clinical trial setting.
27329199	Immunotherapy for human papillomavirus-associated disease and cervical cancer: review of clinical and translational research.	Cervical cancer is the fourth most lethal women's cancer worldwide. Current treatments against cervical cancer include surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and anti-angiogenic agents. However, despite the various treatments utilized for the treatment of cervical cancer, its disease burden remains a global issue. Persistent infection of human papillomavirus (HPV) has been identified as an essential step of pathogenesis of cervical cancer and many other cancers, and nation-wide HPV screening as well as preventative HPV vaccination program have been introduced globally. However, even though the commercially available prophylactic HPV vaccines, Gardasil (Merck) and Cervarix (GlaxoSmithKline), are effective in blocking the entry of HPV into the epithelium of cervix through generation of HPV-specific neutralizing antibodies, they cannot eliminate the pre-existing HPV infection. For these reason, other immunotherapeutic options against HPV-associated diseases, including therapeutic vaccines, have been continuously explored. Therapeutic HPV vaccines enhance cell-mediated immunity targeting HPV E6 and E7 antigens by modulating primarily dendritic cells and cytotoxic T lymphocyte. Our review will cover various therapeutic vaccines in development for the treatment of HPV-associated lesions and cancers. Furthermore, we will discuss the potential of immune checkpoint inhibitors that have recently been adopted and tested for their treatment efficacy against HPV-induced cervical cancer.
27328497	Prevalence of abnormal oral cytology and impact of sexual behavior in women with abnormal cervical cytology.	UNLABELLED: PURPOSE OFINVESTIGATION: To assess the frequency of oral cytological abnormalities in women who have cervical intraepithelial lesions, and transmission of infection depending on their sexual behavior. The authors also aimed to investigate the oral cytological changes in male partners. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Thirty patients with abnormal cervical cytological results via punch biopsy formed the case group, and 68 patients constituted the control group with normal cervical smear results. The Bethesda system was used for classification of the cytological alterations. RESULTS: Oral dysplasia was significantly higher in the squamous intraepithelial lesion (SIL) group. Oral sex percentage was 43.3% in SIL group, whereas it was 19.1% in the control group. History of genital warts in women with SIL was also significantly higher in the case group. Three patients were diagnosed with abnormal oral cytology in the SIL group (10%), however abnormal oral cytology was not detected in the control group. No oral dysplastic changes was identified in the male partners of women with oral lesions. CONCLUSION: The authors detected oral dysplastic changes in the SIL group, especially in the (low grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LGSIL) patients. Interestingly they could not find any oral dysplastic changes in the male partners of the study population.
27328491	The chemosensitizing effect of aqueous extract of sweet fennel on cisplatin treated HeLa cells.	BACKGROUND: Cisplatin is an important chemotherapeutic agent that is widely used in treatment of several malignancies, but its side effects on normal tissues and organs limit its use. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of aqueous extract of sweet fennel alone and in combination with cisplatin on human cervical cancer adenocarcinoma cell line (HeLa cells) searching for an effective, inexpensive therapy with minimal side effects. MATERIALS AND METHODS: HeLa cell line was used to study the cytotoxic effect of different concentrations of the aqueous extract of sweet fennel alone and in combination with 50 mug/ml cisplatin. Quantitative measure of drug interaction was quantified by the combination index. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) were used to analyze the sweet fennel decoction. MTT assay was used to examine cell viability percentage. Electron microscopy was applied to study the ultrastructure of the cells. RESULTS: The phenyl propanoids (23%) and phenols (12%) constituted the highest percentage of the aqueous extract. Increasing the concentration of sweet fennel from 50 mug/ml to 80 mug/ml, decreased the percentage of the cell viability of HeLa cells from 86.74% to 78.28%, respectively. Further decrease to 11.31% was demonstrated when 50 mug/ml of fennel was combined with 50 mug/ml cisplatin (additive effect). In addition to the signs of apoptosis observed in HeLa cells at 50 mug/ml of fennel, disruption of both nuclear and cytoplasmic membranes and presence of autophagolysosomes were noticed at a dose of 80 mug/ml. Combination of 50 mug/ml of cisplatin with 60, 70, and 80 mug/ml of sweet fennel revealed no significant difference in comparison to cisplatin alone. The combination with 50 mug/ml of sweet fennel revealed marked vacuolization of the cytoplasm, fragmentation of the nucleus, and complete disruption of nuclear membrane. CONCLUSIOn: Combination of cisplatin and the 50 mug/ml of the fennel could enhance cervical cancer growth inhibition. This combination could be effective in lowering the dose of single or repeated cumulative courses of cisplatin and hence decreases its hazardous side effects. In vivo studies and the evaluation of different combination doses of cisplatin and sweet fennel are recommended.
27323894	Base excision repair pathway: PARP1 genotypes as modulators of therapy response in cervical cancer patients.	CONTEXT: Genetic polymorphisms in genes of the base excision repair (BER) pathway appear to modulate the therapy response of cancer patients. PARP1 protein recognizes the DNA strand damage and facilitates the subsequent recruitment of BER proteins. Few studies have reported an association between PARP1 Val762Ala polymorphism (rs1136410) and cancer therapy response. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of our study was to determine whether PARP1 Val762Ala polymorphism have prognostic value in patients with cervical cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two hundred and sixty adult patients, with histologically confirmed cervical cancer, at FIGO-stages IB2-IVA, primarily treated with concurrent chemotherapy (cisplatin) and radiotherapy. Overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were the primary end points of the analysis. The PARP1 Val762Ala genetic variants were analyzed by allelic discrimination by real-time PCR. RESULTS: We observed that peri- and postmenopausal women carrying the C-allele present a statistically significant lower OS and DFS (log-rank test, p = 0.008 and p = 0.006, respectively) among those with early stage cervical cancer. Cox regression analysis confirmed these results, after adjustment for other prognostic factors (for OS: HR, 3.70; 95%CI, 1.32-10.38; p = 0.013 and for DFS: HR, 3.97; 95%CI, 1.59-9.93; p = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study evaluating the effect of PARP1 Val762Ala polymorphism in treatment response in cervical cancer patients. PARP1 genotypes may contribute as an independent prognostic factor in cervical cancer, being useful in predicting the clinical outcome.
27323178	Expression and clinical implications of enhancer of Zeste homolog 2 and p53 protein in squamous cell carcinoma and precancerous lesions in the cervix.	We investigated the expression and clinical implications of enhancer of Zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) and p53 protein in cervical squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and precancerous lesions. EZH2 and p53 expressions in SCC (168), cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN)-I (19), CIN-II (35), and normal tissues (30) were detected by streptavidin-peroxidase-conjugation. The correlation between co-expression of EZH2 and p53 protein and the clinic pathological features and prognosis of SCC were discussed. The positive expression rates of EZH2 and p53 were 6.7, 37.0, and 75.6%, and 3.3, 21.1, and 39.3% in normal cervical tissues, CIN, and SCC, respectively, which were significantly different (P < 0.05). The positive expression rate of EZH2 and p53 protein in SCC patients with and without lymph node metastasis was 82.9 and 70.4% (EZH2) and 45.7 and 34.7% (p53), respectively, which was also a significant difference (P < 0.05). The progression-free survival (PFS) rates in followed-up patients (N = 143) who were EZH2- and p53-negative, EZH2- or p53-positive, and EZH2- and p53-positive were 71.3 +/- 1.9, 66.1 +/- 2.0, and 51.3 +/- 3.8 months, respectively, which was a significant difference (P < 0.001); the overall survival among these groups was 72.9 +/- 1.1, 68.6 +/- 1.8, and 57.4 +/- 3.4 months, respectively (P < 0.001). Multivariate analyses revealed that EZH2 expression, lymph node metastasis, and tumor staging were independent prognostic factors of SCC. EZH2 and p53, which affect lymph node metastasis and prognosis of SCC, may play a key role in the occurrence and development of SCC.
27321030	PET Imaging Toward Individualized Management of Urologic and Gynecologic Malignancies.	Advances in the understanding of cellular and molecular basis of tumor progression have spurred interest in the development of new targeted agents that are changing the therapeutic management of patients with cancer. In parallel to progression in the therapeutic area, new PET radiopharmaceuticals are being developed to guide the use of such targeted therapies. This article aims to give an overview on the role of PET imaging in the individualized management of patients affected by urologic and gynecologic malignancies, focusing on the most promising targets for therapies and for molecular imaging using PET.
27320891	[Effects of docosahexaenoic acid on cell apoptosis, invasion and migration of cervical cancer cells in vitro].	OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) on apoptosis, migration and invasion of cervical cancer cell lines. METHODS: cervical cancer cell lines Hela and Siha in logarithmic phase were treated different concentrations of DHA. The morphological changes of the cells were observed microscopically and cell apoptosis was observed using Hoechst 33258 fluorescent staining. MTT assay was used to evaluate the effect of DHA in suppressing cell growth, and flow cytometry was employed to analyze the changes of cell apoptotic rate following DHA stimulations. Wound healing assay and Transwell migration assay were used to evaluate the migration of the cell lines. The expression levels of Bax, Bcl-2 cleaved caspase3, MMP-9 and VEGF proteins were detected by Western blotting. RESULTS: DHA exposure of the cells caused obvious morphological changes and dose-dependently increased the number of apoptotic bodies in the cells. MTT assay showed that DHA inhibited the growth of the cancer cells in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. DHA also effectively suppressed migration and invasion of the cancer cells. The cells exposed to DHA showed significantly down-regulation of Bcl-2, MMP-9 and VEGF proteins and up-regulation of cleaved-caspase 3 and Bax. CONCLUSION: DHA can promote cervical carcinoma cell apoptosis by down-regulating the anti-apoptotic proteins Bax, Bcl-2 and cleaved-caspase3 and suppress cell invasion by decreasing MMP-9 and VEGF expressions.
27318567	Enhanced electrochemical sensing of leukemia cells using drug/lipid co-immobilized on the conducting polymer layer.	Electrochemical biosensors using five anticancer drug and lipid molecules attached on the conducting polymer layer to obtain the orientation of drug molecules toward cancer cells, were evaluated as sensing materials and their performances were compared. Conjugation of the drug molecules with a lipid, phosphatidylcholine (PC) has enhanced the sensitivity towards leukemia cells and differentiates cancer cells from normal cells. The composition of each layer of sensor probe was confirmed by electrochemical and surface characterization experiments. Both impedance spectroscopy and voltammetry show the enhanced interaction of leukemia cells using the drug/lipid modified sensor probe. As the number of leukemia cells increased, the charge transfer resistance (Rct) in impedance spectra increased and the amine oxidation peak current of drug molecules in voltammograms decreased at around 0.7-1.0V. Of test drug molecules, raltitrexed (Rtx) showed the best performance for the cancer cells detection. Cancer and normal cell lines from different origins were examined to evaluate the degree of expression of folate receptors (FR) on cells surface, where cervical HeLa cell line was found to be shown the highest expression of the receptor. Impedance and chronoamperometric experiments for leukemia cell line (Jurkat E6-1) showed linear dynamic ranges of 1.0x10(3)-2.5x10(5) cells/mL and 1.0x10(3)-8.0x10(3) cells/mL with detection limits of 68+/-5 cells/mL and 21+/-3 cells/mL, respectively.
27318493	Endometrial and cervical cancer patients with multiple sentinel lymph nodes at laparoscopic ICG mapping: How many are enough?	PURPOSE: The adoption of a sentinel lymph node (SLN) algorithm and the presence of high bilateral detection rates have been associated with increased accuracy of SLN mapping in cervical and endometrial cancer patients. In this context, the significance of the number of SLNs removed has not yet been investigated. The aim of this study was to evaluate (a) whether or not a higher SLN removal count is associated with a reduced false-negative rate and (b) which clinical factors correlate with the number of SLNs removed. METHODS: Patients with cervical or endometrial cancer who underwent SLN mapping with bilateral SLN detection followed by lymphadenectomy were evaluated retrospectively. On the basis of the mean number of the SLNs removed, the patients were divided in two groups: Group 1 included patients with up to 3 SLNs removed and Group 2 included patients with more than 3 SLNs removed. Factors predicting a higher SLN count were evaluated using univariate and multivariate analysis. RESULTS: Eighty-four patients met the inclusion criteria. The two groups consisted of 42 patients each and differed only by the median SLN count. Two endometrial cancer patients in Group 1 had false-negative pelvic SLNs and isolated para-aortic metastases; no false-negative SLNs were recorded in Group 2 (p = n.s.). The results of multivariate analysis indicted that the number of SLNs removed was influenced only in cases where the operating surgeon had performed more than 20 laparoscopic ICG SLN mappings. CONCLUSIONS: A higher SLN count does not seem to increase the accuracy of SLN mapping in cervical and endometrial cancer patients.
27316707	Capability of leaf interdigitation with different inverse planning strategies in Monaco: an investigation of representative tumour sites.	PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to experimentally assess the dosimetric impact of leaf interdigitation using different inverse treatment strategies for representative tumour sites and to identify the situations in which leaf interdigitation can benefit these tumour sites. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Sixty previously treated patients (15 nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), 15 multiple brain metastasis (MBM), 15 cervical cancer and 15 prostate cancer) were re-planned for volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT), sliding window IMRT (dMLC) and step-and-shoot IMRT (ssIMRT) with and without leaf interdigitation. Various dosimetric variables, such as PTV coverage, OARs sparing, delivery efficiency and planning time, were evaluated for each plan. In addition, a protocol developed by our group was applied to identify the situations in which leaf interdigitation can achieve benefits in clinical practice. RESULTS: Leaf interdigitation produced few benefits in PTV homogeneity for the MBM VMAT plans and NPC ssIMRT plans. For OARs, sparing was equivalent with and without leaf interdigitation. Leaf interdigitation showed an increase in MUs for dMLC plans and a decrease in MUs for ssIMRT plans. Leaf interdigitation resulted in an increase in segments for dMLC plans and a decrease in segments for NPC and MBM ssIMRT plans. For beam on time, leaf interdigitation showed an increase in MBM dMLC, NPC ssIMRT and prostate ssIMRT plans. In addition, leaf interdigitation saved planning time for VMAT and dMLC plans but increased planning time for ssIMRT plans. CONCLUSION: Leaf interdigitation does not improve plan quality when performing inverse treatment strategies, regardless of whether the target is simple or complex. However, it influences the delivery efficiency and planning time. Based on these observations, our study suggests that leaf interdigitation should be utilized when performing MBM VMAT plans and NPC ssIMRT plans.
27313455	Chimeric HBcAg virus-like particles presenting a HPV 16 E7 epitope significantly suppressed tumor progression through preventive or therapeutic immunization in a TC-1-grafted mouse model.	BACKGROUND: Therapeutic human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines are currently being developed. However, no therapeutic efficacy has been achieved in clinical trials for the treatment of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia or cancer. One of the important issues in increasing vaccine efficacy is determining the best way to enhance tumor antigen-specific cellular immune responses. This study aimed to explore the virus-like particles (VLPs) of hepatitis B core antigen (HBcAg) as potential therapeutic vaccine carriers and to assess its immunological characteristics. METHODS: Chimeric VLPs presenting a HPV 16 cytotoxic T lymphocytes epitope E749-57 (amino acid 49-57 of the E7 protein) were prepared using recombinant genes. C57BL/6 mice were immunized with VLPs and grafted with tumor cells TC-1 which is an E7-expressing tumorigenic cell line. The dynamic tumor growth was monitored and anti-tumor immune responses were investigated. RESULTS: Using a preventive strategy, immunization with VLPs resulted in nearly complete suppression of tumor growth. In treatment studies, VLP immunization significantly suppressed the tumor progression in mice carrying 2-3 mm tumors and in those bearing even larger tumors with diameters up to 8-9 mm. The VLP structure was shown to be important to induce vigorous antitumor immunity and effects. In immunized mice, enhanced E749-57-specific cellular immune responses were evidenced by increased interferon (IFN)-gamma expression and decreased interleukin (IL)-4 expression in splenic lymphocytes, as well as an elevated number of effector cells expressing IFN-gamma in response to the in vitro stimulation of the specific peptide E749-57. In addition, effective immune memory after VLP immunization was maintained for at least 16 weeks, preventing significant tumor growth after subsequent TC-1 challenge. CONCLUSION: While VLPs were highly immunogenic in stimulating humoral immunity, our results strongly indicated that VLPs, such as HBcAg particles, might also be potent therapeutic vaccine carriers to elicit robust cellular immune responses, even in the immunosuppressive microenvironment of a tumor.
27313335	Immunohistochemical Expression of VEGF and Podoplanin in Uterine Cervical Squamous Intraepithelial Lesions.	VEGF and podoplanin (PDPN) have been identified as angiogenesis and/or lymphangiogenesis regulators and might be essential to restrict tumor growth, progression, and metastasis. In the present study, we evaluate the association between the expression of these markers and CIN grade. Immunohistochemistry was performed in 234 uterine cervical samples using conventional histologic sections or TMA with the monoclonal antibodies to VEGF (C-1 clone) and podoplanin (D2-40 clone). Positive-staining rates of VEGF in 191 CIN specimens were significantly associated with histological grade (P < 0.001). Negative and/or focal immunostaining for PDPN were more frequent in CIN 3 (P = 0.016). We found that patients with CIN 3 more frequently had strong and more diffuse staining for VEGF and diminished staining for PDPN (P = 0.018). Strong and more diffuse VEGF immunoexpressions in CIN 2 and CIN 3 were detected when compared to CIN 1. Negative and/or focal PDPN immunoexpression appear to be more frequent in CIN 3. Moderate to strong VEGF expression may be a tendency among patients with high-grade lesions and diminished PDPN expression.
27311570	The expression and prognostic value of protein tyrosine kinase 6 in early-stage cervical squamous cell cancer.	BACKGROUND: Protein tyrosine kinase 6 (PTK6) is overexpressed in many epithelial tumors and predicts poor prognosis. However, PTK6 expression status and its role in cervical squamous cell cancer are unknown. This study aimed to investigate the expression level and clinical significance of PTK6 in early-stage cervical squamous cell cancer. METHODS: Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and western blotting analysis were performed to detect PTK6 mRNA and protein expression levels in 10 freshly frozen, early-stage cervical squamous cell cancer specimens and adjacent non-tumorous cervical tissues. The expression of PTK6 was detected using immunohistochemical staining in 150 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded, early-stage cervical squamous cell cancer sections and 10 normal cervical tissue sections. RESULTS: The mRNA and protein levels of PTK6 in cancer tissues were higher than those in adjacent non-tumorous cervical tissues. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that PTK6 was not expressed in normal cervical tissues but was overexpressed in the cytoplasm of cervical squamous cell cancer cells. The level of PTK6 expression was significantly associated with tumor grade (P = 0.020). The 5-year overall survival rate of patients with high PTK6 expression was lower than that of patients with low PTK6 expression (81.3% vs. 96.2%, P = 0.008). Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that the expression level of PTK6 in cervical squamous cell cancer was an independent prognostic factor for patient survival (hazard ratio = 5.999, 95% confidence interval 1.622-22.191, P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: PTK6 is overexpressed in cervical squamous cell cancer. Increased PTK6 expression is associated with reduced 5-year overall survival. PTK6 expression is an independent prognostic predictor for cervical cancer.
27311164	[Risk factors associated with breast cancer women's in Durango, Mexico].	BACKGROUND: Breast cancer is a public health problem worldwide and is a priority for developing countries like ours, to establish preventive and early detection measures. In Mexico since 2006 breast cancer than cervical cancer as a cause of death in women aged 30-54 years and threatens all socioeconomic groups. The known risk factors for the occurrence of this neoplasm are early menarche, nulliparity, late age parity and late menopause and family history of breast cancer. OBJECTIVE: To determine the risk factors associated with breast cancer in women in the State of Durango. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Epidemiological study of 50 cases and 100 con- trols aged between 35 and 69 years old. For the calculation of sample size Schlesselman tables were used. The data was collected and analyzed in SPSS V15. We used descriptive statistics and odds ratio was calculated. RESULTS: Age had a mean of 50.60 years and a deviation +/-9,599 for cases and 50.73 (SD +/- 10.08) for controls. The hereditary familial history of breast cancer OR = 5.182 (Cl 1694-15855), higher age at first pregnancy at 30 years of age OR = 3.582 (95% CI .1.121-11.439). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that reproductive and hereditary familial history may influence the development of breast cancer, which is a multifactorial disease.
27310550	Cervical cancer: Renal complications and survival after percutaneous nephrostomy.	INTRODUCTION: Obstructive nephropathy is a frequent complication in the course of advanced cervical cancer (CC), and ultrasonography-guided percutaneous nephrostomy (PCN) is a well established technique for fast ureteral desobstruction. OBJECTIVE: To identify possible factors related to the survival and quality of life of patients with advanced CC presenting acute urinary obstructive complications that after desobstruction by PCN recovered urinary flux and renal function. METHOD: This is an analytical, descriptive, cross-sectional study that included 45 patients with CC who underwent PCN and were divided into 2 groups: "death" (DG) and "survival" (SG), in a public hospital that is reference for oncologic diseases in Northern Brazil. RESULTS: The mean serum creatinine of the patients preceding PCN was >10 mg/dL, and after PCN <2 mg/dL. The cutoffs of 8.7 g/dL for Hb (p=0.0241) and 27% for Ht (p=0.0065) indicated the values that better discriminate the outcomes of the groups. The presence of low blood pressure was statistically correlated (p=0.0037) to the outcome "death". Changes in glomerular filtration rate (already reduced in all cases) were not associated to the levels of Hb/Ht or to the outcome "death" during the nephrological follow-up. CONCLUSION: PCN was responsible for the recovery of renal function in 61.7% of the patients, leading to interruption of renal replacement therapy (RRT) in all of those patients. Hb levels >8.7g/dL and Ht >27% were associated to longer survival, and the presence of low blood pressure during follow-up was associated with progression to death.
27302628	A dosimetric evaluation of IGART strategies for cervix cancer treatment.	PURPOSE: Image guided adaptive radiotherapy (IGART) strategies can be used to include the temporal aspects of radiotherapy treatment. A dosimetric evaluation of on- and off-line adaptive strategies are done in this study. METHODS: A library of equivalent uniform dose (EUD)-based Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy Treatment plans with incrementally increasing clinical target volume (CTV)-to-planning target volume (PTV) margins were developed for 10 patients. Utilizing daily computed tomography (CT) images an on-line strategy using a margin-of-the-day (MOD) concept that selects the best plan from the library was employed. This was compared to an off-line strategy with full analysis of accumulated dose between fractions where dosimetric deviations from the treatment intent triggered plan adaptation. A fixed margin treatment approach was used as benchmark. RESULTS: Using fixed margins of <15mm lead to under-dosages of more than 5Gy in total delivered dose. The average CTV EUD for the off-line and on-line strategy was 50.0+/-5.0Gy and 50.4+/-2.0Gy respectively and OAR doses were comparable. CONCLUSION: A fixed margin treatment approach yields a significant probability of CTV under-dosage. Using EUD dose metrics CTV coverage can be restored in both the off-line and on-line adaptive strategies at acceptable OAR dose levels. Considering the workload and time on the treatment machine, the off-line strategy proves to be sufficient and more practical.
27301520	Brachial Diparesis due to Motor Neuronopathy as One of the Predominant Presenting Signs of Occult Small Cell Lung Carcinoma.	Sensory neuronopathy is a well-established presentation in paraneoplastic neurological syndromes that is mostly associated with small cell lung cancer and anti-Hu antibodies. Motor neuronopathy, on the other hand, is an extremely rare observation in this syndrome. A 56-year-old man presented with asymmetric brachial diparesis and sensory ataxia. Electrophysiological studies revealed sensory ganglionopathy and progressive anterior horn degeneration in cervical segments. Small cell lung carcinoma with associated anti-Hu antibodies was later diagnosed. The patient did not improve despite the administration of steroids and chemotherapy. Paraneoplastic syndromes may exceptionally present with a bilateral arm weakness. Cases accompanied by sensory ganglionopathy should therefore be promptly investigated for any underlying malignancy.
27301192	Aptamer Functionalized Cisplatin-Albumin Nanoparticles for Targeted Delivery to Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Positive Cervical Cancer.	Targeted nanocarriers may offer a new approach to improve the efficacy and tolerability of cisplatin, which are commonly used to treat cancers as a first line chemotherapy for most types of cancer. In the present study, we have developed EGFR-targeted albumin-cisplatin nanoparticles for tumor targeted delivery of cisplatin. The cisplatin NPs were conjugated with EGFR aptamer, which binded to Hela cells specifically, then taken up by tumor cells through receptor mediated endocytosis. The aptamers accumulate in the tumor and interact with the receptor on the surface of Hela cells, successfully blocked EGF-induced EGFR phosphorylation, exerting its targeting and therapy function. Here we demonstrate that the EGFR aptamer functioned NPs enhanced in vitro antitumor effects and markedly improved its tolerability and in vivo efficacy when compared with free cisplatin and other single treatment. Furthermore, the Apt-Pt NPs treatment resulted in reduced systemic and nephrotoxicity, validated by decreased biodistribution of platinum in the major organs as quantified by ICP-MS. The Apt-Pt NPs provides a remarkable improvement in the drug therapeutic efficacy and tolerability in vivo, and will be generalized as a principle for development of novel nanocarriers for targeted tumor therapy.
27300513	Human papillomavirus E6 and E7 oncoproteins affect the expression of cancer-related microRNAs: additional evidence in HPV-induced tumorigenesis.	PURPOSE: Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are the causative agents of cervical cancer and are also associated with other types of cancers. HPVs can modulate microRNAs (miRNAs) expressed by infected cells. The production of extracellular vesicles is deregulated in cancer, and their cargo delivered to the microenvironment can promote tumorigenesis. The involvement of HPV oncoproteins on miRNA expression in cells and exosomes was analyzed in keratinocytes transduced with E6 and E7 from mucosal HPV-16 or cutaneous HPV-38 (K16 and K38). METHODS: MiRNAs were investigated through the TaqMan Array Human MicroRNA Cards, followed by real-time RT-PCR assay for specific miRNAs. Selected miRNA targets were analyzed by Western blot and correlated to the HPV oncoproteins by specifically silencing E6 and E7 expression. Exosomes, isolated from K16 and K38 supernatants by differential centrifugations, were quantified through the vesicle-associated acetylcholinesterase activity. RESULTS: MiRNAs deregulated in K16 and K38 cells were identified. HPV-16 and/or HPV-38 E6 and E7 single proteins can modify the expression of selected miRNAs involved in the tumorigenesis, in particular miR-18a, -19a, -34a and -590-5p. The analysis of the content of exosomes isolated from HPV-positive cells revealed the presence of E6 and E7 mRNAs and few miRNAs. MiR-222, a key miRNA deregulated in many cancers, was identified in exosomes from K16 cells. CONCLUSIONS: HPV E6 and/or E7 oncoprotein expression can induce the deregulation of some miRNAs. Through the production and function of exosomes, HPV oncogenes as well as HPV-deregulated miRNAs can potentiate the virus oncogenic effects in the tumor cell microenvironment.
27299910	[Feasibility of cervical smear in HIV-positive women living in Chad].	Cervical cancer is the leading cause of cancerrelated death in Sub-Saharan African women. HIV-infected women are at increased risk for cervical intraepithelial lesions and invasive cervical cancer. WHO guidelines for screening and treatment of precancerous cervical lesions are regularly actualized. There are no data on cervical squamous intraepithelial lesions in Chad. Between August 2013 and May 2015, screening for cervical squamous intraepithelial lesions was proposed to HIV-infected women living in Moundou (Chad). Cytology examination was performed after with Papanicolaou coloration. Three hundred and eleven HIV-seropositive women accepted the screening without refusal. Mean age of the patients was 38 years (95% Confidence Interval: 37.7-39.9). The women declared a mean of 4.1 pregnancies (range: 0-12). The patients had been followed-up for their seropositivity for 8 years (range: 0-25). All were on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Of the patients whose results were known (N = 231), 98% had a CD4 lymphocyte nadir count less than 350/mm(3). Cytological results were as follows: normal smear (N = 59; 19%), inflammatory or hemorrhagic smear (N = 139; 44%), low grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (N = 58; 19%), high grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (N = 28; 9%), epidermoid carcinoma (N = 13; 4%), and uninterpretable smear (N = 14; 5%). The inflammatory lesions were due to cervicitis (N = 54), vaginosis (N = 22), and trichomonas infection (N = 3). The patients' age, CD4 lymphocyte nadir count, and CD4 count at the time of the cervical smear were not different according to the cytological results. Only five patients had a cone biopsy. Three patients deceased during the study of whom two from a gynaecological cancer diagnosed too late. The screening of dysplasia and cervical cancer in HIV-seropositive women is possible in Chad. In our study, 13% of the women had highgrade dysplasia or carcinoma needing curative care. We also showed that simple cytology did not permit the interpretation of half of the smears. The performance of cervical smear would have increased if it had been preceded by the visualization of the cervix with coloration.
27298758	Automatic Detection of Cervical Cancer Cells by a Two-Level Cascade Classification System.	We proposed a method for automatic detection of cervical cancer cells in images captured from thin liquid based cytology slides. We selected 20,000 cells in images derived from 120 different thin liquid based cytology slides, which include 5000 epithelial cells (normal 2500, abnormal 2500), lymphoid cells, neutrophils, and junk cells. We first proposed 28 features, including 20 morphologic features and 8 texture features, based on the characteristics of each cell type. We then used a two-level cascade integration system of two classifiers to classify the cervical cells into normal and abnormal epithelial cells. The results showed that the recognition rates for abnormal cervical epithelial cells were 92.7% and 93.2%, respectively, when C4.5 classifier or LR (LR: logical regression) classifier was used individually; while the recognition rate was significantly higher (95.642%) when our two-level cascade integrated classifier system was used. The false negative rate and false positive rate (both 1.44%) of the proposed automatic two-level cascade classification system are also much lower than those of traditional Pap smear review.
27297278	Evaluation of cervical and anal intraepithelial neoplasia in women attending a sexually transmitted infection clinic.	BACKGROUND: The incidence of anal and cervical cancers and their precursors have increased in the past decades. Women with HIV and sexually transmitted infections are at a higher risk. Cervical human papilloma virus infection may serve as a reservoir and source of anal infection or vice versa. A higher incidence of anal cytological abnormality has been observed in patients with abnormal cervical cytology. OBJECTIVES: This cross sectional study was designed to estimate the prevalence and associations of anal and cervical cytological abnormalities in a cohort of sexually active women using Papanicolaou smears. METHODS: We conducted a single centre study of 35 consecutive HIV positive and 40 HIV negative women attending the sexually transmitted infection clinic. Cervical and anal specimens were obtained for cytology after a detailed history and examination. Chi square test and coefficient of correlation were used for comparison. RESULTS: Cervical dysplasia was observed in 22.6% (17.3% low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion and 5.3% high grade squamous intraepithelial lesion) and anal dysplasia in 8% study subjects (6.7% low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion and 1.3% high grade squamous intraepithelial lesion); no association was observed with HIV infection. A higher number of patients with cervical dysplasia (29.4%) were found to have concomitant anal dysplasia (P = 0.002). History of anal intercourse was reported in all patients with anal dysplasia and was higher (P < 0.037) in patients with cervical dysplasia. LIMITATIONS: The limitations included a small sample size, lack of correlation with histological findings and bias due to STI clinic-based recruitment of the study population. CONCLUSION: Cytology may be used to screen for cervical and anal dysplasia in women irrespective of HIV status. Women with cervical dysplasia may be preferentially screened for anal dysplasia and vice versa. Anal intercourse may be a risk factor for anal and cervical dysplasia.
27296950	The Downregulation of MicroRNA-10b and its Role in Cervical Cancer.	It has been demonstrated that microRNAs (miRNAs) act as oncogenes or tumor suppressors in a variety of cancers. Our previous work suggested that miR-10a/b functioned as a tumor suppressor in gastric cancer, and miR-10b was also reported to be significantly downregulated in advanced stage cervical cancer tissues. However, the aberrant expression of miR-10b in cervical cancer and its possible role in cervical carcinogenesis was largely unknown. In this study, we investigated the expression of miR-10b in cervical cancer tissues, carcinoma in situ tissues, mild dysplasia, moderate dysplasia, severe dysplasia tissues, and normal controls. We found that miR-10b was significantly downregulated during cervical cancer progression, and the lower level of miR-10b in cervical cancer was significantly associated with a more aggressive tumor phenotype. Moreover, overexpression of miR-10b in cervical cancer cells could inhibit the cell proliferation and invasion, and the further mechanism study suggested that its role was possibly through directly targeting HOXA1. These results suggested that the downregulation of miR-10b and the resulting elevated HOXA1 level in cervical cancer tissues might play critical roles in cervical cancer progression.
27296359	Inhibitory effect of 13 taxane diterpenoids from Chinese yew (Taxus chinensis var. mairei) on the proliferation of HeLa cervical cancer cells.	The inhibitory effect of 13 taxanes isolated from the Chinese yew (Taxus chinensis var. mairei) on the proliferation of human cervical cancer HeLa cells were examined using an MTT assay. Four compounds having a hydrophobic cinnamate side chain showed antiproliferative activity, which may be due to increased cell permeability.
27295810	Incidence of Hydronephrosis in Cervical Cancer Patients in A Tertiary Hospital Lagog, Nigeria.	BACKGROUND: Cervical cancer is still a global health challenge that affects women of reproductive age group and consequently causes a drawback on the social and economic stability of nations. Developing countries suffer a greater burden of the disease because of several factors such as poverty, multiple sexual partners, unbalanced diet, poor knowledge and attitude to prevention of diseases and late-presentation. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to evaluate the incidence of hydronephrosis in cervical cancer patients in Lagos University Teaching Hospital (LUTH), Lagos, Nigeria for the period of 3 years (2010-2012). METHOD: This study is a cross sectional study carried out among cervical cancer patients seeking treatment in the Radiotherapy department of the Lagos University Teaching Hospital (LUTH), between the year 2010 and 2012, to find out the incidence of hydronephrosis using abdominopelvic ultrasonography. RESULTS: The incidence of hydronephrosis during the 3years period studied was 43.7%. A rise in the incidence of hydronephrosis of 5.4% in 2011 and 13.3% in 2012 was noted. The mean age of the patients was 55.5 years. 122 (56.7%) were grand multiparous and 123 (57.2%) had multiple sexual partners. An increase of 8.3% in 2011 and 9.3% in 2012 was noted in the incidence of cervical cancer cases studied. 107 (49.8%) presented at stages III and IV. CONCLUSION: Late presentation of patients is still a major challenge affecting treatment outcomes. The presence of hydronephrosis was noticed at staging, during or after treatment, resulting in the need to separate this population from current Stage IIIB classification. The presence of hydronephrosis may or may not be related to the disease and so adequate staging is important.
27294724	Associations of an abnormal Pap test result with attitudes and beliefs relevant to cervical cancer: a study of rural Appalachian women.	PURPOSE: To compare women who recall being informed of an abnormal Pap to those not having this experience relative to attitudes and beliefs pertaining to screening for cervical cancer. METHODS: Four hundred women were recruited from eight rural Appalachian counties, in 2013 and 2014. Women completed a paper-and-pencil survey after providing written informed consent. Bivariate associations and age-adjusted associations were calculated between the self-reported experience of being told of an abnormal Pap test result and eight attitudes/beliefs relative to the prevention of cervical cancer. Data analyses were performed in 2014. RESULTS: The mean age was 40.2 years (range 30-64 years). Eighteen women chose not to answer the question asking about ever having an abnormal Pap test result, leaving n = 382. Of the 382 women who did answer, 122 (30.6 %) indicated having an abnormal Pap test result and the remaining 260 (65.2 %) indicated never having this experience. With the exception of one item assessing knowledge that HPV is the cause of cervical cancer, between-group differences in attitudes, beliefs, and intent to have a Pap test the next time one is due were not observed. CONCLUSIONS: Although we hypothesized that women ever having an abnormal Pap test may have actively sought to learn more about cervical cancer and its prevention, findings suggest that this is not the case. Informing women of an abnormal result could be coupled with a high-intensity counseling designed to improve attitudes and beliefs relative to women's role in protecting themselves from cervical cancer.
27294605	SATB2 Expression Is Sensitive but Not Specific for Osteosarcomatous Components of Gynecologic Tract Carcinosarcomas: A Clinicopathologic Study of 60 Cases.	The novel marker special AT-rich sequence binding protein (SATB2) is highly sensitive for mesenchymal tumors with osteoblastic differentiation. However, SATB2 expression in gynecologic tract carcinosarcoma has not been previously explored. Given the potential prognostic and therapeutic implications of heterologous carcinosarcoma in the gynecologic tract, this study investigates the utility of SATB2 in identifying osteosarcomatous elements. A multi-institution database review identified consecutive cases of gynecologic tract carcinosarcoma including both heterologous and homologous types. Clinicopathologic parameters were recorded. Nuclear SATB2 immunoreactivity was scored from 1 representative whole-slide section from each case. Sixty gynecologic tract carcinosarcoma were identified (uterine corpus=47, ovary=11, fallopian tube=1, cervix=1) including 32 heterologous type (7 osteosarcoma, 3 mixed osteosarcoma/chondrosarcoma, 6 chondrosarcoma, 12 rhabdomyosarcoma, 4 mixed chondrosarcoma/rhabdomyosarcoma) and 28 homologous type. Patient ages ranged from 41 to 90 yr (average 67.9 yr). Mostly diffuse strong SATB2 positivity was present in 10/10 (100%) cases containing osteosarcoma. In these cases, SATB2 positivity was seen in malignant cells intimately associated with osteoid or bone [3/10 (30%) of these cases additionally showed patchy weak/moderate SATB2 staining in areas of nonosteogenic sarcoma elsewhere in the same tumor]. SATB2 positivity was present in 30/50 (60%) cases lacking osteosarcoma, predominantly as patchy moderate staining within undifferentiated sarcoma. No cases showed SATB2 positivity in chondrosarcoma or rhabdomyosarcoma components. SATB2 is a highly sensitive marker for osteosarcomatous differentiation in gynecologic tract carcinosarcoma, and is also highly specific when used to differentiate osteosarcoma from chondrosarcoma and rhabdomyosarcoma elements in these tumors. However, a positive SATB2 result may lack specificity for differentiating osteosarcoma from an undifferentiated sarcoma component.
27293491	Combined clinical and genetic testing algorithm for cervical cancer diagnosis.	BACKGROUND: Opportunistic screening in hospitals is widely used to effectively reduce the incidence rate of cervical cancer in China and other developing countries. This study aimed to identify clinical risk factor algorithms that combine gynecologic examination and molecular testing (paired box gene 1 (PAX1) or zinc finger protein 582 (ZNF582) methylation or HPV16/18) results to improve diagnostic accuracy. METHODS: The delta Cp of methylated PAX1 and ZNF582 was obtained via quantitative methylation-specific PCR in a training set (57 CIN2- and 43 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia >/=grade 3 (CIN3+) women), and the individual and combination gene sensitivities and specificities were determined. The detection accuracy of three algorithms combining gynecologic findings and genetic test results was then compared in a randomized case-control study comprising 449 women referred for colposcopic examination by gynecologists in the outpatient department of Xiangya Hospital between November 2011 and March 2013. RESULTS: Significant association was observed between CIN3+ and methylated PAX1 or ZNF582 in combination with HPV16/18 (OR:15.52, 95 % CI:7.73-31.18). The sensitivities and specificities of methylated PAX1 or ZNF582 combined with HPV16/18 for CIN3+ women were 89.2 and 76.0 %, or 85.4 and 80.1 %, respectively. Of the three algorithms applied to cohort data and validated in the study, two indicated 100 % sensitivity in detecting cervical cancer and a low rate of referrals for colposcopy. CONCLUSIONS: These algorithms might contribute to precise and objective cervical cancer diagnostics in the outpatient departments of hospitals in countries with high mortality and low screening rates or areas with uneven resource distribution.
27293315	Pleiotropic Effects of IL-2 on Cancer: Its Role in Cervical Cancer.	IL-2 receptor (IL-2R) signalling is critical for normal lymphocyte proliferation, but its role in cervical cancer is not fully understood. The receptor is composed of three chains: IL-2alpha, IL-2beta, and IL-2gamma. Intracellular signalling is initiated by ligand-induced heterodimerization of the IL-2beta and IL-2gamma chains, resulting in the activation of multiple intracellular kinases. Recently, IL-2R was shown to be expressed on nonhaematopoietic cells, especially on several types of tumour cells. However, the function of this receptor on malignant cells has not been clearly defined. The expression of IL-2R and the production of IL-2 in cervical cancer cells have been documented as well as expression of molecules of the JAK-STAT pathway. In the current review we have highlighted the differences in the responses of molecules downstream from the IL-2R in normal lymphocytes and tumour cells that could explain the presence of tumour cells in an environment in which cytotoxic lymphocytes also exist and compete and also the effect of different concentrations of IL-2 that could activate effector cells of the immune system cells, which favour the elimination of tumour cells, or concentrations that may promote a regulatory microenvironment in which tumour cells can easily grow.
27290836	[Recurrence of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia pre-conization with diathermic handle].	BACKGROUND: Cervical cancer is a major public health problem worldwide. In Mexico there are an estimated 50 cases per 100,000 women. Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) is a precursor of inva- sive cancer. Early detection and treatment of this condition lead to a cure rate close to 100%. OBJECTIVES: To know the percentage of patients who, following a loop diathermy conization, present premalignant lesion recurrence within a cyto-colpo-histological follow-up period of one year; to identify risk factors for patients with persistent lesions. METHODS: A descriptive, retrospective, observational and analytical study of cases and controls conducted at the Hospital General Dr. Miguel Silva in Morelia, Mexico from January 2012 to June 2014. The subjects were patients who had undergone diathermy loop conization due to intraepithelial lesions. RESULTS: The population was comprised of 251 patients, of whom 53 (21.1%) presented recurrence within a one-year follow-up period. The average period between the conization procedure and the diagnosis of a persistent lesion was 8.92 +/- 3.2 months. The average patient age was 36.1 +/- 7.49 in the group that presented post-procedure recurrence, while that of patients without recurrence was 39.1 +/- 7.58, with a p value of 0.025. The only risk factor that showed a statistically significant differ- ence was the persistence of oncogenic hybrids, with an odds ratio of 17.568 (8.33-37.02); p = 0.0001. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the high effectiveness of loop diathermy conization, cyto-colpo-histological follow-up is necessary owing to the high risk of persistent lesions.
27290832	[Citohistologic and colposcopic correlation in perimenopausal women].	OBJECTIVE: This study was conducted to compare the correlation between the Pap smear and colposcopy findings in postmenopausal Mexican women. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Observational, Retroelective, longitudinal, descriptive study, all menopausal women who consulted for pap smears and colposcopy performed was studied. RESULTS: 119 patients were evaluated. 72 % of pap smears were negative to human papilloma virus, 29 (24%) had a low-grade lesion and 4 (4%) had a high-grade lesions. In the colposcopic study: 31 studies (26%) report low-grade intraepithelial lesion and 2 cases (2%) high-grade lesion. The histopathological biopsy reported one invasive cervical cancer (2.43%) and 20 cases of low-grade lesions (48.7%). cytology had a sensitivity of 85.3% and specificity of 56.09% with a false negative rate of 14.3%, a positive predictive value of 66.03 % and a negative predictive value of 79.31%. Colposcopy: sensitivity= 82.92%, specificity = 56.09% with a false negative rate of 17.07% positive predictive value of 65.38% and a negative predictive value of 76.66%. CONCLUSIONS: The correlation between Pap smear and colposcopy shows that the diagnosis of low and high grade lesions differs only by 2%, therefore indicates adequate sensitivity for diagnosis. In this population of women routine gynecological tests most be performed.
27290805	[Urinary retention secoundary to cervical myoma large items].	OBJECTIVES: To describe the clinical-diagnostic importance of cystic appearance of a cervical myoma large elements result produced secondary METHOD: We described a case of a 40-year-old with abdominal discomfort producing difficulty walking, dyspareunia, urinary retention seven months of evolution. The USG diagnosis was a cystic mass consistent with a right ovarian cyst. The surgical abdominal total hysterectomy is performed. RESULTS: Histopathological study of approximately 1 3x6 cm uterus with myoma fund of approximately 4 cm and myoma level cervical posterior surface of 15x12 cm.
27290801	[Reprodcutive results of radical trachelectomy].	BACKGROUND: Historically, cervical cancer in early stages has been treated with radical hysterectomy and radiotherapy with no option in keeping the uterine-ovarian function. Since two decades ago, evidence shows these cases are candidates for radical trachelectomy, a procedure capable of preserving the fertility without affecting the oncological outcome. OBJECTIVE: To analyze reproductive results among patients treated with radical trachelectomy, in a reference center from the northeast of Mexico. MATERIAL AND METHOD: Between March 1999 and December 2013, 27 cases with cervical cancer in early stages were treated with vaginal or abdominal radical trachelectomy in the ISSSTE Regional Hospital in Monterrey, NL (Mexico). We obtained the gynecological, medical and surgical clinical history. Plan of analysis consisted of descriptive statistics. RESULTS: Age range was 27-39 years. Main complications were cervical stenosis (n=1) and erosion of cerclaje (n=2). Eighteen patients tried to get pregnant, 8 of them got a spontaneous pregnancy; 1 more patient required assisted reproduction technics and did not succeed. All pregnancies were delivered by cesarean section and were preterm births; 3 underwent premature rupture of membranes. Two pregnancies ended in abortion, one at 10 weeks with severe hemorrhage that needed hysterectomy; the second one, at 1 7 weeks, received a fine uterine curettage. Only 6 cases (33%) got a live birth. CONCLUSIONS: Only one third of the attempted pregnancies got a live birth. Assisted reproduction technics play an important role and should be offer to all cases. Cerclaje is an important factor to carry a pregnancy up to the third trimester.
27287497	Development and application of a rapid detection system for human papillomavirus and Herpes simplex virus-2 by loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay.	Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is an important factor that causes cervical cancer and non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC), while HSV-2 plays an important role when HR-HPV triggers the cancer. Thus, a quick and convenient assay in the detection of HPV and HSV-2in the screening of HPV and HSV-2 infection is required. Two respective HPV and HSV-2 detection methods were established based on loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay. Specific outer primers, inner primers, and loop primers were designed according to the conserved domains of HPV and HSV-2 genomes, respectively, while degenerate primers were used for HPV assay. After optimizing the reaction conditions, the results were observed by LAMP Tubidimeter real-time LA-320. Standard plasmids HPV-L-P and HSV-2-L-P were cloned and used in sensitivity tests of HPV LAMP and HSV-2 LAMP, respectively. Fifty samples of actinic keratosis (AK), 20 samples of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), 50 samples of basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and 20 samples of seborrheic keratosis (SK) were detected by HPV assay. Seventy three clinical samples of vaginitis, chronic cervicitis, cervical intraepithelial neoplasias and cervical cancer level positive were detected with HPV and HSV-2 assays. The reaction conditions of two assays were the same with a reaction temperature of 63 degrees C and a reaction time of 45 min. The sensitivity of HPV LAMP assay was 10 copies/muL, while that of the HSV-2 LAMP assay was 100 copies/muL. No cross-reactivity was observed. The HPV positive rates of AK, SCC, BCC and SK samples were 80% (40/50), 75% (15/20), 44% (22/50) and 21% (15/72), respectively. As an economic and quick diagnostic tool, LAMP assay is conducive to the extensive screening of HPV and HSV-2 and has huge potential to be promoted in resource-limited hospitals.
27287359	The Annual Gynecologic Examination Updated for the 21st Century.	The concept of an annual gynecologic screening visit to identify disease at an early stage has long been an established component of women's health care. Women and their health care providers have historically accepted the schedule of an annual gynecologic examination with cervical cancer screening and a pelvic examination. Recently, researchers questioned the value of the annual breast and pelvic examinations in asymptomatic women and re-established the intervals for Pap test screening with the addition of human papillomavirus co-testing to establish cervical cancer risk. The updated well woman examination is now an opportunity to engage women in health education, screening for chronic disease risks, and health care concerns such as depression and violence.
27287144	Milk-derived multi-fluorescent graphene quantum dot-based cancer theranostic system.	An economical green-chemistry approach was used for the synthesis of aqueous soluble graphene quantum dots (GQDs) from cow milk for simultaneous imaging and drug delivery in cancer. The GQDs synthesized using one-pot microwave-assisted heating were multi-fluorescent, spherical in shape having a lateral size of ca. 5nm. The role of processing parameters such as heating time and ionic strength showed a profound effect on photoluminescence properties of GQDs. The GQDs were N-doped and oxygen-rich as confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis. Cysteamine hydrochloride (Cys) was used to attach an anti-cancer drug berberine hydrochloride (BHC) on GQDs forming GQDs@Cys-BHC complex with c.a. 88% drug loading efficiency. In vitro drug release was studied at the acidic-basic environment and drug kinetics was studied using pharmacokinetic statistical models. The GQDs were biocompatible on L929 cells whereas theranostic GQDs@Cys-BHC complex showed a potent cytotoxic effect on different cancerous cell line models: cervical cancer cell lines such as HeLa cells and breast cancer cells such as MDA-MB-231 confirmed by Trypan blue and MTT-based cytotoxic assays. Furthermore, multi-excitation based cellular bioimaging was demonstrated using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) and fluorescence microscopy using GQDs as well as GQDs@Cys-BHC complex. Thus, drug delivery (therapeutic) and bioimaging (diagnostic) properties of GQDs@Cys-BHC complex are thought to have a potential in vitro theranostic application in cancer therapy.
27285816	Uptake and photo-toxicity of Foscan(R), Foslip(R) and Fospeg(R) in multicellular tumor spheroids.	In cancer photodynamic therapy (PDT), an efficient and homogeneous intratumoral accumulation of the photosensitizer (PS) is required to induce cell damages in the entire tumor mass after light activation. Thus, in this study we investigated penetration ability and photodynamic efficiency of meta-tetra(hydroxyphenyl)chlorin (m-THPC) in standard formulation (Foscan(R)) and in its non PEGylated and PEGylated liposomal formulations, Foslip(R) and Fospeg(R), in HeLa multicellular spheroids, as in vitro avascular models of solid tumors. Confocal microscopy studies demonstrated that m-THPC fluorescence was confined in the external cell layers of spheroids with a slightly higher accumulation of Foslip(R) and Fospeg(R) with respect to Foscan(R). Irradiation with red light, following 24h incubation of spheroids with the m-THPC formulations, caused however photodamages also in cells located in the central part of spheroids, as documented by transmission electron microscopy analyses. Overall, the photodynamic effects of the three m-THPC formulations on HeLa cell spheroids were comparable in terms of cell viability measured with the MTS assay. It is however worth noting that the delivery of m-THPC by liposomes significantly abolished its cytotoxicity in the dark, slightly improved the cellular uptake and, following PDT, promoted cell loss and spheroid disassembling to a higher extent when compared to Foscan(R).
27279231	Micro ribonucleic acid-93 promotes oncogenesis of cervical cancer by targeting RAB11 family interacting protein 1.	AIM: Micro ribonucleic acid (RNA)-93 (miR-93) is a novel oncogenic miRNA dysregulated in many types of tumors. We aimed to further study the expression pattern and clinical significance of miR-93 and its target, the RAB11 family interacting protein 1 (RAB11FIP1) gene, in cervical cancer. METHODS: Mir-93 and RAB11FIP1 expression in cervical cancer (n = 168), cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 2 or 3 (n = 60) and normal cervical tissues (n = 48) was examined by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemical staining. Methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium assay, flow cytometry, and Transwell chamber invasion assay were performed to investigate the function of miR-93 in the proliferation, apoptosis and invasion of cervical cancer cell lines SiHa and CaSki. Luciferase activity assay was conducted to identify the target gene of miR-93. RESULTS: Mir-93 expression levels in cervical cancer and CIN tissues were significantly increased (P = 0.032), but the RAB11FIP1 protein was significantly decreased (P = 0.006) compared with normal tissues. Neither was associated with clinicopathological variables. Enforced miR-93 knockdown or RAB11FIP1 overexpression suppressed proliferation and promoted apoptosis, but did not influence invasion in cervical cancer cells. Luciferase activity indicated that RAB11FIP1 was a direct target for miR-93. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that overexpression of miR-93 via targeting RAB11FIP1 as an early event plays an important role in oncogenesis of cervical cancer. MiR-93 and its target protein RAB11FIP1 may be potential therapeutic targets for cervical cancer and its precursors.
27278909	A new report of Nocardiopsis valliformis strain OT1 from alkaline Lonar crater of India and its use in synthesis of silver nanoparticles with special reference to evaluation of antibacterial activity and cytotoxicity.	The authors report the biological synthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) by alkaliphilic actinobacterium Nocardiopsis valliformis OT1 strain isolated for the first time from Lonar crater, India. The primary detection of silver NPs formation was made by colour change from colourless to dark brown and confirmed by UV-Vis spectrum of AgNPs at 423 nm, specific for AgNPs. Further, AgNPs were characterized by nanoparticle tracking analysis, Zeta sizer, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analyses. FTIR analysis showed the presence of proteins as capping agent. TEM analysis revealed the formation of spherical and polydispersed AgNPs within the size range of 5-50 nm. The antimicrobial activity of silver nanoparticles against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtilis was evaluated. The AgNPs showed the maximum antibacterial activity against B. subtilis (Gram positive) and the minimum against E. coli (Gram negative). The minimal inhibitory concentration values of AgNPs for the tested bacteria were found to be in the range of 30-80 microg/mL. The AgNPs demonstrated higher antibacterial activity against all the bacteria tested as compared with the commercially available antibiotics. The cytotoxicity of biosynthesized AgNPs against in vitro human cervical cancer cell line (HeLa) demonstrated a dose-response activity. The IC50 value was found to be 100 microg/mL of AgNPs against cancer HeLa cell line.
27278606	The expression of miR-21 and miR-143 is deregulated by the HPV16 E7 oncoprotein and 17beta-estradiol.	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of non-coding RNAs that negatively regulate their target mRNAs at a posttranscriptional level, thereby affecting crucial processes in cancer development. However, little is known about the molecular events that control expression of miRNAs in cervical cancer (CC). HPV16 E7 oncoprotein in conjunction with estrogen are sufficient to produce high grade cervical dysplasia and invasive cervical malignancies in a mouse model. In the present study, we determined the potential role that the E7 oncoprotein and 17beta-estradiol (E2) play in the deregulation of miR-21 and miR-143 expression levels by these two risk factors. We found that, while the expression of miR-21 was upregulated and the expression of miR-143 was downregulated by the HPV16 E7 oncoprotein in vivo, and in vitro and that E2 treatment is also implicated in the deregulation of these important miRNAs in vivo. Sustained upregulation of miR-21 resulted in suppression of PTEN expression, and repression of miR-143 increased the mRNA and protein levels from Bcl-2. These results suggested that HPV type 16 E7 oncoprotein and E2 play an important role in regulating miR-21 and miR-143 expression. We have observed similar results in CC patients containing HPV16 sequences, suggesting that these miRNAs could serve as diagnostic biomarkers in CC. The present study highlights the roles of miRNAs in cervical tissue and implicates these important molecules in cervical carcinogenesis.
27276209	Uterine Cervical Metastasis From Primary Rectal Adenocarcinoma on PET/CT and MRI.	FDG avid uterine cervical masses are most commonly due to primary cervical carcinoma; however, history and differential diagnoses are critical when interpreting FDG PET/CT studies. A 51-year-old woman with newly diagnosed moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma of the rectum underwent FDG PET/CT for staging, which revealed the hypermetabolic primary rectal tumor and nodal metastases. Additionally, FDG avid focus in the anterior cervix without a CT correlate was present. Cervical metastasis was suspected, and further evaluation with MRI and histopathologic correlation was recommended, which confirmed cervical metastasis. This case illustrates an unusual case of FDG-avid cervical metastasis from rectal adenocarcinoma.
27276204	PET/CT Response Criteria (European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer) Predict Survival Better Than Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors in Locally Advanced Cervical Cancer Treated With Chemoradiation.	PURPOSE: To investigate whether the ratio of SUVs measured with F-FDG PET/CT between pretreatment and posttreatment has prognostic value in patients with locally advanced cervical cancer treated with primary chemoradiation therapy. METHODS: Cases of locally advanced cervical cancer (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stages IB1 to IVA) treated with a nonsurgical curative modality (172 cases including chemoradiation or radiation therapy) were reviewed. F-FDG PET/CT parameters, including SUVmax and SUVmean, were evaluated by F-FDG PET/CT performed prior to treatment and 6 weeks after the end of treatment. Metabolic response was evaluated according to the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer guidelines and was compared with radiologic response measured according to the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumours (RECIST). RESULTS: In total, 142 patients receiving chemoradiation showed radiologic responses (median 56% decrease in maximal diameter), whereas 160 and 146 patients showed metabolic responses measured with SUVmax and SUVmean, respectively (73% decrease in SUVmax; 48% decrease in SUVmean). Radiologic response and metabolic response were significantly correlated for SUVmax and SUVmean (P = 0.0009; P = 0.0457, respectively). Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed significant differences in overall survival and progression-free survival between the responder and nonresponder groups, based on the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer criteria (both P < 0.001), whereas no significant difference was found when using RECIST criteria (P = 0.058, P = 0.088, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: F-FDG PET/CT parameters are good prognostic markers for the response of cervical cancer patients to concurrent chemoradiation therapy, as compared with the RECIST criteria.
27273964	Pelvic intraoperative iatrogenic oncosurgical injuries: single-center experience.	PURPOSE: Iatrogenic events are more likely to occur during surgical treatment of malignant conditions. Gynecologic and colorectal cancers account for most of the cases that require surgical treatment within the pelvic area. The purpose of this study was to analyze the incidence of intraoperative accidents and the most frequently encountered injuries during surgery for cancers of the pelvic area. METHODS: The records of 2702 patients admitted to our clinic over a 15-year period, (January 2000-December 2014), were analyzed for type and frequency of intraoperative accidents. RESULTS: Urinary tract lesions were the most common injuries seen in this series (63.1%), followed by enteral (28.1%) and vascular (8.8%) injuries, with an overall incidence of 2.9% for the whole group. Iatrogenic injuries showed a statistically significant difference in incidence depending on the type of primary malignancy (p<0.002). Cervical cancer was associated with a higher rate of ureteral lesions, whereas enteral injuries occurred predominantly during surgical resection for ovarian cancer. The use of neoadjuvant radiotherapy or chemotherapy has been associated with a significantly lower risk of surgical iatrogenic injuries (p=0.004). CONCLUSION: Immediate recognition of the lesion and prompt treatment are recommended in order to lower postoperative complications and to avoid a second operation.
27273940	Cervical cancer: screening, diagnosis and staging.	Purpose: Despite the widespread screening programs, cervical cancer remains the third most common cancer in developing countries. Based on the implementation of cervical screening programs with the referred adoption of improved screening methods in cervical cytology with the knowledge of the important role of the human papilloma virus (HPV) it's incidence is decreased in the developed world. Even if cervical HPV infection is incredibly common, cervical cancer is relatively rare. Depending on the rarity of invasive disease and the improvement of detection of pre-cancerous lesions due to the participation in screening programs, the goal of screening is to detect the cervical lesions early in order to be treated before cancer is developed. In populations with many preventive screening programs, a decrease in cervical cancer mortality of 50-75% is mentioned over the past 50 years. The preventive examination of vagina and cervix smear, Pap test, and the HPV DNA test are remarkable diagnostic tools according to the American Cancer Association guidelines, in the investigation of asymptomatic women and in the follow up of women after the treatment of pre-invasive cervical cancer. The treatment of cervical cancer is based on the FIGO 2009 cervical cancer staging.
27272848	Immunohistochemical Evaluation of E6/E7 HPV Oncoproteins Staining in Cervical Cancer.	BACKGROUND/AIM: High-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) subtypes (i.e. 16 and 18) lead to uterine cervical cancer as well as HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer (OSCC), a form of head and neck cancer. The induction of HPV-induced cancer is driven by virus-specific oncoproteins E6 and E7. E6 protein of HPV types 16 and 18 interacts with the E3 ubiquitin protein ligase, resulting in ubiquitination and proteolysis of tumor protein p53. E7 inactivates retinoblastoma protein (Rb) by phosphorylation followed by an increase of free eukaryotic transcription factor E2F (E2F) in the cell. This leads to an increase of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p16, that is used as an immunohistochemical marker of HPV-associated OSCC. Unfortunately, p16 is not exclusively increased by E7 oncoprotein in carcinogenesis. Therefore, the aim of this study was to develop an immunohistochemical approach for the direct detection of E6/E7 oncoproteins in uterine cervical cancer as well as in OSCC. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Paraffin sections of uterine cervical cancer and 130 were analyzed. Immunohistochemical staining protocols were evaluated with tissue slides from patients with cervical dysplasia (CIN III) and squamous epithelial carcinoma tissue with HPV infection. Liver and placental tissues were used as negative controls. E6-Specific antibody (Biorbyt) was used as primary antibody. The polymer staining method and diaminobenzidine were applied for further development. Panels of E7-specific antibodies were tested. Again, the polymer staining method and diaminobenzidine were applied for further development. RESULTS: E6-Specific antibody revealed specific and intense staining after pre-incubation of tissue slides with citrate buffer solution. Only the E7 antibody obtained from Chemicon showed intense and specific staining in patients with CIN III and squamous epithelial carcinoma tissue. Pre-incubation with proteinase K diminished non-specific reaction. CONCLUSION: Our results revealed a useful staining protocol for the immunohistochemical evaluation of E6/E7 oncoprotein expression in uterine cervical cancer, as well as in HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer. Advantages of this method compared to mRNA in situ hybridization of E6/E7 are the much lower costs, as well as the broader applicability in pathological practice.
27272838	Immunohistochemical Evaluation of the Role of p53 Mutation in Cervical Cancer: Ser-20 p53-Mutant Correlates with Better Prognosis.	BACKGROUND: Cervical cancer is driven by human papillomavirus virus-specific oncoprotein E6. E6 interacts with E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase, resulting in the proteolysis of p53 protein. The aim of this study was to analyze one TP53 mutation in patients with cervical cancer and to correlate it to prognosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 248 paraffin-embedded tumor samples were stained for mutated p53 protein. The distribution and intensity of staining both in the nucleus and cytoplasm were evaluated with a semi-quantitative immunohistochemical score. RESULTS: A total of 66% of studied cervical carcinomas expressed the mutated p53 protein. The overall survival was better for patients expressing the mutated p53 protein in the nucleus. CONCLUSION: Interestingly, we found a very high mutation rate of TP53 in a cancer type where p53 is initially inactivated via E6 during the development of cervical cancer. An unexpected finding is the correlation of this mutation with better survival, possibly due to better response to therapy.
27272821	Hepatic Resection for Liver Metastases from Cervical Cancer Is Safe and May Have Survival Benefit.	The goal of this study was to evaluate the single-centre experience with hepatectomy for liver metastases from cervical cancer (CCLM). Fifteen patients who underwent such surgery at the Fundeni Clinical Hospital between January 2002 and April 2014 were retrospectively reviewed. Liver lesions diagnosed at more than 6 months from cervical cancer diagnosis were classified as metachronous lesions, while lesions occurring within the first 6 months were considered synchronous lesions. Two patients were diagnosed with synchronous CCLM, while the other 13 patients had metachronous. Early postoperative death occurred in a single patient with metachronous liver metastases and pelvic recurrence, but this was not related to liver surgery. The median overall survival for the entire cohort was 18 months from the time of liver resection; patients with metachronous lesions had an improved outcome when compared to those with synchronous lesions. In patients with metachronous liver metastases, prognostic factors associated with an improved outcome were the general biological status of the patient, grade of tumoural differentiation and absence of other abdomino-pelvic recurrences. In multivariate analysis, only the grade of differentiation was statistically significant. In conclusion, hepatic resection for liver metastases from cervical cancer can be performed safely, may prove effective, and should be part of the multimodal treatment.
27272807	High Pre-treatment Plasma D-Dimer Level as a Potential Prognostic Biomarker for Cervical Carcinoma.	BACKGROUND/AIM: We aimed to evaluate the prognostic significance of high pre-treatment plasma D-dimer levels in patients with cervical carcinoma (CC) after adjusting for venous thromboembolism. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Relationships between the clinicopathological characteristics and the overall (OS) and progression-free (PFS) survival rates of patients with CC (N=129) were examined. Survival was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method and prognostic indicators assessed using a Cox proportional hazards model. RESULTS: A high pre-treatment plasma level of D-dimers, detected in 42.6% of cases (N=55), was associated with advanced tumour stage. In the multivariate analysis, high pre-treatment plasma D-dimer levels, tumour stage, histological type, and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels were identified as independent prognostic factors for OS, while tumour stage and CEA levels were identified as independent prognostic factors for PFS. CONCLUSION: A high pre-treatment plasma level of D-dimers represents an independent prognostic biomarker for CC that could assist in identifying high-risk populations for treatment decisions.
27272442	Antioxidant, Antibacterial, and Antiproliferative Activities of Free and Bound Phenolics from Peel and Flesh of Fuji Apple.	This study was conducted to investigate the antioxidant, antibacterial, and antiproliferative activities of flesh free (FF), flesh bound (FB), peel free (PF), and peel bound (PB) phenolics from Fuji apple. The PB, which had highest total phenolic contents (126.15 +/- 2.41 mg/100 g wet weight) and lowest total carbohydrate contents (34.68 +/- 2.78 mg/100 g wet weight), showed the strongest 2,2'-azinobis-(3-ethylbenthiazoline-6-sulphonate) (ABTS) radical scavenging activity (EC50 = 0.36 +/- 0.02 mg/mL), 1,1-diphenyl-2-picryhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging activity (EC50 = 0.26 +/- 0.01 mg/mL), and ferric reducing antioxidant power (Ferric reducing antioxidant power; EC50 = 0.19 +/- 0.02 mg/mL) compared with those of FF, FB, and PF. The PB also showed the strongest antibacterial activities on Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Listeria monocytogenes and it also showed the highest antiproliferative effects on Caco-2 human colonic cancer cell (EC50 = 1.44 +/- 0.01 mg/mL) and Hela human cervical cell (EC50 = 2.81 +/- 0.01 mg/mL). Both free and bound phenolics from Fuji apple showed good antioxidant, antibacterial, and antiproliferative activities in our study, and bound phenolics had significantly higher activities compared with those of free phenolics.
27272214	Long noncoding RNA PVT1 promotes cervical cancer progression through epigenetically silencing miR-200b.	Long noncoding RNA PVT1 has been reported to be dysregulated and play vital roles in a variety of cancers. However, the functions and molecular mechanisms of PVT1 in cervical cancer remain unclear. The objective of this study was to investigate the expression, clinical significance, biological roles, and underlying functional mechanisms of PVT1 in cervical cancer. Our results revealed that PVT1 is upregulated in cervical cancer tissues. Enhanced expression of PVT1 is associated with larger tumor size, advanced International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage, and poor prognosis of cervical cancer patients. Using gain-of-function and loss-of-function approaches, we demonstrated that overexpression of PVT1 promotes cervical cancer cells proliferation, cell cycle progression and migration, and depletion of PVT1 inhibits cervical cancer cell proliferation, cell cycle progression, and migration. Mechanistically, we verified that PVT1 binds to EZH2, recruits EZH2 to the miR-200b promoter, increases histone H3K27 trimethylation level on the miR-200b promoter, and inhibits miR-200b expression. Furthermore, the effects of PVT1 on cervical cell proliferation and migration depend upon silencing of miR-200b. Taken together, our findings confirmed that PVT1 functions as an oncogene in cervical cancer and indicated that PVT1 is not only an important prognostic marker, but also a potential therapy target for cervical cancer.
27271587	Dioscin Induces Apoptosis in Human Cervical Carcinoma HeLa and SiHa Cells through ROS-Mediated DNA Damage and the Mitochondrial Signaling Pathway.	Dioscin, a natural product, has activity against glioblastoma multiforme, lung cancer and colon cancer. In this study, the effects of dioscin against human cervical carcinoma HeLa and SiHa cells were further confirmed, and the possible mechanism(s) were investigated. A transmission electron microscopy (TEM) assay and DAPI staining were used to detect the cellular morphology. Flow cytometry was used to assay cell apoptosis, ROS and Ca(2+) levels. Single cell gel electrophoresis and immunofluorescence assays were used to test DNA damage and cytochrome C release. The results showed that dioscin significantly inhibited cell proliferation and caused DNA damage in HeLa and SiHa cells. The mechanistic investigation showed that dioscin caused the release of cytochrome C from mitochondria into the cytosol. In addition, dioscin significantly up-regulated the protein levels of Bak, Bax, Bid, p53, caspase-3, caspase-9, and down-regulated the protein levels of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl. Our work thus demonstrated that dioscin notably induces apoptosis in HeLa and SiHa cells through adjusting ROS-mediated DNA damage and the mitochondrial signaling pathway.
27270709	De novo malignancy after lung transplantation in Japan.	OBJECTIVE: Lung transplant recipients have an increased de novo cancer risk due to long-term immunosuppression and several oncogenic viral infections. In Japan, to date, there have been no national surveys of the incidence of de novo malignancy after lung transplantation. METHODS: This national survey was conducted by the Japanese Society for Transplantation. The questionnaire was distributed to lung transplant institutions, asking about several clinical factors related to de novo malignancy patients transplanted from 2001 to 2010. RESULTS: 179 cases of lung transplantation were performed by seven institutions in Japan between 2001 and 2010. De novo malignancies occurred in 18 patients (10.1 %). The most common malignancy was a lymphoproliferative malignancy (12 cases, including 1 double de novo cancer after tongue cancer), followed by cervical cancer (4 cases), breast cancer (2 cases), and tongue cancer (1 case). The mean time of occurrence after transplantation was 37.8 (range 4-148) months. Reduction and/or withdrawal of immunosuppression for the treatment of malignancy was seen in 14 cases. Death due to cancer occurred in 6 cases. The overall 5-year survival of 18 patients was 58.9 %. The 5-year survival of post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder was not significantly different from that of other malignancies (47.6 and 62.5 %, respectively; p = 0.33). CONCLUSIONS: This is the first national survey of the incidence of de novo malignancy after lung transplantation in Japan. The incidence was 10.1 % and post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder was the most common malignancy.
27269919	[Effects of 7-difluoromethy-5, 4'-dimethoxygenistein on proliferation and apoptosis of human cervical cancer cells and its mechanism].	OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of 7-difluoromethy-5, 4'- dimethoxygenistein (DFMG) on inhibiting proliferation and inducing apoptosis of human cervical cancer HeLa cells and its possible molecular mechanism in vitro. METHODS: HeLa cells were cultured in vitro. The effect of DFMG on inhibiting proliferation was determined using MTT assay. The effects of DFMG on inducing apoptosis were assessed using flow cytometry with AV-PI staining, AO/EB staining, and agarose gel electrophoresis. Multiple molecular techniques, such as RT-PCR, Western blot, siRNA transfection, and cDNA transfection, were used to explore its possible molecular mechanism. RESULTS: DFMG presented with dramatically inhibiting proliferation effect of HeLa cells in a time-and dose-dependent manner ranging from 0.25 to 64 mug/mL and from 24 to 72 h in vitro, and its IC(50) was 4.62 mug/mL for 48 h. The cells treated with DFMG for 48 h showed typical morphological change of apoptosis, typical DNA ladder of agarose gel electrophoresis, and the sub-G(1) population increased in a dose-dependent manner. Simultaneously the expressions of c-myc mRNA, c-myc protein and its downstream genes, such as bax, cyto-c and caspase-9, were up-regulated, while bcl-2 protein was down-regulated. Down-regulation of c-myc by siRNA attenuated DFMG-induced cell proliferation inhibition and inducing apoptosis. Up-regulation expression of c-myc by cDNA transfection could enhance the effects of DFMG-induced cell proliferation inhibition and inducing apoptosis. CONCLUSION: DFMG could inhibit the proliferation and induce the apoptosis of human cervical cancer HeLa cells in vitro, and its mechanism may be closely related to regulate c-myc and its down-stream gene expression.
27269207	First Experience with Three-Dimensional Thoracolaparoscopy in Esophageal Cancer Surgery.	INTRODUCTION: Endoscopic techniques are rapidly gaining interest in esophageal cancer surgery due to lower pulmonary complication rates and faster postoperative recovery. Conventional two-dimensional endoscopic surgery has two main limitations: lack of depth perception and limited dexterity due to the use of rigid instruments. Theoretically, three-dimensional (3D) endoscopy can overcome these limitations, but to date, its use has not been reported in the context of esophageal cancer surgery. We studied our first series of 3D thoracolaparoscopic esophagectomies to document the safety and feasibility of implementing this technique. METHODS: Patients who underwent a thoracolaparoscopic esophagectomy using a glasses-based 3D system with a 100 degrees angulating camera tip were included. Continuity of the digestive tract was restored with gastric tube reconstruction and a cervical anastomosis. RESULTS: All 13 resections were completed thoracolaparoscopically. Median duration of surgery was 360 minutes (range: 245-590 minutes), and median blood loss was 170 mL (range: 50-230 mL). A median of 20 lymph nodes was resected, and all resections were microscopically radical. Median hospital stay was 9 days. Two patients developed pneumonia (15%), and three patients experienced an anastomotic leakage (23%). All postoperative complications were managed on the ward. CONCLUSION: In this series, the newest generation glasses-based 3D systems proved safe and useful for the thoracolaparoscopic resection of esophageal cancer. Besides better visualization, dexterity seemed to be improved using the 100 degrees flexible 3D camera. Implementation was without significant problems, and the first results are promising.
27268652	Knowledge of the General Community in Cordoba, Argentina, on Human Papilloma Virus Infection and its Prevention.	BACKGROUND: Most studies of human papilloma virus (HPV) are aimed at the natural history of the infection and its relation to cancer; however, there are few studies to assess knowledge of the general population. Our aim was analyze the degree of knowledge of Argentinians about HPV infection and its prevention. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a voluntary, anonymous and non-binding survey with 27 multiple-choice items, in twelve private and public establishments, selected to include a broad population in terms of education, age and gender. The survey consisted of three sections: individual characteristics of the volunteer, HPV infection basic knowledge, its prevention and the virus relationship with other cancers. RESULTS: One thousand two hundred ninety seven volunteers aged 18 to 80 participated. The total number of correct answers was 45.1%. The correct answers for relationship HPV and cervical cancer was 62.1%. Almost 55% did not know about types of HPV that the vaccines for protection. Statistical analysis showed that women, single people, workers, the better educated, those who have had a STDs or HPV and receiving information through medical or educational establishments had greater knowledge of the topic. Only 0.2% of participants answered all questions correctly. CONCLUSIONS: Knowledge plays an important role in health care and the deficiency found in our population could influence the success of the measures taken in the fight against cervical cancer. In this regard, we believe it would be appropriate, not only to emphasize early diagnosis and vaccine implementation, but also incorporate new communication strategies, facilitating reception of accurate and precise information by all strata of society.
27268648	Distribution of High Risk Human Papillomavirus Types in Western Kazakhstan - Retrospective Analysis of PCR Data.	BACKGROUND: Virtually all cases of cervical cancer are caused by persistent infections with a restricted set of human papillomaviruses (HPV). Cancer of the cervix is the third or even the second most common cancer in women worldwide, more than 85% of the cases occurring in developing countries, such as China and India, including the Republic of Kazakhstan. The purpose was to determine the HPV type distribution to evaluate efficacy of vaccination and adjust cancer prevention strategy in Western Kazakhstan in the future. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted of data obtained from PCR laboratories in 4 regional centers for the time period covering 12 months, 2013-2014, using AmpliSens(R) Real-Time PCR kits for HPV testing of 12 genotypes (16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, and 59). RESULTS: A total of 1,661 persons were HPV tested within 2013-14, but a proprotion examined for 16 and 18 genotypes only (563) was not been included for statistic analysis of distribution and ratio of the most common genotypes. Males accounted for only a small number (N=90 in total). CONCLUSIONS: Total number of the HPV-positive appeared to be 26.0%, or 286 of N=1098. Types distribution was as follows: type 16 (10.7%), 39 (5.83%), 51 (5.27%), 31 (4.85%), 56 (4.58%), 18 (3.61%), 59 (2.64%), 58 (2.22%), 35 (1.94%), 33 (1.25%). Overall the HPV infection was highest in 16-29 years old (62.4%) and decreased with age. Total prevalence of the HR-HPVs amongst male population was 21.4% with top five types 16, 18, 39, 51, 31. Trends forcorrelations between Aktau site and type 33 (Cramer's V 0.2029), between Caucasian ethnicity and type 33 (Cramer's V .1716), and between European ethnicities in Uralsk and type 45 (Cramer's V .1752) were found. Of N 563 tested separately for 16 or 18 types, 13.6% were positive. As a whole, the distribution of 16/18 types had a ratio of 3.53:1. Given the vaccine-targeted type 16 is widely spread amongst this regional population, HPV immunization program of adolescent girls 10-13 years should be implemented appropriately.
27268625	Correlation between EGFR Expression and Radiosensitivity in Cervical Adenocarcinoma Cases.	BACKGROUND: Most of the cervical cancer patients, including those with cervical adenocarcinomas, come at advanced stage in the developing world so its mortality is high. Radiotherapy is one of the treatment modality for advanced stage cervical adenocarcinomas, but its efficacy depends on several prognostic factors such as the stage, histopathology, presence of organ dysfunction and expression of cellular biology markers mainly involve in cell proliferation such as the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Some research indicates that activation of EGFR in malignancy (including cervical cancer) correlates with aggressive behavior, a poor prognosis and decreasing sensitivity of radiotherapy. However, the combination between targeted therapies and radiotherapy are innovative approaches which may provide a good result. This study aimed to assess any correlation between expression of EGFR and response to radiotherapy in cervical adenocarcinoma cases. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 32 women were registered in a retrospective study period January 2007 and May 2014. Paraffin blocks from these patients were processed by classical histological techniques and for immunohistochemical staining of EGFR, scoring being accomplished according to the immunoreactive scoring (IRS) of Remmele and Stegner. RESULTS: Among the studied molecular factors, there was significant correlation expression of EGFR with poor response to radiotherapy (p=0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: The result of this study showed a significant correlation between expression of EGFR and sensitivity of radiation in cervical adenocarcinoma cases. Further research is n ecessary to obtain information about new therapeutic management.
27268619	Susceptible and Protective Associations of HLA Alleles and Haplotypes with Cervical Cancer in South India.	BACKGROUND: Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes have been implicated in cervical cancer in several populations. OBJECTIVES: To study the predispositions of HLA alleles/haplotypes with cervical cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Clinically diagnosed and PAP smear confirmed cervical cancer patients (n 48) and age matched controls (n 47) were genotyped for HLA-A,-B,-DRB1* and DQB1* alleles by PCR-SSP methods. RESULTS: The frequencies of alleles DRB1*04 (OR=2.57), DRB1*15 (OR=2.04), DQB1*0301 (OR=4.91), DQB1*0601 (OR=2.21), B*15 (OR=13.03) and B*07 (OR=6.23) were higher in cervical cancer patients than in the controls. The frequencies of alleles DRB1*10 (OR=0.22) and B*35 (OR=0.19) were decreased. Strong disease associations were observed for haplotypes DRB1*15-DQB1*0601 (OR=6.56; < 3.5.10-4), DRB1*14-DQB1*0501 (OR=6.51; <0.039) and A*11-B*07 (OR=3.95; <0.005). The reduced frequencies of haplotypes DRB1*10-DQB1*0501 (OR=0.45), A*03-B*35 (OR=0.25) and A*11-B*35 (OR= 0.06) among patients suggested a protective association. HLA-C* typing of 8 patients who possessed a unique three locus haplotype 'A*11-B*07-DRB1*04' (8/48; 16.66%; OR=6.51; <0.039) revealed the presence of a four locus haplotype 'A*11-B*07-C*01-DRB1*04' in patients (4/8; 50%). Amino acid variation analysis of susceptible allele DQB1*0601 suggested 'tyrosine' at positions beta9 and beta37 and tyrosine-non-tyrosine genotype combination increased the risk of cervical cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Strong susceptible associations were documented for HLA alleles B*15, B*07, DRB1*04, DRB1*15, DQB1*0301, DQB1*0601 and haplotypes DRB1*15-DQB1*0601 and DRB1*14-DQB1*0501. Further, protective associations were evidenced for alleles B*35 and DRB1*10 and haplotypes A*11-B*35 and DRB1*10-DQB1*0501 with cervical cancer in South India.
27268612	Knowledge and Attitudes of Bangkok Metropolitan Women towards HPV and Self-Sampled HPV Testing.	BACKGROUND: To evaluate knowledge of Bangkok women regarding HPV and self-sampled HPV testing, and their attitudes towards testing. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thai women who had lived in Bangkok for more than 5 years, aged 25-to-65 years old, were invited to join the study. Participating women were asked to a complete self-questionnaire (Thai language), with literate assistance as needed. The questionnaire was divided into 3 parts: (I) demographic data, (II) knowledge and (III) attitudes towards self-sampled HPV testing. Before proceeding to Part III of the questionnaire, a 15-minute educational video of self-sampled HPV testing was presented to all participants. RESULTS: Among 2,810 women who answered the questionnaires, 33.7% reported that they did not know about HPV. The characteristic features of these women were older age (>50 years), lower income (<600 USD/month), unemployed status, and non-attendees at cervical cancer screening. Only small numbers of women (4.6%) responded that they had heard about self-sampled HPV testing. After having information, 59.6% would not use the self-sampled HPV testing as a method of cervical cancer screening (non-acceptance). Factors significantly associated with the non-acceptance were older age, lower income, having no knowledge about HPV or self-collected HPV testing, a perception that the testing was unreliable and a concern that they might not be able to perform it correctly. CONCLUSIONS: Nearly half and almost all Bangkok women did not know about HPV and self-sampled HPV testing, respectively. Approximately 60% of Bangkok women refused to do the self-sampled HPV testing. Significant negative attitudes were concerns that the testing would be unreliable and a lack of confidence to perform the procedure correctly. Education about HPV and self-sampled HPV testing, ease of the procedure, or the testing models may increase rate of acceptability or positive attitudes.
27268606	Incidence of High Grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesions in Patients with Atypical Squamous Cells of Undetermined Significance Papanicolaou Smears at Naresuan University Hospital.	PURPOSE: To determine the incidence of high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN2-3) among patients with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US) Papanicolaou (Pap) smears. MATERIALS AND METHODS: One-hundred and eighty-seven patients with ASC-US Pap smears who underwent colposcopy with histological study were enrolled between September 2007 and August 2015. Patient factors (including age, parity, current pills used, HIV status, age at first sexual intercourse and number of sexual partners) were obtained. Logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate clinical factors associated with CIN2-3. RESULTS: CIN was diagnosed in 92 of 187 women (49.2%). Sixty-one of these (32.6%) had CIN1 and 31 (16.6%) had CIN2-3. There was no woman who had invasive cancer. There was no correlation of high-grade CIN with factors in this study including age, parity, current pills used, HIV status, age at first sexual intercourse and number of sexual partners. CONCLUSIONS: Data from this study showed no invasive cervical cancer was found in patients with ASC-US. There was no patient factor associated with high grade intraepithelial neoplasia in patients with ASC-US Pap smears.
27268599	Prognostic Scores for Predicting Recurrence in Patients with Differentiated Thyroid Cancer.	BACKGROUND: Differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) is a cancer group that shares molecular and cellular origin but shows different clinical courses and prognoses. Several prognostic factors have been reported for predicting recurrence for individual patients. This literature review aimed to evaluate prognostic scores for predicting recurrence of DTC. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A search of the MEDLINE database for articles published until December 2015 was carried out using the terms "thyroid neoplasms AND (recurrent OR persistent) AND (score OR model OR nomogram) ". Studies were eligible for review if they indicated the development of prognostic scoring models, derived from a group of independent prognostic factors, in predicting disease recurrence in DTC patients. RESULTS: Of the 308 articles obtained, five were eligible for evaluation. Two scoring models were developed for DTC including both papillary and follicular carcinoma, one for papillary carcinoma, and the other two for papillary microcarcinoma. The number of patients included in the score development cohort ranged from 59 to 1,669. The number of evaluated potential prognostic factors ranged from 4 to 25. Tumor-related factors were the most common factors included in the final scores, with cervical lymph node metastases being the most common. Only two studies showed internal validation of the derived score. CONCLUSIONS: There is a paucity of prognostic scores for predicting disease recurrence in patients with DTC, in particular for follicular thyroid carcinoma. Several limitations of the created scores were found. Performance of the scores has not been adequately studied. Comprehensive validation in multiple cohorts is recommended before widespread use.
27266997	Design and synthesis of N-(5-chloro-2,4-dihydroxybenzoyl)-(R)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline-3-carboxamid es as novel Hsp90 inhibitors.	Heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) is an attractive chemotherapeutic target for antitumor drug development. Herein, we reported the design and synthesis of two series of novel N-(5-chloro-2,4-dihydroxybenzoyl)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline-3- carboxamides as Hsp90 inhibitors using (S)-Tic (1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline-3- carboxylic acid) (A1-13) and (R)-Tic (B1-13) as scaffold, respectively. Cellular thermal shift assay (CETSA) screening showed that compounds B1-13 with (R)-Tic scaffold exhibited potent ability to stabilize Hsp90alpha. Compound B7 showed not only the most potent ability to induce thermal stabilization of Hsp90alpha but also the strongest cytotoxicity. The IC50 values of B7 were 0.98 muM and 1.74 muM against the proliferation of human breast cancer MDA-MB-231 and human cervical cancer HeLa cell lines, respectively. Moreover, CETSA melt and ITDRFCETSA (isothermal dose-response fingerprint) curves confirmed that B7 bound to Hsp90alpha in 293T cells. Western blotting results indicated that B7 induced the degradation of Hsp90 clients CDK4, Her2, Cdc-2 and C-raf. In addition, docking and Molecular dynamics (MD) refinement of the B7-Hsp90 complex showed that the binding model of B7 to Hsp90 was similar with that of 8-benzyladenines. The overall properties warrant compound B7 a promising lead for the development of Hsp90 inhibitor antitumor drugs.
27266495	[Clinical Analysis of Surgical treatment of long bone metastases].	OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of microwave ablation combined with curettage in the treatment of long bone metastases. METHODS: From April 2010 to June 2015, 38 patients with long bone metastases were adopted, who all underwent microwave ablation combined with curettage with 40 lesions involved in Department of Orthopaedic Oncology, Beijing Jishuitan Hospital. There were 22 males and 16 females with an average age of 58.3 years (range from 32 to 83 years). Solitary metastases were found in 9 cases and multiple metastases in 29 patients. Primary malignancies included: 15 cases of lung cancer, 7 cases of renal carcinoma, 4 cases of breast cancer, 3 cases of liver cancer, 1 case of thyroid carcinoma, 1 case of endometrial carcinoma, 1 case of cervical carcinoma, 1 case of esophageal carcinoma and 6 cases of carcinoma of unknown primary. The operative sites included the femur (n=21), the humerus (n=12) and the tibia (n=7). There were 23 cases of pathologic fractures which included: 12 in femur, 10 in humerus and 1 in tibia. Curettage after in situ microwave ablation was performed in 40 lesions. Reconstructions were carried out in all lesions: bone cement filling alone in 1 lesion and bone cement filling with metal implants in the other 39 lesions. RESULTS: The mean follow-up was 6.9 months (range; 1-65 months). During the follow-up, 22 patients died and 16 patients were alive. The 6-month overall survival (OS) was 73.7%, and the 1-year and 2-year OS were 48.6% and 28.1% respectively. The postoperative survival time was 7.1 months on average (range 2-40 months) in the 22 patients who finally died. The occurrence of pathological fracture had a significant effect on the OS (chi(2)=5.606, P=0.018). The local recurrence rate was 10% (4/40), which occurred at 6.8 months after the operation on average (range 2-14 months). No complications occurred in the perioperative period, and there were no complications such as internal fixation failure or pathological fracture noticed during the follow-up period. The scores of VAS, KPS and ECOG were significantly improved after operation. The mean MSTS score was 22 points (range 17-28 points) in 33 evaluable locations and the rate of excellent and good was 72.7%. CONCLUSIONS: Microwave ablation combined with curettage appears to be a safe and effective approach in the surgical treatment of long bone metastases, which can relieve local pain and control the local development of bone metastases.
27266224	Differential Diagnosis between Primary Endocervical and Endometrial Adenocarcinoma using Immunohistochemical Staining of Estrogen Receptor, Vimentin, Carcinoembryonic Antigen and p16.	BACKGROUND: When clinical and histopathological evaluation is not effective in discriminating primary endocervical adenocarcinoma (ECAs) and endometrial adenocarcinoma (EMAs), an immunohistochemistry (IHC) method is regularly used in practice, which involves staining of estrogen receptor (ER), vimentin (Vim), monoclonal carcinoembryonic antigen (mCEA) and p16. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the performance of IHC markers, ER, Vim, mCEA and p16, in differentiating between primary ECAs and EMAs and to compare the performances of two-, three- and four-marker panels. MATERIAL AND METHOD: Women with cervical or uterine cancers who were diagnosed with mucinous or endometrioid adenocarcinoma or adenocarcinoma of non-otherwise specified, after cervical biopsy, endometrial biopsy or curettage, and who underwent elective surgery at Rajavithi Hospital between January 1, 2011 and June 30, 2012 were retrospectively reviewed. Paraffin-embedded tissue sections from pre-operative specimens were reviewed and stained with ER, Vim, mCEA and p16. Postoperative pathologic slides was reviewed and installed as the reference standard. RESULTS: Of 110 cases, 44 were primary ECAs and 66 were primary EMAs. ER and Vim were significantly expressed in EMAs (p < 0.001), while mCEA and p16 were significantly expressed in ECAs (p < 0.001). From multivariable analysis, Vim and p16 were the significant markers for differentiating ECAs and EMAs. A comparison of different combinations showed that panels of Vim/p16, ER/Vim/p16, Vim/mCEA/p16 and ER/Vim/mCEA/p16 achieved the highest overall accuracy of97.9%. CONCLUSION: Vim and p16 are the significant IHC markers and a two-marker panel of Vim/p16 is recommended for using in differentiating primary ECAs and EMAs; which a pattern of negative Vim and positive p16 expression favors diagnosis of ECAs while the converse pattern of positive Vim and negative p16 staining points to diagnosis of EMAs.
27266211	Effects of Radiation Therapy on Immunological and Virological Status in HIV-Infected Cancer Patients in Thailand: A Multicenter Prospective Study.	BACKGROUND: Radiation therapy (RT) is the core part of cancer multidisciplinary management which causes myelosuppression. The current standard or RT among HIV-positive cancer patients who are immuno-compromised does not differ from that of HIV-negative ones. OBJECTIVE: To determine the effects of radiation therapy on immunological and virological status among HIV-infected cancer patients. MATERIAL AND METHOD: A prospective observational study was conducted of HIV-infected cancer patients who received definitive RT in seven hospitals in Thailand. Blood samples were taken to determine immune status using CD4%, and virological status was identified using plasma HIV-RNA viral load (HIV-VL) assay: at baseline before RT at the last week of RT completion; and at the 6-month follow-up visit. Additional CD4% test was performed at the 3-month follow-up visit. RESULTS: Ninety HIV-infected cancer patients from seven hospitals in Thailand were included in the analysis. The median age was 40 years old (range 19-61). Seventy-six patients (84.4%) were female and 65 (72.2%) were cases of invasive cervical cancers. Eighty-seven percent of patients had been receiving antiretroviral treatment (ART) before RT The mean CD4% at baseline, RT completion, 3-month and 6-month follow-up visits, were 18.7%, 20.1%, 16.8% and 17.1%, respectively. The proportion of CD4% reduction in the non-ART group was higher than that of the ART group throughout the period, particularly at the 3-month follow-up visit (100% vs. 29.7%, p = 0.0004). Six cases had a HIV-VL increase of more than 10 times (1-log(1)(0)) at completion of RT: 3 of these were non-ART and 3 were ART-uncontrolled viral suppression. CONCLUSION: RT had a suppressive effect on immunological status in HIV-infected cancer patients, particularly in the subacute period among those who were not on ART HIV-disease progression was observed during radiation treatment in HIV-infected cancer patients without ART and those with ART-uncontrolled viral suppression.
27265130	Loss of Cell Differentiation in HPV-Associated Bladder Cancer.	Medical histories of 101 urothelial bladder cancer patients were compared with the results of morphological analysis and biomolecular detection of human papilloma viruses (HPV) in the tumor specimens. DNA of HPV16 (the major type of virus responsible for appearance of cervical carcinoma) was detected in 38 specimens, while mRNA of E6 and E7 oncogenes and E7 oncoprotein of HPV16 were observed in 13 specimens. HPV-positive bladder cancer was characterized by higher degree of cell anaplasia than HPV-negative cancer; in the primary bladder tumor, HPV was detected more often than in recurrent bladder cancer. These data attest to involvement of HPV16 in the genesis of bladder cancer. No correlations of HPV status of bladder tumor with patient's sex, age, and invasion into the muscle layer were revealed.
27264717	Anti-cancer activity of doxorubicin-loaded liposomes co-modified with transferrin and folic acid.	Cancer-specific drug delivery represents an attractive approach to prevent undesirable side-effects and increase the accumulation of the drug in the tumor. Surface modification of nanoparticles such as liposomes with targeting moieties specific to the up-regulated receptors on the surface of tumor cells thus represents an effective strategy. Furthermore, since this receptor expression can be heterogeneous, using a dual-combination of targeting moieties may prove advantageous. With this in mind, the anti-cancer activity of PEGylated doxorubicin-loaded liposomes targeted with folic acid (F), transferrin (Tf) or both (F+Tf) was evaluated. The dual-targeted liposomes showed a 7-fold increase in cell association compared to either of the single-ligand targeted ones in human cervical carcinoma (HeLa) cell monolayers. The increased penetration and cell association of the dual-targeted liposomes were also demonstrated using HeLa cell spheroids. The in vitro cytotoxicity of the doxorubicin liposomes (LD) was then evaluated using HeLa and A2780-ADR ovarian carcinoma cell monolayers. In both these cell lines, the (F+Tf) LD showed significantly higher cytotoxic effects than the untargeted, or single-ligand targeted liposomes. In a HeLa xenograft model in nude mice, compared to the untreated group, though the untargeted LD showed 42% tumor growth inhibition, both the (F) LD and (F+Tf) LD showed 75% and 79% tumor growth inhibition respectively. These results thus highlight that though the dual-targeted liposomes represent an effective cytotoxic formulation in the in vitro setting, they were equally effective as the folic acid-targeted liposomes in reducing tumor burden in the more complex in vivo setting in this particular model.
27261616	MicroRNA-744 inhibited cervical cancer growth and progression through apoptosis induction by regulating Bcl-2.	Growing evidence suggests that microRNA plays an essential role in the development and metastasis of many tumor progressions, including cervical cancer. Aberrant miR-744 expression has been indicated in many growth of tumor, the mechanism of miR-744 inhibits both the proliferation and metastatic ability for cervical cancer remains unclear. Accumulating evidences reported that Bcl-2 signal pathway plays an important role in the cellular process, such as apoptosis, cell growth and proliferation. The goal of this study was to identify miR-744 that could inhibit the growth, migration, invasion, proliferation and metastasis of gastric cancer through targeting Bcl-2 expression. Real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) was used to quantify miR-744 expression in vitro and vivo experiments. The biological functions of miR-744 were determined via cell proliferation. Our study indicated that miR-744 targeted on Bcl-2, which leads to the inactivation of apoptosis signaling and the cell proliferation of cervical cancer cells, ameliorating cervical cancer growth and progression. In addition, both up-regulation of miR-744 and down-regulation of Bcl-2 could stimulate Caspase-3 expression, promoting apoptosis of cervical cancer cells. Therefore, our research revealed the mechanistic links between miR-744 and Bcl-2 in the pathogenesis of cervical cancer through modulation of Caspase-3, leading to the inhibition of cervical cancer cell growth. And targeting miR-744 could be served as a novel strategy for future cervical cancer therapy clinically.
27261574	Curcumin and Ellagic acid synergistically induce ROS generation, DNA damage, p53 accumulation and apoptosis in HeLa cervical carcinoma cells.	Cervical cancer and precancerous lesions of the cervix continue to be a global health issue, and the medication for the treatment for chronic HPV infection so far has not been effective. Potential anticancer and anti HPV activities of two known phytochemicals, Curcumin and Ellagic acid were evaluated in HeLa cervical cancer cells. Curcumin is a natural compound found in the root of Curcuma longa plant and Ellagic acid a polyphenol found in fruits of strawberries, raspberries and walnuts. The combination of Curcumin and Ellagic acid at various concentrations showed better anticancer properties than either of the drug when used alone as evidenced by MTT assay. Besides this, Curcumin and Ellagic acid also restore p53, induce ROS formation and DNA damage. Mechanistic study further indicated that Curcumin and Ellagic acid show anti-HPV activity as evidenced by decrease in the HPV E6 oncoprotein on HeLa cells.
27260610	Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder of the pediatric airway: Presentation and management.	OBJECTIVE: Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) is a rare complication of immunosuppression with little consensus on its evaluation and management. The purpose of this contemporary review is to describe a pediatric patient with PTLD of the airway and review the literature to provide multidisciplinary recommendations regarding management. DATA SOURCES: Retrospective chart and literature review. REVIEW METHODS: A pediatric patient with PTLD of the airway is described. An extensive literature search to review the existing data on pediatric PTLD of the upper airway was also performed. RESULTS: A pediatric patient with mixed fetal/embryonal hepatoblastoma developed laryngo-tracheal PTLD following liver transplantation. Diagnostic positron emission tomography (PET) scan demonstrated multiple sites of abnormal fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake within the larynx, distal esophagus, cervical lymph nodes, and abdomen concerning for PTLD. Laryngeal biopsy demonstrated Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) positive cells confirming the diagnosis. Rituximab therapy and reduction of immunosuppression resulted in resolution of his laryngeal disease in 3 months. An extensive literature search to review the existing data on pediatric PTLD of the larynx and trachea revealed 14 reported cases. CONCLUSIONS: PTLD of the pediatric airway is an EBV-associated disease that requires a high index of suspicion as patients can often present with non-specific signs and symptoms but progress to have significant airway compromise. Evaluation consists of peripheral blood polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays, biopsy, and PET/CT imaging. Management options include reduction of immunosuppression and/or systemic therapies.
27260518	Serous carcinoma arising from uterine adenomyosis/adenomyotic cyst of the cervical stump: a report of 3 cases.	BACKGROUND: Serous carcinoma arising in adenomyosis and adenomyotic cyst is very rare. Only 3 serous carcinomas and 5 serous endometrial intraepithelial carcinomas (EIC) have been reported to date. METHODS: We reviewed the clinicopathological features of 2 serous carcinoma in uterine adenomyosis and 1 serous EIC in adenomyotic cyst of the cervical stump. RESULTS: Case 1 had an endometrial serous carcinoma in the uterine myometrium and the left ovary. A minor component of benign endometrial glands with minimal endometrial stroma was found in the uterine mass and the surrounding myometrium. Case 2 showed 3 small foci of serous carcinoma, serous EIC and endometrial glandular dysplasia (EmGD) in the adenomyosis. Scanty serous carcinoma was present in the endometrium without evidence of myometrial invasion. The eutopic endometrium in both case 1 and 2 had no evidence of neoplastic changes after complete examination. Case 3 had 3 microscopic serous EICs in the adenomyotic cysts of the cervical stump. One EIC lesion coexisted with EmGD. No cancer was found in the endocervical tube although the preoperative endocervical biopsy showed a poorly differentiated endometrioid carcinoma. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated that serous carcinoma in case 1 and EIC in all 3 cases showed a characteristic pattern of p53 and p16 over expression, high Ki67 index, and lack of WT1, ER and PR staining. EmGD in case 1 and 3 had a similar staining pattern except a lower Ki67 index and the presence of ER expression. CONCLUSIONS: We believe that this case series may expand our recognition on serous carcinoma arising in uterine adenomyosis/adenomyotic cyst including extra-uterine spread and the potential synchronous growth of carcinomas in eutopic endometrium.
27259318	Effects of TGF-beta1 on the Proliferation and Apoptosis of Human Cervical Cancer Hela Cells In Vitro.	To investigate the effects of TGF-beta1 on the proliferation and apoptosis of cervical cancer Hela cells in vitro. Human cervical cancer Hela cells were cultured in vitro and divided into the experimental and control groups. In the experimental groups, Hela cells were stimulated with different concentrations of TGF-beta1 (0.01, 0.1, 1, and 10 ng/mL), while Hela cells cultured in serum-free medium without TGF-beta1 were used as controls. The CCK8 method was adopted to detect the effect of TGF-beta1 on Hela cell proliferation, and flow cytometry was used to determine cell apoptosis 72 h after TGF-beta1 treatment. Compared with the control group, the CCK-8 tests showed that different concentrations of TGF-beta1 had no obvious effect on Hela cell proliferation 24 h after treatment (P > 0.05). However, upon 48 or 72 h of treatment, TGF-beta1 significantly inhibited the proliferation of Hela cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner (P < 0.05). The flow cytometry results indicated that TGF-beta1 influenced the apoptosis of human cervical cancer Hela cells in a dose-dependent manner after 72 h of treatment (P < 0.05). TGF-beta1 significantly inhibited the growth and induced the apoptosis of human cervical Hela cells in vitro.
27255650	Disparities in time trends of cervical cancer mortality rates in Brazil.	PURPOSE: This study aimed to correct and describe cervical cancer mortality rates and trends by regions and age-groups in Brazil. It may help planning and implementing policies for cervical cancer control. METHODS: Data from 2003 to 2012 were accessed through the centralized national mortality database. Correction of the age-specific mortality rates was done by proportional redistribution of ill-defined causes of death and deaths coded as 'uterine, part unspecified'. Annual percentage change (APC) was obtained by trend analysis (Joinpoint regression). RESULTS: In the 10-year period, cancer and ill-defined causes corresponded, respectively, to 18.9 and 10.8 % of all deaths (except injuries). The proportion of ill-defined causes was reduced by more than a half in the period. The age-standardized cervical cancer mortality rate was 7.2 per 100,000 women-years after correction. The total increase in rates after corrections was 50.5 %. A significant decreasing trend in rates was observed at the national level (APC = -0.17, p < 0.001). North was the only region that did not show a decreasing significant trend (APC + 0.07, p = 0.28). Decreasing trends were restricted to age-groups over 40 years. CONCLUSIONS: A consistent decreasing trend of cervical cancer mortality rates in Brazil from 2003 to 2012 was observed, although this was not consistent in all regions and restricted to older age-groups. Quality of data needs to be improved. Cancer control policies may consider the differences in access to care and the characteristics of regions to improve their efficiency.
27255620	Update on the new 9-valent vaccine for human papillomavirus prevention.	OBJECTIVE: To provide family physicians with information on the efficacy, safety, public health effects, and cost-effectiveness of the 9-valent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine. QUALITY OF EVIDENCE: Relevant publications in PubMed up to May 2015 were reviewed and analyzed. Most evidence cited is level I (randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses) or level II (cross-sectional, case-control, and epidemiologic studies). Government reports and recommendations are also referenced. MAIN MESSAGE: The 9-valent HPV vaccine, which protects against HPV types 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58, is safe and effective and will further reduce the incidence of HPV infection, as well as HPV-related cancers. It can also indirectly protect unvaccinated individuals through herd immunity. With an effective vaccination program, most cervical cancers can be prevented. Analyses show that the cost-effectiveness of the 9-valent HPV vaccine in female patients is comparable to the original quadrivalent HPV vaccine (which protects against HPV types 6, 11, 16, and 18) currently in use. However, the usefulness of vaccinating male patients with the 9-valent HPV vaccine needs further investigation. CONCLUSION: The 9-valent HPV vaccine offers more protection against HPV than the quadrivalent HPV vaccine does and is as safe. Analysis of cost-effectiveness favours its use, at least in adolescent girls. Therefore, physicians should recommend the 9-valent HPV vaccine to patients instead of the quadrivalent HPV vaccine.
27252484	ENDOCRINE TUMOURS: Imaging in the follow-up of differentiated thyroid cancer: current evidence and future perspectives for a risk-adapted approach.	The clinical and epidemiological profiles of differentiated thyroid cancers (DTCs) have changed in the last three decades. Today's DTCs are more likely to be small, localized, asymptomatic papillary forms. Current practice is, though, moving toward more conservative approaches (e.g. lobectomy instead of total thyroidectomy, selective use of radioiodine). This evolution has been paralleled and partly driven by rapid technological advances in the field of diagnostic imaging. The challenge of contemporary DTCs follow-up is to tailor a risk-of-recurrence-based management, taking into account the dynamic nature of these risks, which evolve over time, spontaneously and in response to treatments. This review provides a closer look at the evolving evidence-based views on the use and utility of imaging technology in the post-treatment staging and the short- and long-term surveillance of patients with DTCs. The studies considered range from cervical US with Doppler flow analysis to an expanding palette of increasingly sophisticated second-line studies (cross-sectional, functional, combined-modality approaches), which can be used to detect disease that has spread beyond the neck and, in some cases, shed light on its probable outcome.
27249731	Gynecologic Cancers: Emerging Novel Strategies for Targeting DNA Repair Deficiency.	The presence of a BRCA mutation, somatic or germline, is now established as a standard of care for selecting patients with ovarian cancer for treatment with a PARP inhibitor. During the clinical development of the PARP inhibitor class of agents, a subset of women without BRCA mutations were shown to respond to these drugs (termed "BRCAness"). It was hypothesized that other genetic abnormalities causing a homologous recombinant deficiency (HRD) were sensitizing the BRCA wild-type cancers to PARP inhibition. The molecular basis for these other causes of HRD are being defined. They include individual gene defects (e.g., RAD51 mutation, CHEK2 mutation), homozygous somatic loss, and whole genome properties such as genomic scarring. Testing this knowledge is possible when selecting patients to receive molecular therapy targeting DNA repair, not only for patients with ovarian cancer but also endometrial and cervical cancers. The validity of HRD assays and multiple gene sequencing panels to select a broader population of patients for treatment with PARP inhibitor therapy is under evaluation. Other non-HRD targets for exploiting DNA repair defects in gynecologic cancers include mismatch repair (MMR), checkpoint signaling, and nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) DNA repair. This article describes recent evidence supporting strategies in addition to BRCA mutation for selecting patients for treatment with PARP inhibitor therapy. Additionally, the challenges and opportunities of exploiting DNA repair pathways other than homologous recombination for molecular therapy in gynecologic cancers is discussed.
27249229	Epidemiological Investigation and Risk Factors for Cervical Lesions: Cervical Cancer Screening Among Women in Rural Areas of Henan Province China.	BACKGROUND This cross-sectional study aimed to investigate the prevalence of cervical lesions and evaluate risk factors for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) among women taking part in cervical cancer screening in rural areas of Henan province, China. MATERIAL AND METHODS Cervical cancer screening using the ThinPrep cytologic test (TCT) and gynecologic exam was conducted on 1315 women age 20-68 years in rural areas of Henan province, China. Colposcopy and biopsies were carried out for histopathologic diagnosis when indicated. Univariate and multivariate logistic regressions were performed to evaluate risk factors associated with cervical lesions. RESULTS Among 1315 women screened, CIN prevalence detected by histopathology was 1.22% (0.38% of CIN 1, 0.76% of CIN 2, and 0.08% of CIN 3). Cervical cancer prevalence was 2.66%. Multivariate analysis confirmed risk factors for cervical lesions included older age (the 21-40 age group vs. the 41-66 age group, OR=0.13, 95% CI: 0.03~0.57), postmenopause (OR=0.11, 95% CI: 0.03~0.45), cervical inflammation (OR=0.06, 95% CI: 0.01~0.31), and smoking (OR=6.78, 95% CI: 1.20~38.23). CONCLUSIONS Older age (41-66 years), presence of HPV infection, postmenopause, cervical inflammation, and smoking are strong risk factors for cervical lesions among women in rural areas of Henan province, China. Particular efforts should be made to provide cervical cancer screening for these women.
27247498	Cancer Mortality Projections in Korea up to 2032.	Predicting cancer mortality is important to estimate the needs of cancer-related services and to prevent cancer. Despite its significance, a long-term future projection of cancer mortality has not been conducted; therefore, our objective was to estimate future cancer mortality in Korea by cancer site through 2032. The specially designed Nordpred software was used to estimate cancer mortality. The cancer death data from 1983 to 2012 and the population projection data from 1983 to 2032 were obtained from the Korean National Statistics Office. Based on our analysis, age-standardized rates with the world standard population of all cancer deaths were estimated to decline from 2008-2012 to 2028-2032 (men: -39.8%, women: -33.1%). However, the crude rates are predicted to rise (men: 29.8%, women: 24.4%), and the overall number of the cancer deaths is also estimated to increase (men: 35.5%, women: 32.3%). Several cancer deaths are projected to increase (lung, liver and gallbladder, colon and rectum, pancreas and leukemia in both sexes; prostate cancer in men; and breast and ovarian cancer in women), whereas other cancer deaths are expected to decrease (stomach, esophagus and larynx in both sexes and cervical cancer in women). The largest contribution to increasing cancer deaths is due to the aging of the Korean population. In conclusion, a strategy for primary prevention, early detection, and early treatment to cope with the rapidly increasing death of cancer due to population aging is urgently required.
27247200	Feasibility of robotic radical hysterectomy after neoadjuvant chemotherapy in women with locally advanced cervical cancer.	OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety and feasibility of robotic radical hysterectomy (RRH) in women with locally advanced cervical cancer (LACC) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT). MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective comparative longitudinal observational study was performed in 30 patients with LACC FIGO stage IB2-IIB who underwent RRH after NACT between February 2008 and September 2014. This group was compared with a cohort of 176 patients underwent RRH with cervical cancer FIGO stage IA2-IB1 in the same period of time. RESULTS: Patients' age, BMI, ASA score, comorbidity, and previous abdominal surgery, was similar between groups. FIGO stage significantly differed between groups; 29 (96.6%) of patients had FIGO stage IB2 in NACT group and 163 (92.6%) were FIGO stag IB1 in women without NACT, p < 0.001. Type of RRH was also significantly different between groups. Type C1 RRH was significantly more common in NACT group, p = 0.015. Mean (SD) tumor size was significantly bigger in NACT, 27.0 (13.7) mm versus 20.9 (9.0) mm in early stage versus LACC, respectively. p = 0.023. Mean (SD) surgical time was significantly longer in NACT group (307.8 (40.2) min versus 277.4 (45.4) min, p = 0.001). Estimated blood loss and length of the hospital stay were similar between groups. There were no significant differences in terms of intraoperative and postoperative complications. CONCLUSIONS: RRH after NACT in women with LACC seems to be safe and feasible. These results need to be confirmed in studies with a larger patients sample.
27246752	Decoy Receptor 3 (DcR3) as a Biomarker of Tumor Deterioration in Female Reproductive Cancers: A Meta-Analysis.	BACKGROUND DcR3 (decoy receptor 3) has been proposed be involved in development and prognosis of female reproductive cancers, including cervical cancer, ovarian cancer, and breast cancer. The purpose of this meta-analysis was to explore the evidence for the correlation between DcR3 and the clinicopathological characteristics, as well as the overall survival time, in female reproductive cancers. MATERIAL AND METHODS Relevant studies were searched for in PubMed, Wiley Online Library, Web of Science, Science Direct, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Google Scholar, EMBASE, Ovid, LILACS, Chinese CNKI, Chong Qing VIP, Wan Fang, and China Biology Medicine disc up to 30 September 2015. Data on the relationship between DcR3 expression and TNM stage, differentiation, lymph node metastasis, age, and overall survival time were extracted. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs (confidence intervals) were estimated by forest plot. RESULTS Twelve studies with 1127 patients met the inclusion criteria for this meta-analysis. Overexpression of DcR3 was significantly related to the risk of female reproductive cancers (OR=10.69, 95% CI: 6.33-18.05), TNM stage (OR=5.51, 95% CI: 2.83-10.71), differentiation (OR=4.16, 95% CI: 2.28-7.60), lymph node metastasis (OR=5.89, 95% CI: 3.16-10.9), age (OR=0.85, 95% CI: 0.51-1.44), and overall survival time (OR=1.84, 95% CI: 0.58-5.83). Subgroup analyses showed that overexpression of DcR3 in cervical, ovarian, and breast cancer all had similar relationships with these clinicopathological parameters. CONCLUSIONS Our meta-analysis suggests that overexpression of DcR3 may play vital roles in the tumorigenesis and deterioration of female reproductive cancers. However, the relationship between DcR3 expression and prognosis needs further investigation.
27246722	High-resolution T2-weighted cervical cancer imaging: a feasibility study on ultra-high-field 7.0-T MRI with an endorectal monopole antenna.	OBJECTIVES: We studied the feasibility of high-resolution T2-weighted cervical cancer imaging on an ultra-high-field 7.0-T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) system using an endorectal antenna of 4.7-mm thickness. METHODS: A feasibility study on 20 stage IB1-IIB cervical cancer patients was conducted. All underwent pre-treatment 1.5-T MRI. At 7.0-T MRI, an external transmit/receive array with seven dipole antennae and a single endorectal monopole receive antenna were used. Discomfort levels were assessed. Following individualised phase-based B1+ shimming, T2-weighted turbo spin echo sequences were completed. RESULTS: Patients had stage IB1 (n = 9), IB2 (n = 4), IIA1 (n = 1) or IIB (n = 6) cervical cancer. Discomfort (ten-point scale) was minimal at placement and removal of the endorectal antenna with a median score of 1 (range, 0-5) and 0 (range, 0-2) respectively. Its use did not result in adverse events or pre-term session discontinuation. To demonstrate feasibility, T2-weighted acquisitions from 7.0-T MRI are presented in comparison to 1.5-T MRI. Artefacts on 7.0-T MRI were due to motion, locally destructive B1 interference, excessive B1 under the external antennae and SENSE reconstruction. CONCLUSIONS: High-resolution T2-weighted 7.0-T MRI of stage IB1-IIB cervical cancer is feasible. The addition of an endorectal antenna is well tolerated by patients. KEY POINTS: * High resolution T 2 -weighted 7.0-T MRI of the inner female pelvis is challenging * We demonstrate a feasible approach for T 2 -weighted 7.0-T MRI of cervical cancer * An endorectal monopole receive antenna is well tolerated by participants * The endorectal antenna did not lead to adverse events or session discontinuation.
27245707	Overall accuracy of cervical cytology and clinicopathological significance of LSIL cells in ASC-H cytology.	OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study were (i) to investigate the diagnostic accuracy of Papanicolaou (Pap) smears and (ii) to evaluate the clinicopathological significance of the presence of low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) cells in atypical squamous cells cannot exclude high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) (ASC-H) cytology. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed paired cytological and histological findings from 3141 patients. ASC-H cytology was classified as either ASC-H or LSIL with some features suggestive of the presence of a concurrent HSIL (LSIL-H). Clinicopathological characteristics were evaluated through a retrospective study and meta-analysis. RESULTS: The accuracy of the cytological diagnosis was 93.7% (2942 of 3141 cases). The positive predictive value (PPV) of ASC-H for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or worse (CIN 2+ ) was 51.4%. In cases of LSIL-H, CIN 2+ histology was more prevalent in the pre-menopausal period (19-44 years) than in peri- and postmenopausal periods (older than 45 years) (P = 0.024). There was no difference in the ability of LSIL-H and ASC-H to predict CIN 2+. CONCLUSION: The Pap smear is a good cervical cancer screening method. Although there was no difference in the predictive value for CIN 2+ between LSIL-H and ASC-H, the presence of definite LSIL cells was more predictive of CIN 2+ in younger patients than in older patients.
27245581	A case of right-sided Bochdalek hernia incidentally diagnosed in a gastric cancer patient.	BACKGROUND: Bochdalek hernia (BH) is generally congenital, presenting with respiratory distress. However, this pathology is rarely detected in adults. Some adult cases of BH present with symptoms attributed to the hernia, but incidental detection of BH is increasing among asymptomatic adults due to advances in imaging modalities. This report presents the management of incidental BH patients detected in the preoperative period of gastric cancer. CASE PRESENTATION: An asymptomatic 76-year-old woman was diagnosed with advanced gastric cancer during follow-up after radiotherapy for uterine cervical cancer. Computed tomography (CT) was performed to exclude metastatic gastric cancer, incidentally detecting right-sided BH. We planned distal gastrectomy with lymph node dissection for gastric cancer and simultaneous repair of BH using a laparoscopic approach. We performed laparoscopic gastrectomy for gastric cancer and investigated the right-sided BH to assess whether repair during surgery was warranted. Herniation of the liver into the right hemithorax was observed, but was followed-up without surgical repair because the right hepatic lobe was adherent to the remnant right anterior hemidiaphragm and covered the huge defect in the right hemidiaphragm. No intra- or postoperative pneumothorax was observed during pneumoperitoneum. CONCLUSION: Regardless of symptoms, repair of adult BH is generally recommended to prevent visceral incarceration. However, BH in asymptomatic adults appears to be more common than previously reported in the literature. Surgeons need to consider the management of incidental BH encountered during thoracic or abdominal surgery.
27245463	Review of Cytology Practice at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital before and after High-Risk Human Papillomavirus Testing.	OBJECTIVE: We performed a retrospective review of Papanicolaou (Pap) testing to assess whether the cytology practice in our institution was affected by the introduction of high-risk (HR) human papillomavirus (HPV) assays over time. STUDY DESIGN: Cytology, HPV and histopathology records were retrieved from our laboratory information system from 2003 to 2015. Records for Digene Hybrid Capture 2(R), Hologic Cervista(R) and Roche Cobas(R) HPV assays were obtained. A 3-month follow-up for HPV detected cases was performed, and results were correlated with cytology and biopsies. A 1-year follow-up of HPV 16/18 and other HR HPV detected cases was also performed. RESULTS: From 2008 to 2015, a noticeable decrease in Pap testing volume occurred, from 11,792 to 4,664, while the percentage of HPV testing increased from 19 to 59%. Similar HPV detection rates and follow-up results for both reflex and cotesting were observed in the 3 HPV assays. CONCLUSIONS: The decrease in Pap testing was due to the lengthening of the test interval when cotesting results were negative. Practitioners adhering to guidelines accounts for increased molecular testing volume. A trend towards higher-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia in the follow-up of detected HPV 16/18 was noted. So far there has been no demand for HPV as a stand-alone test.
27244269	Cloning and Expression of L1 Protein Human Papillomavirus Type 31 Isolated from Iranian Patients in Escherichia coli.	Human papillomavirus (HPV), a major pathogen of human cervical cancer, contains a full-length L1 gene encoding its surface capsid protein. One group of potential vaccine candidates against this virus in Iranian patients is based on surface protein components such as HPV31 L1 protein that can make virus-like particles (VLPs). The high immunity response stimulation of this effecter VLP was observed in host, suggesting that the individual characteristics of a particular effecter may require empirical testing for vaccination. In the present study, we decided to clone and express HPV31 L1 protein to investigate its use as a subunit vaccine and furthermore to insert the gene into an Escherichia coli background so as to analyze production of this recombinant protein. We report the presentation of HPV31 in 100 cervical lesion tissue samples based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Type of lesion, age, and other characteristics were reviewed and confirmed by a pathologist. The sequence from L1 genes of HPV was selected using special primers. The gene encoding the major capsid protein L1 was used for subcloning in pTG19-T and pET-32a plasmid. The recombinant protein expression was confirmed by RT-PCR using L1 primers and detected by absorption sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and immunoblot testing. The results presented here offer new insights into the in vivo response of HPV31 in Iranian patients and European models. On the other hand, the use of recombinant L1 protein for Iranian patient protection as well as vaccination studies will permit testing of this antigen protection rate and open the way to the discovery of protein biomarkers for monitoring clinical and subclinical cervical cancers.
27243143	The Use of the Colposcopically Directed Punch Biopsy in Clinical Practice: A Survey of British Society of Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology (BSCCP)-Accredited Colposcopists.	OBJECTIVES: The colposcopically directed punch biopsy has been an integral component of colposcopic practice. In light of the changing landscape of the cervical screening programme, a study was conducted to investigate the current practice of British Society of Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology-accredited colposcopists on technique and rationale for performing a punch biopsy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A web-based questionnaire survey was e-mailed to all British Society of Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology-accredited colposcopists. Questions included selection criteria for performing a punch biopsy, number of biopsies, and technique. Results were analyzed by specialty, experience, and workload. RESULTS: A total of 749 colposcopists responded, 50.2% of the 1,493 total. The respondents were obstetrician and gynecologists (42.9%), gynecologists/oncologists (33.6%), and nurse colposcopists (19.8%). Most colposcopists (78.3%) had more than 5-year colposcopy experience and saw in excess of 11 new cases (73.4%) of abnormal cervical cytology/month. Most colposcopists (56%) aimed to take 2 biopsies to diagnose cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, and very few (16.2%) reported routinely taking random biopsies from normal areas of cervix. Looking at the trends in management in the case scenarios, there was a lower threshold for performing punch biopsy before large loop excision of the transformation zone in younger (age, <25 years) or nulliparous women versus older women (age, >40 years; p < .05). Colposcopists were more likely to take biopsies in women with low-grade cytology/colposcopic findings (71.2%, always or most of the times) as compared with high-grade cytology/colposcopic findings (40.3%, never or rarely). CONCLUSIONS: Colposcopically directed punch biopsy is routinely used by colposcopists; however, techniques, number of biopsies taken, and rationale for performing a biopsy vary greatly between colposcopists.
27243140	See-and-Treat for High-Grade Cytology: Do Young Women Have Different Rates of High-Grade Histology?	OBJECTIVE: To compare rates of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 or greater (CIN3+) between women aged 21 to 24 and women aged 25 or older undergoing a see-and-treat strategy for high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) cytology. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, women treated with a see-and-treat loop electrosurgical excisional procedure (LEEP) for HSIL cytology at our university-based colposcopy clinic between 2008 and 2013 were identified. Data collected included age, race, parity, smoking status, method of contraception, history of abnormal cytology, HIV status, and LEEP histology. Cohorts were compared using Pearson chi-squared test of association and Fisher exact test. RESULTS: Three hundred sixty-nine women were included in this analysis. The mean age was 30 (SD, 7.2; range, 21-56). Ninety-seven women (26.3%) were 21 to 24 years old. The rate of CIN3 in all women undergoing a see-and-treat LEEP for HSIL cytology was 65.9% (95% CI, 60.8-70.5). The rate of CIN 2 was 15.2% (95% CI, 11.9-19.2). Three women (1.1%) had invasive carcinoma. There was no difference in risk of CIN3+ in the young women compared with women aged 25 years or older (RR, 1.37; 95% CI, 0.92-2.02). Within this see-and-treat population, there was no correlation between presence of CIN3+ and race, smoking, contraception, or HIV status. CONCLUSIONS: Most women undergoing see-and-treat for HSIL cytology will have CIN3 on final histology. In this large cohort, women aged 21 to 24 did not have lower rates of CIN3 compared with women aged 25 and older, suggesting that see-and-treat is still a valid treatment option for the prevention of invasive disease in young women.
27243139	See-and-Treat Loop Electrosurgical Excision Procedure for High-Grade Cervical Cytology: Are We Overtreating?	OBJECTIVES: To report the overtreatment rate for see-and-treat versus 3-step conventional strategy (cervical cytology, colposcopic biopsies, then LEEP) for patients with high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) cytology. Our second aim was to identify risk factors for overtreatment. METHODS: We included 178 women with HSIL cytology from our university-based colposcopy clinic who underwent LEEP between 2007 and 2014. Overtreatment was defined as cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 1 or less on LEEP specimen. Differences between treatment groups were compared using chi-square test, 2-sample t test, or Mann-Whitney rank-sum test as appropriate. RESULTS: CIN2+ was found in 69 (80%) of women in the see-and-treat group and 69 (75%) of the conventional management group (P = 0.093), with overtreatment in 17 (20%) and 23 (25%, P = 0.403), respectively. Women who underwent see-and-treat (n = 86) were older (mean age, 36 vs 31 years; P = 0.007), and a greater proportion completed childbearing (30% vs 13%, P = 0.024). There were no differences in top hat excision; however, a higher proportion of the see-and-treat group had CIN2+ in endocervical samples (54% vs 27%, P = 0.047). Overtreatment, regardless of management strategy, was associated with age at time of LEEP, where older women were more likely to be overtreated (median age, 37 vs 32 years, respectively; OR, 1.04; 95% CI, 1.01-1.08; P = 0.011). CONCLUSIONS: A see-and-treat strategy minimizes risk of loss to follow-up with a similar overtreatment rate compared with conventional management. With CIN2+ in some three-fourths of women with HSIL, a see-and-treat should be favored especially when adherence to follow-up is questionable.
27241922	Radical hysterectomy after chemoradiation in FIGO stage III cervical cancer patients versus chemoradiation and brachytherapy: Complications and 3-years survival.	BACKGROUND: To compare patterns and rates of early and late complications, and survival outcome in FIGO stage III cervical cancer patients underwent to radical hysterectomy after chemo-radiation (CT-RT) vs. chemo-radiation alone. METHODS: Between May 1996 and April 2013 150 FIGO stage III cervical cancer patients were treated. We divide patients according to type of treatment: 77 were submitted to standard treatment (Group A), and 73 to completion hysterectomy after chemo-radiation (Group B). RESULTS: The baseline characteristics of the 2 groups were superimposable. We observed lower intra-operative and treatment-related early urinary and gastro-intestinal complications in Group B with respect to Group A (p < 0.001). Vascular complications were registered only in Group B (p < 0.001). We found a significantly higher rate of local recurrences in the Group A than in the Group B (p < 0.002). We registered 29 deaths in the Group A and 22 in the Group B (p = 0.021). The 3-years disease-free survival rate in the Group A and in the Group B was 62.9% and 68.3%, respectively (p = 0.686), and the 3-years overall survival rate in the Group A and in the Group B was 63.2% and 67.7%, respectively (p = 0.675). CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms that radical hysterectomy after CT-RT is an effective therapeutic approach for advanced cervical cancer. Further prospective and randomized studies should be performed in order to solve the question about the standard approach, and how the different pattern of complication could impact on the quality of life.
27241146	[Application of Van-Clear and xylene in the detection of cervical hTERC gene by fluorescence in situ hybridization].	OBJECTIVE: To observe the effect of Van-Clear on vamplification of human telomerase RNA component (hTERC) gene in cervical tissues by fluorescence in situ hybridization, and to determine the potential for Van-Clear to replace xylene. METHODS: A total of 278 specimens of cervix uteri were collected from inpatients of Department of Gynaecology in Boai Hospital of Zhongshan from January to February, 2015, with 81 cases of normal specimens, 68 cases of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) I, 57cases of CIN2, 42 cases of CIN3 and 30 cases of cervical invasive cancer. Double samples were collected from the same region. Fluorescence in situ hybridization was applied to detect the changes in the amplification of hTERC gene in 2 groups of specimens from the cervical biopsy. RESULTS: Differences in the positive expression rate of hTERC gene between the 2 groups of cervical lesions at all levels were not statistically significant (P>0.05). CONCLUSION: There is no significant difference in the positive rate of hTERC gene expression between the slices made by Van-clear and xylene. As an environmental-friend product, Van-Clear possesses certain value in detection of cervical hTERC gene by fluorescence in situ hybridization.
27241107	Peutz-Jeghers Syndrome: Pathobiology, Pathologic Manifestations, and Suggestions for Recommending Genetic Testing in Pathology Reports.	Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (PJS), in most cases, is attributed to mutation in STK11/LKB1 and is clinically characterized by gastrointestinal hamartomatous polyposis, mucocutaneous pigmentation, and predisposition to certain neoplasms. There are currently no recommended gynecologic screening or clinical surveillance guidelines beyond those recommended for the general population; however, cervical cytology samples must be examined with a high level of suspicion for cervical adenocarcinoma. It is considered prudent to note the established association with PJS and recommend referral for genetic counseling. Complete surgical excision after a diagnosis of atypical lobular endocervical glandular hyperplasia is recommended.
27241106	Gynecologic Manifestations of the DICER1 Syndrome.	Patients with germline DICER1 mutations are at increased risk of developing a wide range of tumors, most of which are relatively rare in the general population. In the gynecologic tract, these include ovarian sex cord-stromal tumors, particularly Sertoli-Leydig cell tumor, and embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma of the cervix. In some cases, these are the sentinel neoplasms. DICER1-associated tumors may have distinctive morphologic appearances that may prompt the pathologist to consider an underlying tumor predisposition syndrome and therefore consideration of genetic evaluation in the patient and her family.
27240268	Quantitative and mixed analyses to identify factors that affect cervical cancer screening uptake among lesbian and bisexual women and transgender men.	AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: The purposes of this study were to measure the prevalence of, and identify factors associated with, cervical cancer screening among a sample of lesbian, bisexual and queer women, and transgender men. BACKGROUND: Past research has found that lesbian, bisexual and queer women underuse cervical screening service. Because deficient screening remains the most significant risk factor for cervical cancer, it is essential to understand the differences between routine and nonroutine screeners. DESIGN: A convergent-parallel mixed methods design. METHODS: A convenience sample of 21- to 65-year-old lesbian and bisexual women and transgender men were recruited in the USA from August-December 2014. Quantitative data were collected via a 48-item Internet questionnaire (N = 226), and qualitative data were collected through in-depth telephone interviews (N = 20) and open-ended questions on the Internet questionnaire. RESULTS: Seventy-three per cent of the sample was routine cervical screeners. The results showed that a constellation of factors influence the use of cervical cancer screening among lesbian, bisexual and queer women. Some of those factors overlap with the general female population, whereas others are specific to the lesbian, bisexual or queer identity. Routine screeners reported feeling more welcome in the health care setting, while nonroutine screeners reported more discrimination related to their sexual orientation and gender expression. Routine screeners were also more likely to 'out' to their provider. The quantitative and qualitative factors were also compared and contrasted. CONCLUSIONS: Many of the factors identified in this study to influence cervical cancer screening relate to the health care environment and to interactions between the patient and provider. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Nurses should be involved with creating welcoming environments for lesbian, bisexual and queer women and their partners. Moreover, nurses play a large role in patient education and should promote self-care behaviours among lesbian women and transgender men.
27238806	[In Process Citation].	Introduccion y objetivos: la terapia con antioxidantes durante la quimioterapia y radioterapia en pacientes con cancer cervicouterino es controvertida. Mientras existe evidencia que sugiere que el uso de antioxidantes disminuye los efectos secundarios propios del tratamiento contra el cancer, hay datos que sugieren que los antioxidantes incrementan el riesgo de recurrencia de cancer por la afectacion de la terapia de los tratamientos. Metodos: se dirigio un estudio clinico controlado en pacientes con cancer cervicouterino que fueron suplementados con una mezcla de antioxidantes o placebo, con seguimiento por 4 anos posteriores al termino de su tratamiento antineoplasico para evaluar el efecto de los antioxidantes en la recurrencia. Tomamos datos de niveles de hemoglobina y albumina. Se analizaron las diferencias entre grupos con la prueba de Chi-cuadrado, la sobrevida se calculo con un analisis multivariado por medio de regresion de COX. Resultados: se dio seguimiento a 103 pacientes con cancer cervicouterino en etapa clinica IIB y IIIB de los cuales 48% fueron tratados con suplementacion de antioxidantes y el 52% con placebo, originalmente y de estos se dio seguimiento a 88 pacientes durante 4 anos. El 23,9% de los pacientes tratados presentaron recurrencia por cancer mientras que el 76,1% no la presento. El 21,6% de los pacientes presentaron metastasis, el 8% de los pacientes pertenecio al grupo de antioxidantes y el 15,9% al grupo placebo (p > 0,05). Implicaciones para los pacientes supervivientes: la suplementacion con antioxidantes aparentemente no interfiere con la recurrencia por cancer, sin embargo no hay evidencia suficiente para probarlo. Posiblemente una dosis distinta sea la clave para un mejor efecto, pero seran necesarios futuros estudios que prueben efectos sobre otro tipo de dosis. Conclusiones: la suplementacion con antioxidantes durante el tratamiento de pacientes con cancer cervicouterino no tiene efectos en la recurrencia por cancer a 4 anos de seguimiento.
27238361	Invasive cervical cancer accompanied by IgG4-related disease.	IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD) is a systemic disease that affects multiple organs and generates nodules or thickening. Discriminating these diseases from malignancy is important because glucocorticoid treatment is effective for patients with IgG4-RD. Coexistence of IgG4-RD with various malignant diseases has been reported, but there are few reports with regard to gynecologic malignant diseases. We encountered a case of invasive cervical cancer stage IIB accompanied by IgG4-RD. The patient was a 46-year-old woman. On pelvic magnetic resonance imaging, fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography and computed tomography, systemic multiple lymph node swelling was seen, including in the neck and the mediastinum in addition to uterine cervix. Diagnosis (and hence, appropriate treatment choice) was achieved on pathology of the submandibular gland and uterus, and analysis of serum IgG4. IgG4-RD should be suspected in patients presenting with malignancy and unusual multiple lymph node swelling.
27236093	Endovascular Repair of an Iliac Ureteroarterial Fistula with Late Stent Thrombosis and Migration into the Bladder.	BACKGROUND: Ureteroarterial fistulas are rare. We describe a case of ureteral-arterial fistulas (UAF) repaired with an endovascular stent graft and examine late complications associated with the procedure. CASE REPORT: A 37-year-old woman with a history of complicated locally invasive cervical cancer treated with chemoradiation presented initially with right leg rest pain and chronic intermittent gross hematuria. She was found to have an ureteroarterial fistula and underwent successful endovascular exclusion with a covered stent with resolution of her symptoms. She returned 1 year later with stent-graft thrombosis manifesting as lower extremity rest pain, requiring a femoral-femoral bypass. She then returned 6 months later with imaging evidence of extravascular migration of the stent graft into the bladder. Because of a poor prognosis of recurrent gynecologic cancer, extraction was not attempted, and she underwent complete urinary diversion. CONCLUSIONS: UAFs are a rare occurrence but may be treated successfully with endovascular stent grafting. Despite technical success, late complications such as stent thrombosis may occur even with anticoagulation. Extravascular stent migration may occur in the presence of a chronically dilated ureter.
27235709	Curcumin hampers the antitumor effect of vinblastine via the inhibition of microtubule dynamics and mitochondrial membrane potential in HeLa cervical cancer cells.	BACKGROUND: Curcumin, a major component of curry powder, which is a natural polyphenol product extracted from rhizoma curcumae longae, interacts with a specific binding site on microtubules. Vinblastine is an antitumor drug that induces microtubule depolymerization. PURPOSE: We investigated whether curcumin influences the antitumor effect of vinblastine in HeLa human cervical cancer cells. STUDY DESIGN: Changes in microtubule filaments were visualized by immuno-staining. Cell death was determined by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide(MTT) or water-soluble tetrazolium(WST) assay. Apoptotic cell formation was assessed by flow cytometry after staining cells with propidium iodide(PI) and/or Annexin V or with 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole(DAPI). Reactive oxygen species(ROS) were also measured by flow cytometry using dichloro-dihydro-fluorescein diacetate(DCF-DA). JC-1 was used to determine mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP). RESULTS: When cells were pretreated with curcumin, microtubule filaments were disordered. Vinblastine-induced microtubule depolymerization and cell death were reduced in HeLa human cervical cancer cells pretreated with curcumin compared to the control. The decrease in cell death was much greater in cells pretreated with curcumin compared to cotreatment or post-treatment. DNA condensation by vinblastine was also decreased in curcumin-pretreated cells. Curcumin reduced ROS production by vinblastine. However, no changes in vinblastine-mediated microtubule depolymerization were detected upon N-acetylcysteine(NAC) treatment. In contrast, vinblastine-induced MMP collapse was inhibited by pretreatment with curcumin or NAC. These findings suggest that vinblastine-induced tumor cell death might be inhibited by curcumin via ROS-independent microtubule dynamics and ROS-dependent MMP collapse. It also suggests that microtubule dynamics could be necessary for the optimal antitumor activity of vinblastine. Our results suggest that patients treated with vinblastine should not consume curcumin.
27233813	The association between p16 and Ki-67 immunohistostaining and the progression of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2.	OBJECTIVE: To compare the frequency of p16- and Ki-67-positive cells on immunohistostaining among women with progression, persistence, or regression of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 (CIN2). METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted of women with CIN2 diagnosed by histology who were treated at a university hospital in Japan during 2004-2011. The immunostaining patterns for p16 and Ki-67 were analyzed and compared between patients with disease progression, persistence, or regression. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to evaluate the progression rates stratified by immunostaining, and multivariate analysis of risk factors for progression was performed using the Cox proportional hazards model. RESULTS: The analysis included 59 women with progression, 35 women with persistence, and 28 women with regression. Deep p16 expression (staining in more than half of the cervical intraepithelial compartment) and positive Ki-67 staining in more than 50% of cells were significantly more common among women with progression than among those with regression. The risk factors for progression of CIN2 were deep p16 expression (P<0.001) and a Ki-67 ratio of more than 50% (P<0.001). CONCLUSION: Among women with CIN2, positive immunohistostaining for p16 and Ki-67 was strongly associated with disease progression.
27233002	Adjuvant effect of docetaxel on HPV16 L2E6E7 fusion protein vaccine in a mouse model.	We previously demonstrated that the antineoplastic agent docetaxel enhanced the immune response to an influenza vaccine. This study evaluated the adjuvant effect of docetaxel (DOC) on the therapeutic efficacy of HPV16 L2E6E7 fusion protein (HPV-LFP) in mice inoculated with TC-1 cells. The results demonstrated that docetaxel significantly enhanced the therapeutic effect of HPV-LFP on TC-1 cell-induced tumors in mice. The injection of HPV-LFP in combination with docetaxel in TC-1 tumor-bearing mice significantly reduced tumor volume and weight, and a greater percent survival was detected than mice treated with HPV-LFP alone. The inhibition of tumors was associated with significantly increased serum antigen-specific IgG and isotypes, activated CTLs, increased IFN-gamma-secreting T cells, and decreased Treg cells and IL-10-secreting cells in spleen. In addition, down-regulation of IL-10, VEGF and STAT3, up-regulation of IFN-gamma and decreased Treg cells in the tumor microenvironment may also important contributing factors to the antitumor effect. It may be valuable to use a DOC-containing water to dilute HPV-LFP powder before injection in patients because of its excellent adjuvant effect on HPV-LFP and solubility in water.
27229487	Analysis of the association of HOTAIR single nucleotide polymorphism (rs920778) and risk of cervical cancer.	We recently demonstrated that overexpression of HOTAIR (Hox transcript antisense intergenic RNA) was associated with tumor progression and radio-resistance in human cervical cancer. Considering the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs920778 (C>T) could influence HOTAIR expression and cancer predisposition in other malignancies, we herein investigated the association between rs920778 status and cervical cancer susceptibility in a Chinese population. Using the specific TaqMan PCR assay, we genotyped rs920778 in 215 cervical cancer patients and 430 age-matched healthy controls. As shown in our data, TT genotype of rs920778 was significantly correlated with the upregulation of HOTAIR (p = 0.008). Compared with the healthy control, TT genotype and T allele notably indicated a much higher risk of cervical cancer [TT genotype: odds ratio (OR) = 2.186, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.378-3.466, p = 0.003; T allele: OR = 1.556, 95% CI = 1.221-1.981]. In addition, we also found that the TT genotype of rs920778 was correlated with advanced tumor stage (p = 0.039), highly histological grade (p = 0.013), lympho node metastasis (p < 0.001) and positive infection of high risk HPV (p < 0.001). Among the patients who underwent concurrent chemo-radiotherapy, TT genotype carriers present notably resistance to the combination of EBRT + ICBT + cisplatin (p = 0.023). In conclusion, we firstly reported that TT genotype of HOTAIR rs920778 was significantly associated with the cervical cancer susceptibility. Moreover, the TT genotype of rs920778 might be a potent prognostic marker in cervical cancer patients.
27225481	Yin Yang 1 is associated with cancer stem cell transcription factors (SOX2, OCT4, BMI1) and clinical implication.	The transcription factor Yin Yang 1 (YY1) is frequently overexpressed in cancerous tissues compared to normal tissues and has regulatory roles in cell proliferation, cell viability, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, metastasis and drug/immune resistance. YY1 shares many properties with cancer stem cells (CSCs) that drive tumorigenesis, metastasis and drug resistance and are regulated by overexpression of certain transcription factors, including SOX2, OCT4 (POU5F1), BMI1 and NANOG. Based on these similarities, it was expected that YY1 expression would be associated with SOX2, OCT4, BMI1, and NANOG's expressions and activities. Data mining from the proteomic tissue-based datasets from the Human Protein Atlas were used for protein expression patterns of YY1 and the four CSC markers in 17 types of cancer, including both solid and hematological malignancies. A close association was revealed between the frequency of expressions of YY1 and SOX2 as well as SOX2 and OCT4 in all cancers analyzed. Two types of dynamics were identified based on the nature of their association, namely, inverse or direct, between YY1 and SOX2. These two dynamics define distinctive patterns of BMI1 and OCT4 expressions. The relationship between YY1 and SOX2 expressions as well as the expressions of BMI1 and OCT4 resulted in the classification of four groups of cancers with distinct molecular signatures: (1) Prostate, lung, cervical, endometrial, ovarian and glioma cancers (YY1(lo)SOX2(hi)BMI1(hi)OCT4(hi)) (2) Skin, testis and breast cancers (YY1(hi)SOX2(lo)BMI1(hi)OCT4(hi)) (3) Liver, stomach, renal, pancreatic and urothelial cancers (YY1(lo)SOX2(lo)BMI1(hi)OCT4(hi)) and (4) Colorectal cancer, lymphoma and melanoma (YY1(hi)SOX2(hi)BMI1(lo)OCT4(hi)). A regulatory loop is proposed consisting of the cross-talk between the NF-kB/PI3K/AKT pathways and the downstream inter-regulation of target gene products YY1, OCT4, SOX2 and BMI1.
27225188	Expression quantitative trait loci in long non-coding RNA PAX8-AS1 are associated with decreased risk of cervical cancer.	Paired box 8 (PAX8) is a crucial nephric-lineage transcription factor, and its aberrant expression has been detected in various types of cancer including Mullerian carcinomas. PAX8 antisense RNA 1 (PAX8-AS1), a potential regulator of PAX8, contains specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that may represent expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) for PAX8. In this study, we hypothesized that these eQTLs SNPs in PAX8-AS1 may influence the risk of cervical cancer. A case-control study of 1486 cervical cancer patients and 1536 cancer-free controls was conducted to identify the associations between two eQTLs SNPs (rs4848320 and rs1110839) and cervical cancer. Logistic regression analyses revealed that variant allele T of rs4848320 (recessive model: adjusted OR = 0.61, 95 % CI = 0.38-0.97, P = 0.027) and G of rs1110839 (additive model: adjusted OR = 0.88, 95 % CI = 0.79-0.99, P = 0.032) were associated with decreased risk of cervical cancer. Moreover, the haplotype containing variant alleles of the two SNPs significantly decreased the risk of cervical cancer compared to the most frequent haplotype (adjusted OR = 0.82, 95 % CI = 0.70-0.95, P = 0.009). These findings indicate that PAX8 eQTLs SNPs may serve as novel susceptibility markers for cervical cancer.
27224532	Natural Antibodies to Human Papillomavirus 16 and Recurrence of Vulvar High-Grade Intraepithelial Neoplasia (VIN3).	OBJECTIVES: Approximately 30% of women treated for squamous high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN3), often associated with human papillomavirus (HPV), have recurrent disease. In this study, we assess predictors of recurrence that may provide targets for early prevention or treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Women with VIN3 who participated in a previous population-based case-control study with blood and tumor samples completed a follow-up telephone interview an average of 5 years after initial diagnosis. The risk of recurrence was determined by proportional hazards modeling. RESULTS: Women with VIN3 in the follow-up study (n = 65) were similar to women with VIN3 in the parent study (n = 215) with regard to age at primary diagnosis, level of current cigarette smoking (>60%), and lifetime number of partners. We found that 22 (33.8%) of 65 participants had a vulvar recurrence and that 73.4% recurred within 3 years of treatment. Recurrences occurred more often among women with common warts in the decade before diagnosis (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.5, 95% CI = 1.1-5.8) and among those with a previous anogenital cancer (HR = 2.7, 95% CI = 1.2-6.3). Interestingly, recurrence was less frequent among women who mounted a natural antibody response to HPV16 (HR = 0.4, 95% CI = 0.2-0.9). CONCLUSIONS: These data provide strong preliminary evidence that VIN3 recurrence was less frequent among those with HPV16 antibodies. Vaccination with the currently licensed HPV vaccine as part of adjunctive therapy for VIN3 would increase antibody response and may decrease risk of recurrence. Randomized controlled trials are needed to determine whether HPV vaccination is effective against VIN3 recurrence.
27222685	[Analysis of predictors of malignancy of nodular goiters: about 500 cases].	Thyroid nodules are very common and less than 10% of them are malignant. They pose a serious diagnostic and therapeutic problem with respect to their benign or malignant nature. The study of some clinical and paraclinical factors for presumed malignancy makes it possible to codify appropriate therapeutic strategy. The aim of this study was to investigate predictors of malignancy in nodular goiters and to compare our results with those reported in the literature. This retrospective study consisted of 500 cases of nodular goiter operated in the Department of Otorhinolaryngology (ear, nose and throat or ENT) and Head and Neck Surgery at Avicenne military hospital in Marrakech between 2006 and 2012. The percentage of cancers was 6,8%. The average age of our patients was 46 years, with a sex-ratio of 5 (F/H). The hard nature of the nodule was present in 94,4% of the cases of cancer by palpation; irregular boundaries were present in 64.70% of the cases of cancer. Three nodules were fixed and malignant. Cervical lymphadenopathy were observed in 8 patients, 7 of which had cancer. Ultrasound examination showed hypoechoic appearance in 61,8% of the malignant nodules, with smooth-edges in 88,24% of the cases. Intranodular vascularization was found in 35,3% of the cases of cancers, with microcalcifications in 55,9% of the cases. Perinodular hypoechoic halo was incomplete in 73,5% of the cases of cancer. Our patients were euthyroid in 84,6% of the cases. Predictors of malignancy in nodular goiters were present in our first clinical study: patients over the age of 60 years, hard consistency of nodule, fixity, irregular and poorly defined character by palpation, as well as presence of cervical adenopathy on examination; and echographic features: hypoechoic character, smooth-edges, presence of microcalcifications and visualization of intranodular vascularization with or without peri-nodular vascularization. Although some of these factors are highly predictive of malignancy, only final histology provides certainty of diagnosis. Clinicians should base their clinical practice and patient management on a body of clinical arguments.
27222684	Risk factors and distribution of oncogenic strains of human papilloma virus in women presenting for cervical cancer screening in Port Harcourt, Nigeria.	INTRODUCTION: Human papilloma virus(HPV) accounts for most cases of cervical cancer with high risk HPV(hrHPV) genotypes largely responsible. The objective is to ascertain the distribution of oncogenic strains of human papilloma virus genotypes and predisposing risk factors in women presenting for cervical cancer screening in Nigeria. METHODS: A cross-sectional study of 80 women who presented for cervical cancer screening. The biodata of the participants, the presence of risk factors to HPV were recorded and hrHPV were identified using PCR technique. The information obtained was processed using the SPSS version 20 software. Results were presented in tables, test of significance and association done using student's t-test and Odds ratio, with P value < 0.05 as significant. RESULTS: The age range of patients was 19-62 years with prevalence of hrHPV of 10%. HrHPV are more in patients with more than one life time sexual partner (OR 1.26,95%CI 0.13-29.99), multiple sexual partners (OR 1.55, 95% CI 0.28-8.70), early coitarche (OR 1.57, 95% CI 0.14-15.00) and previous STI (OR 150, 95%CI 9.53-1979. 62). Four hrHPV genotypes: 16, 18, 31 and 35 were detected. CONCLUSION: HPV genotype 18 was predominant in Port Harcourt, Nigeria. High risk sexual behaviours are associated with acquisition of hrHPV.
27222318	Incorporating a 3-dimensional printer into the management of early-stage cervical cancer.	We used a 3-dimensional (3D) printer to create anatomical replicas of real lesions and tested its application in cervical cancer. Our study patient decided to undergo radical hysterectomy after seeing her 3D model which was then used to plan and simulate this surgery. Using 3D printers to create patient-specific 3D tumor models may aid cervical cancer patients make treatment decisions. This technology will lead to better surgical and oncological outcomes for cervical cancer patients. J. Surg. Oncol. 2016;114:150-152. (c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
27221920	Post-Loop Electrosurgical Excision Procedure Complications in Srinagarind Hospital.	The purpose of this study was to evaluate the prevalence and predictors of post-Loop Electrosurgical Excision Procedure (LEEP) complications in Srinagarind Hospital, Khon Kaen, Thailand. Retrospective chart review was performed for 200 patients undergoing LEEP during January 2012 to February 2013. Their mean age was 45 years-old. Fifty-three (26.5%) were menopausal. The three most common preceding abnormal cervical cytology were high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL; 50%), atypical squamous cell cannot exclude HSIL (ASC-H; 10.5%), and low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL; 10%). The overall complications prevalence rate was 16.5% (95%CI, 11.4-21.6). Complications included bleeding (11%; 95%CI, 6.66-15.3), offensive discharge (4%; 95%CI, 1.28-6.72), and pelvic inflammatory disease (1.5%; 95%CI, 0.18-3.18). Only mode of delivery was an independent predictor of post-LEEP complications. Women with previous caesarean sections carried an increased risk of complications by 3.9 times (95%CI, 1.21-12.56) compared with vaginal delivery. In conclusion, LEEP is generally safe with an acceptable complication rate. Previous caesarean section was the only independent predictor for post-LEEP complications. However, this predictor still needs prudent evaluation as no clear cause-effect relationship was identified.
27221897	Risk Factors for Cervical Cancer and CIN3 in Jewish Women in Israel - Two Case Control Studies.	PURPOSE: The aim of the study was to identify risk and protective factors/markers for cervical cancer and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 3 (CIN3) in Israeli Jewish women in order to settle the discrepancy of low incidence rate of cervical cancer and relatively high incidence rate of CIN3. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted two case control studies, which examined the association between potential risk and protective factors/markers for cervical cancer or CIN3 using self administered detailed questionnaires. RESULTS: For studying cervical cancer, 40 cases and 40 matched controls were interviewed. In the univariable and multivariable analyses older age, depression or anxiety and ever smoking seemed to act as independent risk factors/markers, while older age at first intercourse was protective. For studying CIN3, 99 cases and 79 controls were interviewed. Multivariable analysis has demonstrated that being born in Israel, depression or anxiety and ever smoking were independent risk factors/markers for CIN3. CONCLUSIONS: The risk factors/markers studied, that were associated with cervical cancer or CIN3 among Jewish women in Israel, are similar to those reported in other parts of the world, and do not explain the observed discrepancy of high in-situ cervical cancer rates and low invasive cervical cancer incidence in Israel.
27221835	Celecoxib, a COX-2 Selective Inhibitor, Induces Cell Cycle Arrest at the G2/M Phase in HeLa Cervical Cancer Cells.	Celecoxib, a selective inhibitor of COX-2, showed cytotoxic effects in many cancer cell lines including cervical cancer cells. This study investigated the effect of celecoxib on cell cycle arrest in HeLa cervical cancer cells through p53 expression. In vitro anticancer activity was determined with the 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5 diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) method. A double staining method was applied to investigate the mechanism of cell death, cell cycling was analyzed by flow cytometryand immunocytochemistry was employed to stain p53 expression in cells. Celecoxib showed strong cytotoxic effects and induced apoptosis with an IC50 value of 40 muM. It induced cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase by increasing level of p53 expression on HeLa cells.
27221560	Separation of type and grade in cervical tumours using non-mono-exponential models of diffusion-weighted MRI.	OBJECTIVES: Assessment of empirical diffusion-weighted MRI (DW-MRI) models in cervical tumours to investigate whether fitted parameters distinguish between types and grades of tumours. METHODS: Forty-two patients (24 squamous cell carcinomas, 14 well/moderately differentiated, 10 poorly differentiated; 15 adenocarcinomas, 13 well/moderately differentiated, two poorly differentiated; three rare types) were imaged at 3 T using nine b-values (0 to 800 s mm-2). Mono-exponential, stretched exponential, kurtosis, statistical, and bi-exponential models were fitted. Model preference was assessed using Bayesian Information Criterion analysis. Differences in fitted parameters between tumour types/grades and correlation between fitted parameters were assessed using two-way analysis of variance and Pearson's linear correlation coefficient, respectively. RESULTS: Non-mono-exponential models were preferred by 83 % of tumours with bi-exponential and stretched exponential models preferred by the largest numbers of tumours. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and diffusion coefficients from non-mono-exponential models were significantly lower in poorly differentiated tumours than well/moderately differentiated tumours. alpha (stretched exponential), K (kurtosis), f and D* (bi-exponential) were significantly different between tumour types. Strong correlation was observed between ADC and diffusion coefficients from other models. CONCLUSIONS: Non-mono-exponential models were preferred to the mono-exponential model in DW-MRI data from cervical tumours. Parameters of non-mono-exponential models showed significant differences between types and grades of tumours. KEY POINTS: * Non-mono-exponential DW-MRI models are preferred in the majority of cervical tumours. * Poorly differentiated cervical tumours exhibit lower diffusion coefficients than well/moderately differentiated tumours. * Non-mono-exponential model parameters alpha, K, f, and D* differ between tumour types. * Micro-structural features are likely to affect parameters in non-mono-exponential models differently.
27220396	Construction and functional analysis of an anti-human cervical carcinoma/anti-human CD3 single-chain bispecific antibody.	The aim of the present study was to construct a single-chain bispecific antibody (scBsAb) against cervical carcinoma and to investigate its biological activities. The scBsAb was constructed using a genetic cloning technique and antigen binding activities were detected by ELISA. The iodogen method was used to analyze the pharmacokinetics. The Rosette formation test was used to detect the binding ability between peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) and Cs1213 cervical cancer cells. In addition, the MTT method was performed to detect the killing effect of PBLs. The molecular weight of the scBsAb was ~60 kDa. The antigen binding activities of scBsAbs were compared with the antihuman cervical carcinoma antibody singlechain Fv fragment (CSAs1 scFv) and anticluster of differentiation (CD)3 scFv (P>0.05). In addition, a pharmacokinetics assay demonstrated that compared with the two corresponding scFvs, scBsAbs exhibited a significantly prolonged retention time in the body (P<0.01). In addition, the number of rosettes formed by PBLs and Cs1213 cells in the scBsAb group was markedly greater than that in the scFv groups or the RPMI1640 group (P<0.05 and P<0.01, respectively). The killing activity of PBLs against scBsAbmediated Cs1213 cells was significantly greater than that mediated by the other antibodies (P<0.05). When the concentration of scBsAb was 40 microg/ml, the killing rate was 64.5%. Thus, antihuman cervical carcinoma/antiCD3 scBsAbs may possess two types of antigen binding activity, prolong the duration in vivo and improve the killing activity of PBLs against cancer cells.
27217891	The profile of patients with obstructive uropathy in Cameroon: case of the Douala General Hospital.	INTRODUCTION: Obstructive uropathy can lead to irreversible kidney damage. The etiology largely determined by the patient's age can be benign or malignant. This study aimed at determining the profile and outcome of patients with obstructive uropathy in Cameroon. METHODS: A cross sectional study carried out in the urology unit of the Douala General Hospital, including patients with a diagnosis of obstructive uropathy seen from January 2004 to December 2013. Clinical profile, treatment and outcome data were obtained from patients records. RESULTS: Of the 229 patients included 69% were men, mean age 50 +/-18 years. Associated comorbidities were hypertension, diabetes, and HIV. Mean haemoglobin 8,40+/-2,4g/dl, mean GFR 10,3 +/-10ml/min, 94 (41%) patients needed emergency dialysis. Symptoms at presentation: asthenia (57%), anorexia (55%), loin pain (37%), vomiting (28%), oedema (20%), and anuria (15%). Urinary tract infection was present in 33 patients. Main aetiologies of obstruction: urolithiasis (35%), begnin prostatic hypertrophy (27%), prostatic cancer (12%), cervical cancer (16%), and congenital malformations (5%). Drainage was effective in 102 (45%) patients, 63 (28%) recovered completely, 91 (41%) were loss to follow up, 49 (22%) died and more women (p = 0.02). Mortality was associated with prostatic cancer (p = 0.000), cervical cancer (p = 0.004) and radiotherapy (p = 0.03). CONCLUSION: Patients with obstructive uropathy presented with significant impaired renal function. Main causes were urinary stones, prostatic hypertrophy, prostatic and cervical cancers. Renal recovery was poor, loss to follow up and mortality high. Specific strategies to target improvement in renal recovery and patient's survival are needed in this patient's group.
27217888	Visual inspection with acetic acid and Lugol's iodine in cervical cancer screening at the general referral hospital Kayembe in Mbuji-Mayi, Democratic Republic of Congo.	INTRODUCTION: Cervical cancer is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality of women from cancer in the developing World. It is the primary cause of reduced life expectancy in Sub-Saharan countries such as Democratic Republic of Congo. The aim of this work was to determinate the socio-demographic profile of women with precancerous and cancerous lesions of the cervix, to determinate the frequency of VIA and VILI positive cases and to show the challenges that can be faced in managing patients with abnormalities in the city of Mbuji-Mayi in the Democratic Republic of Congo. METHODS: As part of its activities, the "Association de Lutte contre le Cancer du Col uterin" (ALCC) organized a community outreach followed by free voluntary testing for cervical cancer for two weeks (26(th)March to 10(th) April 2011) at the General Referral Hospital Kayembe in Mbuji-Mayi (Democratic Republic of Congo). RESULTS: A total of 229 women were examined. 38% of tests (VIA + VILI) were positive with 6 clinically suspected cases of invasive cancer at stage 1 (7% of cases). Nearly 70% of patients were still of childbearing age and had started their first sexual intercourse before 18 years of age and 86% of cases were multiparous. Given the material, financial and technical constraints, 75% of patients were placed in a monitoring program of 9 months to 1 year (= expectation and another test) while 11% of them were selected for a biopsy to be locally practiced and sent to the pathologist. Nearly 8% of the cases were candidates for hysterectomy. CONCLUSION: Given the difficulties encountered and the frequency of positive tests, we recommend another study with a larger sample, improved working conditions (mainly equipment) and the association of another test such as the Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) test.
27215608	Type-Specific Identification of Genital Human Papillomavirus Infection in Women with Cytological Abnormality.	OBJECTIVES: To estimate the frequency of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and the genotype distribution of HPV among women with a Pap smear showing atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US) attending the Program for the Detection and Control of Cervical Cancer in Bogota, Colombia. STUDY DESIGN: Cervical samples from 200 women with an ASC-US Pap smear were analyzed for the presence of HPV DNA and genotype distribution using a commercial molecular technique (Linear Array(R); Roche Molecular Systems, USA). RESULTS: HPV infection was found in 140 women (70%). High-risk HPV types were present in 46.4% of the samples; 16.4% showed a low-risk HPV type, and 37.1% showed both. Of the positive samples, 42.9% were infected with a single viral genotype, whereas 57.1% exhibited multiple HPV infections. The most common HPV genotypes were HPV 16, 53, and 52 with a prevalence of 26.4, 16.4, and 13.6%, respectively. CONCLUSION: The epidemiological characterization of HPV infections described in this study might guide actions for epidemiological surveillance to strengthen the program in Bogota and to develop appropriate HPV vaccination programs.
27215420	Prevalence of High-Grade Intraepithelial Neoplasia in Patients with Cytology Presenting Atypical Squamous Cells of Undetermined Significance.	OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the prevalence of histological high-grade lesions and cervical cancer in patients with ASCUS cytology. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional prospective study involving 703 women with a uterus and atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS). The patients were submitted to a colposcopy and underwent a guided biopsy when changes on the colposcopy were detected. RESULTS: The findings revealed 456 (64.9%) women with a normal colposcopy and 247 (35.1%) with colposcopic abnormalities. The biopsy results were: cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 1 (CIN 1) in 51 (20.6%) patients, CIN 2 in 11 (4.5%) patients, CIN 3 in 8 (3.2%) patients, and a negative result in 177 (71.7%) patients; no cases of cancer were detected. Tallying of 456 normal colposcopies and 177 negative biopsies yielded a total of 90.04% negative exams. Furthermore, around 7.2% (51/703) of the patients exhibited CIN 1, a lesion associated with a high potential for regression. The biopsy results were not associated with patient age or menopausal status. CONCLUSION: We conclude that cytological surveillance of patients with ASCUS is feasible and safe given the low risk of CIN 2/3 or cervical cancer.
27215080	Comparison of In-House Multiplex Real Time PCR, Diagcor GenoFlow HPV Array Test and INNO-LiPA HPV Genotyping Extra Assays with LCD- Array Kit for Human Papillomavirus Genotyping in Cervical Liquid Based Cytology Specimens and Genital Lesions in Tehran, Iran.	BACKGROUND: Human papillomavirus is a major etiologic agent for some human common cancers. Cervical precancer and cancer is the most prevalent dysplasia by HPV genotypes. Various rapid and sensitive methods have been developed into readily HPV genotyping. METHODS: In the present study, we compared the performance of Real Time PCR, GenoFlow HPV Array, and INNO-LiPA HPV Genotyping Extra Assays with LCD- Array. RESULTS: From 108 cervical samples, HPV was detected in 33 women (30.55%). Among detected HPV genotypes, HPV 6 and 11 were dominant genotypes. Comparing these methods revealed that for Real Time PCR, Genoflow, and INNO-LiPA in comparison with LCD Array, sensitivity and specificity were 94.2%, 93%; 76.7%, 93%; 64%, 96.5%, respectively. Overall, accuracy and precision of these methods were more than 80% and 90%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: It seems that these methods are reliable and suitable for detection and genotyping of HPVs in cervical disorders and other dysplasia associated with human papillomaviruses.
27215041	A COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF METHYLATION STATUS OF TUMOR SUPPRESSOR GENES IN PAIRED BIOPSY AND SERUM SAMPLES FROM CERVICAL CANCER PATIENTS AMONG NORTH INDIAN POPULATION.	Tumor-specific genetic or epigenetic alterations have been detected in serum DNA in case of various types of cancers. In breast cancer, the detection of tumor suppressor gene hypermethylation has been reported in several body fluids. Promoter hypermethylation of some genes like MYOD1, CALCA, hTERT etc. has also been detected in serum samples from cervical cancer. The present study is the first report on the comparison of promoter hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes likep14, p15, p16, p21, p27, p57, p53, p73, RARbeta2, FHIT, DAPK, STAT1 and-RB1 genes in paired biopsy and serum samples from cervical cancer patients among north Indian population. This is also the first report on the hypermethylation of these genes in serum samples from cervical cancer patients among north Indian population. According to the results of the present study, promoter hypermethylation of these genes can also be detected in serum samples of cervical cancer patients. The sensitivity of detection of promoter hypermethylation in serum samples of cervical cancer patients as compared to paired biopsy samples was found to be around 83.3%. It was observed that promoter hypermethylation was mainly observed in the serum samples in the higher stages and very rarely in the lower stages. The present study clearly showed that serum of patients with cervical cancer can also be used to study methylated genes as biomarkers.
27209757	[Study of Cervical Exfoliated Cell's DNA Quantitative Analysis Based on Multi-Spectral Imaging Technology].	The conventional cervical cancer screening methods mainly include TBS (the bethesda system) classification method and cellular DNA quantitative analysis, however, by using multiple staining method in one cell slide, which is staining the cytoplasm with Papanicolaou reagent and the nucleus with Feulgen reagent, the study of achieving both two methods in the cervical cancer screening at the same time is still blank. Because the difficulty of this multiple staining method is that the absorbance of the non-DNA material may interfere with the absorbance of DNA, so that this paper has set up a multi-spectral imaging system, and established an absorbance unmixing model by using multiple linear regression method based on absorbance's linear superposition character, and successfully stripped out the absorbance of DNA to run the DNA quantitative analysis, and achieved the perfect combination of those two kinds of conventional screening method. Through a series of experiment we have proved that between the absorbance of DNA which is calculated by the absorbance unmixxing model and the absorbance of DNA which is measured there is no significant difference in statistics when the test level is 1%, also the result of actual application has shown that there is no intersection between the confidence interval of the DNA index of the tetraploid cells which are screened by using this paper's analysis method when the confidence level is 99% and the DNA index's judging interval of cancer cells, so that the accuracy and feasibility of the quantitative DNA analysis with multiple staining method expounded by this paper have been verified, therefore this analytical method has a broad application prospect and considerable market potential in early diagnosis of cervical cancer and other cancers.
27207110	Awareness and prevalence of cervical cancer screening among women in Nepal.	OBJECTIVE: To estimate awareness and prevalence of cervical smear testing among women in Nepal. METHODS: A secondary analysis of data obtained as part of a nationwide household survey between May 25 and June 14, 2015, was undertaken. Information obtained from women aged 21-65years was included. Multiple regression analyses were performed to identify factors associated with having undergone cervical smear testing. RESULTS: A total of 829 women were included. Among 816 women who answered the relevant survey question, 710 (87.0%) had no knowledge of cervical smear tests. Only 39 (4.7%) of the 829 women had ever undergone a cervical smear. In multivariate analysis, having undergone a cervical smear was associated with literacy (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 3.26, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.25-8.51; P=0.016) and living in rural areas (aOR 0.48, 95% CI 0.24-0.96; P=0.038). CONCLUSION: Nepali women rarely undergo cervical smear screening, with the lowest prevalence recorded among the illiterate and those living in rural areas. To boost screening rates, educational campaigns and rural outreach are needed.
27203702	Regression and Progression Predictors of CIN2 in Women Younger Than 25 Years.	OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to review the management and outcome of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2 (CIN2) in women younger than 25 years. METHODS: A retrospective review was performed, investigating women younger than 25 years at the time of diagnosis with biopsy-proven CIN2 between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2014, who were seen in the colposcopy clinic at the Queen Elizabeth II Hospital in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada. The regression, persistence, and progression rate of CIN2 in conservative managed women were evaluated, and potential risk factors were examined. Colposcopy, cytologic, and histopathologic findings were compared with women with immediate treatment (<6 months). RESULTS: Of the 319 women included in the study, 108 women received immediate treatment, and 211 women were managed conservatively; of these, 144 women remained untreated, and 67 women received treatment 6 months or greater. From the women managed conservatively, 150 women (71.1%) showed regression, 26 women (12.3%) had persistent disease, and 35 women (16.6%) progressed, with a median follow-up of 15.1 months. None of the women included in the study progressed to invasive cancer. The hazard ratio for time to progression was 2.40 for women who smoked (p = 0.006). CONCLUSIONS: A conservative approach of CIN2 is the preferred management option for women younger than 25 years. Smoking was identified as a risk factor for progression.
27199542	Rhabdomyolysis in hyponatremia and paraneoplastic syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis.	We report a 26-year-old woman admitted to our hospital for generalized tonic seizure. Laboratory investigations revealed severe hyponatremia possibly triggered by vomiting and diarrhea. 24 hours after correction of hyponatremia she developed diffuse myalgias and marked hyperCKemia. Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (SIAD) was suspected as cause of hyponatremia. Abnormal vaginal bleeding prompts gynecological evaluation and a small-cell carcinoma of uterine cervix was detected.
27197582	Role of difucosylated Lewis Y antigen in outcome of locally advanced cervical squamous cell carcinoma treated with cisplatin regimen.	BACKGROUND: Several mechanisms are involved in the development of resistance to therapy in locally advanced cervical squamous cell carcinoma (LACSCC). Studies have shown that CD44 and Lewis Y antigen (LeY) form a complex that is associated with chemoresistance, tumor invasion and metastasis. We assessed the role of CD44 and LeY in the outcome of LACSCC patients treated with different chemotherapy regimens. METHODS: 126 LACSCC patients at FIGO stages IIB-IVA were selected from the GOCS database: 74 patients included in 3 different prospective phase II trials in the neoadjuvant setting (vinorelbine, docetaxel, ifosfamide-vinorelbine-cisplatin) and 52 patients treated with standard radiochemotherapy based on cisplatin (RCBC). Clinical data at baseline, disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) were recorded. Univariate and multivariate Cox models were employed. RESULTS: Median age was 45.6 years (range: 24.9-80.5). Sixty-three and 47 tumors were CD44+ and LeY+, respectively. Tumors with expansive growth showed higher grade (p = 0.0024), mitotic index (p = 0.0505), tumor necrosis (p = 0.0191), LeY+ (p = 0.0034) and CD44+/LeY+ coexpression (p = 0.0334). CD44+ cells were present in 91.3% of patients with local recurrence (p = 0.0317). Advanced stage was associated with LeY+ tumors. Patients treated with RCBC had worse DFS and OS when their tumors expressed LeY (p = 0.0083 and p = 0.0137, respectively). Pre-treatment hemoglobin level, FIGO stage and tumor response remained the most significant prognostic factors in Cox regression. CONCLUSIONS: In our cohort of LACSCC patients, the coexpression of CD44 and LeY was not associated with worse outcome. However, in the subgroup of patients receiving RCBC, LeY expression was correlated with shorter DFS and OS.
27196899	Long-Term Follow-up of HPV Infection Using Urine and Cervical Quantitative HPV DNA Testing.	The link between infection with high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV) and cervical cancer has been clearly demonstrated. Virological end-points showing the absence of persistent HPV infection are now accepted as a way of monitoring the impact of prophylactic vaccination programs and therapeutic vaccine trials. This study investigated the use of urine samples, which can be collected by self-sampling at home, instead of cervical samples for follow-up of an HPV intervention trial. Eighteen initially HPV DNA-positive women participating in an HPV therapeutic vaccine trial were monitored during a three-year follow-up period. A total of 172 urine samples and 85 cervical samples were collected. We obtained a paired urine sample for each of the 85 cervical samples by recovering urine samples from six monthly gynaecological examinations. We performed a small pilot study in which the participating women used a urine collection device at home and returned their urine sample to the laboratory by mail. All samples were analyzed using quantitative real-time HPV DNA PCR. A good association (kappa value of 0.65) was found between the presence of HPV DNA in urine and a subsequent cervical sample. Comparisons of the number of HPV DNA copies in urine and paired cervical samples revealed a significant Spearman rho of 0.676. This correlation was superior in women with severe lesions. The HPV DNA results of the small pilot study based on self-collected urine samples at home are consistent with previous and subsequent urine and/or cervical results. We demonstrated that urine sampling may be a valid alternative to cervical samples for the follow-up of HPV intervention trials or programs. The potential clinical value of urine viral load monitoring should be further investigated.
27196093	Results of a Multilevel Intervention Trial to Increase Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Vaccine Uptake among Adolescent Girls.	BACKGROUND: Uptake of the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine is low in Appalachian Ohio and areas with high cervical cancer rates. METHODS: We conducted a group-randomized trial among 12 counties in Appalachian Ohio randomized to receive either an HPV vaccine (intervention counties) or influenza vaccine (comparison counties) multilevel intervention (MLI). Parents (n = 337) who had a daughter aged 9 to 17 years who had not received the HPV vaccine were recruited from commercial lists. Clinics (N = 24) and 119 providers from these clinics were also recruited. The primary outcome was medical record-confirmed receipt of the first shot of the HPV vaccine 3 months after receiving the intervention among daughters of parents enrolled in the study. Secondary outcomes included receipt of the first HPV vaccine shot by 6 months and changes in provider knowledge. RESULTS: According to medical records, 10 (7.7%) daughters of intervention participants received the first shot of the HPV vaccine within 3 months of being sent the intervention materials compared with 4 (3.2%) daughters of comparison group participants (P = 0.061). By 6 months, 17 (13.1%) daughters of intervention participants received the first HPV vaccine shot compared with eight (6.5%) daughters of comparison group participants (P = 0.002). Provider knowledge about HPV increased (P < 0.001, from baseline to after education). CONCLUSIONS: The MLI increased uptake of the HPV vaccine among girls aged 9 to 17 years; however, uptake was low. IMPACT: To improve HPV vaccine uptake, attention to additional levels of influence (e.g., policy, community) and more elements within levels (e.g., reminders, automated prompts) may be needed.

27195779	Findings and Outcomes in a Prevaccination Cohort of Women Younger Than 25 Years Attending a Tertiary Colposcopy Service.	OBJECTIVE: To describe clinical presentation and treatment in women younger than 25 years referred to the Royal Women's Hospital colposcopy clinic, before implementation of the National Human Papillomavirus Vaccination Program. METHODS: Retrospective cohort analysis of women younger than 25 years referred to a tertiary hospital colposcopy clinic between 1998 and 2007. Clinical presentation and correlation between cervical cytology, biopsy, and histology at treatment was examined. RESULTS: Approximately 14,635 colposcopies were undertaken in 4104 women (median age, 22 years); 3051 had abnormal referral cytology, of whom, 23.8% had high-grade disease on punch biopsy. High-grade disease was found in 15.1% of those with possible low-grade or low-grade cytology (293/1932), 42.4% of those with possible high-grade or high-grade cytology (474/1119). Sensitivity and specificity of colposcopy for high-grade disease (high-grade epithelial abnormality, adenocarcinoma in situ, cervical cancer up to 2 years follow-up) was 60.0% and 82.3%, respectively. Thirty-nine percent (n = 1180) with abnormal cytology had treatment, of which, 66.6% was ablative. Histological CIN3+ was found in 53.8% of those with a previous high-grade punch biopsy (126/234) at excisional treatment, and 23.0% of those with a previous low-grade punch biopsy (20/87) (relative risk, 2.3 [CI, 1.6-3.5]). Four cancers were detected (0.1% of the total cohort, 0.5% of those with a high-grade biopsy, and 1.7% of those with a high-grade biopsy who underwent excisional treatment.) CONCLUSIONS: Before vaccination, young women experienced a high real-time burden of high-grade disease and high rates of intervention. These baseline data contribute to monitoring of HPV vaccination and revised cervical screening strategies.
27194041	Implication of different clinical and pathological variables in patients with differentiated thyroid cancer on successful ablation for 3700 MBq (131)I: a single Egyptian institutional experience over 14 years.	OBJECTIVE: Is to investigate possible factors predicting success of ablation for 3700 MBq radioactive iodine 131 in patients with differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) following near total thyroidectomy. METHODS: This retrospective study enrolled 272 patients between 2000 and 2014. The success or failure of ablation was assessed 6 months after given the dose and our criteria for complete successful remnant ablation defined as: Negative (131)I whole body scan with no residual functioning thyroid tissue or distant functioning metastases and stimulated thyroglobulin (Tg) level less than 2 ng/ml. Different clinical and pathological factors, such as age, gender, tumor histology, grade and variants, size of primary malignant lesion, stage, and risk assessment according to the American (ATA) and European Thyroid Association (ETA) guidelines, associated pathology, tumor mutifocality, lymph node (LN) metastases and their number, invasiveness of the tumor (capsular invasion of the nodule, extra-thyroidal extension, and vascular invasion), baseline stimulated Tg level, and pre-ablative diagnostic scan were assessed. RESULTS: There were 185 successful ablations (68 %). The baseline-stimulated Tg measured before the ablation was the only independent predictor of ablation success in multivariate analysis (P < 0.0001) with odds ratio (OR) of 2.64 (95 % CI: 1.54-4.54) and the optimal cutoff for this was 3.8 ng/mL. On the univariate analysis, LN metastases was predictor of ablation failure (P value = 0.03). CONCLUSION: Baseline-stimulated Tg level is clinically important and had a significant predictive value for successful ablation; therefore, higher pre-ablation Tg should potentially be incorporated in the decision making for (131)I dosage or other treatment. In accordance with other studies, this is also applicable to cervical lymph nodal involvement and thyroid capsule invasion.
27193777	Clinical significance of post-treatment 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose uptake in cervical lymph nodes in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.	OBJECTIVES: We assessed the clinical significance of FDG uptake in cervical lymph nodes after treatment of patients with DLBCL. METHODS: In total, 87 patients with DLBCL were enrolled. All patients had newly appeared FDG uptake in cervical lymph nodes on PET/CT during follow-up after cessation of therapy. Cervical lymph nodes were finally diagnosed as benign or malignant according to histopathological findings or follow-up PET. Clinical characteristics and PET findings were compared between groups and factors associated with malignant lesions were evaluated. RESULTS: Only 8 (9.2 %) patients with cervical lymph nodes with FDG uptake ultimately had malignancy. FDG uptake lymph nodes appeared significantly earlier in the malignant group than in patients with benign FDG uptake (p = 0.013). Primary nodal lymphoma was more frequent in patients with cancer spread than in those with benign FDG uptake in lymph nodes (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Most cervical lymph nodes with FDG uptake (about 91 %) appearing after treatment of malignant DLBCL were ultimately benign. The elapsed time between the end of therapy and the appearance of cervical lymph nodes with FDG uptake and the primary sites of lymphomas are helpful clues in determining which cases are malignant. KEY POINTS: * About 91 % appearing after treatment of DLBCL were benign. * Elapsed time between therapy and FDG uptake was associated with malignancy. * Primary sites of lymphoma are helpful clues to determine malignancy.
27193257	Tungsten Oxide Nanoplates; the Novelty in Targeting Metalloproteinase-7 Gene in Both Cervix and Colon Cancer Cells.	In this study, we synthesized tungsten oxide (WO3) nanoplates, both crystallographic phases and the morphology of the samples were determined by powder x-ray diffraction and the scanning electron microscopy, respectively. The obtained data clarified that, the all prepared WO3.H2O samples were composed of large quantity of nanoplates. The cytotoxicity patterns of nanoplates were checked on both normal and cancer mammalian cell lines. Both nanoplates cytotoxicity did not exceed the 50 % inhibitory concentration (IC50) on the all normal tested cells even by using concentrations up to 1 mg/ml. In addition, orthorhombic tungsten oxide nanoplate was more potent against both Caco2 and Hela cells by showing inhibition percentages in cellular viability 64.749 and 72.27, respectively, and with cancer selectivity index reached 3.2 and 2.6 on both colon and cervix cancer, respectively. The anticancer effects of nanoplates were translated to alteration in both pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic genes expressions. Tungsten oxide nanoplates down regulated the expression of B cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) and metalloproteinase-7 (MMP7) genes. In addition, orthorhombic tungsten oxide nanoplates showed more potentiation in IL2 and IL8 induction (40.43 pg/ml) and upregulation of TNF-alpha gene expression but with lower folds than Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induction.
27193219	A significant association between rs8067378 at 17q12 and invasive cervical cancer originally identified by a genome-wide association study in Han Chinese is replicated in a Japanese population.	In this study, associations between invasive cervical cancer and four cervical cancer susceptibility loci (rs13117307 at 4q12, rs8067378 at 17q12, and rs4282438 and rs9277952 at 6p21.32) in the Han Chinese population were investigated in a Japanese population. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DPB1 alleles were also investigated for their association with cervical cancer risk in the Japanese population. After receiving written informed consent, 214 unrelated Japanese women with invasive cervical cancer and 288 cancer-free Japanese women were recruited, and DNA samples were obtained (study protocol approved by Institutional Review Board of Nagasaki University). Of the four single-nucleotide polymorphisms, rs8067378 showed a significant association with invasive cervical cancer (P=0.0071). Under a recessive model, the minor allele G of rs8067378 contributed to the risk of invasive cervical cancer (odds ratio=2.92, 95% confidence interval=1.40-6.36; P=0.0021). No association was detected between HLA-DPB1 alleles and cervical cancer risk in the Japanese population. In conclusion, we show for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, that an association between increased risk of invasive cervical cancer and rs8067378 in the Han Chinese population is replicated in a Japanese population. In addition, Japanese women with the GG genotype of rs8067378 are a candidate high-risk group for invasive cervical carcinoma.
27192595	Prevalence and genotype distribution of human papillomavirus: implications for cancer screening and vaccination in Henan province, China.	INTRODUCTION: To provide information for cervical cancer screening and vaccination in Henan province, China, the distribution of human papillomavirus (HPV) was analyzed. METHODS: The HPV genotypes were detected using gene array and flow-through hybridization. RESULTS: Overall, 38.1% (1,536/4,033) of the women were human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid (HPV DNA) positive. The prevalence of high-risk HPV types was 32.4%. HPV 16 was the most prevalent genotype (8.9%), followed by HPV 52 (5.8%) and HPV 58 (4.4%). CONCLUSIONS: The data support close surveillance of women for cervical cancer screening, and HPV prophylactic vaccines including HPV16, HPV 52, and HPV 58 might offer greater protection in this area.
27188615	[Multi-disciplinary treatment increases the survival rate of late stage pharyngeal, laryngeal or cervical esophageal cancers treated by free jejunal flap reconstruction after cancer resection].	OBJECTIVE: To investigate the survival status of patients with pharyngeal, laryngeal or cervical esophageal cancers, who received free jejunal flap (FJF) to repair the defects following tumor resection, and to analyze the effect of multi-disciplinary treatment on their survival. METHODS: Fifty-eight patients with pharyngeal, laryngeal or cervical esophageal cancer underwent free jejunal flap (FJF) reconstruction after cancer resection between 2010 and 2013. All their clinical records were reviewed and analyzed. RESULTS: The success rate of flap transplantation was 91.4% (53/58). The 2-year overall survival rates (OSR) of cervical esophageal cancer and hypopharyngeal cancer patients were 67.5% and 49.3%, respectively, both were significantly better than that of laryngeal cancer. The main causes of death were local recurrence and distant metastases. The group with no short-term complications had a better two-year OSR (59.0%) than the group with short-term complications (46.6%), however, the difference between them was not significant (P=0.103). The 2-year survival rate of the initial treatment group was 65.0%, better than that of the salvage treatment group (49.4%), but the difference was not significant (P=0.051). For the stage III and IV patients, the multi-disciplinary treatment group had a significantly better 2-year OSR (64.7%) than the single or sequential treatment group (37.0%, P=0.016). CONCLUSIONS: Free jejunal flap reconstruction is an ideal option for repairing the cervical digestive tract circumferential defects caused by tumor resection with a high success rate and a low mortality. Compared with the single or sequential treatment, multi-disciplinary treatment can significantly improve the survival rate of late-stage hypopharyngeal and cervical esophageal cancer patients.
27188366	[Incidence trends of cervical cancer in Tianjin, 2007-2013].	OBJECTIVE: To investigate the change of incidence and age distribution of cervical cancer in Tianjin from 2007 to 2013. METHODS: The incidence data of cervical cancer and population data were collected from the cancer registry system of Tianjin Center for Disease Control and Prevention and Tianjin Municipal Public Security Bureau, respectively. The crude incidence, and age-standardized incidence of cervical cancer were calculated by using SPSS software. The Join Point Regression Program software was used to detect the trend of cervical cancer incidence. RESULTS: A total of 3 362 cervical cancer patients were diagnosed during 2007 to 2013. The average age of the patients was 48.11 years. The crude incidence was 9.85/100 000. The annual world standard age specific incidence was 6.65 /100 000. The incidence in urban area was higher than that in rural area, but the proportion of the cases in urban area showed a downward trend(trend chi(2)=21.92, P=0.001)and the proportion of the cases in rural area showed a upward trend(trend chi(2)=12.70, P=0.048). The difference was significant. The incidence was generally stable in urban area, the APC value was 2.7%(95%CI:-9.1%-16.2%), the difference was not significant(Z=0.564, P=0.597); The incidence rate in rural area showed an upward trend, APC value was 13.4%(95% CI: 3.5%-24.2%), the difference was significant(Z=3.549, P=0.016). The two incidence peaks were in age groups 40-44 years and 75-79 years. CONCLUSION: The overall incidence of cervical cancer in Tianjin was still stable during 2007-2013, and the disease mainly occurred in middle-aged and elderly population. More attention should be paid to the increased incidence of cervical cancer in rural area.
27187495	Effectiveness Modelling and Economic Evaluation of Primary HPV Screening for Cervical Cancer Prevention in New Zealand.	BACKGROUND: New Zealand (NZ) is considering transitioning from 3-yearly cervical cytology screening in women 20-69 years (current practice) to primary HPV screening. We evaluated HPV-based screening in both HPV-unvaccinated women and cohorts offered HPV vaccination in New Zealand (vaccination coverage ~50%). METHODS: A complex model of HPV transmission, vaccination, cervical screening, and invasive cervical cancer was extensively validated against national population-based datasets. Sixteen potential strategies for HPV screening were considered. RESULTS: Most primary HPV strategies were more effective than current practice, for both unvaccinated women and cohorts offered vaccination. The optimal strategy for both groups was 5-yearly HPV screening in women aged 25-69 years with partial genotyping for HPV 16/18 and referral to colposcopy, and cytological triage of other oncogenic types. This is predicted to reduce cervical cancer incidence and mortality by a further 12-16% and to save 4-13% annually in program costs (excluding overheads). The findings are sensitive to assumptions about future adherence to initiating screening at 25 years. CONCLUSION: Primary HPV screening with partial genotyping would be more effective and less costly than the current cytology-based screening program, in both unvaccinated women and cohorts offered vaccination. These findings have been considered in a review of cervical screening in NZ.
27183708	Bile acids, carriers of hepatoma-targeted drugs?	Previous studies display that bile acids (Bas) could be used as carriers and pharmaceutical excipients. In this study, the selective cytotoxicity of 6 bile acids (BAs) was evaluated against hepatoma cell line HepG2, human colon carcinoma cell line HT-29, gastric cancer cell line BGC823, cervical cancer cell line Hela and hepatocyte line L02. Our study suggested that most of the BAs showed cytotoxicity against a broader spectrum of tumor cells and display high cell selectivity toward HepG2. In particular, chenodeoxy- cholic acid (CDCA) exerted the most potent selective cytotoxicity against HepG2 (IC(5)(0) = 54.62 +/- 3.5 microM) and low toxicity on L02 cells (IC(5)(0) >200 microM). According to the structure-activity relationship, the position, configuration and number of OH groups in BAs could affect cell proliferation and selectivity. Moreover, the pre-mechanism of CDCA on HepG2 cells was studied by Giemsa staining, DAPI staining, AO/EB staining, apoptosis analysis and mitochondrial membrane potential assay. Results showed that CDCA could induce apoptosis and loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential in HepG2 cells. The study inferred that CDCA might be a carrier and parent pharmaceutical excipient for hepatic carcinoma targeting drug.
27181176	Cervical lymph node thyroglobulin measurement in washout of fine-needle aspirates for diagnosis of papillary thyroid cancer metastases.	BACKGROUND: Patients with papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) and enlarged cervical lymph nodes (CLNs) are usually assessed by fine-needle aspiration biopsy cytology (FNAB-C). Thyroglobulin (Tg) is frequently detected in washout of fine-needle aspirates (FNA) of these lymph nodes. The aim of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of the measurement of FNAB-Tg in the washout of FNAB in combination with FNAB-C to detect CLN metastases in PTC. METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated 163 surgically proven CLNs. Ultrasound-guided FNAB-C and FNAB-Tg measurements were performed and the ultrasound features were evaluated. RESULTS: The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of FNAB-C, FNAB-Tg and FNAB-C/FNAB-Tg in diagnosis of metastatic CLNs were 85.7, 87.8 and 71.6%, were 80.5, 87 and 82.8% and were 97.1, 96.3 and 95.7%, respectively. The diagnostic sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of FNAB-C/FNAB-Tg for metastatic CLNs was significantly higher than that of FNAB-C or FNAB-Tg alone (p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Combined US-guided FNAB-C and FNAB-Tg can improve the accuracy for diagnosis of metastatic CLNs in patients with PTC.
27180296	Unravelling the potential of a new uracil phosphoribosyltransferase (UPRT) from Arabidopsis thaliana in sensitizing HeLa cells towards 5-fluorouracil.	In silico studies with uracil phosphoribosyltransferase from Arabidopsis thaliana (AtUPRT) revealed its lower binding energies for uracil and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) as compared to those of bacterial UPRT indicating the prospective of AtUPRT in gene therapy implications. Hence, AtUPRT was cloned and stably expressed in cervical cancer cells (HeLa) to investigate the effect of prodrug 5-FU on these transfected cancer cells. The treatment of AtUPRT-expressing HeLa (HeLa-UPP) cells with 5-FU for 72h resulted in significant decrease in cell viability. Moreover, 5-FU was observed to induce apoptosis and perturb mitochondrial membrane potential in HeLa-UPP cells. While cell cycle analysis revealed significant S-phase arrest as a result of 5-FU treatment in HeLa-UPP cells, quantitative gene expression analysis demonstrated simultaneous upregulation of important cell cycle related genes, cyclin D1 and p21. The survival fractions of non-transfected, vector-transfected and AtUPRT-transfected HeLa cells, following 5-FU treatment, were calculated to be 0.425, 0.366 and 0.227, respectively.
27180063	Tubulosquamous polyps in the vagina. Immunohistochemical comparison with ectopic prostatic tissue and Skene glands.	Two tubulosquamous polyps arising in the vagina are reported. Both were diffusely positive for GATA3 in the squamous component and focally positive for NKX3.1 in the glandular component, prostate acid phosphatase was focally positive in only 1 case in the glandular component. Both cases were negative for PAX2, PAX8, SALL4, and prostate-specific antigen. In addition, we included 3 cases of cervical squamous-lined cysts most likely representing ectopic prostatic tissue in the cervix and 1 case of paraurethral Skene-type glands to compare the immunophenotype. We analyze this immunoprofile, not previously reported. We also suggest unifying the nomenclature because vaginal Brenner tumors are most likely synonymous with tubulosquamous polyp (TSP) of the vagina. Our findings add support to the postulated origin of TSPs and cervical ectopic prostatic tissue from eutopic or misplaced Skene glands, equivalent of the prostate in the female. NKX3.1 seems a better marker to study and diagnose ectopic prostatic tissue in the cervix as well as TSPs.
27179279	Giant cribriform adenocarcinoma of the tongue showing PRKD3 rearrangement.	Cribriform adenocarcinoma of the tongue and minor salivary glands (CAMSG) was first described 16 years ago. It typically presents as a mass at the base of the tongue with early spread to lymph nodes, but without potential for distant metastases. In the 2005 World Health Organization Classification of Tumors the entity was classified as a possible variant of polymorphous low-grade adenocarcinoma (PLGA). Since then, more than 40 cases have been described in the English literature. Recently, PRKD1-3 translocation was found in more than 80% of CAMSGs. In some of those cases ARID1A or DDX3X was the translocation partner. We reviewed 183 primary carcinomas of major and minor salivary glands, resected at the Medical University of Gdansk, Poland, in the period 1992-2012, and identified only one case of CAMSG. A giant tumor developed at the base of the tongue in a 76-year-old man. The primary tumor was resected with multiple bilateral cervical lymph node metastases. The patient received radiotherapy but died 10 months after the surgery due to causes not related to the primary cancer. The tumor presented PRKD3 rearrangement as confirmed by FISH. As the tumor is extremely rare (it represented only 0.5% of salivary gland tumors in our series), the controversy on its nosological status is still unresolved. This is the first report in the world literature of a patient who died in the course of CAMSG.
27178030	Reimbursed Costs of Management of Uterine Cervical Lesions in Poland--a Descriptive Analysis of Data from the National Health Fund and the Ministry of Health.	BACKGROUND: Despite implementation of organised screening programme in 2006/2007, cervical cancer (CC) incidence and mortality in Poland are still higher than the average in the European Union. CC and preceding cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) caused by human papillomaviruses (HPVs) can be prevented by vaccines which are reimbursed in around 20 European countries but not in Poland. CC and CIN can be also detected with the use of HPV tests which are not included in the Polish screening programme. Reimbursement for HPV vaccines and HPV testing requires cost-effectiveness analyses which include country-specific data on the burden and costs of management of cervical neoplasia. Therefore, we investigated the burden of cervical neoplasia and direct costs associated with its detection and management in Poland in 2012 reimbursed by the National Health Fund (NHF) - the only public healthcare insurance institution. We also report administrative costs of the organised screening programme covered by the Ministry of Health. METHODS: Data on the burden and reimbursed costs of organised and opportunistic screening as well as management of cervical neoplasia were drawn from the NHF databases. Numbers of women reported with CIN and CC were ascertained. RESULTS: In 2012, there were 765,266 and 1,288,358 reimbursed Pap smears collected within and outside the organised screening programme, respectively. Expenditures on medical and administrative procedures in organised screening reached PLN (Polish Zloty) 41,470,664 and 12,150,398 respectively. The number of women with particular diagnosis and reimbursement for the management of these lesions were as follows: glandular ectropion 208,033 and PLN 37,349,515; CIN1 10,521 and PLN 6,616,375; CIN2 5,812 and PLN 5,071,155; CIN3 6,487 and PLN 7,611,062; unspecified grade CIN 36,575 and PLN 12,352,034; and CC 33,482 and PLN 52,377,006, respectively. In women with ectropion and CIN the total number of local excision/ablative therapeutic procedures on the cervix reached 47,658 and the total number of hysterectomies was 1,321. CONCLUSION: In 2012, management of approximately 93 thousand women with HPV-related cervical lesions reimbursed in Poland amounted to PLN 84,027,632 which makes it a considerable public health problem. The number of women managed for glandular ectropion is considerable and related costs are high. Total reimbursement for detection, treatment and follow-up of all cervical lesions reaches at least PLN 137 million annually.
27177038	5-Aminolevulinic acid photodynamic therapy in human cervical cancer via the activation of microRNA-143 and suppression of the Bcl-2/Bax signaling pathway.	5-Aminolevulinic acid photodynamic therapy (ALAPDT) is a method using a photosensitizer and light radiation for disease treatment, and is currently used for the treatment of skin cancers, precancerous lesions and viral warts. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of ALAPDT on human cervical cancer through the regulation of microRNA143 (miR143) and the Bcl-2/Bax signaling pathway. The results demonstrated that ALAPDT reduced proliferation, increased cytotoxicity and induced apoptosis in HeLa human cervical carcinoma cells. Reverse transcriptionquantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis demonstrated that the expression levels of miR143 were increased following ALAPDT treatment. Western blotting indicated that the expression levels of Bcl2 and Bax were significantly reduced and increased, respectively, by ALAPDT treatment. In addition, upregulation of miR143 expression reduced Bcl2 expression and increased Bax expression in HeLa cells. However, downregulation of miR143 expression inhibited the effect of ALAPDT on Bcl-2/Bax protein expression. In conclusion, the current study demonstrated that ALAPDT affected human cervical cancer via the activation of miR-143 and the suppression of the Bcl-2/Bax signaling pathway.
27176896	The value of a transformation zone component in anal cytology to detect HSIL.	BACKGROUND: In a cytology-based screening program intended to prevent anal cancer, the anal transformation zone (TZ) should be adequately sampled because it is the site most susceptible to the development of the cancer precursor, high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL). An adequate TZ component is defined as comprising at least 10 rectal columnar or squamous metaplastic cells. In the current study, the authors examined whether the presence of a TZ component in anal cytology correlated with the detection of histological HSIL. METHODS: In a natural history study of anal human papillomavirus infection in homosexual men, all participants underwent liquid-based cytology and high-resolution anoscopy (HRA) with or without biopsy at each visit. True-negative cytology (negative cytology with non-HSIL biopsy or negative HRA), false-negative cytology (negative cytology with HSIL biopsy), and true-positive cytology (abnormal cytology with HSIL biopsy) were compared with regard to the presence or absence of a TZ component. RESULTS: Of 617 participants, baseline results included 155 true-positive results, 191 true-negative results, and 31 false-negative results. The absence of an adequate TZ component was found to be significantly higher for false-negative (32.3%) than for either true-positive (11.0%; P = .0034) or true-negative (13.1%; P = .0089) results. CONCLUSIONS: Significantly more false-negative cases lacked a TZ component compared with either true-positive or true-negative cases. TZ cells may be an important indicator of sample quality for anal cytology because, unlike cervical sampling, the anal canal is not visualized during cytology sampling.

27176495	Valproic acid exhibits different cell growth arrest effect in three HPV-positive/negative cervical cancer cells and possibly via inducing Notch1 cleavage and E6 downregulation.	We investigated the effect of valproic acid (VPA), a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, and the mechanism of VPA-induced growth inhibition on three cervical cancer cell lines with different molecular and genetic background. We found that VPA induced proliferation suppression, cell apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in all tested cell lines, with an increase of Notch1 active form ICN1 as a tumor suppressor and its target gene HES1. Noteworthy, blocking of Notch signaling with DAPT resulted in growth inhibition in ICN1-overexpressing CaSki and HT-3 cells. Thus, endogenous Notch signaling may be necessary for survival of ICN1-overexpressing cervical cancer cell lines. Furthermore, G1 phase arrest was induced in HeLa and CaSki cells by VPA while G2 phase arrest was induced in HT-3 cells, suggesting different mechanism in this cycle arrest. We also found VPA suppressed oncogene E6 in a Notch-independent manner, and induced significant apoptosis in E6-overexpressing HPV positive CaSki cells. Cell morphological change was also observed in HeLa and HT-3 cell lines after VPA treatment with an upregulation of EMT transcription factor Snail1. Notch signaling inhibitor DAPT partly reversed VPA-induced Snail1 upregulation in HeLa cells. This discovery supports that VPA may induce EMT at least partly via Notch activation.
27176229	Oxymatrine inhibits the proliferation of CaSki cells via downregulating HPV16E7 expression.	Treatment of recurrent and metastatic cervical cancer remains a challenge, especially in developing countries, which lack efficient screening programs. HPV16E7 has been reported to play an important role in the development of cervical cancer. In recent years, oxymatrine, which was traditionally used as anti-malarial agent, has been shown to inhibit tumor growth with low toxicity to normal cells. In the present study, we investigated the mechanisms underlying the antitumor effect of oxymatrine in cervical cancer. The CCK-8 assay was used to compare the proliferation of untreated and oxymatrine-treated cervical cancer CaSki cells. Flow cytometry was applied to observe the effect of oxymatrine on apoptosis and the cell cycle distribution of CaSki cells. We used qRT-PCR and western blot analysis to determine the mRNA level and protein level of HPV16E7. The HPV16E7 siRNA inhibition was also performed to confirm the effect of downregulating HPV16E7 on the proliferation in CaSki cells. Our results revealed that oxymatrine-treated cells showed time-dependent and dose-dependent inhibition of proliferation and a significant increase in apoptosis. Oxymatrine arrested CaSki cells in G0/G1 phase and S phase while decreased the cells in G2/M phase. The expression of HPV16E7 was significantly downregulated in oxymatrine-treated cells compared with control cells. Knock-down of HPV16E7 effectively inhibited the proliferation of CaSki cells. In conclusion, our data suggest that oxymatrine inhibits cervical cancer growth via downregulation of HPV16E7. Oxymatrine can be considered to be a potential preventive and therapeutic target for cervical cancer.
27175838	Cancer Screening in Older Patients.	Although cancer is the second leading cause of death among persons 65 years and older, there is a paucity of clinical trial data about the effectiveness and harms of cancer screening in this population. Given the heterogeneous nature of the older population, cancer screening in these patients should not be based on age alone. Studies suggest that a life expectancy of at least 10 years is necessary to derive a survival benefit from screening for breast and colorectal cancers; therefore, screening for these cancers is not recommended in those with a life expectancy of less than 10 years. Prostate cancer screening, if performed at all, should not be performed after 69 years of age. Cervical cancer screening may be stopped after 65 years of age if the patient has an adequate history of negative screening results. An individualized approach to cancer screening decisions involves estimating life expectancy, determining the potential benefits and harms of screenings, and weighing those benefits and harms in relation to the patient's values and preferences.
27175798	Immunocytochemical study of TOP2A and Ki-67 in cervical smears from women under routine gynecological care.	BACKGROUND: Cervical cancer is one of the most common female cancers and is caused by human papillomavirus (HPV). Viral infection leads to cell cycle deregulation by inactivating p53 and retinoblastoma protein by viral oncoproteins E6 and E7, respectively. Then, nuclear proteins such as DNA topoisomerase type IIa (TOP2A) and Ki-67 show increased expression because of increased cell division. These molecules are used as biomarkers for immunohistochemistry analysis of cervical tissue. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, we recruited 110 women receiving regular gynecological surveillance at public health centers in Olinda - PE, Brazil. Cervicovaginal cells were collected to determine the presence of cytological abnormalities and HPV infection. Pap smear slides were used to evaluate the expression of TOP2A and Ki-67 using immunocytochemistry techniques. RESULTS: Of the 110 women, 75.4 % showed HPV-DNA(+) infection (83/110) and 29.1 % showed cellular abnormalities (32/110). Two atypical cells of undetermined significance, one low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion, and one high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion samples showed no HPV-DNA. TOP2A was positive in 71.9 % of samples, while Ki-67 was positive in 81.2 %. Immunocytochemistry results were positive in 4 of 5 atypical cells of undetermined significance samples. In HPV-DNA(+) samples with cytological abnormalities, immunocytochemistry results were positive 96.4 % of samples (p < 0.0001; odds ratio = 28.0). Among the samples infected with HR-HPV, TOP2A(+) was effective in 71 % samples, while and Ki-67(+) was 77.4 %. Ki-67 and TOP2A were positive for all samples infected with HPV6, HPV11, and HPV18. Ki-67 was also positive for all HPV16 samples, except for one negative sample in cytopathology analysis. CONCLUSIONS: TOP2A and Ki-67 antibodies may be used in combination for cervical cancer screening in immunocytochemistry assays.
27175788	PAX8 is transcribed aberrantly in cervical tumors and derived cell lines due to complex gene rearrangements.	The transcription factor PAX8, a member of the paired box-containing gene family with an important role in embryogenesis of the kidney, thyroid gland and nervous system, has been described as a biomarker in tumors of the thyroid, parathyroid, kidney and thymus. The PAX8 gene gives rise to four isoforms, through alternative mRNA splicing, but the splicing pattern in tumors is not yet established. Cervical cancer has a positive expression of PAX8; however, there is no available data determining which PAX8 isoform or isoforms are present in cervical cancer tissues as well as in cervical carcinoma-derived cell lines. Instead of a differential pattern of splicing isoforms, we found numerous previously unreported PAX8 aberrant transcripts ranging from 378 to 542 bases and present in both cervical carcinoma-derived cell lines and tumor samples. This is the first report of PAX8 aberrant transcript production in cervical cancer. Reported PAX8 isoforms possess differential transactivation properties; therefore, besides being a helpful marker for detection of cancer, PAX8 isoforms can plausibly exert differential regulation properties during carcinogenesis.
27175680	Effect of Dexmedetomidine Alone for Intravenous Patient-Controlled Analgesia After Gynecological Laparoscopic Surgery: A Consort-Prospective, Randomized, Controlled Trial.	Gynecological laparoscopic surgery is minimally invasive compared with open surgical approaches, but postoperative pain is generally undermanaged. Pain management strategies related to the procedure-specific efficacy are needed. Many studies have shown that dexmedetomidine (DEX) has opioid-sparing properties. It is not clear whether DEX used alone for intravenous patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) could reduce postoperative pain after an invasive procedure. We hypothesized that DEX alone would reduce postoperative pain in women patients undergoing an elective gynecological laparoscopic procedure.This CONSORT-prospective randomized controlled clinical study aimed to investigate the effects of DEX alone for intravenous PCA after gynecological laparoscopic operation. Forty women patients scheduled for elective gynecological laparoscopy were enrolled into the study at Shandong Cancer Hospital and Institute and randomly allocated into two groups (n = 20 each). In the DEX group (group D), the intravenous PCA protocol was DEX 0.25 mug/kg/h diluted to 100 mL in 0.9% saline. In the fentanyl group (group F), the PCA protocol was fentanyl 20 mug/kg diluted to 100 mL in 0.9% saline. The primary outcome was the mean pain score on a visual analogue scale (VAS) at 6 hours after the operation. The secondary outcomes included the Ramsay sedation score, the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), satisfaction with pain control, and time to recovery of gastrointestinal function.There were no significant differences in the patients' characteristics and intraoperative measurements (P > 0.05). No patients received rescue analgesic. The mean VAS scores at 6 hours post-operatively were not significantly different between the groups (P > 0.05). The incidence of PONV was less in group D than in group F (P < 0.05). The Ramsay sedation scores were not significantly between the groups (P > 0.05). Satisfaction with pain control was higher and time to recovery of gastrointestinal function was lower in group D (P < 0.05).DEX alone is effective for intravenous patient-controlled analgesia after gynecological laparoscopic surgery without a change in sedation and with fewer side effects, and this effect was associated with better satisfaction with postoperative pain control and earlier recovery of gastrointestinal function.
27173319	BK polyomavirus association with colorectal cancer development.	The development of human neoplasms can be provoked by exposure to one of several viruses. Burkitt lymphoma, cervical carcinoma, and hepatocellular carcinoma are associated with Epstein-Barr, human papilloma, and hepatitis B virus infections, respectively. Over the past three decades, many studies have attempted to establish an association between colorectal cancer and viruses, with debatable results. The aim of the present research was to assess the presence of BK polyomavirus (BKV) DNA and protein in colorectal cancer samples from patients in the Western Province of Saudi Arabia. DNA extracted from archival samples of colorectal cancer tissues was analyzed for BKV sequences using polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based techniques. In addition, expression of a BKV protein was assessed using immunohistochemical staining. None of the tumor and control samples examined tested positive for BKV DNA in PCR assays. Furthermore, immunohistochemical staining failed to detect viral proteins in both cancer and control specimens. These results may indicate that BKV is not associated with the development of colorectal adenocarcinoma in patients in the Western Province of Saudi Arabia.
27172762	Malignant mesonephric tumor of the cervix with an initial manifestation as pulmonary metastasis: case report and review of the literature.	Malignant mesonephric tumor (MMT) is a relatively uncommon malignancy of the female genital tract. The diagnosis of metastatic MMT is difficult because cytological, pathological, immunohistochemical characteristics of MMT are under-recognized. The authors present a 55-year-old female with metastatic pulmonary nodules. The bronchial washing cytology revealed three dimensional clusters of bland epithelial cells with slight nuclear grooves. A corresponding lung histology had ductal or tubular clusters of epithelial cells with intraglandular eosinophilic materials. These epithelial cells were positive for immunohistochemical stain of CD10, suggesting metastasis from MMT. The cervical smear showed clusters of bland, gland-forming epithelial cells with intraglandular eosinophilic materials. On histologic examination, mesonephric adenocarcinoma with papillary and solid proliferation was identified in the uterine cervix. A review of the literature for 72 cases of MMT is also included. Clinical and cytopathological features of MMT are herein made available.
27172758	A case of placental site nodule associated with cervical high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion.	INTRODUCTION: A placental site nodule (PSN) is a remnant of intermediate trophoblast (extravillous trophoblast, EVT) from a previous pregnancy. Usually, this a benign lesion, which once removed, does not require any treatment and does not recur. Although this lesion is related to pregnancy, it may be detected many months or several years after the pregnancy from which it resulted. The lesion represents a degenerative process of EVT. Especially in tissue obtained from curettage, can microscopically mimic aggressive lesions of intermediate trophoblast, such as placental site trophoblastic tumor (PSTT) and epithelioid trophoblastic tumor (ETT), and in an unusual location can pose problems in differential diagnosis with other malignancies, as in the present cervical example. CASE REPORT: A 36-year-old female, gravida 2, para 1, with a history of early spontaneous abortion two years prior, was submitted to a cervical smear for abnormal uterine bleeding, which showed a cervical high squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) with extension to the endocervical cells. Histologic examination of the endocervical curettage revealed haphazardly distributed fragments of tissue, showing extensive hyalinization and cells of different size with indistinct outlines, organized in small groups, singly, or in cords. Mitotic figures were absent. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed focal positivity to cytokeratin 8 (CK8) and placental alkaline phosphatase and negativity to high molecular weight cytokeratin. The Ki-67 index was low. As a result, the morphological and immunohistochemical findings led to the diagnosis of a PSN. CONCLUSION: Diagnosis of a PSN in an unusual location also can pose problems in differential diagnosis with other malignancies, as in the present cervical example. In the present case, the cervical location and the association with HSIL might suggest an erroneous diagnosis of cervical invasive squamous carcinoma. Clinical and pathological data, with immunohistochemical study, are mandatory for a correct diagnosis of this lesion.
27172757	Possible relation between borderline ovarian cancer and endocervical adenocarcinoma: case report.	Case: The patient, a 74-year-old women was diagnosed with intestinal-type endocervical adenocarcinoma that developed after 11 years from borderline ovarian cancer. The diagnosis was based on biopsy and magnetic resonance imaging; hysterectomy with pelvic lymphadenectomy was then performed.
27172752	Hydroxycamptothecin shows antitumor efficacy on HeLa cells via autophagy activation mediated apoptosis in cervical cancer.	OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effect and the mechanism of anti-tumor agent hydroxycamptothecin (HCPT) on HeLa cells in cervical cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Autophagy and apoptosis were detected by western blotting and the transfection of GFP-LC3 shRNA as well as Hoechst staining. RESULTS: The authors found that the expression of the regulators of Beclin-1, p62, and microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3) upregulated and then triggered the occurrence of cell autophagy. On the other hand, HCPT could induce to the formation of autophagy and resulted in cell apoptosis after autophagy. CONCLUSION: HCPT can alter cell autophagy and then trigger cell apoptosis to achieve antitumor effects.
27172751	Immediate risk of HSIL presence in women who have both ASC-US cytology and negative high-risk HPV test.	PURPOSE: The authors aimed to detect immediate risk of having high grade squamous lesions (HSIL) in atypical squamous cells of uncertain significance(AS-CUS) and concomitant high-risk human papillomavirus (HrHPV) testing as negative [HrHPV(negative)AS-CUS]. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The authors performed immediate/baseline colposcopy on concomitant HrHPV (negative)AS-CUS cases. Pap tests were evaluated with liquid-based cytology (LBC) and HrHPV detection was performed in LBC material with PCR. Colposcopic diagnoses and biopsy results were compared with Pap test and HrHPV test results. RESULTS: There were 104 patients over a one-year period. In all, 84 cases were included. Colposcopic biopsies revealed low grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) in 19 cases (23%) and HSIL in three cases (4%). Intrauterine device use and smoking were significantly correlated with presence of HSIL (p = 0.005 and p = 0.007 respectively). CONCLUSION: Similar data in literature, 4% of ASC-US-HrHPV (negative) cases are expected to have HSIL in follow-up periods less than six months. The present authors believe clinicians should be more open with their patients about limitations of Pap-HPV testing.
27172749	Expression of cancer stem markers could be influenced by silencing of p16 gene in HeLa cervical carcinoma cells.	Effect of the tumor suppression gene p16 on the biological characteristics of HeLa cervical carcinoma cells was explored. The expression of p16 protein was increased in HeLa tumor sphere cells, and no significant difference in tumor spheres from the first to the fourth passages. Compared with those of parental HeLa cells, the proportion of CD44+/CD24- and ABCG2+ cells increased significantly in tumor spheres. However after the cells were silenced by the p16-sh289 vector, expression of P16 protein and the cell number of CD44+/CD24- and ABCG2+ decreased. Moreover, HeLa cells with p16 gene silencing showed decreased abilities of sphere formation and matrigel invasion. More HeLa cells with p16 gene silence were needed for tumor formation in nude mice. Tumor size and weight in mouse model established with p16 gene silenced HeLa cells were less than those with HeLa parental cell model. The present results indicate that silencing of the p16 gene inhibits expression of cancer stem cell markers and tumorigenic ability of HeLa cells.
27172741	Can the histopathology influence the outcome of early-stage cervical cancer?	PURPOSE OF INVESTIGATION: The assessment of the histology influence on survival in early-stage cervical cancer patients treated with surgery. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The retrospective analysis of 71 cervical adenocarcinoma (AC), International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) Stage IB, treated initially with surgery, between 1989 and 1999 and 43 squamous cell cancer (SCC) patients, treated with the same method, between 1998 and 1999, was performed. Cox multi-variant analysis and the Kaplan-Meyer methods were performed (the level of statistical significance, p </= 0.05). RESULTS: The ten-year overall survival (OS) of AC and SCC patients was 67.5% and 90%, p = 0.015. The ten-year disease free survival (DFS) was 63% and 85%, p = 0.022, respectively. After adjusting the significant prognostic factors, patients with AC had significantly worse treatment outcomes than patients with SCC: DFS (relative risk (RR) 1.85, 95% CI = 1.28-2.69, p = 0.001) and OS (RR 1.65, 95% CI = 1.65-2.33, p = 0.005). CONCLUSION: Prognosis of early cervical AC patients, treated with surgery, appears to be less favorable as compared to patients with SCC, treated with the same method.
27172740	Study on the relationship between the structure and functions of anti-human cervical cancer single-chain antibody and the lengths of linkers.	BACKGROUND: This study aimed to find the linker with minimal impact among chains to fight against the structure and function of cervical cancer (CC) single-chain antibody. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The original variable region of heavy chain (VH) and variable region of light chain (VL), and the single-chain antibody with linkers of different lengths (n = 1-8) were modeling by homologous modeling, while the peptide chain structure of (Gly4Ser)n was utilized by the linkers. Comparison of the similarity of original VH/VL and VHn/VLn was carried out by applying the algorithm of spatial hierarchical alignment based on the spherical coordinates. The fore and aft distance and diffusion radius of alpha (alpha) were also calculated. The stability of antibody with different linker length was then compared. ELISA method was adopted to evaluate the immunological activity of single-chain antibody with different linkers. MTT assay was used to analyze the inhibition effect of ScFv-n on CC cells. RESULTS: When n = 4, the structures were the most similar between ScFv and the original VH/VL. When n = 3, the influence of adding connecting peptide on the stability of single-chain antibody was the least. The result of ELISA and MTT methods indicated that when n = 3, single-chain antibody gained the highest activity. CONCLUSION: The optimum length of linker of anti-human CC single-chain antibody was n = 3 from the point of mathematical modeling and biology experiments. This study provided new ideas for the design and constructions of single-chain antibody, and theoretical basis for the treatment of CC.
27171673	Advances in diagnosis and treatment of metastatic cervical cancer.	Cervical cancer is one of the most common cancers in women worldwide. The outcome of patients with metastatic cervical cancer is poor. We reviewed the relevant literature concerning the treatment and diagnosis of metastatic cervical cancer. There are two types of metastasis related to different treatments and survival rates: hematogenous metastasis and lymphatic metastasis. Patients with hematogenous metastasis have a higher risk of death than those with lymphatic metastasis. In terms of diagnosis, fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) and PET-computed tomography are effective tools for the evaluation of distant metastasis. Concurrent chemoradiotherapy and subsequent chemotherapy are well-tolerated and efficient for lymphatic metastasis. As for lung metastasis, chemotherapy and/or surgery are valuable treatments for resistant, recurrent metastatic cervical cancer and chemoradiotherapy may be the optimal choice for stage IVB cervical cancer. Chemotherapy and bone irradiation are promising for bone metastasis. A better survival is achieved with multimodal therapy. Craniotomy or stereotactic radiosurgery is an optimal choice combined with radiotherapy for solitary brain metastases. Chemotherapy and palliative brain radiation may be considered for multiple brain metastases and other organ metastases.
27171589	CE: Late and Long-Term Sequelae of Breast Cancer Treatment.	: More than 12% of women will be diagnosed with breast cancer at some point in their lives, and 78% of them can be expected to survive for at least 15 years. More than 2.8 million breast cancer survivors currently reside in the United States. After breast cancer treatment, as many as 90% of survivors report physical problems that can reduce functional ability, produce or exacerbate emotional problems, negatively affect body image, and diminish quality of life. Many survivors will seek care for late and long-term effects of treatment, which will not necessarily be recognized as such by health care providers and appropriately treated. In this article, the authors discuss the underlying causes of late and long-term sequelae of breast cancer treatment and describe effective assessment and management strategies. They focus specifically on the most common and potentially debilitating upper body effects of breast cancer surgery and external radiation therapy: lymphedema, axillary web syndrome, postmastectomy pain syndrome, rotator cuff syndrome, adhesive capsulitis, arthralgias, cervical radiculopathy, and brachial plexopathy.
27167676	Review of Lung and Pleural Biopsies Received in a Gynecologic Pathology Department Over a 14-Yr Period.	Review of pulmonary biopsies received by Birmingham Women's Hospital to identify which gynecologic tumors most commonly metastasize to lung or pleura, and which may first present with pulmonary metastases. We reviewed all pulmonary biopsies over a 14-yr period. There were 25 lung and 9 pleural biopsies, from 33 patients. Twenty-one patients had known gynecologic tumors (1 vulval, 1 cervical, 9 endometrial, 4 uterine mesenchymal, and 6 ovarian). Eighteen of the 21 biopsies had been referred from other hospitals; in 4 cases review lead to an altered diagnosis. Three of the 21 biopsies had been sent directly to Birmingham Women's Hospital. The interval between primary diagnosis and pulmonary metastasis was known in 18/21 cases and ranged from 1 to 17 yr. Nine of 21 (43%) had metastatic endometrial carcinoma; the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage was known in 7/8 cases: Stage I in 5, and II and IIIA in the remaining 2 cases. Of the further 12 patients with no history of gynecologic malignancy, 4 had pleural metastases from ovarian carcinoma, 3 had primary lung carcinoma, 3 had carcinoma of unknown primary, 1 had endometrial stromal sarcoma, and 1 with a suspected Mullerian tumor was lost to follow-up. Pulmonary metastasis can occur many years after a diagnosis of gynecologic neoplasia-usually endometrial carcinoma, even after initial presentation at low stage. It may also be the initial manifestation in some cases-particularly ovarian carcinoma with pleural involvement. Specialist review of lung and pleural biopsies is important to confirm the diagnosis and optimize patient management.
27167673	Primitive "Spindle Cell Variant" (Sarcomatoid Variant) Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma of the Uterine Cervix: Description and Outcome of a Rare Case.	A very rare case of primary diffuse large B-cell lymphoma of the uterine cervix characterized by "spindle cell variant" morphology ("sarcomatoid subtype") is described along with a discussion of the challenging diagnosis due to its rarity and presenting clinical and pathological features.
27167552	Cardiovascular effects of radiotherapy on the patient with cancer.	The incidence of cancer (CA) has increased globally and radiotherapy (RT) is a vital component in its treatment. Cardiovascular injuries induced by RT in the treatment of thoracic and cervical CA have been causing problems in clinical practice for decades, and are among the most serious adverse effects of radiation experienced by the growing number of cancer survivors. This article presentes a review on the Lilacs, Scielo and Pubmed databases of the main cardiovascular injuries, their mechanisms, clinical presentations, treatments and prevention proposals. Injuries caused by RT include diseases of the pericardium, coronary artery disease, valvular disease, myocardial disease with systolic and diastolic dysfunction, conduction disorders, and carotid artery and great vessels disease. Thoracic and cervical irradiation increases cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Despite the great progress in the improvement of RT techniques, totally excluding prime areas of the cardiovascular system from the irradiation field is not yet possible. Guidelines must be created for monitoring, diagnosis and treatment of patients with CA treated with RT.
27167539	Synchronous gynecologic cancer and the use of imaging for diagnosis.	Endometrial and cervical cancers are the most prevalent gynecologic neoplasms. While endometrial cancer occurs in older women, cervical cancer is more prevalente in young subjects. The most common clinical manifestation in these two gynecological cancers is vaginal bleeding. In the first case, diagnosis is made based on histological and imaging evaluation of the endometrium, while cervical cancers are diagnosed clinically, according to the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO). The authors present a case of synchronous gynecological cancer of the endometrium and cervix diagnosed during staging on MRI and confirmed by histological analysis of the surgical specimen.
27167271	In-house quality check of external beam plans using 3D treatment planning systems - a DVH comparison.	This paper presents a new approach towards the quality assurance of external beam plans using in-house-developed DICOM import and export software in a clinical setup. The new approach is different from what is currently used in most clinics, viz., only MU and point dose are verified. The DICOM-RT software generates ASCII files to import/export structure sets, treatment beam data, and dose-volume histo-grams (DVH) from one treatment planning system (TPS) to the other. An efficient and reliable 3D planning system, ROPS, was used for verifying the accuracy of treatment plans and treatment plan parameters. With the use of this new approach, treatment plans planned using Varian Eclipse planning system were exported to ROPS planning system. Important treatment and dosimetrical data, such as the beam setup accuracy, target dose coverage, and dose to critical structures, were also quantitatively verified using DVH comparisons. Two external beam plans with diverse photon energies were selected to test the new approach. The satisfactory results show that the new approach is feasible, easy to use, and can be used as an adjunct test for patient treatment quality check.
27167253	A comparison of organs at risk doses in GYN intracavitary brachytherapy for different tandem lengths and bladder volumes.	The purpose of this study was to investigate the concurrent effects of tandem length and bladder volume on dose to pelvic organs at risk (OARs) in HDR intracavitary brachytherapy treatment of cervical cancer. Twenty patients with locally advanced cervical cancer were selected for brachytherapy using Rotterdam applicators. The patients were CT scanned twice with empty and full bladder. Two treatment plans were prepared on each of the image sets. Patients were categorized into two groups; those treated with a tandem length of 4 cm or smaller (T </= 4 cm) and those with tandem length larger than 4 cm (T &gt; 4 cm). Only one tandem tip angle of 30 degrees was studied. Dose-volume histograms (DVHs) of OARs were calculated and compared. Bladder dose was significantly affected by both bladder volume and tandem physical length for T </= 4 cm. This was reflected on the values obtained for D2cm(3), D1cm(3), and D0.1cm(3) for both empty and full bladder cases. When T &gt; 4 cm, no correlation could be established between variations in bladder dose and blad-der volume. Rectum dose was generally lower when the bladder was empty and T &gt; 4 cm. Dose to sigmoid was increased when T &gt; 4 cm; this increase was larger when the bladder was full. Our results suggest that, for tandems longer than 4 cm, keeping the bladder empty may reduce the dose to rectum and sigmoid. This is contrary to cases where a shorter than 4 cm tandem is used in which a full bladder (about 50-120 cm(3)) tends to result in a lower dose to rectum and sigmoid. Attention should be given to doses to sigmoid with long tandem lengths, as a larger tandem generally results in a larger dose to sigmoid.
27166306	MicoRNA-425-5p is a potential prognostic biomarker for cervical cancer.	Background MicroRNAs have been implicated in many biological pathways involved in tumourigenesis and can serve as prognostic biomarkers in many cancer types. The present study aims at evaluating the prognostic significance of miR-425-5p in cervical cancer. Methods Real-time polymerase chain reaction was performed to assess the expression levels of miR-425-5p in 35 pairs of cervical cancer tissues and their matched normal tissues as well as serum samples from 40 cervical cancer patients, 13 benign cervical disease patients and 32 healthy controls. The association between miR-425-5p expression levels in tissue and serum, and clinicopathological factors was examined. The correlation between serum miR-425-5p expression levels and overall survival of cervical cancer patients was assessed by Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox proportional hazards model. Results MiR-425-5p expression levels were significantly increased in cervical cancer tissues compared with matched non-cancerous tissues. Higher expression of miR-425-5p was positively associated with high tumour stage ( P = 0.0003) and positive lymph node metastasis ( P = 0.0107). Serum concentrations of miR-425-5p in cervical cancer patients were significantly higher compared with benign cervical disease and healthy controls. Moreover, the up-regulation of serum miR-425-5p occurred more frequently in cervical cancer patients with high TNM stage ( P = 0.0003) and positive lymph node metastasis ( P = 0.0037). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that high serum miR-425-5p expression levels predicted poor survival ( P = 0.0571). Cox proportional hazards risk analysis demonstrated that miR-425-5p was an independent prognostic factor for cervical cancer. Conclusion Our study suggests that miR-425-5p is up-regulated in cervical cancer and serum miR-425-5p may serve as a potential prognostic biomarker for cervical cancer.
27165240	Concurrent Chemoradiation with Weekly Paclitaxel and Cisplatin for Locally Advanced Cervical Cancer.	Cervical cancer is one of the most common gynecological cancers in Iranian women. This study was initiated to assess whether the combination of paclitaxel and cisplatin with radiation might feasible for these patients. The aim was to assess tumor response and toxicity of weekly cisplatin and paclitaxel along with radiotherapy in the treatment of cervical cancer. Women with primary untreated squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix with FIGO stages IB2 to IIIB were treated with weekly injections of cisplatin 30 mg/m2 and paclitaxel 35 mg/m2 for 5-6 weeks along with radiotherapy. A total of 25 patients were enrolled in this study who completed the intended treatment. Disease was assessed prior to treatment by pelvic examination and contrast enhanced MRI of the abdomen and pelvis. Response was assessed 1 month after completion of treatment by physical examination and 3 months after also by MRI.Toxicity was assessed and was graded using RTOG grading. There was a complete response rate of 84% after 3 months. The major toxicity was grade 1 and 2 anemia (92%). The mean duration of treatment was 58 days. In conclusion, combination chemotherapy with cisplatin and paclitaxel along with radiotherapy in patients with locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of cervixwas well tolerated, in contrast to other studies, but it seems that there was no increase in tumor response and progression free survival with this treatment regimen.
27165236	Relationships between Self-Efficacy and Pap Smear Screening in Iranian Women.	Cervical cancer is the fourth common cancer among women worldwide. Pap smear screening has resulted in deceasing incidence of cervical cancer in developed countries but low uptake of Pap smear screening among women in developing countries is still a public health challenge. The aim of this cross-sectional study was to assess the relationship between self-efficacy and timely uptake of Pap smear among Iranian women. A total of 580 married women referred to primary health care centers covered administratively by Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences in Tehran were administered a questionnaire by trained staff. Data were analyzed with SPSS (version 16) software, using univariate and multivariate logistic regression. The mean age for participants was 33.1+/-8.8 years. There was a significant association between self-efficacy and Pap smear screening (P<0.01). There was also a positive correlation between duration of marriage and husband's education with Pap smear uptake (P<0.01). In univariate analysis, there was a significant association between Pap smear uptake and level of self-efficacy (OR = 15.3 for intermediate and OR=7.4 for good level), duration of marriage (OR = 5.7 for 5-14 years and OR=10.4 for more than 15), age (OR =2.7 for 27-34 years and OR=7.4 for more than 35 years) and husband education level (OR=2.3 for more than 12 years of education). In multivariate analysis, significant associations persisted between Pap smear uptake and self-efficacy (OR = 23.8; 95% CI: 8.7, 65.5), duration of marriage (OR = 5.9; 95% CI: 2.8, 12.2), age (OR = 3.9; 95% CI: 1.2, 12.9) and husband's education (OR = 2.5; 95% CI: 2.0, 10.3). Efforts are needed to increase women's knowledge about cervical cancer and improve their self-efficacy and perceptions of the Pap smear screening in order to reduce cervical cancer incidence and mortality rates.
27165219	Breast and Cervical Cancer Screening in Women Referred to Urban Healthcare Centers in Kerman, Iran, 2015.	Breast and cervical cancers are among leading causes of morbidity and mortality in women worldwide. Regular screening is very important for early detection of these cancers, but studies indicate low rates of screening participation. In this survey we studied the rate of screening participation among women 18-64 years old referred to urban health centers in Kerman, Iran in 2015. A cross-sectional study was carried out on 240 women who were selected using a multistage sampling method. Data collected using a questionnaire covered demographics and questions about common cancer screening status in women. Analysis was by SPSS 19. The mean age of participants was 31.7+/- 7. Most (97.1%) were married, housewives (83.3%), had high school diploma (43.8%) and a monthly income more than ten million Rls. The frequency of the Pap test performance was higher in women who were employed and with a university degree (p<0.05). The frequency of mammography performance in women over 40 years was also higher in women with university degree (p<0.05). There was no statistically significant difference in the frequency of pelvic examination, and self and clinical breast examinations based on education, household income and employment (p>0.05). Our study found that the rate of screening participation among women is low. Investigation of the barriers, increasing the awareness of women about the importance and advantages of screening and also more incentives for health personnel especially family physicians to pay more attention to preventive programs could be effective.
27164305	Five year cancer incidence in Calabar, Nigeria (2009-2013).	Cancer incidence rates are presented for the Calabar Cancer Registry, a population-based cancer registry (PBCR) covering the population of two Local Government Areas (LGAs) of Calabar the capital of Cross-River State, Nigeria. (375,196 inhabitants in 2006). During the period 2009-2013, a total of 719 new cases were registered comprising 320 men (an age standardised incidence rate (ASR) of 78.8 per 100,000) and 399 women (ASR of 86.9 per 100,000). Breast and cervical cancers account for 60.4% of all cancers in women, with breast cancer (ASR 35 per 100,000) almost twice as common as cervix cancer (ASR 21 per 100,000) and occurring in rather younger women. Prostate cancer was the most common cancer in men (ASR 50.8 per 100,000). Hodgkin's lymphoma was common in both sexes, and there were moderate numbers of HIV-related cancers recorded (Kaposi sarcoma, non Hodgkin lymphoma, and squamous cell carcinomas of conjunctiva).
27164070	Novel N-Substituted 2-(2-(Adamantan-1-yl)-1H-Indol-3-yl)-2-Oxoacetamide Derivatives: Synthesis and Biological Evaluation.	In this study, a series of novel N-substituted 2-(2-(adamantan-1-yl)-1H-indol-3-yl)-2-oxoacetamide derivatives were synthesized, and evaluated for their cytotoxicity in human cell lines including Hela (cervical cancer), MCF7 (breast cancer ) and HepG2 (liver cancer). Several compounds were found to have potent anti-proliferative activity against those human cancer cell lines and compound 5r showed the most potent biological activity against HepG2 cells with an IC50 value of 10.56 +/- 1.14 muMu. In addition, bioassays showed that compound 5r induced time-dependent and dose-dependent cleavage of poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP), and also induced a dose-dependent increase in caspase-3 and caspase-8 activity, but had little effect on caspase-9 protease activity in HepG2 cells. These results provide evidence that 5r-induced apoptosis in HepG2 cell is caspase-8-dependent.
27161432	Human papillomavirus prevalence and type-specific distribution of high- and low-risk genotypes among Malagasy women living in urban and rural areas.	BACKGROUND: Cervical cancer (CC) is the most common cancer among sub-Saharan African women. Efficient, global reduction of CC will only be achieved by incorporation of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination into existing programmes. We aimed to investigate the overall and type-specific prevalences and distributions of oncogenic HPVs. METHODS: A total of 1081 women aged 30-65 years were recruited to three sequential studies in Madagascar. Demographic and historical data were obtained from participants, and specimens were self-collected for HPV testing using real-time polymerase chain reaction. HPV-positive women underwent detailed pelvic examination, visual inspection of the cervix with acetic acid, biopsy, and endocervical curettage. Data were analysed using chi(2) and t-tests, and logistic regression. RESULTS: The prevalence of all 19 high-risk types of HPV was 39.3%. There were no differences in the prevalences of HPV and CC between rural and urban Malagasy women. The most common high-risk HPV types were HPV-53 (6.2%) and HPV-68 (5.8%), followed by HPV-52 (5.2%), HPV-35 (4.5%), HPV-73 (3.4%), HPV-31 (3.4%), HPV-16 (3.1%), and HPV-18 (3.1%). The prevalence of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia>/=grade 2 (CIN2+) was 9.4%. CIN1-CIN3 lesions were more common in women in their 30s. The median age of participants with CIN2+ was 44 years (range 37-55). Overall, 25.8% of CIN2+ cases were associated with HPV-16/18. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence to support the introduction of HPV vaccination in eastern African countries such as Madagascar. Further studies are needed to screen younger women and adolescents, to provide a global vision of HPV genotype distributions and to maximize the impact of HPV vaccination.
27160614	[Prevalence of uterine anatomical anomalies in mexican women with recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL)].	INTRODUCTION: In Mexico, the information available about the prevalence of uterine anatomical anomalies as the direct and indirect cause of recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) is limited. OBJECTIVE: To know the prevalence and types of uterine anatomical anomalies in Mexican women with RPL. METHODS: In a cross-sectional study, we included women attending a clinic for RPL from 2008 to 2013, with a history of three or more consecutive gestational losses, with the same couple and complete study protocol by factors. Altered anatomical factor was defined by any of the following diagnoses: Mullerian malformations, submucosal myomas, uterine synechiae, endometrial polyp, and cervical weakness, confirmed by laparoscopy and hysteroscopy. RESULTS: We analyzed 188 women. The prevalence of anatomical anomalies was 41.5% (n = 78); the type of anatomical anomaly was: cervical weakness 15.9% (n = 30), septate uterus 11.7% (n = 22), and uterine synechiae 9.6% (n = 18), endometrial polyps 1.6% (n = 3), bicornuate uterus 1.1% (n = 2), arcuate uterus 0.5% (n = 1), didelphic uterus 0.5% (n=1), and submucosal myoma 0.5% (n=1). We identified the anatomic factor as the unique cause of RPL in 35.6% (n = 67) of cases. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of altered anatomical factor in Mexican women with RPL is 41.5%; more frequent anomalies were: cervical weakness, septate uterus, and uterine synechiae.
27160517	Radiotherapy for gynecologic cancer in nonagenarian patients: a framework for new paradigms.	No consensus exists regarding the role of radiotherapy in the management of gynecologic cancer in nonagenarian patients. We retrospectively reviewed the outcomes of 19 consecutive nonagenarian patients with gynecologic cancer (6 endometrial cancers, 6 cervical cancers, 4 vulvar cancers, and 3 vaginal cancers) who were treated with radiotherapy. Radiotherapy was performed mainly in a palliative setting (n = 12; 63.2%), with a median dose of 45 Gy (range, 6-76 Gy). Infrequent major acute or late toxicities were reported. Among 19 patients, 9 (47.4%) experienced tumor progression, 5 (26.3%) experienced complete response, 2 (10.5%) experienced stable disease and/or partial response. At last follow-up, 12 patients (63.2%) had died; most deaths (n = 9) occurred because of the cancer. These results suggest that radiotherapy is feasible in the treatment of nonagenarian patients with gynecologic cancer.
27160267	Comparison of Nerve-Sparing Radical Hysterectomy and Radical Hysterectomy: a Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.	BACKGROUND/AIMS: Radical hysterectomy (RH) for the treatment of cervical cancer frequently caused pelvic organ dysfunctions. This study aimed to compare the results of pelvic organ function and recurrence rate after Nerve sparing radical hysterectomy (NSRH) and RH treatment through systematic review and meta-analysis. METHODS: PubMed, Web of Science and China Knowledge Resource Integrated Database were searched from inception to 25 February 2015. Studies of cervical cancer which reported radical hysterectomy or nerve sparing radical hysterectomy were included. The quality of included studies was evaluated using the guidelines of Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. Statistical analysis was performed using Review Manager 5.3 software (Cochrane Collaboration). RESULTS: A total of 20 studies were finally included. Meta-analysis demonstrated that NSRH was associated with less bladder and anorectal dysfunction than RH. The time to bladder and anorectal function recovery after NSRH was shorter than RH. Patients undergoing NSRH also scored higher than patients undergoing RH at Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI). On the other hand, the local recurrence and overall recurrence rate were similar between NSRH and RH. CONCLUSION: NSRH may be an effective technique for lowering pelvic organ dysfunction and improving the function recovery without increasing the recurrence rate of cervical cancer.
27160224	Utility of (18)F-FDG PET/CT in patients with advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the uterine cervix receiving concurrent chemoradiotherapy: a parallel study of a prospective randomized trial.	PURPOSE: The aim of this prospective study was to assess the usefulness of (18)F-FDG PET/CT performed before and during treatment for predicting treatment failure in patients with advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the uterine cervix treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT). METHODS: Patients with cervical squamous cell carcinoma, International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage III/IVA or positive pelvic or paraaortic lymph node (LN) metastasis without other distant metastasis on PET/CT entering a randomized trial of CCRT (AGOG 09-001) were eligible. PET/CT scans were performed at baseline, during week 3 of CCRT and 2 - 3 months after CCRT. PET/CT parameters were correlated with sites of failure and overall survival (OS). The resulting predictors developed from the study cohort were validated on two independent datasets using area under the curve values, sensitivities and specificities. RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 54 months for survivors, 20 (36 %) of the 55 eligible patients were proven to have treatment failure. Sites of failure were local in five, regional in 11, and distant in 11. Four predictors for local failure, three for regional failure, and four for distant failures were identified. After validation with two independent cohorts of 31 and 105 patients, we consider the following as clinically useful predictors: pretreatment metabolic tumour volume (MTV) and during-treatment cervical tumour MTV for local failure; during-treatment SUVnode (maximum standardized uptake value of LNs) for regional and distant failure, and during-treatment MTV for distant failure. During-treatment SUVnode (P = .001) and cervical tumour MTVratio (P = .004) were independent significant predictors of OS by stepwise Cox regression. CONCLUSION: PET/CT imaging before and during treatment is useful for predicting failure sites and OS, making tailored therapeutic modifications feasible with potential outcome improvement during primary therapy.
27157762	Acid and reduction stimulated logic "and"-type combinational release mode achieved in DOX-loaded superparamagnetic nanogel.	A superparamagnetic nanogel featured with a logic "and"-type pH/reduction combinational stimulated release mode was fabricated as a drug delivery system by virtue of parallel crosslinking. The disulfide bond and electrostatic interaction between thiolated alginate (SA-SH) and thiolated/aminated iron oxide nanoparticles (SH-MION-NH2) were employed to achieve the mechanism. The obtained DOX-loaded magnetic nanogel is 122.7+/-20.3nm in size with superparamagnetism. The combinational conditions of pH5.0/10mM glutathione (GSH) stimulated a significantly high accumulative release. However, either pH7.4/10mM (GSH) or pH5.0 alone induced much low release. This verified the typical logic "and"-type combinationally stimulated release mode. In vitro cytotoxicity tests clearly illustrated the effective selectivity of killing the human cervical cancer cells (HeLa) with IC50 of 1.01mug/mL and the human hepatoma cells (HepG2) with IC50 of 1.57mug/mL but significantly low cytotoxicity to the cercopithecus aethiops kidney cells (Vero). CLSM presented the internationalization of the nanogel into cytoplasm and nuclei with time. In vivo investigation revealed that the selective intratumoral accumulation and antitumor efficacy were considerably advantageous over free DOX whereas low systemic toxicity exhibited up-regulated security as compared to free DOX. Overall, the DOX-loaded magnetic nanogel with enhanced antitumor efficacy and down-regulated adverse effect was a promising nanoplatform for the clinical chemotherapy of malignancy.
27156793	Analytical performance evaluation of Anyplex II HPV28 and Euroarray HPV for genotyping of cervical samples.	Analytically accurate human papillomavirus (HPV) genotyping methods are required to assess the impact of HPV vaccination. The aim of this study was to evaluate the analytical performance of Anyplex II HPV28 (Seegene, Korea) and Euroarray HPV (Euroimmun, Germany) genotyping kits, for conducting a future HPV vaccine efficacy monitoring study in Luxembourg. A total number of 150 cervical swabs were collected from women with mean age 31.4 years. Agreements for detecting any HPV between Aptima/Anyplex (88.0%) and Aptima/Euroarray (90.7%) were similar. Agreement of Anyplex/EuroArray with Aptima was higher for Genotypes 16, 18 or 45 than for the other 11 HPVs. The average number of HPV genotypes detected per sample was similar with 2.6 and 2.5, for Anyplex and EuroArray, respectively. In conclusion, Anyplex and Euroarray showed high agreement in general and in particular for detecting genotypes contained in HPV vaccines.
27156696	Acetylated starch nanocrystals: Preparation and antitumor drug delivery study.	In this study, we developed a new nanoparticulate system for acetylated starch nanocrystals (ASN) using broken rice. ASN with different degrees of substitution (DS) of 0.04, 0.08 and 0.14 were prepared using acetic anhydride as acetylating agent through reaction with starch nanocrystals (SN). The resulting ASN were investigated for the capability to load and release doxorubicin hydrochloride (DOX), and the antitumor activities of DOX-loaded SN and DOX-loaded ASN were evaluated as potential drug delivery systems for cancer therapy. Cellular uptake and cytotoxicity of nanocrystals and the DOX-loaded nanocrystals were investigated using fluorescence microscopy and a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) (MTT) assay. Compared with acetylated starches (AS) and native starches (NS), ASN with DS 0.14 loaded up to 6.07% of DOX with a higher loading efficiency of 91.1% and had steadier drug-release rates. Toxicity analysis using the rat hepatocytes model suggested that ASN was biocompatible and could be used for drug delivery. Furthermore, ASN were taken up by cancer cells in vitro and significantly enhanced the cytotoxicity of DOX against HeLa human cervical carcinoma cells. The IC50 value of DOX-loaded ASN-DS 0.14 was 3.8mug/mL for 24h of treatment, which was significantly lower than that of free DOX (21mug/mL). These results indicate that the prepared ASN using broken rice is a promising vehicle for the controlled delivery of DOX for cancer therapy.
27153984	Multidirectional characterisation of chemical composition and health-promoting potential of Rosa rugosa hips.	Rugosa rose provides one of the largest hips frequently used in the preparation of pharmaceutical and food products. The aim of work was to conduct multidirectional study of biological activity and chemical composition of Rosa rugosa hips. Antiradical, cytotoxic (against cervical and breast cancer cell lines), antibacterial (against eight bacterial strains) and antifungal potential of the species in question was evaluated. Total contents of phenolics, phenolic acids, flavonoids, tannins, carotenoids and ascorbic acid were determined. LC-ESI-MS/MS analysis was performed in order to investigate closely phenolic acids and flavonoid glycosides. As a result, interesting selective cytotoxic effects on cervical (HeLa) and breast cancer (T47D) cell lines, significant antiradical activity (EC50 2.45 mg mg-1 DPPH*) and moderate antimicrobial potential (MIC 0.625-1.25 mg mL-1) were observed. Nine phenolic acids and 11 flavonoid glycosides were qualitatively and quantitatively determined, including 7 compounds previously not reported in R. rugosa hips.
27149709	[A Case of Cystic Cervical Lymph Node Metastasis of HPV-positive Tonsil Cancer, Being Discriminated as the Branchiogenic Carcinoma].	In recent years, human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive oropharyngeal carcinomas have been increasing. The first manifestation of these tumors is frequently as cystic metastasis to cervical lymph nodes that may precede recognition of the primary tumor, so, they often result in misdiagnosis as branchial cleft cysts. We report a case of cystic cervical lymph node metastasis of HPV-positive tonsil cancer. The patient was a 70-years-old man who noticed a mass on his left neck. The tumor was large and soft, and it was diagnosed as benign in fine-needle aspiration cytology. We diagnosed the tumor as a branchial cleft cyst and undertook surgery. The histopathological diagnosis was squamous cell carcinoma arising from a branchiogenic cyst. However, because it did not satisfy the diagnostic criteria, we diagnosed the tumor as an unknown primary tumor. One year later, left tonsil cancer was suspected based on PET-CT imaging and a left tonsillectomy was undertaken, whereafter tonsil cancer was found. In p16 immunostaining, it was positive in both cystic mass and tonsil. The cervical mass was cystic lymph node metastasis of HPV-positive tonsil cancer. It is important to investigate the oropharynx, when we found cystic cervical mass, because HPV-positive oropharyngeal carcinoma frequently results in cystic neck metastasis.
27149550	The first comprehensive report on Indigenous Australian women's inequalities in cervical screening: A retrospective registry cohort study in Queensland, Australia (2000-2011).	BACKGROUND: The Australian National Cervical Screening Program, introduced more than 20 years ago, does not record the Indigenous status of screening participants. This article reports the first population-based estimates of participation in cervical screening for Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australian women. METHODS: This was a retrospective, population-based study of 1,334,795 female Queensland residents, aged 20 to 69 years, who participated in cervical screening from 2000 to 2011; 26,829 were identified as Indigenous through linkage to hospitalization records. Participation rates were calculated as the number of women screened divided by the average estimated resident population, with adjustments made for hysterectomies, for each 2-, 3-, and 5-year screening period. Multivariate logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), which were adjusted for age group, place of residence, and socioeconomic disadvantage. RESULTS: In 2010-2011, the 2-year participation rate was 55.7% (95% CI, 55.6%-55.9%) for non-Indigenous women and 33.5% (95% CI, 32.9%-34.1%) for Indigenous women; this represented a decrease from 2000-2001 (57.7% [95% CI, 57.6%-57.9%] and 35.3% [95% CI, 34.5%-36.1%], respectively). The difference between Indigenous and non-Indigenous women was greatest for those aged 45 to 49 years. The 3- and 5-year participation rates were higher within both groups, and the absolute differences between the 2 groups were larger. Significant interactions between the Indigenous status and the place of residence and socioeconomic disadvantage highlight that the Indigenous/non-Indigenous differential was evident in all places of residence except for very remote areas (OR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.95-1.02) and was greatest in the most affluent areas (OR, 0.26; 95% CI, 0.24-0.27). CONCLUSIONS: Indigenous Australian women participate less than non-Indigenous women, and this gap has not closed. These results provide important benchmarks for the new Australian cervical screening program commencing in 2017, which will provide opportunities to reduce inequities for Indigenous women and address longstanding data deficiencies in the collection of the Indigenous status.

27149525	Perceptions and Experiences of Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Infection and Testing among Low-Income Mexican Women.	BACKGROUND: HPV infection causes cervical cancer, a major contributor to morbidity and mortality among low-income Mexican women. Human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA testing is now a primary screening strategy in Mexico's early cervical cancer detection program (ECDP). Research on Mexican women's perceptions of HPV and testing is necessary for establishing culturally appropriate protocols and educational materials. Here, we explore perceptions about HPV and HPV-related risk factors among low-income Mexican ECDP participants. METHODS: We conducted semi-structured interviews with 24 ECDP participants from two primary care health clinics in Michoacan state, Mexico. Interviews addressed women's understandings of and experiences with HPV and HPV testing. Analysis was inductive and guided by the Health Belief Model with a focus on gender. RESULTS: Women's confusion about HPV and HPV screening caused emotional distress. They understood HPV to be a serious disease that would always cause severe symptoms, often characterizing it as analogous to HIV or inevitably carcinogenic. Women also attributed it to men's sexual behaviors, specifically infidelity and poor hygiene. Women described both sexes' desire for sex as natural but understood men's negative practices of masculinity, like infidelity, as the causes of women's HPV infection. Some women believed dirty public bathrooms or heredity could also cause HPV transmission. CONCLUSIONS: These results are consistent with prior findings that geographically and economically diverse populations lack clear understandings of the nature, causes, or symptoms of HPV, even among those receiving HPV testing. Our findings also reveal that local cultural discourse relating to masculinity, along with failure to provide sufficient education to low-income and indigenous-language speaking patients, exacerbate women's negative emotions surrounding HPV testing. While negative emotions did not deter women from seeking testing, they could be ameliorated with better health education and communication.
27147341	The rotate-plus-shift C-arm trajectory. Part I. Complete data with less than 180 degrees rotation.	PURPOSE: In the last decade, C-arm-based cone-beam CT became a widely used modality for intraoperative imaging. Typically a C-arm CT scan is performed using a circular or elliptical trajectory around a region of interest. Therefore, an angular range of at least 180 degrees plus fan angle must be covered to ensure a completely sampled data set. However, mobile C-arms designed with a focus on classical 2D applications like fluoroscopy may be limited to a mechanical rotation range of less than 180 degrees to improve handling and usability. The method proposed in this paper allows for the acquisition of a fully sampled data set with a system limited to a mechanical rotation range of at least 180 degrees minus fan angle using a new trajectory design. This enables CT like 3D imaging with a wide range of C-arm devices which are mainly designed for 2D imaging. METHODS: The proposed trajectory extends the mechanical rotation range of the C-arm system with two additional linear shifts. Due to the divergent character of the fan-beam geometry, these two shifts lead to an additional angular range of half of the fan angle. Combining one shift at the beginning of the scan followed by a rotation and a second shift, the resulting rotate-plus-shift trajectory enables the acquisition of a completely sampled data set using only 180 degrees minus fan angle of rotation. The shifts can be performed using, e.g., the two orthogonal positioning axes of a fully motorized C-arm system. The trajectory was evaluated in phantom and cadaver examinations using two prototype C-arm systems. RESULTS: The proposed trajectory leads to reconstructions without limited angle artifacts. Compared to the limited angle reconstructions of 180 degrees minus fan angle, image quality increased dramatically. Details in the rotate-plus-shift reconstructions were clearly depicted, whereas they are dominated by artifacts in the limited angle scan. CONCLUSIONS: The method proposed here employs 3D imaging using C-arms with less than 180 degrees rotation range adding full 3D functionality to a C-arm device retaining both handling comfort and the usability of 2D imaging. This method has a clear potential for clinical use especially to meet the increasing demand for an intraoperative 3D imaging.
27146749	Clinical significance of geographic miss when using conventional four field radiotherapy technique in treatment of locally advanced carcinoma cervix.	BACKGROUND: Although conventional four- field radiotherapy based on bony landmarks has been traditionally used, areas of geographical miss due to individual variation in pelvic anatomy have been identified with advanced imaging techniques. AIMS: The primary aim of this study is to evaluate the geographical miss in patientswhen using the conventional four-field planningplanning and to find out the impact of 3-D conformal CT based in patients with locally advanced carcinoma cervix. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In 50 patients, target volume delineation was done on planning computed tomography (CT) scans, according to guidelines by Taylor et al. Patients were treated with modified four field plan, except for the superior, where field border was kept at L4-L5 interspace A dosimetric comparison was done between the conventional four-field based on bony landmarks and the target volume delineated on computed tomography. The disease free survival, pelvic and para aortic nodal free survival, distant failures free survival were calculated using Kaplan Meir Product Limit Method. RESULTS: Patients were followed-up for a median period of 11 months. The median V95 for conventional and modified extended four field plans were 89.4% and 91.3% respectively. Patients with V95 for modified extended pelvic fields less than 91.3% had a trend toward inferior disease free survival (mean DFS 9.8 vs. 13.9 months) though the difference was not statistically significant log rank test. CONCLUSIONS: Our preliminary data shows trend toward lower DFS in patients with inadequate target volume coverage. We recommend routine use of CT based planning for four field technique.
27146748	Cancer cervix: An uncommon malignancy in Kashmir, India.	OBJECTIVE: To study the distribution of cancers among females with particular emphasis on cancer cervix in Kashmiri population, which is geographically and socio-culturally distinct from the rest of India. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All patient records were screened from January 1, 2009 to December 31, 2011 at Regional Cancer Centre, Srinagar. Most common cancers among females were recorded and analysis of cancer cervix cases was performed. RESULTS: Female cancers comprised of 40% of total cancers with oesophageal and breast cancer as most common malignancies. Cancer cervix did not figure in top ten cancers and only 45 (0.01%) cases were recorded of the total of 3084 adult female cancers. CONCLUSION: We conclude that due to different socio-cultural and sexual practices, this cancer is highly uncommon in Kashmir and screening or possibly should be directed specifically at only high risk selective subjects.
27146747	Pap test accuracy and severity of squamous intraepithelial lesion.	BACKGROUND: Cytology smears and guided biopsies are the most widely used diagnostic standards for cervical cancer (CC) screening in the developing countries. AIM: To evaluate the performance of conventional cytology in estimating the presence and grade of cervical disease against the reference standard of histopathology. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: After primary screening for CC, directed biopsies were performed and compared with histopathology results. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Papanicolaou (Pap) smears and biopsies from 3194 women in the age group of 14-98 years were included. Cytology results were provided by doctors who performed the cervical biopsies. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: The accuracy of Pap smear was measured by sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) calculated using the statistical analysis program PSPP 0.7.8. RESULTS: The sensitivity of conventional cytology (Pap smear) for women with low-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia or less serious lesions (CIN1-) was 93% and specificity was 73%. The sensitivity and specificity of cytology for women with high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia or cancer (CIN2+) was 64% and 84%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Cytology is a sufficiently sensitive test for detection of cervical lesions and can be used as a primary testing tool to triage.
27146746	Abnormal uterine cervical cytology in a large tertiary hospital in Bangkok metropolis: Prevalence, management, and outcomes.	OBJECTIVES: To determine the prevalence of abnormal cervical cytology, management, and association with clinical significant histopathology including cervical intraepithelial neoplasia II or adenocarcinoma in situ and more severe lesions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Women with abnormal cervical cytology from January 2005 to December 2009 were identified from the archives of Department of Anatomical Pathology and Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology. Demographic data, type of abnormal cytology, management, and their associated histopathology were collected. RESULTS: During the study period: 2533/54,179 women (4.7%) had abnormal cervical Pap test. Squamous lesions were more common than glandular lesions: 2309 (4.3%) compared to 224 (0.4%). Atypical squamous cell (ASC) was most commonly found (1449 or 2.7%), whereas low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) and high-grade squamous intra-epithelial lesion (HSIL), or squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) were found in 648 (1.2%) and 212 (0.4%), respectively. Among abnormal glandular cytology, atypical glandular cell (AGC) was most commonly found (199 women or 0.4%) whereas adenocarcinoma and endometrial cell in woman aged >40 year were found in only 14 (0.02%) and 11 women (0.02%), respectively. Majority (77.3%) underwent further investigations. We found that 13.0% of ASC, 20.3% of LSIL, and 78.7% of HSIL and SCC had clinical significant histopathology. In glandular abnormalities: 14.9% of AGC, 33.3% of women aged >40 years with endometrial cell, and 66.7% of adenocarcinoma were histologically proven to be of clinical significant. CONCLUSIONS: ASC was the most common abnormal cervical cytology. Cytology abnormalities of HSIL and SCC had the highest association with clinical significant histopathology.
27146744	Awareness of cervical cancer and Pap smear among nursing staff at a rural tertiary care hospital in Central India.	BACKGROUND: Cancer cervix is the leading cause of cancer deaths in females in developing countries and one in five women suffering from cervical cancer lives in India. AIMS: The aim of this study is to determine the awareness about cervical cancer and Pap smear among nurses working in a tertiary care institute. Study Setting and Design: Cross-sectional survey in a tertiary care institute. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Nurses working at our institute excluding those who have worked or working in the Obstetrics and Gynecology department were provided with a pre-designed questionnaire testing their knowledge about cervical cancer. RESULTS: Approximately, 86% were aware about cancer cervix and 69% were aware of a pre-cancerous stage. 42.3% were not aware of any risk factor and 27.6% were not aware of any symptom of cancer cervix. 86.2% were aware about Pap smear, but only 58.6% were aware that facilities of Pap smear were available at our hospital. CONCLUSIONS: Knowledge about cervical cancer and awareness of Pap smear as screening test was inadequate in nursing staff. Awareness programs about cervical cancer and screening are needed to increase awareness for this preventable condition. RECOMMENDATION: There is a need to arrange reorientation programs to sensitize nurses and establish cytology clinics to offer facilities for easily accessible and affordable screening.
27146743	Spectrum of cervical lesions observed in 500 cases: Carcinoma cervix the leading cause of death in females.	INTRODUCTION: The present study was done to know the various histopathological variants in cervical lesions, to know the age incidence and to know the preventive measures and early detection of cervical cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a retrospective and prospective study done on all the hysterectomy specimens and on punch biopsy samples sent for histopathology. We studied a total of 500 cases for a period of 3 years. RESULTS: Out of the 500 cases, 395 cases were non-neoplastic and 105 cases were neoplastic lesions. Chronic cervicitis was the most common non-neoplastic lesion and large cell non-keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma was the most common malignant lesion. CONCLUSION: The main aim of presenting this study is to highlight the various histopthological variants, age incidence and to educate about the preventive measures and early detection of cervical cancer.
27146741	Is neo-adjuvant chemotherapy a better option for management of cervical cancer patients of rural India?	OBJECTIVES: To explore alternate modality of treatment in patients of advanced cancer cervix by neo-adjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) followed by External Beam Radiotherapy (ERT) and Brachytherapy (BT). Short- (6 months) and long- (12 months) term follow-up data from these patients were compared with the retrospective data from an urban cancer centre, where standard protocol of concurrent chemo-radiotherapy is practiced. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two hundred patients of advanced cervical cancer, treated at our rural cancer centre between January 2007 and December 2007, were included in the study arm (Group A). These patients received three cycles of neo-adjuvant chemotherapy with Cisplatin, Bleomycin, and Vincristine before External-Beam Radiotherapy (EBT) followed by brachytherapy. Patients in the control arm (Group B) of an urban cancer centre, received EBT with weekly concomitant Cisplatin, followed by brachytherapy. Short- (6 months) and long- (12 months) term follow-up data from our patients were compared with the retrospective data from the urban cancer centre. RESULTS AND ANALYSIS: Complete response rate was comparatively higher among patients of Group A, also correspondingly proportion of patients showing progressive disease and stable disease was lower among them. Local treatment failure was 87.5% among patients from Group A and 94.4% in Group B patients. Concomitant chemoradiation (CRT) was associated with more GI toxicities. CONCLUSION: Our result suggests NACT arm is as effective as CRT arm in respect of complete response with less pelvic failure and G.I toxicities. Further follow-up data are needed before arriving at a definite conclusion.
27146739	Predictors of Iranian women's intention to first papanicolaou test practice: An application of protection motivation theory.	BACKGROUND AND AIM: Given the importance of papanicolaou (Pap) test in the early detection and timely treatment of cervical cancer, present study was designed to determine predictors of a sample of Iranian women's intention to first Pap test practice based on the protection motivation theory (PMT) variables. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, a total of 240 women referral to the 30 primary health care clinics were selected. They completed a developed scale based on PMT variables including intention, perceived vulnerability and severity, fear, response costs, response efficacy and self-efficacy. Path analysis was used to determine the association between predictive factors and intention. RESULTS: The results showed that PMT had goodness of fit with a chi2/df = 2.37, df = 28, P= 0.001 and RMSEA = 0.076. PMT explained 42% of the variance in women's intention to get first Pap smear test. Self-efficacy (b = 0.55, P< 0.001) and response efficacy (b = 0.19, P< 0.001) were found to be the predictors of intention. CONCLUSION: These findings may be used to develop tailored, theory-based educational interventions associated with Pap testing among women.
27146738	Association between occupational history of exposure to tobacco dust and risk of carcinoma cervix: A case-control study.	CONTEXT: Cervical cancer is the second most common malignancy among women in India. There is thus a need to identify unexplored risk factors such as occupational exposure to tobacco dust to justify its increasing trend so as to recommend suitable preventive measures. AIMS: The aim was to study the association between occupational exposure to tobacco dust with development of carcinoma cervix. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: Case-control study done in two tertiary care hospitals in Mangalore. METHODOLOGY: 239 histologically confirmed new cases of cervical cancer and the equivalent number of age-matched controls from 2011 to 2012 were interviewed about occupational history of beedi rolling and related factors. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Chi-square test, unpaired t-test, logistic regression. RESULTS: Exposure rate to tobacco dust following beedi rolling was 63 (26.4%) among cases and 38 (15.9%) among controls (P = 0.005, odds ratio [OR] =1.893). The latent period from occupational exposure of tobacco dust subsequent to beedi rolling and development of cervical cancer was found to be 26.5 +/- 8.5 years. Adjusted OR of beedi rolling with development of cervical cancer was found to be 1.913 (P = 0.005) after controlling the confounding effect of tobacco usage and was 1.618 (P = 0.225) after controlling the effects of all confounders. Three-quarters of beedi rollers were working in conditions of inadequate ventilation and hardy anybody used face mask during work. About a quarter of participants underwent voluntary screening for cervical cancer. CONCLUSION: Occupational exposure to tobacco dust was found to be associated with risk of developing cervical cancer. Measures to promote awareness, timely screening of this disease along with the improvement in working conditions is required for improving the health status of beedi rollers and to minimize the incidence of carcinoma cervix in the community.
27146732	P120ctn may participate in epithelial-mesenchymal transition in OSCC.	AIM: Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is the eighth most common cause of cancer death. OSCC cells can easily invade tissues and metastasize to the cervical lymph nodes. Understanding the molecular basis of OSCC metastasis would facilitate the development of new therapeutic approaches to the disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To identify the potential role of catenin (P120ctn) in the progression of OSCC, HN4 cells (derived from a primary OSCC) and HN12 cells (derived from a lymph node metastasis in the same patient) were used in the present study. The samples of 28 patients with OSCC were examined to determine the expression of P120ctn and E-cadherin (E-cad; E: Epithelial) in vivo. Then, P120ctn was subsequently knocked down in HN4 cells (HN4/shP120ctn) and overexpressed in HN12 cells (HN12/P120ctn). Invasion and migration capacity, as well as the expression of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers N-cadherin and vimentin were detected. RESULTS: The results showed a positive correlation between the expression of P120ctn and E-cad in OSCC samples. The overexpression of P120ctn led to a decrease in both invasion and migration capacity of HN12 cells accompanied by a decrease in EMT markers. In contrast, knockdown of P120ctn led to an increase in both invasion and migration capacity accompanied by an increase in EMT markers. CONCLUSION: Considered together, we concluded that P120ctn might regulate EMT in OSCC through E-cad. The proper expression of P120ctn might therefore serve as a therapeutic goal for the inhibition of OSCC progression.
27141702	Adolescent Vaccination Performance in South Carolina Compared to the United States.	National data on vaccine up-to-date (UTD) suggest that insufficient numbers of adolescents receive needed vaccines. This study analyzed public use data of the National Immunization Survey-Teen (NIS-Teen) from 2010 through 2013 for South Carolina (SC) adolescents and compared immunization rates to those of United States (US) adolescents. We also examined trends for each vaccine recommended for adolescents for both SC and US adolescents. UTD rates in SC adolescents for the quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccine (MCV4) and the tetanus- diphtheria, acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccine lag those of US adolescents, despite demonstrating a trend of improvement in SC adolescents from 45% to 69% for MCV and from 48% to 72% for Tdap. Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine UTD rates for SC adolescents demonstrated improvement over a 4 year period. HPV vaccination for SC girls improved when compared to the US, however UTD rates for both the SC and US were still well below the Healthy People 2020 goal of 80%. For all three vaccines, parental recall for a provider recommendation to vaccinate their adolescent was around or below 50%, except for HPV in females where it reached 65% in SC and 69% in the US. Differences between state and national rates may help SC providers focus on specific interventions needed to improve UTD rates.
27145290	Identification of genetic variants in TNF receptor 2 which are associated with the development of cervical carcinoma.	Cervical cancer is one of the most common malignancies among women in India. Beside HPV, other factors present in host also put their role in the progression of cervical tumerogenesis. In present study, we screened 300 subjects to identify variations in TNFR2 gene by PCR-dHPLC method followed by direct sequencing. We identified six known and four novel variations in six different exons of TNFR2 gene. Out of these identified variations, five known variations were found to be significantly associated with the risk of cervical cancer (p < 0.0001). On construction of haplotypes, one haplotype (TTGCC) was emerged as a major protective type while two (CAAGC + CTGCC) were revealed as major risk haplotypes. In conclusion, postmenopausal women having CAAGC + CTGCC haplotypes in TNFR2 gene along with HPV infection and tobacco consumption may lead to the development of cervical cancer.
27144672	Neuromuscular electrical stimulation improves radiation-induced fibrosis through Tgf-Beta1/MyoD homeostasis in head and neck cancer.	OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to analyze TGF-beta1 and MyoD expression in cervical muscles during radiation therapy (RT) and their role in inducing muscle fibrosis in head and neck cancer (HNC) patients. We also studied the effect of combined traditional swallow therapy (TST) and neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) therapy on TGF-beta1/MyoD homeostasis in patients undergoing post-operative RT for HNC. STUDY DESIGN: Case-control study. METHODS: Thirty patients, 10 with benign thyroid lesions and non-radiated muscle (control), and 20 with advanced-stage HNC receiving primary resection and post-operative radiation (study group) were enrolled. Patients in the study group were randomly assigned to receive post-operative RT alone (Group I) or post-operative RT with TST/NMES therapy (Group II). Intraoperative biopsies were obtained in all 30 patients. In the study groups, biopsies were repeated 4 weeks after completion of RT. TGF-beta1 and MyoD expression were evaluated by immunohistochemistry and Western Blot. RESULTS: The control group demonstrated low expression of TGF-beta1 and high expression of MyoD. Following RT, patients in study Group I had high expression of TGF-beta1 and low levels of MyoD. Group II patients demonstrated TGF-beta1 levels more consistent with that of non-irradiated tissue. CONCLUSION: The molecular pathogenesis of RT-induced muscle fibrosis involves the TGF-beta1 pathway and its repression of MyoD expression. Our results suggest a correlation between TST/NMES combined therapy and the restoration of TGF-beta1/MyoD homeostasis in cervical muscles. TST/NMES is a plausible prophylaxis and/or treatment for RT-induced muscle fibrosis and dysphagia. J. Surg. Oncol. 2016;114:27-31. (c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
27143091	Somatic health of 2500 women examined at a sexual assault center over 10 years.	INTRODUCTION: Sexual assault is a public health issue with many potential short- and long-term consequences for the victims. We aimed to investigate somatic health of women before and after sexual assault. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We included 2501 women who attended the Centre for Victims of Sexual Assault in Copenhagen, and 10004 women without a known assault experience (controls). Somatic diagnoses were retrieved from the National Health Registry and number of visits to general practitioners from the Danish Health Insurance Registry. Somatic data were assessed during the five-year period before and after the assault. RESULTS: The incidence of several somatic disorders was found to be significantly higher for the exposed women than for controls, both before and after the assault. Rate ratios of main disorders before and after the assault were respectively: disease of circulatory and respiratory system: 3.2 (2.6-4.1) and 2.6 (2.1-3.2); epilepsy: 2.9 (2.2-3.8) and 4.1 (3.0-5.6) and disease of the liver: 3.5 (1.9-6.3) and 7.0 (4.4-11.1), respectively. The rate ratios of laparoscopic surgery: 1.5 (0.9-2.5) and 3.4 (2.3-5.0) and of cervical cancer: 0.8 (0.4-1.7) and 2.0 (1.4-3.0) increased significantly after sexual assault. Likewise, the number of visits to a general practitioner was significantly higher in exposed women both before and after the assault (16 vs. 10/year). Complications associated with childbirth were not statistically different between the groups. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest a higher somatic morbidity in women seen at a sexual assault center before as well as after the assault compared with controls.
27142771	Feasibility study on combination chemotherapy using nogitecan hydrochloride (topotecan) and cisplatin for patients with metastatic, persistent, or recurrent uterine cervical cancer.	BACKGROUND: The standard chemotherapeutic regimen for stage IVB, persistent, or recurrent uterine cervical cancer is platinum-based combination chemotherapy such as cisplatin (CDDP)/paclitaxel and CDDP/nogitecan hydrochloride (NGT, topotecan). Because it is unclear whether the CDDP/NGT combination chemotherapy is tolerable for Japanese patients, we conducted the present study to assess the feasibility of CDDP/NGT combination chemotherapy. METHODS: Between June 2012 and April 2014, 15 patients with stage IVB, persistent, or recurrent uterine cervical cancer were enrolled in this study. Patients underwent six cycles of NGT at a dose of 0.75 mg/m2, followed immediately by CDDP at a dose of 50 mg/m2 on day 1 by intravenous infusion, and then NGT at a dose of 0.75 mg/m2 on days 2 and 3. RESULTS: Of 15 patients, 9 patients underwent at least 6 cycles of NGT/CDDP combination chemotherapy. Of a total of 83 cycles, 70 cycles (84.3 %) of NGT/CDDP combination chemotherapy could be continued at the starting dose of NGT (0.75 mg/m2). Grade 3/4 hematological toxicities included leukopenia in 10 patients (66.7 %), neutropenia in 15 (100 %), anemia in 6 (40.0 %), thrombocytopenia in 4 (26.7 %), and febrile neutropenia in 4 (26.7 %). The response rate according to RECIST was 27 % (3/11), with partial response in 3 patients. CONCLUSIONS: NGT/CDDP combination chemotherapy may be a tolerable and effective regimen for Japanese patients with stage IVB, persistent, or recurrent uterine cervical cancer. Based on the results of this study, NGT/CDDP combination chemotherapy was approved in Japan in November 2015.
27140022	Primary NK/T-cell lymphoma of the larynx: Report of 2 cases and review of the English-, Japanese-, and Chinese-language literature.	Natural killer/T (NK/T) -cell lymphoma in the larynx is extremely rare, as only 29 cases have been previously reported in the English-language, Japanese-language, and Chinese-language literature. Its characteristics have never been systematically illustrated. We report 2 new cases of laryngeal NK/T-cell lymphoma, and we discuss the process of the diagnosis of this disease, the choice of treatment, and treatment outcomes. We also summarize all 31 cases reported thus far. Symptoms of laryngeal NK/T-cell lymphoma are difficult to differentiate from those of other laryngeal diseases. The most common laryngeal subsite in the reported cases was the supraglottis, and roughly one-third of these cases involved the cervical lymph nodes. Because of our limited experience with this disease and the difficulties encountered in interpreting the pathologic findings, most patients required multiple biopsies over a few months before their diagnosis was confirmed. The outcome of treatment was generally poor. Radiotherapy, alone or combined with chemotherapy, was superior to chemotherapy alone in treating this disease in its early stages. In view of the frequency of local lymph node metastasis, irradiation fields should cover the entire cervical area. We believe that prompt diagnosis and treatment with radiotherapy are both critical to improving survival for patients with laryngeal NK/T-cell lymphoma.
27137809	Preparation and characterization of latex films photo-immobilized with IFN-alpha.	We developed a biomaterial by photo-immobilizing interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) on the surface of latex condom films for the prevention and treatment of cervicitis, cervical cancers and diseases caused by cervical virus. The IFN-alpha modification by photoactive N-(4-azidobenzoyloxy) succinimide was characterized on a nano-scale by spectroscopy analysis and micro morphology. The anti-bacterial, anti-cancer, and anti-viral effects of the modified bioactive latex films were evaluated by antibacterial susceptibility testing, Gram staining, flow cytometry, immunofluorescence, and Western blotting. Our results showed that the photo-immobilized IFN-alpha latex films effectively inhibited the growth of both Neisseria gonorrhoeae and human cervical cancer HeLa cells. Moreover, the expression of anti-viral proteins, including P56, MxA, and 2', 5'-OAS, in the human cervical epithelial cell line NC104 was significantly increased by photo-immobilized IFN-alpha latex films. Taken together, these results suggest that photo-immobilized IFN-alpha latex films may have therapeutic effects against cervicitis, cervical cancers, and cervical virus.
27137353	Carboplatin-based chemoradiotherapy in advanced cervical cancer: an alternative to cisplatin-based regimen?	OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the results of treatment with cisplatin or carboplatin concomitant with radiotherapy (RT) in cases of locally advanced cervical cancer (CC). METHODS: This study is a retrospective analysis of medical records of 184 patients with cervical cancer stage IIB-IVA who were treated at Instituto do Cancer do Estado de Sao Paulo from May 2008 to December 2012. All patients received complete pelvic region external-beam RT with weekly cisplatin (cis-RT, 40mg/m(2); n=159) or carboplatin (carbo-RT, AUC 2; n=25), followed by high-dose-rate intracavitary brachytherapy (HDR-ICBT). Primary endpoint was progression free survival; secondary endpoints were overall survival and overall response rate, which includes complete and partial responses. RESULTS: Five or more chemotherapy cycles were administered to 87.3% and 84% of the cis-RT- and carbo-RT- treated patients, respectively (p=0.749). Estimated 3-years progression free survival was 59% in the cis-RT group vs 40% in the carbo-RT group (p=0.249). Estimated 3-years overall survival was 70% in the cis-RT group vs 68% in the carbo-RT group (p=0.298). Overall response rate (95.3% cis-RT vs 95.4% carbo-RT; p=0.911) and grade >/=3 toxic effects (8.5% cis-RT vs 11.8% carbo-RT; p=0.757) were similar. In multivariate analysis, only the overall response rate was a significant predictor of survival. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with advanced cervical cancer who are treated with carbo-RT have similar 3-years overall survival, progression free survival, overall response rate, and toxic effects when compared to cis-RT-treated patients. Carbo-RT may be an alternative treatment in patients that cannot receive cisplatin.
27137347	In vitro development and validation of a non-invasive (13)C-stable isotope assay for ornithine decarboxylase.	Oesophageal cancer is a significant cause of cancer related mortality, with increasing incidence worldwide. Ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) is an enzyme involved in polyamine synthesis and cellular proliferation, and ODC expression and activity has been implicated as a prognostic marker of oesophageal cancer. This study aimed to develop and optimise an in vitro (13)C-stable isotope assay for ODC activity as a non-invasive marker of oesophageal cancer. Experiments were performed in triplicate (n = 3/group/cell line) using Caco2, HeLa, Flo-1, OE33, TE7 and OE21 cell lines (colorectal, cervical, oesophageal adenocarcinoma and oesophageal squamous carcinoma respectively). Following addition of 2mM (13)C-ornithine to cells, 10 ml gas samples were collected from the headspace every 20 min for a total of five hours. Gas samples were analysed using isotope ratio mass spectrometry to quantify (13)CO2. Assay specificity was determined using the selective ODC inhibitor, N-(4'-Pyridoxil)-Ornithine(BOC)-OMe (POB). All data is expressed as delta (13)CO2 from baseline. High ODC activity was detected by (13)C-ornithine assay in Caco2 (32.00 +/- 1.12 delta (13)CO2) in contrast to HeLa cells (5.44 +/- 0.14 delta (13)CO2) cells. POB inhibited activity in Caco2 cells to 12.87 +/- 1.10 delta (13)CO2. Differential ODC activity was detected in all oesophageal cancer cells, and 53 h incubation of cell lines with POB reduced activity by 72%, 56%, 64% and 69% in the Flo-1, OE33, OE21 and TE7 cell lines respectively. We have shown that ODC activity can be selectively detected by a non-invasive, stable-isotope (13)C-ornithine assay. ODC activity was detected in all oesophageal cancer cell lines in vitro. Further studies are indicated to quantify ODC activity in oesophageal cancer patients.
27136615	Digital holographic microscopy as screening tool for cervical cancer preliminary study.	BACKGROUND: The liquid-based cytology Papanicolaou (Pap) test has gradually replaced the conventional Pap test, as it seems to be more efficient, in part because it uses computer assistance. However, Pap test diagnoses are still subjective and are cost-consuming or time-consuming. The authors describe a new digital holographic microscopy instrument and accompanying software. This technology provides an instantaneous, 3-dimensional image reconstruction of cells directly from the uterine cervical sample vial. METHODS: Analyses were performed using the proprietary digital holographic microscopy (DHM) instrument, computer, and software. Residual materials from 3 randomly chosen laboratories were analyzed and subjected to DHM, and the sensitivity and specificity of DHM were calculated for the detection neoplasia. RESULTS: In 41 specimens that yielded normal Pap test results, 1333 cells were analyzed using DHM; and, in 30 specimens that yielded abnormal Pap test results, 494 cells were analyzed using DHM. Available histologic correlation was as follows: 4 histologic samples were diagnosed as grade 1 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (corresponding to 2 cytologic diagnoses of low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion and 2 cytologic diagnoses of atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance), 4 histologic samples were diagnosed as grade 3 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (corresponding to 2 cytologic diagnoses of low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion and 2 cytologic diagnosis of atypical squamous cells, cannot rule out high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion), and 11 lesions were diagnosed as benign. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis indicated that the best criteria were the nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio (area under the curve, 0.88; 95% confidence interval, 0.68-1.00) and the greatest nuclear dimension (area under the curve, 0.85; 95% confidence interval, 0.66-1.00). CONCLUSIONS: This preliminary study demonstrated for the first time that the DHM technique is suitable for the processing of gynecologic cervical samples. Nevertheless, DHM criteria and parameters could be better defined. Hopefully, holographic analysis will be performed automatically and will provide an instantaneous, cost-effective diagnosis from a closed vial with the preservation of all cellular material.

27136538	One-Pot Three-Component Synthesis of Novel Diethyl((2-oxo-1,2-dihydroquinolin-3-yl)(arylamino)methyl)phosphonate as Potential Anticancer Agents.	With the aim of discovering new anticancer agents, we have designed and synthesized novel alpha-aminophosphonate derivatives containing a 2-oxoquinoline structure using a convenient one-pot three-component method. The newly synthesized compounds were evaluated for antitumor activities against the A549 (human lung adenocarcinoma cell), HeLa (human cervical carcinoma cell), MCF-7 (human breast cancer cell), and U2OS (human osteosarcoma cell) cancer cell lines in vitro, employing a standard 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2-H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. The results of pharmacological screening indicated that many compounds exhibited moderate to high levels of antitumor activities against the tested cancer cell lines and that most compounds showed more potent inhibitory activities comparable to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) which was used as a positive control. The mechanism of representative compound 4u (diethyl((2-oxo-1,2-dihydroquinolin-3-yl)(phenyl-amino)methyl)phosphonate) indicated that the compound mainly arrested HeLa cells in S and G2 stages and was accompanied by apoptosis in HeLa cells. This action was confirmed by acridine orange/ethidium bromide staining, Hoechst 33342 staining, and flow cytometry.
27136527	A Novel Photosensitizer 3(1),13(1)-phenylhydrazine -Mppa (BPHM) and Its in Vitro Photodynamic Therapy against HeLa Cells.	Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has attracted widespread attention due to its potential in the treatment of various cancers. Porphyrinic pyropheophorbide-a (PPa) has been shown to be a potent photosensitizer in PDT experiments. In this paper, a C-3(1),13(1) bisphenylhydrazone modified methyl pyropheophorbide-a (BPHM) was designed and synthesized with the consideration that phenylhydrazone structure may extend absorption wavelength of methyl pyro-pheophorbide-a (Mppa), and make the photosensitizer potential in deep tumor treatment. The synthesis, spectral properties and in vitro photodynamic therapy (PDT) against human HeLa cervical cancer cell line was studied. Methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) assay showed the title compound could achieve strong inhibition of cervical cancer cell viability under visible light (675 nm, 25 J/cm(2)). Cell uptake experiments were performed on HeLa cells. Morphological changes were examined and analyzed by fluorescent inverted microscope. In addition, the mechanism of the photochemical processes of PDT was investigated, which showed that the formation of singlet oxygen after treatment with PDT played a moderate important role.
27136522	Two New Cinnamyl Isovalerate Derivatives from Sabina gaussenii.	Chemical investigation of the 90% acetone extract of the branches and leaves of Sabina gaussenii led to the isolation of two new cinnamyl isovalerate derivatives (1-2) and eighteen known compounds (3-20). Their structures were determined mainly by means of MS, 1D- and 2D-NMR data, and this is the first time these compounds have been reported from this plant. The biological activity test results indicated that the 90% acetone extract showed cytotoxicity against the human lung adenocarcinoma (A549) cell line (IC50 = 0.98 +/- 0.1 mug/mL), compound 6 showed cytotoxicities against human cervical carcinoma (HeLa) (IC50 = 0.4 +/- 0.1 muM ) and human gastric carcinoma (BGC-823) (IC50 = 0.9 +/- 0.2 muM) cancer cell lines, and compound 19 showed cytotoxicities against HeLa (IC50 = 1.5 +/- 0.4 muM), BGC-823 (IC50 = 7.0 +/- 0.8 muM ), and A549 (IC50 = 10.6 +/- 1.5 muM ) cancer cell lines.
27133668	Magnetic resonance imaging findings of intramammary metastases.	The purpose of this study was to identify magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings of intramammary metastases (IM). We identified 8 cases with IM, which were investigated by breast MRI (1.5T). In every case, the diagnosis of IM was proven histopathologically on breast biopsy specimens. Overall, 187 IM were identified. IM had inconsistent MRI features, which cannot be clearly classify as benign or malignant. IM should be taken into consideration in the differential diagnosis of breast lesions to avoid possible misinterpretations.
27133071	The effects of Micro-429 on inhibition of cervical cancer cells through targeting ZEB1 and CRKL.	MicroRNA-429 (miR-429) has been suggested to inhibit epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), mainly due to targeting of ZEB1 and ZEB2, which are repressors of the cell to cell contact protein, E-cadherin. In this study, we indicated that regulation of miR-429 in cervical cancer cells modulates cell migration, elongation, as well as transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta)-induced stress fiber formation through regulating the cytoskeleton reorganization which is likely independent of the zinc finger E-box binding homeobox (ZEB)/E-cadherin axis. ZEB1 and Crk-like adapter protein (CRKL), as novel targets of miR-429 and direct regulators of the actin cytoskeleton were identified. Remarkably, expression levels of ZEB1 and CRKL were inversely associated with the level of miR-429 in cervical cancer cell lines. In addition, individual knockdown and over-expression of these targeting genes phenocopied the roles of miR-429 over-expression and inhibition on cell elongation, migration, stress fiber formation, and invasion. Targeting of ZEB1 by miR-429 led to a decreased expression and transcriptional activity of CRB3, regulated by interference with the translocation of the CRB3. This finally led to decreasing of the expression of Crumbs 3 (CRB3), which is needed for the formation of stress fiber and contractility. Therefore, miR-429 affects cervical cancer by modulating some EMT-related processes. And in this study, evidences were provided to support a role for miR-429 as a novel target suppressing invasion and migration of human cervical cancer cells through modulation of its targeting genes ZEB1 and CRKL. Taken together, our data indicate that miR-429 plays a pivotal role in cervical cancer progression, which is a potential therapeutic target for patients.
27133046	MiR-486-3p targeting ECM1 represses cell proliferation and metastasis in cervical cancer.	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate gene expression and are involved in cervical cancer. But the molecular mechanism is still unclear. Here, miRNA profile of cervical cancer was performed and demonstrated that miR-486-3p decreased in specimens of cervical cancer patients. In addition, our clinical data show that decreased miR-486-3p was associated with metastasis in cervical cancer patients. ECM1 was predicted and velified as a target gene of miR-486-3p. Overexpression of miR-486-3p inhibited cell growth and metastasis by targeting ECM1. In a conclusion, these findings suggest that miR-486-3p is a tumor suppressor miRNA and induction of miR-486-3p is a potential strategy to inhibit cervical cancer progression.
27133034	MicroRNA-143 promotes apoptosis of osteosarcoma cells by caspase-3 activation via targeting Bcl-2.	Osteosarcoma is the most common malignant bone tumor. In recent years, although a lot of research in the mechanism of osteosarcoma development and metastasis had been done, the molecular mechanisms are still elusive. MicroRNAs (miRs), as small noncoding RNA sequences, are dysregulated in various diseases, including cancer, negatively modulating the target genes expression by posttranscriptional repression. MicroRNA-143 (miR-143) has been reported to be reduced in cancers, including pituitary, colorectal, prostate cancer and cervical. We were aimed to detect the effects of miR-143 on osteosarcoma cell invasion and migration as well as to indicate the potential molecular mechanisms by which miR-143 regulated osteosarcoma. After miR-143 transfection, the cancer cells migration and invasion were examined. And Western blot, RT-PCR, flow cytometry and immunochemistry assays were performed to analyze the role of miR-143 in osteosarcoma progression. The results suggested that miR-143 expressed lessly in osteosarcoma cell lines and could suppress cell migration and invasion in U2-OS and MG-63 cells. To our knowledge, it was the first time to target Bcl-2 directly to explore the underlying mechanism by which miR-143 performed its role to induce apoptosis in tumor cells, thus improving osteosarcoma progression. The present study indicated that miR-143 could inhibit Bcl-2 expression, causing Caspas3 activation, thus inducing apoptosis in osteosarcoma cells. MiR-143 may therefore sreve as a potential biomarker for osteosarcoma, and the regulation of its expression might be a novel therapeutic strategy for osteosarcoma treatment.
27132004	Electrochemical chip-based genomagnetic assay for detection of high-risk human papillomavirus DNA.	Cervical cancer, being the fourth leading cause of cancer death in women worldwide, predominantly originates from a persistent infection with a high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV). Detection of DNA sequences from these high-risk strains, mostly HPV-16 and HPV-18, represents promising strategy for early screening, which would help to identify women with higher risk of cervical cancer. In developing countries, inadequate screening options lead to disproportionately high mortality rates, making a fast and inexpensive detection schemes highly important. Electrochemical sensors and assays offer an alternative to current methods of detection. We developed an electrochemical-chip based assay, in which target HPV DNA is captured via magnetic bead-modified DNA probes, followed by an antidigoxigenin-peroxidase detection system at screen-printed carbon electrode chips, enabling parallel measurements of eight samples simultaneously. We show sensitive detection in attomoles of HPV DNA, selective discrimination between HPV-16 and HPV-18 and good reproducibility. Most importantly, we show application of the assay into both cancer cell lines and cervical smears from patients. The electrochemical results correlated well with standard methods, making this assay potentially applicable in clinical practice.
27131759	Efficacy of neoadjuvant chemotherapy plus radical surgery in patients with bulky stage II cervical squamous cell carcinoma: A retrospective cohort study.	OBJECTIVE: In order to evaluate the usefulness of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) with cisplatin and taxol (PT) follow radical surgery for stage II cervical squamous cell carcinoma with a bulky mass. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively compared patients receiving NAC with PT followed by radical hysterectomy and pelvic lymph node dissection (RS) (NAC group) with patients only underwent RS without NAC (ORS group). Enrolled 35 patients with FIGO stage II markedly bulky in the NAC group and 30 such patients in the ORS group from January 2011 to December 2013. All patients histopathology were squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). The surgical profiles and complications, disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) were compared between the groups. RESULTS: There were no statistically significant differences between the two groups in age, BMI, tumor size, and FIGO stage. The response rate of NAC with PT was 82.8%. The two groups also had similar in operative time, blood transfusion. However, the estimated blood loss in ORS group was significantly higher compared to that in NAC group (P = 0.04). hospital stay of NAC group was shorter compared to ORS group (P = 0.03). The 3-year DFS rates were 84.9% and 65.6%, respectively, in the NAC and ORS groups. NAC significantly prolonged DFS (log-rank test, P = 0.03). Moreover, the OS tended to be longer in the NAC group, though the difference did not reach statistical significance (log-rank test, P = 0.287). CONCLUSIONS: NAC with PT follow radical surgery was confirmed to prolong disease-free survival, as compared with radical hysterectomy alone. The results of this study suggest that NAC with PT might be a useful adjunct to surgery in the treatment of stage II SCC presenting as a bulky mass.
27130986	CT features and analysis for misdiagnosis of parotid tuberculosis.	PURPOSE: To analyze the computed tomography (CT) features and the reasons for misdiagnosis of parotid tuberculosis (TB). METHODS: CT features of 13 cases of parotid TB identified more than a 10-year period (2005-2015) were retrospectively analyzed. The CT features were analyzed for nature, range, and extent of the various pathological patterns. RESULTS: Because of the nonspecific CT features, 10 of 13 cases were misdiagnosed as benign and malignant tumors of parotid gland and received surgery. Ten cases of lymph nodal TB, one case of parenchymal TB, and two cases of mixed (concurrence of lymph nodal and parenchymal types) TB were found in the parotid gland. On contrast-enhanced CT scan, two cases showed homogeneous enhancement and eight cases showed ring enhancement (including five cases with thin-walled ring enhancement, two cases with flower-ring enhancement, and one case with thick-walled and eccentric ring enhancement); diffuse enhancement was seen in the one case of parenchymal type; the two cases of mixed type showed diffuse enhancement of parotid gland and ring enhancement of lymph node. Thickened skin around the parotid gland was seen in eight cases, including sinus tract between the lesion and skin in two cases. Ipsilateral cervical lymphadenopathy was found in 10 patients and bilateral was found in 3 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Nonspecific CT features of parotid TB closely relate with pathological changes. Recognition and understanding the spectrum of CT features of parotid TB is helpful for differential diagnosis, but the definitive diagnosis still depends on laboratory and pathological examination.
27130964	Protein stability, conformational change and binding mechanism of human serum albumin upon binding of embelin and its role in disease control.	Here, we present the inclusive binding mode of phytochemical embelin, an anticancer drug with human serum albumin (HSA) established under physiological condition. Also, to understand the pharmacological role of embelin molecule, here, we have studied the anti-cancer activity of embelin on human cervical cancer cell line (HeLa cell line), which revealed that embelin showed dose dependent inhibition in the growth of cancer cells and also induces 26.3% of apoptosis at an IC50 value of 29muM. Further, embelin was titrated with HSA and the fluorescence emission quenching of HSA due to the formation of the HSA-embelin complex was observed. The binding constant of this complex is 5.9+/-.01x10(4)M(-1) and the number of bound embelin molecules is approximately 1.0. Consequently, molecular displacement and computational docking experiments show that the embelin is binding to subdomain IB to HSA. Further evidence from microTOF-Q mass spectrometry showed an increase in mass from 66,563Da to 66,857Da observed for free HSA and HSA+embelin complex, signifying that there is robust binding of embelin with HSA. In addition, the variations of HSA secondary structural elements in presence of embelin were confirmed by circular dichroism which indicates partial unfolding of protein. Furthermore, the transmission electron micrographs established that complex formation leads to aggregation of HSA plus embelin. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed that the stability of the HSA-embelin complexes and results suggests that at around 3500ps the complex reaches equilibration state which clearly contributes to the understanding of the stability of the HSA-embelin complexes.
27130046	(18)F-FDG PET/CT can correct the clinical stages and predict pathological parameters before operation in cervical cancer.	OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the value of the positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET/CT) imaging in correcting the clinical stages and predicting pathological parameters before operation in cervical cancer. METHODS: Medical records of preoperative PET/CT from 113 patients with cervical cancer were retrospectively reviewed and compared with clinical examination and pathological parameters. RESULTS: The accuracy of tumor staging by PET/CT was 94.7%. The sensitivity and specificity to diagnose lymph node (LN) metastasis were 53.8% and 95.0%, respectively, with 98.4% and 59.2% for deep cervical stromal invasion. The positive predictive value was 58.3% and 75.9%, and the negative predictive value was 94.1% and 96.7%. Using maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax)=1.05 and metabolic tumor volume (MTV) of LN=0.50 or MTV of cervical lesions=11.60 as cut-off value to diagnose LN metastasis individually, we have found that the sensitivity and specificity for SUVmax, MTV of LN and cervical lesions were 53.8% and 94.0%, 46.2% and 94.0%, 88.9% and 73.0%, respectively. For deep cervical stromal invasion, with cervical lesions SUVmax=7.83 or MTV=8.76 as cut-off value, the sensitivity and specificity were 92.2% and 57.1%, 75.0% and 76.2%, respectively. CONCLUSION: PET/CT stage preoperative cervical cancer more objectively and accurately compared to traditional staging system. The LN metastasis and deep cervical stromal invasion of cervical cancer could be well predicted before operation by PET/CT so that the doctors can choose individualized treatment options.
27129462	Cationic Antimicrobial Peptides Derived from Crocodylus siamensis Leukocyte Extract, Revealing Anticancer Activity and Apoptotic Induction on Human Cervical Cancer Cells.	Known antimicrobial peptides KT2 and RT2 as well as the novel RP9 derived from the leukocyte extract of the freshwater crocodile (Crocodylus siamensis) were used to evaluate the ability in killing human cervical cancer cells. RP9 in the extract was purified by a combination of anion exchange column and reversed-phase HPLC, and its sequence was analyzed by mass spectrometry. The novel peptide could inhibit Gram-negative Vibrio cholerae (clinical isolation) and Gram-positive Bacillus pumilus TISTR 905, and its MIC values were 61.2 microM. From scanning electron microscopy, the peptide was seen to affect bacterial surfaces directly. KT2 and RT2, which are designed antimicrobial peptides using the C. siamensis Leucrocin I template, as well as RP9 were chemically synthesized for investigation of anticancer activity. By Sulforhodamine B colorimetric assay, these antimicrobial peptides could inhibit both HeLa and CaSki cancer cell lines. The IC50 values of KT2 and RT2 for HeLa and CaSki cells showed 28.7-53.4 and 17.3-30.8 microM, while those of RP9 were 126.2 and 168.3 microM, respectively. Additionally, the best candidate peptides KT2 and RT2 were used to determine the apoptotic induction on cancer cells by human apoptosis array assay. As a result, KT2 and RT2 were observed to induce apoptotic cell death in HeLa cells. Therefore, these results indicate that KT2 and RT2 with antimicrobial activity have a highly potent ability to kill human cervical cancer cells.
27129276	Deletion of Amino Acid Transporter ASCT2 (SLC1A5) Reveals an Essential Role for Transporters SNAT1 (SLC38A1) and SNAT2 (SLC38A2) to Sustain Glutaminolysis in Cancer Cells.	Many cancer cells depend on glutamine as they use the glutaminolysis pathway to generate building blocks and energy for anabolic purposes. As a result, glutamine transporters are essential for cancer growth and are potential targets for cancer chemotherapy with ASCT2 (SLC1A5) being investigated most intensively. Here we show that HeLa epithelial cervical cancer cells and 143B osteosarcoma cells express a set of glutamine transporters including SNAT1 (SLC38A1), SNAT2 (SLC38A2), SNAT4 (SLC38A4), LAT1 (SLC7A5), and ASCT2 (SLC1A5). Net glutamine uptake did not depend on ASCT2 but required expression of SNAT1 and SNAT2. Deletion of ASCT2 did not reduce cell growth but caused an amino acid starvation response and up-regulation of SNAT1 to replace ASCT2 functionally. Silencing of GCN2 in the ASCT2(-/-) background reduced cell growth, showing that a combined targeted approach would inhibit growth of glutamine-dependent cancer cells.
27128470	Up-regulation of KIF14 is a predictor of poor survival and a novel prognostic biomarker of chemoresistance to paclitaxel treatment in cervical cancer.	Kinesin family member 14 (KIF14) is a member of kinesin family proteins which have been found to be dysregulated in various cancer types. However, the expression of KIF14 and its potential prognostic significance have not been investigated in cervical cancer. Real-time PCR was performed to assess the expression levels of KIF14 in 47 pairs of cervical cancer tissues and their matched normal tissues from patients who had not been exposed to chemotherapy as well as tissue samples from 57 cervical cancer patients who are sensitive to paclitaxel treatment and 53 patients who are resistant. The association between KIF14 expression levels in tissue and clinicopathological features or chemosensitivity was examined. Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox proportional hazards model were applied to assess the correlation between KIF14 expression levels and overall survival (OS) of cervical cancer patients. KIF14 expression levels were significantly increased in cervical cancer tissues compared with matched non-cancerous tissues and it was higher in tissues of patients who are chemoresistant compared with those who are chemosensitive. KIF14 expression was positively associated with high tumour stage (P=0.0044), lymph node metastasis (P=0.0034) and chemoresistance (P<0.0001). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that high KIF14 expression levels predicted poor survival in patients with (P=0.0024) or without (P=0.0028) paclitaxel treatment. Multivariate analysis revealed that KIF14 was an independent prognostic factor for OS. Our study suggests that KIF14 may serve as a predictor of poor survival and a novel prognostic biomarker of chemoresistance to paclitaxel treatment in cervical cancer.
27127151	Salvage High-dose-rate Interstitial Brachytherapy for Pelvic Recurrent Cervical Carcinoma After Hysterectomy.	BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to report the clinical results of salvage high-dose-rate interstitial brachytherapy (HDR-ISBT) for patients with cervical cancer with pelvic recurrence after hysterectomy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: When there was no indication for total pelvic extenteration (TPE) and the tumor depth was more than 5 mm of invasion in the paracolpium, salvage HDR-ISBT was applied. RESULTS: A total of 26 patients were included in this study. The median number of fractions and dose per fraction of HDR-ISBT were 5 (range=3-20 fractions) and 6 Gy (range=2.5-6 Gy), respectively. Three-year local control, progression-free survival, and overall survival were 51.1%, 34.4% and 57.1%, respectively. Combination of external-beam radiation therapy, clinical target volume D90 greater than 65 Gy, and dose per fraction greater than 5 Gy were associated with favorable local control. CONCLUSION: For patients with recurrent cervical cancer post hysterectomy who are not candidates for TPE, salvage HDR-ISBT is a possible curative treatment modality.
27127143	Endometrial Adenocarcinoma Presenting as Hematometra with Underlying Thickened Endometrial Lining in a Postmenopausal Woman - A Case Report.	BACKGROUND: Although most postmenopausal women diagnosed with endometrial cancer usually present with vaginal bleeding, when complete cervical stenosis is present, this sign may be missing. In these cases, the patient usually complaints for pelvic or abdominal pain while the transvaginal ultrasonography might reveal the presence of an intrauterine fluid collection in association with a thickened endometrial lining. CASE REPORT: We present the case of a 65-year-old patient who presented with association of pelvic pain, enlarged uterine cavity with an underlying hematometra and an irregular, thickened endometrium who was submitted to surgery for total histerectomy, bilateral adnexectomy, pelvic and para-aortic lymph node dissection. CONCLUSION: Histopathological studies revealed the presence of a well-differentiated endometrial adenocarcinoma. At three years of follow-up, the patient is free of any recurrent disease.
27127132	The Diagnostic Value of Alcohol Dehydrogenase Isoenzymes and Aldehyde Dehydrogenase Measurement Sera of Cervical Cancer Patients.	AIM: The aim of this study was to investigate a potential role of alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) as tumor markers for cervical cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Blood samples were obtained from 43 women with cervical cancer. Isoenzymes class III, IV of ADH and total ADH activity were measured in the sera by the photometric method and class I, II ADH and ALDH activity by the fluorometric method. RESULTS: The total activity of ADH and ADH I was significantly higher in the serum of patients with cervical cancer than in control groups. The diagnostic sensitivity for ADH I was 61,76%, specificity 65,7%, PPV and NPV were 70 and 62,16% respectively. AUC for ADH I was 0,654 and for total ADH 0,618. CONCLUSION: The results suggest a potential role of ADH I as a marker for cervical cancer.
27127107	The NFkappaB Signaling Pathway in Papillomavirus-induced Lesions: Friend or Foe?	Papillomaviruses induce a range of benign and malignant lesions in their hosts, including cervical cancer, that is associated with high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) types. The nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B-cells (NFkappaB) plays a pivotal role in HPV-infected cells, and its expression and activity are modulated by several viral oncoproteins. NFkappaB modulation seems to first facilitate viral persistence and immune evasion, and later to drive tumour progression, but the many conflicting results and the complexity of its signaling networks require great prudence while interpreting the role of NFkappaB in papillomaviral lesions. Accordingly, the pharmacological targeting of the NFkappaB pathway in HPV-induced lesions is a complex and currently unmet challenge. This review deals with recent findings concerning NFkappaB activation in HPV-infected cells, its role in viral persistence, cell transformation and tumour progression, and with current efforts to target this pathway for cancer prevention and therapy.
27126908	Web-based instrument to assess skills in visual inspection of the cervix among healthcare providers.	OBJECTIVE: To validate a web-based instrument for assessing healthcare providers' skills in visual inspection with acetic acid or Lugol iodine (VIA/VILI) for the diagnosis and management of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. METHODS: An observational cross-sectional study enrolled healthcare providers in a web-based assessment of VIA/VILI skills between August and November 2014. Participants participated in a four-module training course, followed by a multiple-choice test with 70 questions based on cervical photographs of HPV-positive women participating in cervical screening. Logistic regression was used to identify relationships between independent variables and success on the test. RESULTS: Overall, 255 participants completed the test and 99 (38.8%) passed. No correlation was found between age or sex and test performance. Compared with other healthcare workers, physicians (odds ratio [OR] 1.91, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01-3.63; P=0.048), and participants with more colposcopy experience (OR 3.62, 95% CI 1.91-6.85; P<0.001) and postgraduate VIA/VILI training (OR 1.95, 95% CI 1.16-3.29; P=0.012) were more likely to pass the test. Participants who repeated the test (31/255 [12.2%]) were five times more likely to succeed on their second repeat (OR 5.89, 95% CI 1.46-23.73; P=0.013). CONCLUSION: Web-based training for VIA/VILI is feasible and can identify healthcare workers who are proficient in this technique.
27126664	Metastasis of extra-ampullary duodenal adenocarcinoma to the uterine cervix.	Secondary metastatic tumours of the uterine cervix are rare. There have been no reports of duodenal cancer metastasizing to the uterine cervix. Here we present a rare case of an extra-ampullary duodenal adenocarcinoma that has metastasized to the uterine cervix. The patient was a 71-year-old woman who had surgery for an extra-ampullary duodenal adenocarcinoma five years previously. Follow-up examination revealed a suspicious right ovarian mass and nodules in the cervix and posterior fornix of the vagina. Biopsies suggested squamous cell carcinoma in the cervix and adenocarcinoma in the fornix. Intraoperatively, the right ovary was enlarged and peritoneal disseminations were found in the pouch of Douglas and the sigmoid colon mesentery. Histopathology of the subsequent hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy specimen revealed a cervical squamous cell carcinoma categorized as pT1b1. Adenocarcinoma infiltration into the ovaries, uterine cervix and vagina, with vascular involvement was detected. Immunohistochemistry revealed the tumour in the cervix and ovaries to be positive for CK7, MUC5AC and MUC6, and immunonegative for CK20, CDX2, Pax8, ER, MUC2 and CD10, similar to the original duodenal adenocarcinoma. This case illustrates the difficulty in making a preoperative diagnosis of metastatic adenocarcinoma in the uterine cervix with a coexisting primary cervical squamous cell carcinoma. The absence of atypia in cervical glandular cells and immunohistochemical profiling of the adenocarcinoma clusters helped to reach a final diagnosis. This is the first report of an extra-ampullary duodenal adenocarcinoma metastasis to the uterine cervix.
27126662	Correlation of p16INK4a immunoexpression and human papillomavirus (HPV) detected by in-situ hybridization in cervical squamous neoplasia.	Persistence and eventual integration of high-risk HPV (hrHPV) into the cervical cell is crucial to the progression of cervical neoplasia and it would be beneficial to morphologically identify this transformation in routine surgical pathology practice. Increased p16(INK4a) (p16) expression is a downstream event following HPV E7 binding to pRB. A study was conducted to assess the correlation between hrHPV detection using a commercial in-situ hybridization assay (Ventana INFORM HPV ISH) and p16 immunoexpression (CINtec Histology Kit) in cervical squamous intraepithelial lesions and squamous carcinoma. 27 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded cervical low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL), 21 high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL) and 51 squamous carcinoma (SCC) were interrogated. hrHPV was significantly more frequent in HSIL (76.2%) and SCC (88.2%) compared to LSIL(37.0%). p16 expression was similarly more frequent in HSIL (95.2%) and SCC (90.2%) compared to LSIL(3.7%). That the rates of hrHPV when compared with p16 expression were almost equivalent in HSIL and SCC while p16 was expressed in only 1 of the 10 LSIL with hrHPV, are expected considering the likelihood that transformation has occurred in HSIL and SCC but does not occur in majority of LSIL.
27125958	Clinical challenges with calcitonin-negative medullary thyroid carcinoma.	PURPOSE: Medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) is a relatively uncommon malignant tumor of the parafollicular C cells of the thyroid, which distinguishing feature is the production of calcitonin (CT). CT is a well-recognized tool in the diagnosis and the postsurgical follow-up of patients with MTC with a high sensitivity and specificity, and represents a powerful prognostic indicator. Usually, there is a direct correlation between tumor size and basal CT levels. However, few cases of CT-negative MTCs have been reported in literature and criteria for diagnosis and follow-up are still controversial. METHODS: We performed a brief review on CT-negative MTC and reported our experience on this rare condition, focusing on the clinical characteristics at presentation, the histological and immunostaining features, and the management. RESULTS: Fifteen cases of large, palpable, CT-negative MTCs have been reported in the literature so far; moreover, we reported four cases followed at our center. CONCLUSIONS: Although CT-negative MTC is rare, normal/low serum levels of CT and CEA cannot completely exclude the possibility of the diagnosis, when suspected. It is well accepted that early diagnosis is crucial, but there is still no consensus on the optimal postoperative surveillance strategy. The ultrasound evaluation of the cervical region, together with abdominal computerized tomography scan, chest X-ray, and fluorine18-fluorodeoxyglucose ((18)F-FDG) PET/computed tomography (FDG-PET/CT), would be recommended in the follow-up of such cases.
27125591	Potent in vitro anti-proliferative, apoptotic and anti-oxidative activities of semi-purified Job's tears (Coix lachryma-jobi Linn.) extracts from different preparation methods on 5 human cancer cell lines.	ETHONOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCES: Job's tears (Coix lacryma-jobi Linn.) is commonly used as an herbal medicine. The low incidence of cancer has been observed in the area of China where regularly consume Job's tears. The effects of preparation methods of Job's tears on anti-cancer activities were investigated. Potent in vitro anti-proliferative, apoptotic and anti-oxidative activities of semi-purified Job's tears extracts from different preparation methods on 5 human cancer cell lines comparing with standards and commercial product were observed. AIM OF STUDY: To study the anti-proliferative, apoptotic and anti-oxidative activities of semi-purified Job's tear extracts from different preparation methods on 5 human cancer cell lines. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The crude methanolic extracts of non-cooked, steamed and roasted Job's tears cultivars were prepared and further semi-purified by liquid-liquid extraction techniques. Both of crude and semi-purified extracts were tested for anti-proliferative, apoptotic induction, anti-oxidative activities and phytochemicals content. RESULTS: The highest yields of crude and-purified extracts were 4.60% and 1.46%, respectively. In crude extracts, the steamed whole Thai Black Loei Job's tears (W-TBL-S1) extract showed the highest anti-proliferative activity in mouth epidermal carcinoma cell (KB) at the IC50 of 43.61+/-0.76mug/ml (0.005 folds of doxorubicin), whereas the roasted whole Laos White Loei Job's tears (W-LWL-R2) extract showed the highest apoptotic activity in cervical adenocarcinoma (HeLa) at 21.52+/-1.50% (0.22 and 15.05 folds of doxorubicin and commercial product, respectively). After liquid-liquid extraction, almost all of the semi-purified extracts showed increases in anti-proliferative activity. Ethyl acetate fraction of the roasted whole Laos White Loei Job's tears (W-LWL-R2) showed the highest anti-proliferative activity in HeLa cell at the IC50 of 0.97+/-0.82mug/ml (7.82 and 45.39 folds of doxorubicin and crude extract, respectively) and apoptotic activity of 18.77+/-6.31% (0.19 folds of doxorubicin). The commercial product showed no anti-proliferative activity in all cell lines but induced apoptosis in HeLa cell at 1.43+/-0.34%. The butanol and hexane soluble fractions of the roasted whole of Laos White Loei Job's tears (W-LWL-R2) showed the highest free radical scavenging (SC50) and metal chelating activity (MC50) of 0.31+/-0.06mg/ml (0.64 folds of ascorbic acid) and 0.08+/-0.01mg/ml (6.37 folds of EDTA), respectively. All ethyl acetate fractions contain high content of carotenoid and tannin, whereas the hexane soluble fraction of the roasted hull of Laos Black Loei Job's tears (H-LBL-R1) showed the highest linoleic acid content of 8.09+/-0.74% w/w. CONCLUSIONS: This study has demonstrated the potent anti-cancer activity of the semi-purified extracts from roasted Job's tears with high potential for further development to modern anti-cancer drug.
27125095	EVOLUTION OF SYNCHRONOUS BILATERAL BREAST CARCINOMA IN A YOUNG PATIENT.	Bilateral breast cancer incidence is appreciated to be between 0.3 to 12% and is determined either by a hereditary load associated with chromosomal instability under the effect of environmental factors, or by the evolution in a particular hormonal context which gives biological aggressiveness. We present the case of a patient, aged 38 years, clinically, imagistic and bioptic diagnosed with left axillary lymph node metastases of breast carcinoma NST invasive G3, IHC-RE = 60%, RP = 30%, HER2neu = 2 +, Ki67 = 20%, in August 2013. Patient followed neoadjuvant chemotherapy treatment during September-October 2013. In December 2013 she was clinically and imaging diagnosed with bilateral breast cancer, for which surgical intervention was done which consisted of bilateral radical Madden mastectomy with bilateral axillary lymphadenectomy. BAP-invasive carcinoma NST: left breast-pT2mN3a G2, right breast--pT3mN3a G2, IHC-RE = 90%, RP =70% HER2neu = 2 +, Ki67 = 50%. During the period of January-March 2014, the patient followed adjuvant chemotherapy and Herceptin. Bilateral breast ultrasound assessment in April 2014 revealed: left axilla--liquid blade 29 / 6mm; right axilla--oval ganglion 9/5 mm. Abdominal and pelvic ultrasound: empty uterine cavity, bosselated contour; at left ovary level multiple cystic formations. During the period of May-June 2014, adjuvant radiation therapy and ovarian irradiationwas administered to the patient. Subsequently hormone therapy was initiated. Following CHT / ovarian irradiation patient continues to experience intermittent uterine bleeding, which is why a total hysterectomy with bilateral ovariectomy was done, and BAP: cervical, endometrialand left ovary with tumor multifocal infiltration with histopathological aspect of invasive breast carcinoma NST. Periodic imaging evaluations do not reveal local or distant recurrence. The particularity of this case is synchronous bilateral breast cancer diagnosis in a young patient complicated in its evolution by ovarian metastases. This form of metastasis is rare in young women and occurs in advanced stages of the disease.
27124948	Follow-up of Women With Negative Pap Test Results and Abnormal Clinical Signs or Symptoms.	OBJECTIVES: Abnormal signs or symptoms recorded on Papanicolaou (Pap) test requisitions may reflect disease not detected with Pap testing. Since 2009, these cases have been reviewed in our laboratory by a second cytotechnologist and a cytopathologist. The objective of this study was to document follow-up findings on these patients. METHODS: A search for Pap test results of "Negative for intraepithelial lesion or malignancy, abnormal clinical signs or symptoms" was performed for cases from January 1, 2009, to October 10, 2013. Clinical information and follow-up findings were documented. RESULTS: 1,104 cases were identified. Signs and symptoms were abnormal bleeding 897 (81%), polyps 83 (8%), pelvic mass 54 (5%), visible cervical lesions 48 (4%), vaginal lesions 17 (2%) and endometrial masses 6 (0.5%). Six hundred sixty-seven (60%) had follow-up results, including 517 with histopathologic diagnoses. Two-hundred thirty-three (45%) had nonspecific benign diagnoses, 216 (42%) had benign tumor-like conditions, 28 (4%) had insufficient specimens, 16 (3%) had precancerous diagnoses and 23 (4%) had malignancies. Endometrial malignancy was identified in 14 (61%), ovarian in 6 (26%), and miscellaneous in 3 (13%). No cervical cancers were identified. CONCLUSIONS: We report follow-up findings from patients with abnormal clinical signs or symptoms, negative Pap test results, and follow-up recommendations highlighting reported abnormal signs or symptoms. Abnormal clinical signs and symptoms should routinely be considered in assessment and management of patients with negative cervical screening test results.
27124943	Effect of Lower Anogenital Squamous Terminology Recommendations on the Use of p16 Immunohistochemistry and the Proportion of High-Grade Diagnoses in Cervical Biopsy Specimens.	OBJECTIVES: The Lower Anogenital Squamous Terminology (LAST) group has recommended that cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) terminology be replaced by squamous intraepithelial lesion (SIL) terminology, with p16 immunohistochemistry used to separate lesions formerly diagnosed as CIN grade 2 into high-grade SILs (HSILs) and low-grade SILs. This study investigated the impact of these changes on the frequency of p16 testing and the diagnosis of high-grade lesions. METHODS: Pathology reports for all cervical biopsy specimens in the 1 year before and after the introduction of LAST recommendations (July 2011 to June 2013) were examined. RESULTS: Before and after the implementation of LAST, 365 (15.4%) of 2,376 cases were diagnosed as high grade (CIN 2/3) vs 486 (17.6%) of 2,761 cases diagnosed as HSILs (P = .0343), and p16 was performed 79 (3.3%) times vs 383 (13.9%) times (P < .0001). CONCLUSIONS: Immunohistochemistry for p16 increased dramatically as a result of LAST recommendations, and high-grade diagnoses increased.
27124932	Prevalence of High-Risk Human Papillomavirus Infection in China: Analysis of 671,163 Human Papillomavirus Test Results From China's Largest College of American Pathologists-Certified Laboratory.	OBJECTIVES: This study on human papillomavirus (HPV) testing in China's largest independent laboratory accredited by the international Laboratory Accreditation Program of the College of American Pathologists extends previous reports on cervical screening test results from this Chinese facility. METHODS: A retrospective laboratory database search from 2007 to 2014 documented high-risk HPV test results using either Hybrid Capture 2 (HC2; Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) or multiplex polymerase chain reaction fluorescence testing (MPFT) methods. RESULTS: During the study period, HPV testing steadily increased, with 643,702 HC2 and 27,641 MPFT HPV tests performed. The mean ages of the tested women were 35.0 years using HC2 and 38.3 years using MPFT. The HC2 HPV-positive rate was 21.7%, significantly higher than 15.7% with MPFT (P < .0001), with bimodal peak incidence in adolescents and women aged 60 to 69 years. CONCLUSIONS: Use of HPV testing in cervical screening is increasing in China. HC2 HPV-positive rates around 20% in all age groups from more than 500,000 tested Chinese women are consistent with previous reports from China and significantly higher than published HC2 HPV-positive rates in populations with more widespread cervical screening. MPFT HPV-positive rates were slightly lower in every age group. The high HPV-positive rate likely reflects limited routine cervical screening and high cervical cancer incidence in China.
27124917	The Value of Papanicolaou Tests in the Diagnosis of Endometrial Carcinoma: A Large Study Cohort From an Academic Medical Center.	OBJECTIVES: To determine on a large scale whether routine cervical Papanicolaou (Pap) tests play a role in endometrial carcinoma diagnosis. METHODS: A retrospective search of an academic women's hospital pathology archive for cases of surgically resected endometrial carcinoma with Pap smears within 36 months before the histologic diagnosis was performed. Demographic features, Pap test results, and tumor features were recorded. RESULTS: We identified 554 (30.5%) of 1,817 cases of endometrial carcinoma with documented Pap test results within 36 months before histologic diagnosis. Among these 554 patients, 405 (73.0%) had Pap test results within 5 months before histologic diagnosis. In total, 154 (38%) cases demonstrated abnormal glandular cells, and 25 (6.2%) had only benign endometrial cells in women 40 years or older. The presence of glandular abnormality on the Pap test is significantly correlated with tumor size, tumor type, depth of invasion, presence of cervical involvement, and presence of lymphovascular invasion (P < .05). The rate of detecting abnormal glandular cells was higher in cases with a high International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage than in cases with a low FIGO stage (47.5% vs 35.5%; P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: The Pap test may play a role in the detection of endometrial carcinoma, especially for those with cervical involvement, lymphovascular invasion, and/or advanced stage.
27121405	Clinical application of computed tomography-guided (125)I seed interstitial implantation for head and neck cancer patients with unmanageable cervical lymph node metastases.	BACKGROUND: To assess clinical application of computed tomography (CT)-guided (125)I seed implantation for patients who cannot endure or unwillingly receive repeated surgery, chemotherapy, or radiotherapy for unmanageable cervical lymph node metastases in head and neck cancer (HNC). METHODS: Thirty-one consecutive patients received CT-guided (125)I seed implantation between February 2010 and December 2013. To evaluate the clinical efficiency, karnofsky performance score (KPS), numeric rating scale (NRS), and tumor volume at 3-, and 6-month post-implantation were compared with pre-implantation, along with local control rate (LCR), overall survival rate (OSR), and complications at 3, 6 months, 1, and 2 years. RESULTS: The tumor volume was obviously decreased at 3-, and 6-month post-implantation (21.23 +/- 8.83 versus 9.19 +/- 7.52 cm(2); 21.23 +/- 8.83 versus 6.42 +/- 9.79 cm(2); P < 0.05) compared with pre-implantation. The NRS was statistically reduced (3.06 +/- 1.06 versus 7.77 +/- 0.92; 2.39 +/- 1.15 versus 7.77 +/- 0.92; P < 0.05), while KPS was significantly improved (83.18 +/- 5.97 versus 73.60 +/- 7.90; 82.86 +/- 5.43 versus 73.60 +/- 7.90; P < 0.05) postoperatively at 3 and 6 months, respectively. The LCR at 3, 6 months, 1, and 2 years was 96.30, 83.87, 64.51, and 45.16%, respectively. The OSR was 100, 100, 67.74, and 45.16%, respectively. Three cases experienced grade I and two had grade II acute radiation toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: CT-guided seed implantation may be feasible and safe for HNC patients whose neck nodes are not manageable by routine strategies with fewer complications, higher LCR, and significant pain relief.
27121353	Variant-specific persistence of infections with human papillomavirus Types 31, 33, 45, 56 and 58 and risk of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia.	In our previous study of the etiologic role of oncogenic human papillomavirus (HPV) types other than HPV16 and 18, we observed a significantly higher risk of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia Grades 2-3 (CIN2/3) associated with certain lineages of HPV types 31/33/45/56/58 [called high-risk (HR) variants] compared with non-HR variants. This study was to examine whether these intra-type variants differ in persistence of the infection and persistence-associated risk of CIN2/3. Study subjects were women who had any of HPV types 31/33/45/56/58 newly detected during a 2-year follow-up with 6-month intervals. For each type, the first positive sample was used for variant characterization. The association of reverting-to-negativity with group of the variants and CIN2/3 with length of positivity was assessed using discrete Cox regression and logistic regression, respectively. Of the 598 newly detected, type-specific HPV infections, 312 became undetectable during follow-up. Infections with HR, compared with non-HR, variants were marginally more likely to become negative [adjusted hazard ratio = 1.3; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.9-1.8]. The adjusted odds ratio associating with the development of CIN2/3 was 3.0 (95% CI, 1.2-7.4) for persistent infections with HR variants for 6 months and 10.0 (95% CI, 3.8-38.0) for persistent infections with HR variants for 12-18 months as compared with the first positive detection of HR variants. Among women with non-HR variants, there were no appreciable differences in risk of CIN2/3 by length of positivity. Findings suggest that the lineage-associated risk of CIN2/3 was not mediated through a prolonged persistent infection, but oncogenic heterogeneity of the variants.
27119991	Tumor Regression and Patterns of Distant Metastasis of T1-T2 Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma with Intensity-Modulated Radiotherapy.	PURPOSE: To study tumor regression and failure patterns in T1-T2 non-metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) after intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT). METHODS: A retrospective analysis of 139 nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients treated with IMRT between January 2005 and December 2010 in our center was performed. According to the AJCC staging system, all primary lesions were attributed to T1 and T2. The prescription doses were 66 Gy at 30 fractions to gross tumor volume of the nasopharynx and the positive neck nodes, 60 Gy to high-risk clinical target volume and 54 Gy to low-risk clinical target volume. Patients staged III, IV A/B or II (lymph node measured 4 cm or more in diameter) received platinum-based chemotherapy. RESULTS: By the end of radiotherapy, 7.2% (10/139), 23.7% (33/139), and 9.4% (13/139) of patients had residual lesions in the nasopharynx, cervical lymph nodes and retropharyngeal lymph nodes, respectively. The majority of patients had complete remission within 6 months of radiotherapy completion. Five months after IMRT, three patients with residual tumors in the cervical lymph nodes underwent surgery. Among these patients, two patients had positive pathological findings, and one patient had negative findings. With a median follow-up of 59 months, the 5-year overall survival, local control, regional control and distant metastasis-free rates were 87.8%, 96.7%, 94.9% and 89.1%, respectively. Fifteen patients developed distant metastases, representing the primary failure pattern. CONCLUSIONS: Most residual lesions that persisted after IMRT vanished completely in six months. Considering the potential damage to normal structures, clinicians should be cautious when considering the use of boost irradiation after radiotherapy. Distant metastasis was the primary cause of treatment failure, which was significantly higher in N2-3 patients than in N0-1. Additional studies to better understand distant metastases are needed.
27119555	Expression of CD11c Is Associated with Unconventional Activated T Cell Subsets with High Migratory Potential.	CD11c is an alpha integrin classically employed to define myeloid dendritic cells. Although there is little information about CD11c expression on human T cells, mouse models have shown an association of CD11c expression with functionally relevant T cell subsets. In the context of genital tract infection, we have previously observed increased expression of CD11c in circulating T cells from mice and women. Microarray analyses of activated effector T cells expressing CD11c derived from naive mice demonstrated enrichment for natural killer (NK) associated genes. Here we find that murine CD11c+ T cells analyzed by flow cytometry display markers associated with non-conventional T cell subsets, including gammadelta T cells and invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells. However, in women, only gammadelta T cells and CD8+ T cells were enriched within the CD11c fraction of blood and cervical tissue. These CD11c+ cells were highly activated and had greater interferon (IFN)-gamma secretory capacity than CD11c- T cells. Furthermore, circulating CD11c+ T cells were associated with the expression of multiple adhesion molecules in women, suggesting that these cells have high tissue homing potential. These data suggest that CD11c expression distinguishes a population of circulating T cells during bacterial infection with innate capacity and mucosal homing potential.
27119081	Subtractive Cell-SELEX Selection of DNA Aptamers Binding Specifically and Selectively to Hepatocellular Carcinoma Cells with High Metastatic Potential.	Relapse and metastasis are two key risk factors of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) prognosis; thus, it is emergent to develop an early and accurate detection method for prognostic evaluation of HCC after surgery. In this study, we sought to acquire oligonucleotide DNA aptamers that specifically bind to HCC cells with high metastatic potential. Two HCC cell lines derived from the same genetic background but with different metastatic potential were employed: MHCC97L (low metastatic properties) as subtractive targets and HCCLM9 (high metastatic properties) as screening targets. To mimic a fluid combining environment, initial DNA aptamers library was firstly labelled with magnetic nanoparticles using biotin-streptavidin system and then applied for aptamers selection. Through 10-round selection with subtractive Cell-SELEX, six aptamers, LY-1, LY-13, LY-46, LY-32, LY-27/45, and LY-7/43, display high affinity to HCCLM9 cells and do not bind to MHCC97L cells, as well as other tumor cell lines, including breast cancer, lung cancer, colon adenocarcinoma, gastric cancer, and cervical cancer, suggesting high specificity for HCCLM9 cells. Thus, the aptamers generated here will provide solid basis for identifying new diagnostic targets to detect HCC metastasis and also may provide valuable clues for developing new targeted therapeutics.
27118696	Do invitations for cervical screening provide sufficient information to enable informed choice? A cross-sectional study of invitations for publicly funded cervical screening.	OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether invitations for publicly funded cervical screening provide sufficient information to enable an informed choice about participation. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study using a checklist of 23 information items on benefits and harms from cervical screening and the risks related to cervical cancer. MATERIAL: Invitations to publicly funded cervical screening in 10 Scandinavian and English-speaking countries. SETTING: Ten Scandinavian and English speaking countries. PARTICIPANTS: Sixteen screening units representing 10 Scandinavian and English speaking countries. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Number of information items presented in invitations for cervical screening. RESULTS: We contacted 21 coordinating units from 11 countries and 20 (95%) responded. Of these, four units did not issue invitations, but the remaining 16 coordinating units in 10 different countries supplied a sample. The invitations for cervical screening were generally information poor and contained a median of only four out of 23 information items possible (17%), ranging from 0 to 12 (0-52%). The most important harms of cancer screening, overdiagnosis and overtreatment, were typically downplayed or unmentioned. The same applied to other important harms, such as false-positive results and the psychological consequences from an abnormal test result. The majority of invitations took a paternalistic approach. While only two invitations (17%) included a pre-assigned appointment date, eight (70%) of the invitations contained strong appeals for participation. CONCLUSIONS: Invitations to cervical cancer screening were information poor and biased in favour of participation. This means that informed choice is not possible, which is in conflict with modern requirements for personal involvement in medical decisions.
27118127	Prognostic impact of incomplete surgical clearance of radioiodine sensitive local lymph node metastases diagnosed by post-operative (124)I-NaI-PET/CT in patients with papillary thyroid cancer.	PURPOSE: Nodal involvement is an independent risk factor of recurrence in papillary thyroid cancer (PTC). Neither the international guidelines nor the recently introduced ongoing risk adaptation concept consider the extent of initial surgical clearance of radioiodine sensitive lymph node metastases in their stratification systems. We investigated the prognostic relevance of incomplete initial surgical clearance in patients with purely lymphogeneous metastatic PTC (pN1 M0) despite successful radioiodine therapy. Accurate assessment of pre-ablative nodal status was attempted using PET/CT studies with both (124)I-NaI and (18)F-FDG along with high-resolution cervical ultrasound. METHODS: Sixty-five patients with histologically diagnosed lymph node metastases (pN1 M0) were retrospectively analyzed. Patients with iodine-negative lymph node metastases diagnosed by (18)F-FDG PET/CT or distant metastases were excluded from the analysis. The association of disease recurrence with the pre-ablative nodal status, as well as other baseline characteristics, were examined applying nonparametric tests for independent samples and multiple regression analysis. Patients with persistent lymph node metastases in (124)I-NaI PET/CT were further divided according to the additional presence or absence of FDG-uptake in (18)F-FDG PET/CT. Survival analyses were performed using Kaplan-Meier curves and the Cox proportional hazards model for uni- and multivariate analyses to assess the influence of prognostic factors on progression free survival (PFS). RESULTS: Incomplete metastatic lymph node resection captured by (124)I-NaI PET/CT (n = 33) was an independent risk factor for recurrence (61 % vs 25 %, p = 0.006) and shorter PFS (46 months vs not reached, HR 4.0 [95 %-CI, 1.7-9.2], p = 0.001). Ultrasound could detect lymph node metastases only in 19/33 patients (58 %). Among patients with positive nodal status, FDG-avidity of metastatic iodine positive lymph nodes worsened the outcome (16 vs 69 months, p = 0.047). From all other investigated factors including age, N-stage (N1a vs N1b), and T-Stage (T4 vs T1-3), only large tumor size (pT4) had a significant impact on PFS (HR 2.9 [95 %-CI, 1.3-6.4], p = 0.007). CONCLUSIONS: Incomplete initial surgical clearance of lymph node metastases even after successful radioiodine therapy may increase the chances of recurrence and is an independent risk factor for impaired survival of patients with PTC. Pre-ablative (dual tracer PET/CT) imaging with (124)I-Na and (18)F provides a prognostic tool for these patients and may considerably complement the current risk stratification systems.
27117108	Intracellular glutathione level and efflux in human melanoma and cervical cancer cells differing in doxorubicin resistance.	INTRODUCTION: Drug resistance continues to be a major problem in cancer treatment. Occurrence of this phenomenon is often associated with altered levels of glutathione (GSH) and GSH-related enzymes. The aim of the study was to evaluate the possible involvement of GSH and GSH-related enzymes in doxorubicin (DOX) resistance in two types of cancer cells of different etiology, from both parental and DOX-resistant sublines. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The human melanoma (ME18 and ME18/R) and cervical cancer cells (HeLa and KB-V1) were tested in terms of their DOX sensitivity (EZ4U test), GSH level (HPLC) and its efflux (spectrofluorometrically). The effects of inhibition of the GSH-related enzymes gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase (gamma-GCS) and glutathione S-transferase (GST) were also evaluated. RESULTS: Exposure to DOX caused an increase of GSH levels in all tested cells except for HeLa cells. However, depletion of GSH did not have a significant influence on the sensitivity of the cells to DOX. Inhibition of the activity of GST also did not have a major effect on DOX sensitivity, although it caused changes of the GSH content. Our attempts to use the spectrofluorometric method for measurements of GSH efflux were not successful. It could be suggested that in ME18 and HeLa cells treated with DOX, GSH efflux does occur. DISCUSSION: The obtained results seem to refute the hypothesis of a central role of GSH in DOX resistance of the tested cells. Despite observations of different effects related to GSH, they do not seem to be essential in terms of DOX resistance. The mechanisms underlying DOX resistance are highly cell-specific.
27116984	[Analysis of 13 cases of rhabdomyosarcoma in the female genital tract].	OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical features, treatments and prognostic factors of rhabdomyosarcoma(RMS)in the female genital tract. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed on 13 cases of RMS in the female genital tract. Clinical characteristics, treatments and prognosis were compared and analyzed statistically. RESULTS: The median age was 21.0 years(range, 6 to 54 years). There were 6 cases vaginal RMS and 7 cases cervical RMS, included 11 cases of embryonal RMS(ERMS)and 2 cases of alveolar RMS(ARMS). According to the Federation International of Gynecology and Obstetrics(FIGO)staging system, there were 6 cases of stage , 3 cases of stage , 1 case of stage and 3 cases of stage , the median survival time were respectively 112.5, 153.0, 9.0 and 3.5 months. According to the Intergroup Rhabdomyosarcom Study Group(IRSG)staging system, there were 10 cases of stage and 3 cases of the stage , and their median survival time were respectively 112.5 and 3.5 months. Nine patients received surgery and the median survival time was 108.0 months(range, 9 to 228 months), 6 of them received chemotherapy after surgery and the median survival time was 152.0 months(range, 9 to 228 months), the other 3 cases did not receive any therapy after surgery and the median survival time was 25.0 months(range, 9 to 108 months). Four patients did not receive surgery and the median survival time was 6.3 months(range, 1 to 117 months). There were 2 cases received combined treatment included radiotherapy and the survival time were respectively 4 and 198 months. There were 8 cases who was survival without disease and 5 cases died of cancer. The median survival time in 13 patients was 25.0 months(range, 1 to 228 months)and the 5-year overall survival rate was 58.6%. CONCLUSIONS: The prognosis of early stage of RMS in the female genital tract is good. While, the prognosis of advanced stage is poor. The standard treatment strategy is combination of surgery and chemotherapy, whether radiotherapy could improve the prognosis still need further study.
27115423	Clinical significance of atypical glandular cells in Pap tests: An analysis of more than 3000 cases at a large academic women's center.	BACKGROUND: The interpretation of atypical glandular cells (AGC) in Papanicolaou (Pap) tests and screening for glandular neoplasia remain challenging. METHODS: Pap tests with an AGC interpretation from January 2008 to December 2013 were retrieved from a pathology database, and cases with histologic follow-up within 1 year were included in the study. RESULTS: There were 589,830 Pap tests during the study period, and 3709 cases (0.6%) were reported as AGC, which included the following: AGC, not otherwise specified (52.0%); atypical endocervical cells (28.0%); and other categories. There were 3007 cases (81.1%) with histologic follow-up results within 1 year. Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2/3 (CIN2/3), cervical adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS)/adenocarcinoma, and endometrial carcinoma were identified in 5.6%, 1.9%, and 5.5% of cases, respectively. Glandular neoplasia was more likely to be identified in cases with pure AGC subcategories than cases with AGC and squamous abnormalities. Endometrial neoplasia was more likely to be identified in cases with atypical endometrial cells than other categories. Overall, the most common severe abnormality on histologic follow-up was CIN2/3. Although CIN2/3 was the most common severe lesion in patients younger than 30 years (10.0%) and in patients aged 30 to 49 years (6.4%), endometrial carcinoma was the most common lesion in women who were 50 years old or older (13.7%). Endocervical glandular lesions (AIS and adenocarcinoma) occurred in only 1.9% of women. CONCLUSIONS: AGC subtypes and ages significantly affect histological follow-up results; 90.5% of cases with carcinoma on histologic follow-up were either endometrial or metastatic carcinoma. This study supports the recommendation that women with AGC Pap test results should be followed up with both endocervical and endometrial sampling. Cancer Cytopathol 2016;124:589-95.

27115350	Cervical Microbiome and Cytokine Profile at Various Stages of Cervical Cancer: A Pilot Study.	Cervical cancer (CC) is caused by high-risk human papillomavirus persistence due to the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment mediated by cytokines. Vaginal microbiota determines the presence of certain cytokines locally. We assessed the association between cervical microbiota diversity and the histopathological diagnosis of each stage of CC, and we evaluated mRNA cervical expression levels of IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, TGF-beta1, TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma across the histopathological diagnosis and specific bacterial clusters. We determined the cervical microbiota by high throughput sequencing of 16S rDNA amplicons and classified it in community state types (CST). Mean difference analyses between alpha-diversity and histopathological diagnosis were carried out, as well as a beta-diversity analysis within the histological diagnosis. Cervical cytokine mRNA expression was analyzed across the CSTs and the histopathological diagnoses. We found a significant difference in microbiota's diversity in NCL-HPV negative women vs those with squamous intraepithelial lesions (SIL) and CC(p = 0.006, p = 0.036).When beta-diversity was evaluated, the CC samples showed the highest variation within groups (p<0.0006) and the largest distance compared to NCL-HPV negative ones (p<0.00001). The predominant bacteria in women with normal cytology were L. crispatus and L. iners, whereas for SIL, it was Sneathia spp. and for CC, Fusobacterium spp. We found higher median cervical levels of IL-4 and TGF-beta1 mRNA in the CST dominated by Fusobacterium spp. These results suggest that the cervical microbiota may be implicated in cervical cancer pathology. Further cohort studies are needed to validate these findings.
27114532	Secondary interaction between MDMX and p53 core domain inhibits p53 DNA binding.	The MDMX oncoprotein is an important regulator of tumor suppressor p53 activity during embryonic development. Despite sequence homology to the ubiquitin E3 ligase MDM2, MDMX depletion activates p53 without significant increase in p53 level, implicating a degradation-independent mechanism. We present evidence that MDMX inhibits the sequence-specific DNA binding activity of p53. This function requires the cooperation between MDMX and CK1alpha, and phosphorylation of S289 on MDMX. Depletion of MDMX or CK1alpha increases p53 DNA binding without stabilization of p53. A proteolytic fragment release assay revealed that in the MDMX-p53 complex, the MDMX acidic domain and RING domain interact stably with the p53 DNA binding domain. These interactions are referred to as secondary interactions because they only occur after the canonical-specific binding between the MDMX and p53 N termini, but exhibit significant binding stability in the mature complex. CK1alpha cooperates with MDMX to inhibit p53 DNA binding by further stabilizing the MDMX acidic domain and p53 core domain interaction. These results suggest that secondary intermolecular interaction is important in p53 regulation by MDMX, which may represent a common phenomenon in complexes containing multidomain proteins.
27113240	Talking about human papillomavirus and cancer: protocol for a patient-centred study to develop scripted consultations.	INTRODUCTION: Persistent infection with sexually transmitted, high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) types is the cause of all cervical cancers and some anogenital and oropharyngeal cancers. HPV is an extremely common asymptomatic infection but little known and poorly understood by the public. Patients with HPV-related cancers have new and challenging information needs due to the complex natural history of HPV and the stigma of sexual transmission. They may ask questions that are outside the remit of the traditional cancer consultation, and there is a lack of guidance on how to counsel them. This study aims to fulfil that need by developing and testing cancer site-specific scripted consultations. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A synthesis of findings generated from previous work, a systematic review of information-based interventions for patients with HPV-related cancers, and interviews with cancer clinicians will provide the evidence base underpinning provisional messages. These will be explored in three phases of face-to-face interviews with 75-90 purposively selected patients recruited in cancer clinics to: (1) select and prioritise the most salient messages, (2) phrase the messages appropriately in plain English and, (3) test their acceptability and usefulness. Phases 1 and 2 will draw on card-sorting methods used in website design. In phase three, we will create cancer site-specific versions of the script and test them using cognitive interviewing techniques. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study has received ethical approval. Findings will be published in a peer-reviewed journal. The final product will be cancer-specific scripted consultations, most likely in the form of a two-sided information sheet with the most important messages to be conveyed in a consultation on one side, and frequently asked questions for later reading on the reverse. However, they will also be appropriate and readily adaptable to web-based uses.
27113237	Clinical validation of hrHPV testing on vaginal and urine self-samples in primary cervical screening (cross-sectional results from the Papillomavirus Dumfries and Galloway-PaVDaG study).	OBJECTIVES: Papillomavirus Dumfries and Galloway (PaVDaG) assessed the performance of a high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV) PCR-based assay to detect high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN2+) in self-collected vaginal and urine samples. SETTING: Women attending routine cervical screening in primary care. PARTICIPANTS: 5318 women aged 20-60 years provided self-collected random urine and vaginal samples for hrHPV testing and a clinician-collected liquid-based cytology (LBC) sample for cytology and hrHPV testing. INTERVENTIONS: HrHPV testing. All samples were tested for hrHPV using the PCR-based cobas 4800 assay. Colposcopy was offered to women with high-grade or repeated borderline/low-grade cytological abnormalities; also to those who were LBC negative but hrHPV 16/18 positive. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The self-tests' absolute sensitivity and specificity for CIN2+ were assessed on all biospecimens; also, their relative sensitivity and specificity compared with clinician-taken samples. Interlaboratory and intralaboratory performance of the hrHPV assay in self-collected samples was also established. RESULTS: HrHPV prevalence was 14.7%, 16.6% and 11.6% in cervical, vaginal and urine samples, respectively. Sensitivity for detecting CIN2+ was 97.7% (95% to 100%), 94.6% (90.7% to 98.5%) and 63.1% (54.6% to 71.7%) for cervical, vaginal and urine hrHPV detection, respectively. The corresponding specificities were 87.3% (86.4% to 88.2%), 85.4% (84.4% to 86.3%) and 89.8% (89.0% to 90.7%). There was a 38% (24% to 57%) higher HPV detection rate in vaginal self-samples from women over 50 years compared with those </=29 years. Relative sensitivity and specificity of hrHPV positivity for the detection of CIN2+ in vaginal versus cervical samples were 0.97 (0.94 to 1.00) and 0.98 (0.97 to 0.99); urine versus cervical comparisons were 0.53 (0.42 to 0.67) and 1.03 (1.02 to 1.04). The intralaboratory and interlaboratory agreement for hrHPV positivity in self-samples was high (kappa values 0.98 (0.96 to 0.99) and 0.94 (0.92 to 0.97) for vaginal samples and 0.95 (0.93 to 0.98) and 0.90 (0.87 to 0.94) for urine samples). CONCLUSIONS: The sensitivity of self-collected vaginal samples for the detection of CIN2+ was similar to that of cervical samples and justifies consideration of this sample for primary screening.
27112648	Aortic Calcification Increases the Risk of Anastomotic Leakage After Ivor-Lewis Esophagectomy.	BACKGROUND: Anastomotic leakage is associated with increased morbidity and mortality after esophagectomy. Calcification of the arteries supplying the gastric tube has been identified as a risk factor for leakage of the cervical anastomosis, but its potential contribution to the risk of intrathoracic anastomotic leakage has not been elucidated. This study evaluated the relationship between calcification and the occurrence of leakage of the intrathoracic anastomosis after Ivor-Lewis esophagectomy. METHODS: Consecutive patients who underwent minimally invasive esophagectomy for cancer at 2 institutions were analyzed. Diagnostic computed tomography images were used to detect calcification of the arteries supplying the gastric tube (eg, aorta, celiac axis). Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to determine the relationship between vascular calcification and anastomotic leakage. RESULTS: Of 167 included patients, anastomotic leakage occurred in 40 (24%). In univariable analysis, leakage was most frequently observed in patients with calcification of the aorta (major calcification: 37% leakage [16 of 43]; minor calcification: 32% [18 of 56]; no calcification: 9% [6 of 70], p < 0.001). Calcification of other studied arteries was not significantly associated with leakage. A significant association with leakage remained for minor (odds ratio, 5.4; 95% confidence interval, 1.7 to 16.5) and major (odds ratio, 7.0; 95% confidence interval, 1.9 to 26.4) aortic calcifications in multivariable analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Atherosclerotic calcification of the aorta is an independent risk factor for leakage of the intrathoracic anastomosis after Ivor-Lewis esophagectomy for cancer. The calcification scoring system may aid in patient selection and lead to earlier diagnosis of this potentially fatal complication.
27112272	Thyroid carcinoma with rhabdoid phenotype: Case report with review of the literature.	OBJECTIVE: This paper aims to comprehensively document a rare case of thyroid carcinoma with rhabdoid phenotype and literature review of this disease. METHODS: A 59-year-old man presented with a rapidly enlarging, painful left lateral cervical mass. CT scan revealed a tumor over the left the thyroid gland with multiple left cervical lymphadenopathy over left level II-IV and level VI. Fine-needle aspiration cytology reported carcinoma, type undetermined. Total thyroidectomy with central compartment and left neck dissection was performed. RESULTS: Pathology report showed rhabdoid phenotype of thyroid carcinoma. Final staging was pT4N1M1. CONCLUSIONS: Although WHO classification of thyroid tumor histology does not define this disease entity, few cases were reported. In the last 20 years, English literature review revealed only 12 cases about thyroid carcinoma with rhabdoid phenotype. Major treatment of thyroid carcinoma with rhabdoid phenotype is surgery, and the benefit of adjuvant therapies as radiotherapy or systemic chemotherapy is not clear. The prognosis of thyroid carcinoma with rhabdoid phenotype is extremely poor, with mean survival of only 6 months.
27112193	Transitioning from cytology-based screening to HPV-based screening at longer intervals: implications for resource use.	BACKGROUND: Following a recent major review of cervical screening, from 2017 Australia will transition from two-yearly cytology-based screening to five-yearly primary HPV screening, with partial genotyping and direct referral for HPV 16/18 and LBC triage for other oncogenic types. Switching to a longer screening interval will result in transitional fluctuations for volumes of tests before a 'steady state' is reached for the new test volumes. This study aimed to quantify the impact of this transition on year-to-year volumes of screening and follow-up tests and procedures. METHODS: Number of women screened and test volumes from 2015 to 2032 were estimated via a detailed simulation model which explicitly modelled varying screening and HPV vaccination exposure in individual birth cohorts, and fully incorporated how a relatively rapid screening program switch in 2017 would affect both women attending for routine screening and those in surveillance following an abnormality. RESULTS: Numbers of women screened and HPV tests are predicted to fluctuate in the first screening rounds as a result of the transition to a longer screening interval (mean women screened and HPV tests 1.4 million in the first 5-year period, year-to-year fluctuation > +/-50%; mean 1.5 million women/HPV tests in third 5-year period, fluctuation approximately +/-25%). The extent to which this fluctuation was predicted to carry through to secondary tests/procedures was less (fluctuations of +25%/-31% in first 5-year period; decreasing to +8%/-10% by third round). HPV vaccination is predicted to counteract increases in high grade cytology results, colposcopies and precancer treatments which would otherwise occur due to population increases. Precancer treatments are predicted to drop below 2015 levels within the first few years of program switchover. Mean colposcopy volumes are predicted to be similar to 2015 levels by the third round of HPV-based screening, and also be 25-40% lower than would have occurred in the absence of HPV vaccination. CONCLUSIONS: While numbers of women attending for screening and HPV tests are anticipated to initially fluctuate as a result of the transition to a longer recommended interval, there is expected to be less fluctuation in follow-up tests and procedures; however these will still have a significant impact on operational aspects of the screening program. Detailed modelling of the switchover process gave important insights into how volumes would be affected.
27108909	[Role of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4G in tumor].	Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4G (eIF4G) is a scaffold component of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4F (eIF4F) complex, which takes principal part in the initiating of protein synthesis. Both two subtypes (eIF4G1 and eIF4G2) of eIF4G were found to be closely related with various tumors. The eIF4G1 expression is significantly up-regulated in breast cancer, cervical cancer, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, lung squamous cell carcinoma, prostatic carcinoma and other malignant tumors, compared with those in adjacent tissues; and the eIF4G2 is obviously over-expressed in diffuse large B cell lymphoma and acute myeloid leukemia, but low-expressed in bladder transitional cell carcinoma. This paper reviews the progress in the study of the role of eIF4G in tumor genesis, development, diagnosis and prognosis.
27108122	Short and long-term urodynamic and quality of life assessment after nerve sparing radical hysterectomy: a prospective pilot study.	OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to compare pre- and postoperative bladder function and quality of life (QoL) in women diagnosed with gynecologic malignancy and treated with nerve sparing radical hysterectomy (NSRH). STUDY DESIGN: Before and after NSRH for uterine malignancy, bladder function was prospectively assessed in a small cohort of 12 women (39-72 years) suffering from uterine malignancy using urodynamic studies and a validated self-administered condition specific QoL questionnaire. Urodynamic studies were performed one day before (U0) as well as one week (U1) and 22 months (U2) after surgery. The questionnaire was applied at U0 and U2. RESULTS: Cystometry showed detrusor contractions leading to overactive bladder incontinence in six out of nine women at short-term, which persisted in three women at long-term follow-up leading to a significant impaired QoL. Voiding function and bladder sensation remained uncompromised after surgery. CONCLUSIONS: NSRH preserves voiding function and bladder sensation. However, short and long-term urodynamic detrusor overactivity and urge incontinence was observed in a significant number of women although symptoms improved over time. These data are important for counselling women and for the design of larger studies to assess the benefits of NSRH versus conventional radical hysterectomy (RH).
27106797	Analysis of Kynurenine/Tryptophan ratio and expression of IDO1 and 2 mRNA in tumour tissue of cervical cancer patients.	OBJECTIVES: Indoleamine 2,3-Dioxygenase (IDO) catalyses the degradation of the essential amino acid tryptophan leading to the production of immunosuppressive Kynurenine. In the present study, we developed a modified method for measurement of Kynurenine/tryptophan (K/T) ratio in the cervical tissue using HPLC and investigated its relationship with the expression of IDO1 and 2 genes in the cervical tumour milieu. DESIGN AND METHODS: Cervical cancer punch biopsy samples of 27 women who presented at the Cancer Institute (WIA) were used for detection of K/T ratio by HPLC as well as expression of IDO1 and 2 at the mRNA level by Realtime PCR after obtaining Institutional ethical committee approval. RESULTS: The K/T ratio was elevated significantly in cancer cervix samples compared to normal cervix (p<0.05). IDO1 mRNA levels were up-regulated whereas IDO2 mRNA levels were down-regulated in cancer cervix compared to the normal cervix. A positive correlation was observed between IDO1 and K/T (p<0.05) indicating that IDO1 was responsible for the increase in K/T ratio. CONCLUSION: Our preliminary data indicates that the K/T ratio at the tissue level may be investigated reliably using HPLC, as an indirect measure of IDO1 gene expression and activity.
27106577	Predictors of biospecimen donation in the Black Women's Health Study.	PURPOSE: Although African-Americans experience higher cancer morbidity and mortality rates compared to their White counterparts, their participation in biospecimen research is lower than that of their white peers. This study investigated the prevalence and predictors of biospecimen donation in a large, cohort study of Black women. METHODS: The BWHS is a follow-up study of U.S. Black women aged 21-69 years enrolled through postal health questionnaires. Between January 2004 and December 2007, participants were sent a consent form with a postage-paid return envelope, and a mouthwash collection kit. Univariate and age- and educational status-adjusted logistic regression models were used to estimate the association of socio-demographic, lifestyle and medical factors with donation of biospecimens. RESULTS: Buccal cells with consent forms were obtained from 26,790 women, for a response rate of 51 %. The strongest predictors of biospecimen donation were age: response increased from 48.6 % among those aged <40 to 63.1 % among those aged 60 and older [RR 1.30 (95 % CI 1.27, 1.34)]; multivitamin use [RR (95 % CI) 1.32 (1.30, 1.34)]; physician visit in the previous 2 years [RR (95 % CI) 1.61 (1.58, 1.65)], and a history of breast [RR (95 % CI) 1.59 (1.56, 1.63)], colon [RR (95 % CI) 1.18 (1.16, 1.20)], and cervical [RR (95 % CI) 1.63 (1.60, 1.67)] cancer screening. CONCLUSIONS: We found that 51 % of women in the geographically-dispersed Black Women's Health Study cohort were willing to provide mouthwash samples to be used for genetic analyses. The response in this study is encouraging given published findings of low overall participation rates of African-Americans in genetic studies.
27106576	Breast and cervical cancer screening among Asian subgroups in the USA: estimates from the National Health Interview Survey, 2008, 2010, and 2013.	PURPOSE: This study describes variations in mammography and Pap test use across and within subgroups of Asian women in the USA. METHODS: Using data from the National Health Interview Survey (2008, 2010, and 2013), we calculated weighted proportions for selected Asian subgroups (Asian Indian, Chinese, Filipino, Other Asian) of women reporting mammography and Pap test use. RESULTS: The proportion of women aged 50-74 years who reported a mammogram within the past 2 years did not differ significantly across Asian subgroups. The proportion of women aged 21-65 years who received a Pap test within the past 3 years differed significantly across Asian subgroups, with lower proportions among Asian Indian, Chinese, and Other Asian women. Recent immigrants, those without a usual source of care, and women with public or no health insurance had lower proportions of breast and cervical cancer screening test use. CONCLUSIONS: Patterns of mammography and Pap test use vary among subgroups of Asian women, by length of residency in the USA, insurance status, usual source of care, and type of cancer screening test. These findings highlight certain Asian subgroups continue to face significant barriers to cancer screening test use.
27106209	Radiotherapy with concurrent temozolomide for the management of extraneural metastases in pituitary carcinoma.	BACKGROUND: Pituitary carcinomas (PC) are uncommon neuroendocrine tumors, accounting for 0.1 % of all pituitary tumors. The diagnosis of PC is based on the presence of metastases from a pituitary adenoma, and not by local invasion or pathological features alone. PC is typically resistant to therapy, with a median overall survival of only 31 months. There is no standard treatment for PC, but maximal safe resection and radiation are performed when possible. Encouraging preliminary data on the use of temozolomide (TMZ)-based therapy has been previously reported. METHODS: We report the response to therapy and safety of radiation with concurrent temozolomide (RT/TMZ) in 2 adult patients with heavily pretreated PC and extraneural metastases. RESULTS: Both patients had prior history of pituitary macroadenoma. At the time of diagnosis of PC, Ki-67 % was 24.2 and 10 %, with positive p53 staining in one case. Metastatic sites included lymph nodes, liver and bone. Case-1 received RT/TMZ to the tumor bed in the skull base and to the metastases in the cervical lymph nodes. Case-2 received RT/TMZ to recurrent tumor involving portacaval lymph nodes. Both patients achieved excellent long-term control of the sites of treated extraneural metastases, with no significant acute or delayed toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: RT/TMZ was safely delivered and might provide sustained control of extraneural metastases in PC. Although this retrospective report has limitations, RT/TMZ can be considered as a therapeutic option for the management of extraneural metastases in PC.
27105330	Impact of Physical Inactivity on Risk of Developing Cancer of the Uterine Cervix: A Case-Control Study.	OBJECTIVE: In this study, we investigated whether physical inactivity was associated with risk of cervical cancer in women treated at an American cancer hospital. METHODS: This case-control study included 128 patients with cervical cancer and 512 controls matched on age. Controls were women suspected of having but not ultimately diagnosed with a neoplasm. Physical inactivity was defined in accordance with the 2008 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans. Thus, participants reporting, on average, no moderate or vigorous recreational physical activity were classified as inactive. Unconditional logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: Compared with noncancer controls, those with cervical cancer had significantly increased odds of reporting abstinence from recreational physical activity (OR, 2.43; 95% CI, 1.56-3.80). No association was noted between occupational-related physical inactivity and cervical cancer (OR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.58-1.36). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that abstinence from regular recreational physical activity is associated with increased odds of cervical cancer. To our knowledge, this is the first US-based study examining these associations. Given the 2008 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans, this study has identified yet another potential public health benefit to regular physical activity. Further investigation is needed using a larger sample and prospectively collected data to characterize dose of activity to mitigate risk and the optimal window of susceptibility.
27103033	Stochastic epigenetic outliers can define field defects in cancer.	BACKGROUND: There is growing evidence that DNA methylation alterations may contribute to carcinogenesis. Recent data also suggest that DNA methylation field defects in normal pre-neoplastic tissue represent infrequent stochastic "outlier" events. This presents a statistical challenge for standard feature selection algorithms, which assume frequent alterations in a disease phenotype. Although differential variability has emerged as a novel feature selection paradigm for the discovery of outliers, a growing concern is that these could result from technical confounders, in principle thus favouring algorithms which are robust to outliers. RESULTS: Here we evaluate five differential variability algorithms in over 700 DNA methylomes, including two of the largest cohorts profiling precursor cancer lesions, and demonstrate that most of the novel proposed algorithms lack the sensitivity to detect epigenetic field defects at genome-wide significance. In contrast, algorithms which recognise heterogeneous outlier DNA methylation patterns are able to identify many sites in pre-neoplastic lesions, which display progression in invasive cancer. Thus, we show that many DNA methylation outliers are not technical artefacts, but define epigenetic field defects which are selected for during cancer progression. CONCLUSIONS: Given that cancer studies aiming to find epigenetic field defects are likely to be limited by sample size, adopting the novel feature selection paradigm advocated here will be critical to increase assay sensitivity.
27102923	Correlation of Lymph Node Density With Negative Outcome Predictors in Oral and Maxillofacial Squamous Cell Carcinoma.	PURPOSE: Lymph node density is defined as the number of positive lymph nodes per total number of excised lymph nodes. In oral and maxillofacial cancer, there are recent data showing that increased lymph node density leads to worse outcomes for patients. However, data correlating lymph node density with other known risk parameters are lacking. This study investigated whether a direct correlation exists among cervical lymph node density, depth of invasion, perineural invasion, and extracapsular tumor spread. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective chart review was undertaken to include all patients who underwent neck dissection with resection of primary oral and maxillofacial squamous cell carcinoma from January 2009 through July 2014. After applying the exclusion criteria, 286 patients were identified. Primary tumor depth of invasion, perineural invasion, and lymph node status, including extracapsular spread, were obtained from the standard pathology report. Descriptive statistics were applied. The association between 2 continuous tumor characteristics was summarized with the Pearson correlation coefficient, and the association between a continuous and a binary tumor characteristic was summarized with 2-sample t test. Statistical significance for the study was set at a P value less than .05. RESULTS: Mean age at time of surgery was 63.9 +/- 12.5 years. The final study included 169 men and 117 women (N = 286). The mean depth of invasion was 12.3 +/- 11 mm (range, 1 to 69 mm). Mean lymph node density was 0.04 +/- 0.1 (range, 0 to 0.81). There was a positive association between lymph node density and depth of tumor invasion (Pearson correlation coefficient, r = 0.21; P < .001). Tumors with perineural invasion had a statistically significant difference in mean lymph node density (0.074 for positive vs 0.024 for negative; P < .001). There also was a significant association in mean lymph node density with the presence of extracapsular spread (0.143 for positive and 0.010 for negative; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Statistically relevant positive linear relations among lymph node density, depth of invasion, perineural invasion, and extracapsular spread were identified. Lymph node density could have prognostic implications, because it is statistically correlated with other known prognostic features that lead to poor outcomes. Lymph node density could be an important feature to capture in future prospective trials. Pathology standards would be crucial in this endeavor.
27102372	Enhanced uptake and transport of PLGA-modified nanoparticles in cervical cancer.	BACKGROUND: Uncoordinated cellular proliferation and dysregulated angiogenesis in solid tumors are coupled with inadequate tissue, blood, and lymphatic vascularization. Consequently, tumors are often characterized by hypoxic regions with limited access to vascular-borne substances. In particular, systemically administered nanoparticles (NPs) targeting tumor cells and relying on vascular access to reach tumor tissue can suffer from limited therapeutic efficacy due to inhomogeneous intra-tumor distribution and insufficient cellular internalization of NPs. To circumvent these challenges, NP surfaces can be modified to facilitate tumor interstitial transport and cellular uptake. RESULTS: We create poly(lactic-co-glycolic) acid NPs modified with MPG, polyethylene glycol (PEG), MPG/PEG, and Vimentin (VIM), and evaluate their cellular uptake in 2D (monolayer) cell culture of human cervical carcinoma (HeLa). We compare NP performance by evaluating uptake by non-cancerous vaginal (VK2) cells. We further assess NP interstitial transport in hypo-vascularized lesions by evaluating the effect of the various modifications on NP penetration in 3D cell culture of the HeLa cells. Results show that after 24 h incubation with HeLa cells in monolayer, MPG, MPG/PEG, PEG, and VIM NPs were internalized at 66x, 24x, 30x, and 15x that of unmodified NPs, respectively. In contrast, incubation with VK2 cells in monolayer showed that MPG , MPG/PEG , PEG , and VIM NPs internalized at 6.3x, 4.3x, 12.4x, and 3.0x that of unmodified NPs, respectively. Uptake was significantly enhanced in tumorigenic vs. normal cells, with internalization of MPG NPs by HeLa cells being twice that of PEG NPs by VK2 cells. After 24 h incubation in HeLa 3D cell culture, MPG and MPG/PEGNPs were internalized 2x and 3x compared to PEG and VIM NPs, respectively. Whereas MPG NPs were internalized mostly in the cell culture periphery (1.2x, 1.4x, and 2.7x that of PEG, MPG/PEG, and VIM NPs, respectively), PEG NPs at 250 mum penetrated 2x farther into the tissue culture than MPG NPs. For all NP types, cellular internalization was severely hindered in 3D compared to monolayer. CONCLUSIONS: Although MPG surface modification enhances internalization and uptake in hypo-vascularized cervical tissue culture, coating with PEG reduces this internalization while enhancing penetration. A delivery strategy combining NPs with either modification may balance cellular internalization vs. tissue penetration in hypo-vascularized cervical cancer lesions.
27102250	Incidence of metastasis in circumflex iliac nodes distal to the external iliac nodes in cervical cancer.	OBJECTIVE: A causal relationship between removal of circumflex iliac nodes distal to the external iliac nodes (CINDEIN) and lower leg edema has been recently suggested. The aim of this study was to elucidate the incidence of CINDEIN metastasis in cervical cancer. METHODS: A retrospective chart review was carried out for 531 patients with cervical cancer who underwent lymph node dissection between 1993 and 2014. CINDEIN metastasis was pathologically identified by microscopic investigation. After 2007, sentinel lymph node biopsy was performed selectively in patients with non-bulky cervical cancer. The sentinel node was identified using (99m)Tc-phytate and by scanning the pelvic cavity with a gamma probe. RESULTS: Two hundred and ninety-seven patients (55.9%) underwent CINDEIN dissection and 234 (44.1%) did not. The percentage of International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage IIb to IV (42.4% vs. 23.5%, p<0.001) was significantly higher in patients who underwent CINDEIN dissection than those who did not. CINDEIN metastasis was identified in 1.9% overall and in 3.4% of patients who underwent CINDEIN dissection. For patients with stage Ia to IIa disease, CINDEIN metastasis was identified in 0.6% overall and in 1.2% of patients who underwent CINDEIN dissection. Of 115 patients with sentinel node mapping, only one (0.9%) had CINDEIN detected as a sentinel node. In this case, the other three lymph nodes were concurrently detected as sentinel lymph nodes. CONCLUSION: CINDEIN dissection can be eliminated in patients with stage Ia to IIa disease. CINDEIN might not be regional lymph nodes in cervical cancer.
27102248	Extrafascial hysterectomy after concurrent chemoradiotherapy in locally advanced cervical adenocarcinoma.	OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether adjuvant simple hysterectomy after concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) improves progression-free survival (PFS) compared with current standard care in locally advanced cervical adenocarcinoma (LACAC). METHODS: We reviewed a cohort of 55 patients with LACAC (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics [FIGO] stage IB2, IIA2, IIB, III without distant metastasis) diagnosed and treated with radical CCRT at Peking Union Medical College Hospital between January 2004 and October 2014. We compared 34 patients who underwent adjuvant extrafascial hysterectomy with 21 patients with standard care after CCRT. The primary outcome was PFS. Overall survivals (OS) between the two groups were also compared. Surgery feasibility, operative complications, and pathologic features after radiation therapy were also analyzed. RESULTS: PFS was significantly improved in surgery group (log-rank p=0.0097; hazard ratio [HR], 0.3431; 95% CI, 0.152 to 0.772), as were OS (log-rank p=0.0419; HR, 0.3667; 95% CI, 0.139 to 0.964). Analysis of stage IIB demonstrates a similar result. There were no severe complications related to postradiation surgery in this series. The mean blood loss was less in laparoscopic group than those in the open group (87 mL vs. 208 mL, p=0.036, Mann-Whitney U-test). Approximately 47% patients (16/34) had pathologic residue tumor on hysterectomy specimens. About 94% patients (32/34) got complete remission after adjuvant surgery. CONCLUSION: Adjuvant hysterectomy after CCRT improves survival outcome for patients with LACAC compared with current standard care. Extrafascial hysterectomy is sufficient in tumor reduction and laparoscopic procedure may be more promising with lower blood loss and expedite recovery.
27101524	Predictive Value of Standardized Intratumoral Metabolic Heterogeneity in Locally Advanced Cervical Cancer Treated With Chemoradiation.	OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to propose and evaluate a novel image metric for quantifying spatial heterogeneity of tumor F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake within the context of predicting response to chemoradiation in locally advanced cervical cancer. METHODS: Ninety patients with locally advanced cervical cancer treated with concomitant chemoradiation were included in this study. Each patient underwent two whole-body F-FDG positron emission tomography/computed tomography scans with one before the initiation of treatment for staging and the other at 12 weeks after treatment completion for response assessment. Patients were categorized in terms of response to chemoradiation into two major groups: complete metabolic responders and noncomplete metabolic responders. The capacity of the proposed intratumoral heterogeneity metric to differentiate patients with respect to response to therapy was evaluated and compared with the use of standardized uptake value indices and various texture parameters that had been previously introduced for predicting tumor response to chemoradiation. RESULTS: At baseline, the proposed intratumoral heterogeneity metric along with four texture features, including entropy and energy derived from gray-level co-occurrence matrices and gray-level nonuniformity and zone size nonuniformity from gray-level zone size matrices, was capable of differentiating responders' groups with P values of 0.0026, 0.0252, 0.0240, 0.0234, and 0.0188, respectively. Furthermore, when compared with the texture features exhibiting significant difference between the responders' groups, the proposed metric demonstrated larger area under receiver operating characteristic curve. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed metric with quantifying spatial heterogeneity of intratumoral FDG accumulation in a normalized manner may be associated with predictive value of poor response to concurrent chemoradiation in locally advanced cervical cancer.
27100836	Associations between prior HPV4 vaccine doses and cervical cancer screening participation.	BACKGROUND: Cervical cancer screening, regardless of HPV vaccination, is a cornerstone of cancer prevention. This study evaluated associations between prior HPV vaccine doses and initiation and continued participation of screening by age at vaccination. METHODS: Using electronic medical records for a safety net healthcare system (Truman Medical Center), women aged 14-26y vaccinated (n=1123) between 07/01/2006 and 10/1/2009 were randomly selected and matched on birth year and health campus to unvaccinated (n=1123) women. Frequency of screening was determined through 07/01/2013. Hazard ratios (HR) for screening were estimated using Cox proportional hazards regression. RESULTS: Screening rates were higher after vaccination: unvaccinated (53%), first (62%), second (59%) or third (61%) doses. Women who initiated screening were less likely to complete the vaccine series, regardless of age. Women receiving one dose were more likely than unvaccinated women to initiate screening (HR=2.98 95% Confidence Interval (CI):2.45-3.61) and were more likely to screen than those receiving two (1 vs. 2, HR=2.94 95% CI:2.09-4.14) or three doses (1 vs. 3, HR=3.15 95% CI:2.21-4.48). Compared to unvaccinated women, women <21y who completed 3-doses were 1.8-times more likely to screen at >/=21y, whereas vaccinated women >/=21y were more likely to screen regardless of number of doses (p<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Women who were vaccinated were more likely to screen than unvaccinated women; screening rate was highest after and occurred closest to the first vaccine dose. Research evaluating the efficacy of a one-dose vaccine is warranted and may provide both higher vaccination and screening rates.
27099069	Parthenolide induces apoptosis and autophagy through the suppression of PI3K/Akt signaling pathway in cervical cancer.	OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of parthenolide on apoptosis and autophagy and to study the role of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway in cervical cancer. RESULTS: Parthenolide inhibits HeLa cell viability in a dose dependent-manner and was confirmed by MTT assay. Parthenolide (6 microM) induces mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis and autophagy by activation of caspase-3, upregulation of Bax, Beclin-1, ATG5, ATG3 and down-regulation of Bcl-2 and mTOR. Parthenolide also inhibits PI3K and Akt expression through activation of PTEN expression. Moreover, parthenolide induces generation of reactive oxygen species that leads to the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential. CONCLUSION: Parthenolide induces apoptosis and autophagy-mediated growth inhibition in HeLa cells by suppressing the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway and mitochondrial membrane depolarization and ROS generation. Parthenolide may be a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of cervical cancer.
27098644	CpG methylation in human papillomavirus (HPV) type 31 long control region (LCR) in cervical infections associated with cytological abnormalities.	The mechanisms that regulate papillomavirus gene expression include DNA methylation. The transcription of papillomavirus oncogenes E6 and E7 is controlled by certain regulatory elements in the LCR, which include binding sites for the E2 protein, a viral regulator of oncogene expression. In HPV-31-infected exfoliated cervical cells, the CpG methylation of the entire LCR was determined by next-generation sequencing after bisulfite modification. Six of the 22 cases had methylated CpG sites in the HPV-31 LCR, including position 7479 and/or 7485, at the promoter distal E2 binding site, thus suggesting a potential regulatory mechanism for papillomavirus transcription.
27098591	Neuroendocrine Carcinoma of the Cervix: Review of a Series of Cases and Correlation With Outcome.	Introduction Neuroendocrine carcinoma (NEC) of the cervix is associated with a poor prognosis despite multimodal treatment. The correct diagnosis of this tumor type is imperative to provide clinicians and patients with prognostic information and ensure that appropriate treatment is provided. Methods A clinicopathological study was undertaken on all cervical tumors registered as NEC with the West Midlands Cancer Intelligence Unit between January 1, 1998 and December 31, 2009. Of the 45 cases diagnosed during the study period, the tumor samples of 41 cases were traced, anonymized, and then independently reviewed by 2 gynecological pathologists. Results The review confirmed 31/41 (78%) cases to be NEC, which overall, represented 1.3% of all the cervical cancers registered in the West Midlands over the period of the study. In the correct histological context, synaptophysin was the most sensitive and specific positive immunohistochemical marker of NEC differentiation. The cases that on review were confirmed as NEC had a significantly worse outcome than the non-NEC cases: median survival for NEC cases was 33.3 months versus 315.0 months for the non-NEC cases, P = .013. Conclusions Histological review of a series of NECs has shown significantly reduced survival in those patients with confirmed NEC in comparison with those patients where a diagnosis of NEC was not confirmed. We propose morphological and immunohistochemical criteria for the diagnosis of cervical NEC; and discourage unqualified use of the term "small cell carcinoma" as this does not accurately convey the diagnosis of SCNEC. We urge pathologists to use the 2014 World Health Organization classification when reporting these tumors.
27098274	MicroRNA and gynecologic cancers.	AIM: Gynecologic malignancies are serious problems in female health. Here we aim to discuss the involvement of microRNA (miRNA) in the pathogenesis of gynecologic cancers and use of miRNA profiles for diagnosis of diseases. METHODS: In order to obtain information needed for this review, we searched the PubMed database with the following keywords: miRNA and ovarian cancer; miRNA and cervical cancer; and miRNA and endometrial cancer. RESULTS: Recent explosive investigations in the field have dramatically expanded our knowledge of the roles of miRNA in the pathology of gynecologic malignancies. In ovarian cancer, miRNA participates in the development of drug resistance. In cervical cancer and endometrial cancer, miRNA play essential roles in important oncogenic processes, including cell proliferation, migration and metastasis. miRNA also have high potentials to be used as biomarkers in these diseases. CONCLUSION: Further validation of the studies and improvement of the methods will result in the broader use of miRNA in the diagnosis of diseases as well as in understanding of the pathomechanisms of gynecologic cancers.
27097911	Variants of EVER1 and EVER2 (TMC6 and TMC8) and human papillomavirus status in patients with mucosal squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.	PURPOSE: There is a growing association of human papillomavirus (HPV) with some cases of mucosal squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (HNSCC), particularly of the oropharynx. Persistent oral HPV infection is believed to increase the likelihood of malignancy, and it is possible that host genetic factors can determine susceptibility to persistent HPV infection. Polymorphisms in the two EV genes (EVER1 and EVER2, also known as transmembrane channel protein (TMC) 6 and 8) have been identified as strong candidate genes, since a small number of critical mutations in these genes have been shown to cause profound and florid skin HPV infections, and some of them have been linked to susceptibility to cervical cancer. METHODS: We sought to determine whether there was a difference in the frequency of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in EVER1 (rs2613516, rs12449858) and EVER2 (rs7205422, rs12452890) between HNSCC patients with HPV-positive and HPV-negative tumors, and healthy controls. We used logistic regression to analyze SNPs in 219 patients with histologically confirmed primary SCC of the oropharynx, oral cavity, hypopharynx, or larynx, and 321 healthy controls. RESULTS: We did not find any associations with the EVER1/EVER2 SNPs and HPV status or being a HNSCC case or a control. CONCLUSIONS: The present data do not provide evidence for a role of genetic variations in EVER1 or EVER2 for HPV status of mucosal HNSCC or between HNSCC patients and controls.
27097702	Concurrent Cisplatin-Based Chemoradiation in Squamous Cell Carcinoma of Cervix.	OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of cisplatin-based concurrent chemoradiation in squamous cell carcinoma of cervix and the frequency of acute toxicity. STUDY DESIGN: Case series. PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY: Department of Clinical Oncology, Karachi Institute of Radiotherapy and Nuclear Medicine (KIRAN), Karachi, from September 2010 to September 2011. METHODOLOGY: Eighty patients with histologically proven squamous cell carcinoma of cervix were included. Patients were treated with concurrent chemoradiation. External beam radiation was delivered with 50 Gy whole pelvis along with 40 mg/m2 weekly cisplatin followed by brachytherapy three insertions of 6.5 Gy each, one week apart. Response to treatment was assessed using response evaluation criteria in solid tumours (RECIST) criteria at 4 weeks after treatment. Acute toxicity of chemoradiation was assessed using common toxicity criteria. RESULTS: Out of the 80 patients, 8 patients were lost to follow-up. Remaining 72 patients aged 28 - 65 years with mean age of 48.03 &amp;plusmn;8.9 years. Forty-eight patients (66%) were in stage II-B, 5 (7%) were in stage III-A, 7 (10%) were in stage III-B, and 12 (17%) were in stage IV-A. Overall response to treatment was 92%, in which 39 (54%) had complete response, and 27 (38%) had partial response while 6 (8%) show progressive disease. About 70% patients had diarrhea, 61.2% patients developed vomiting, 45.8% patients had dermatitis, 43% patients had vaginal mucositis, 40.3% had anemia, 13.9% patients had neutropenia, 27.8% patients had dysuria, and 22.2% patients had proctitis. CONCLUSION: Cisplatin-based concurrent chemoradiation is an effective treatment in locally advanced stage of cervical cancer with manageable toxicity.
27097242	Penile Analogue of Stratified Mucin-Producing Intraepithelial Lesion of the Cervix: The First Described Case. A Diagnostic Pitfall.	The authors report a case where undifferentiated (classic) penile intraepithelial neoplasia was associated with the presence of goblet cells throughout the full epithelial thickness and which later progressed into an invasive carcinoma. The lesion evolved in three consecutive biopsies from only surface epithelium occupying numerous goblet cells in the first to variably sized solid nodules in the dermis composed of atypical squamous and/or basaloid cells intermixed with numerous goblet cells in the third biopsy. Both cellular components expressed CK7 and p16 protein. Human Papillomavirus (HPV) genotyping revealed high risk HPV type 16. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first description of such a lesion occurring on the penis, which can be considered the penile analogue of cervical stratified mucin-producing intraepithelial lesion (SMILE). The correct diagnosis was rendered retrospectively, after recognition of the existence of a vulvar lesion resembling cervical SMILE. The initial biopsy was misinterpreted as extramammary Paget disease, which also constitutes the main pitfall in the differential diagnosis. Another important differential diagnosis is penile/vulvar mucinous metaplasia. The finding of atypical squamous epithelial cells positive for p16 associated with mucinous cells present throughout the full epithelial thickness is a clue to the diagnosis of penile SMILE.
27096255	Is cervical screening preventing adenocarcinoma and adenosquamous carcinoma of the cervix?	While the incidence of squamous carcinoma of the cervix has declined in countries with organised screening, adenocarcinoma has become more common. Cervical screening by cytology often fails to prevent adenocarcinoma. Using prospectively recorded cervical screening data in England and Wales, we conducted a population-based case-control study to examine whether cervical screening leads to early diagnosis and down-staging of adenocarcinoma. Conditional logistic regression modelling was carried out to provide odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) on 12,418 women with cervical cancer diagnosed between ages 30 and 69 and 24,453 age-matched controls. Of women with adenocarcinoma of the cervix, 44.3% were up to date with screening and 14.6% were non-attenders. The overall OR comparing women up to date with screening with non-attenders was 0.46 (95% CI: 0.39-0.55) for adenocarcinoma. The odds were significantly decreased (OR: 0.22, 95% CI: 0.15-0.33) in up to date women with Stage 2 or worse adenocarcinoma, but not for women with Stage1A adenocarcinoma 0.71 (95% CI: 0.46-1.09). The odds of Stage 1A adenocarcinoma was double among lapsed attenders (OR: 2.35, 95% CI: 1.52-3.62) compared to non-attenders. Relative to women with no negative cytology within 7 years of diagnosis, women with Stage1A adenocarcinoma were very unlikely to be detected within 3 years of a negative cytology test (OR: 0.08, 95% CI: 0.05-0.13); however, the odds doubled 3-5 years after a negative test (OR: 2.30, 95% CI: 1.67-3.18). ORs associated with up to date screening were smaller for squamous and adenosquamous cervical carcinoma. Although cytology screening is inefficient at preventing adenocarcinomas, invasive adenocarcinomas are detected earlier than they would be in the absence of screening, substantially preventing Stage 2 and worse adenocarcinomas.
27095720	[Clinical analysis of lymphocytic thyroiditis coexistent with papillary thyroid carcinoma].	OBJECTIVE: To analyse the clinical features and treatment strategies of papillary thyroid carcinoma(PTC) coexistent with lymphocytic thyroiditis (LT). METHODS: A total of 292 patients including 25 males and 267 females with LT and thyroid nodules treated in the department of head and neck surgery between Sep 2011 and Sep 2014 was analysed retrospectively and divided into two groups according to pathological results, of them 262 patients, with a median age of 47 years old, were LT with PTC and 30 patients, with a median age of 54 years old, were LT with benign nodules. Among 262 patients having LT with PTC, 259 were diagnosed as having malignant or suspicious malignant nodules and 3 having benign nodules with ultrasound before surgery, 98 cases were considered multifocal malignant nodules by preoperative ultrasound, and 112 cases were positive in cervical lymph nodes, including bilateral positive in 37 cases. Of 30 patients having LT with benign nodules, 14 were diagnosed malignant or suspicious malignant nodules and 16 benign nodules. RESULTS: The mean age in 262 patients with PTC was less significantly than that in 30 patients with benign nodules (P<0.05). Ultrasound showed a high proportion of calcification and microcalcification in patients with PTC (34%) compared to patients with benign nodules(13%)(P<0.05). There were not significant differences in the mean levels of serum thyroid stimulating hormone(TSH) (2.80 vs 2.99 mU/L, P=0.233), thyroglobulin(TG) (27.14 vs 18.60 mug/L, P=0.747), and anti-thyroglobulin antibodies(ATG)(417.3 vs 378.7 U/ml, P=0.834) between patients with PTC and those with benign nodules. In patients with PTC, multifocal tumor accounted for 42%. The central and lateral lymph node metastasis rates were respectively 50% and 24%, and the occult metastasis rate of lateral neck lymph node was 16%. Univariate analysis showed that age less than 45 years old, multifocal tumor, tumor diameter more than or equal to 2cm and extrathyroidal extension were associated with central lymph node metastasis (P<0.05), but not with lateral neck metastasis. Multivariate analysis showed a closed correlation only between the lymph node metastases in central and lateral neck levels (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Calcification and microcalcification have the same importance in the ultrasonic diagnosis for PTC in patients with LT. Total thyroidectomy and prophylactic central lymph node should be a choice for LT with PTC. Lymph node metastasis in level indicates the possibility of lateral cervical lymph node metastasis in the patients having LT with PTC.
